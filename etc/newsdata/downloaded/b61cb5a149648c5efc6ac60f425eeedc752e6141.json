(The National/CBC Archives)\n\nAlfred Bechard, a Saskatchewan farmer, explained how the snow could affect the price of the wheat.\n\n\"We'll probably lose a little bit of grade by bleaching the grain and then with the high moisture on the grain, you will probably maybe see a little bit of bran frost and so naturally, the buyers want to dock you a little bit,\" he told CBC News.\n\nA freak snowstorm left parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan covered in snow on Oct. 1, 1996. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nThe same snowstorm, which had arrived overnight, had hit parts of southern Alberta, as well.\n\nThe National showed footage of kids throwing snowballs and making snowmen.\n\nThere were also plenty of shots of less delighted people shovelling their walks and porches in Calgary, where residents seemed to accept their fate.\n\nThe snowfall made Calgary look like it was living through the middle of winter, even though the calendar would confirm the date was Oct. 1, 1996. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\n\"For the City of Calgary, it's the biggest snowfall on this day in 80 years,\" said Crowe.\n\n\"But people here like to say: 'If you don't like the weather, wait a minute,\" she added, noting that the forecast was calling for 20 C weather by the end of that week.", "description": "Who wouldn't want to see 15 centimetres of snow fall on the first of October?", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277336.1568121113!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/car-in-snow-covered-ditch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
