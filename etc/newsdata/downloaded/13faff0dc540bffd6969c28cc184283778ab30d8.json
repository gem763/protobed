The strike took place ahead of the UN's Climate Action Summit (or \"Climate Week\"), where 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg delivered a moving speech on Monday to world leaders.\n\nIn short, one needn't look far for a sense of what issues matter to the next generation.\n\nNike is one company that has wised up to this fact. Last week, the brand unveiled its \"Move to Zero\" campaign, which was pegged specifically to Climate Week and revolved around the idea that \"if there is no planet, there is no sport.\"\n\nThe campaign launch saw Nike's New York headquarters decked out with installations covered in information about how climate change is making athletics more difficult by doing things like shortening the snowboarding season. To promote the launch, Nike invited celebrity athletes to speak to members of the press about their own experiences playing sports on a warming planet.\n\nThe name \"Move to Zero\" is meant to refer to Nike's \"journey towards zero carbon and zero waste,\" but anyone hoping to hear that these are concrete targets that Nike has formulated a game plan and timeline for achieving would be disappointed by the presentations.\n\n\"It's not really intended to be a target per se,\" Nike's Chief Sustainability Officer Noel Kinder explained to Fashionista. \"It's the vision that we want to throw out there like, 'Hey, look, if we have this crazy dream and march toward it, then we can achieve it together.'\"\n\nReading between the lines: It's a marketing campaign that repackages old commitments without offering new ones.\n\nWhether or not they were a focus of the presentations, there were some concrete numbers shared around waste in a press release: it claimed that Nike \"diverts 99% of all footwear manufacturing waste from landfills,\" and has given one billion plastic bottles per year new life as yarns that become sports jerseys and Flyknit shoes. Kinder also shared with Fashionista that the brand intends to \"reduce our water consumption in our entire supply chain by 20% per unit by 2020.\"\n\nPerhaps more pertinent in the context of Climate Week, the release noted that the brand hopes to reduce carbon emissions across its global supply chain by 30% by 2030. That's not zero, but it's something. Still, Kinder admitted that Nike may not actually hit that mark.\n\n\"The mix of energy consumption and supply chain is proving to be a challenge,\" he said. \"You set those targets out there knowing that hopefully they're gonna be achievable but what we would call 'a stretch goal.'\"\n\nWhen asked to expound on how Nike is focusing on reducing its footprint, Kinder talked mostly about switching to green energy in the brand's owned and operated facilities. A good move, but one that seems like a drop in the bucket when you consider that, as a Nike spokesperson confirmed via email, the supply chain \u2014 which Nike does not own or operate \u2014 makes up 90% of the brand's footprint.\n\nAn examination of Nike's Impact Report for the 2018 fiscal year revealed more of the specifics of how the brand is looking to reduce emissions in its supply chain, from making boiler systems in footwear factories more efficient to joining apparel factories in China in their efforts to procure solar panels.\n\nBut when it comes to the emissions impacts of raw materials, Kinder claimed, the brand can't do much without \"industry commitment.\"\n\n\"There's no brand leverage in that space anymore if you're talking about cotton or you're talking about spinning of yarn,\" he said. \"They're not purchased by a brand for a product, they're kind of purchased on behalf of an industry or multiple layers of indirectly.\"", "description": "Last week, 250,000 New Yorkers \u2014 many of them teens \u2014 flooded the streets of Manhattan to participate in the youth-led Global Climate Strike, fashion darlings like Jaden and Willow Smith among them.
