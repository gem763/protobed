a soft way off adding \u2018pieces\u2019 as oppose to highlights.'\n\nHe continued: 'By adding soft pieces of colour it can also help the hair look thicker as it creates more dimension within the hairstyle making it appearing more 3D.'\n\nIt was only last month that Kate debuted a new bouncier, shorter blow-dried style while taking Princess Charlotte to school for the first time.\n\nAt the time, James said Kate had transitioned from a more 'polished' summer look, to a more practical style with a '90s on-trend flick', and suggested that Kate appeared to be taking a leaf out of Meghan's more 'relaxed' look book.\n\nThe celebrity stylist suggested the look was a 'much more stylish' look for the Duchess, and was 'perfect for keeping summer vibes lasting longer'\n\nThe 'working mum look' for Charlotte's first day at school: Last month, James revealed how Kate's hair has transitioned from a more 'polished' summer look, to a more practical style with a '90s on-trend flick'\n\nBut today the stylist suggested the Duchess had upgraded her look since then, explaining: 'It\u2019s a much warmer style, more stylish and suited for the cold seasons.'\n\nHe added that the look was 'perfect for keeping summer vibes lasting longer.'\n\nToday Kate visited the Angela Marmont Centre (AMC), a unique scientific hub located in the Natural History Museum that is dedicated to the study of the UK\u2019s natural world.\n\nIt helps public visitors identify their finds, provides vital training in wildlife identification, and leads research and citizen science projects that are helping to transform our understanding of over 80,000 species of wildlife known to exist in the UK today.\n\nWith populations of many UK species declining, and a significant proportion threatened with local extinction, it brings together a host of individuals and organisations all dedicated to building understanding of the UK\u2019s wildlife, so that it can be better protected for future generations.\n\nThe dedicated staff work with colleagues from across the Natural History Museum to carry out a range of scientific research.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the summer he told how Kate's hair has transitioned from a more 'polished' summer look, seen visiting The Back To Nature Garden at Hampton Court Palace in July wearing longer straight locks\n\nIn August Kate was seen wearing a more preened style as she attended The Kings Cup Sailing Race -
