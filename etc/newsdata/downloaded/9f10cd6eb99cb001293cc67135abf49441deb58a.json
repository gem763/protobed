Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer who works in the National Security Council, is testifying about his concerns with President Trump\u2019s summer call with Ukraine, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are coming to defend his character.\n\nLt. Col. Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, was cast as a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d by the president before his testimony began Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u201cconcerned\u201d today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nOver on the cable news shows, two Trump defenders \u2014 former Rep. Sean Duffy and former Bush administration official John Yoo \u2014 called into question Lt. Col. Vindman\u2019s loyalty to America, suggesting he might be overly invested in Ukrainian interests.\n\nRepublican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican, strongly condemned those types of comments and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to question Lt. Col. Vindman\u2019s character.\n\n\u201cWe need to show that we are better than that as a nation. We\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who\u2019ve put their lives on the line,\u201d the Wyoming Republican said.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy praised Lt. Col. Vindman\u2019s military sacrifice, but stressed that the public transcript of President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky shows nothing was amiss.\n\n\u201cI thank him for his service,\u201d the California Republican said. \u201cBut he is wrong on this.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said the criticisms show that Republicans are pinned in a corner and running out of ways to defend the president.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got is to question the patriotism of a lieutenant colonel, who took a bullet for us and had a Purple Heart on the battlefield \u2014 well, good luck with that,\u201d Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind said.\n\nThe Ukraine investigations, which have been taking place behind closed-doors and lead by the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, have taken place at a rapid pace over the last few weeks.\n\nLt. Col. Vindman is the first current White House official to testify as part of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nWith his opening statement publicly released before the testimony began, Lt. Col. Vindman told lawmakers that he told Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a key player in the Ukraine incident, that the push to open an investigation into the Biden family crossed a line. He also said he raised his concerns with the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\n\u2014 This report was based in part on wire services.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
