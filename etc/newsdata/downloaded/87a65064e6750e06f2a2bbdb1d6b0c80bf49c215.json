He eventually admitted he had twisted his ankle, adding that it was not \u201ctoo serious\u201d.\n\nHatley revealed Vunipola had had his ankle scanned \u201cas a precaution\u201d and was spending time with the physios.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy being assessed and that will go on throughout the day and we\u2019ll see how he pulls up tomorrow,\u201d Hatley told reporters on Monday, with a firm diagnosis expected in the next 24 hours.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s around, walking around, big smile on his face. It\u2019s nearly lunchtime, so he\u2019s pretty happy. But he\u2019s all good,\u201d joked the coach.\n\nHatley said there were plenty of players in England\u2019s pack who could compensate for Vunipola\u2019s carrying ability if the number eight is ruled out.\n\n\u201cYou plan for all eventualities. With what we\u2019ve got with Ellis Genge and Mako (Vunipola), Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes. People pick up the slack like you have to,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that England had been forced to play a lot of rugby without both of the Vunipola brothers and other players had stepped up.\n\nHooker Jamie George added that Jones had told the other forwards to carry more when Vunipola came off against Argentina.\n\n\u201cWhenever they see me or Billy as an option, Willi just passes to Billy, which is probably fair enough,\u201d he said, referring to scrum-half Willi Heinz.\n\n\u201cIf he does or he doesn\u2019t play, we\u2019re all aware that we need to make sure we get our hands on the ball and impose ourselves physically on the game,\u201d said George.\n\nEngland, who have already qualified for the quarter-finals, play France on Saturday to decide who tops Pool C.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "England key man Billy Vunipola has had a \"precautionary\" scan on his injured ankle but is walking normally, according to coach Neal Hatley,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Billy-Vunipola-191005-Injured-G-1050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
