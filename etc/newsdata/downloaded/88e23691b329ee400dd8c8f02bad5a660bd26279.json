This beautiful countryside oasis would be a place I\u2019d love to visit, but I imagine if I lived there, I\u2019d have caused such a hefty snag in their research model and it may only have come in 37,255th, just above Croydon.\n\nHappiness is usually regarded as a gentle feeling, contentment \u2013 serenity. And this is how, I imagine, the ONS measure it. But it\u2019s not the same for those of us who prefer life a little more risky.\n\nThis half term, my six-year-old daughter asked me \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite feeling?\u201d I know exactly what my favourite feeling is, but I lied to my child and I told her what I thought I ought to say: \u201cHappiness, darling\u201d and gave her what I hoped was the serene smile of a knowing Earth Mother.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cMine\u2019s not,\u201d she retorted. \u201cMY favourite feeling is EXCITEMENT!\u201d Yup. That\u2019s my girl. That would have been my honest answer. While the kind of happiness enjoyed by the residents of Ribble is likely to be healthier and bring about more sanity, my daughter and I are the sort who endlessly seek the new and unexpected. New events to navigate and new people to tumble about with.\n\nThese days we are all encouraged to float about mindfully. We have meditation apps and colouring books for grown-ups. (Which I\u2019ve never understood. If you\u2019re going to colour in, why is it different doing an \u201cunderwater garden\u201d scene rather than a bunch of farmyard animals? It\u2019s like buying Just For Men hair dye because you don\u2019t want to be seen buying a product women use too. Hair dye is hair dye. Colouring in is colouring in. So raid a kid\u2019s arts cupboard and colour in pigs with pride.)\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The Independent's Happy List 2019 Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s always wanted to do in memory of both of her late husbands who were cared for at St Catherine\u2019s, and all the patients and families who she\u2019s come in to contact with. Di raised an incredible \u00a32,000 to help other people receive expert end of life care and support and make sure they don\u2019t have to face death and loss alone.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy daily shots of adrenaline that boot me into next week. \u201cSlow down\u201d is the phrase directed most often at me by those who love me. It has been under their orders that I\u2019ve found myself, from time to time, in a meditation class. In these oil-scented rooms, where people walk around barefoot and avoid eye contact, I am frustrated and try very hard not to growl \u2018\u2018Can you please hurry this relaxing up, I\u2019ve got stuff to do!\u201d\n\nPeriods in my life have been very zen and calm. But after a while of swimming around in a blissful lake of contentment, I chuck a gigantic rock in it, cause huge ripples and start again somewhere else. Whether it\u2019s career, social life or habitat, every now and then I fling it all up in the air and see where it lands. (Please note, this is very different to causing \u201cdrama\u201d. Wilful drama and those who create it are tiresome and should always be avoided.)\n\nThe constant need to change and stimulation tends not to be put under the umbrella of \u201chappy\u201d but more in the pile of \u201cstress bucket\u201d.\n\nOf course I see the appeal of places like Ribble. In the city, it often feels like you\u2019re chasing your tail and everywhere you turn, there\u2019s something to arrest your vision and scream \u201cBUY ME\u201d.\n\nBut within the chaos of a big city, your find own oasis and there is always something new going on. Good or bad, everything moves rapidly.\n\nI like to spend holidays in the Hampshire countryside. Recently, I made friends, in the local pub, with a couple next door to the cottage I was renting and they kindly said they would lend me a cafetiere. When I went round the next morning to get it, the lady was in a bit of a flap. \u201cWell the phone rang just as you rang the doorbell and it was my sister ringing to ask about Christmas, I told her \u2018I can\u2019t talk about it right now, I\u2019ve got someone at the door!\u2019 Phew, what a palaver!\u201d\n\nFor all my city-slicker ways, I don\u2019t think I have envied another human as much as I envied this lady in that moment. Imagine having a life so calm and uncomplicated that the doorbell and the landline calling you in the same moment lead to this level of flushed cheeks and brow wiping.\n\nI get it, it\u2019s a wonderful life. For some people, happiness is seeing the seasons change and breathing in fresh air, it\u2019s not being in a rush, it\u2019s walking without needing to be anywhere. It is beautiful, for a holiday. But for some of us, true happiness needs a great big stonking rollercoaster plonked in the middle.", "description": "The Office for National Statistics have declared Ribble Valley\u00a0in Lancashire to be the \u201chappiest place in the UK\u201d. This beautiful countryside oasis would be a place I\u2019d love to visit, but I imagine if I lived there, I\u2019d have caused such a hefty snag in their research model and it may only have come in 37,255th, just above Croydon.", "authors": ["Shappi Khorsandi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2012/03/28/10/IMG01124-20120326-1400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
