He said none had entered the ocean and there had been \"no secondary pollution\".\n\nInternational Coastal Cleanup Day - which this year fell on September 21 - is one of the largest global movements for oceanic preservation.\n\nVolunteers in around 100 countries took part this year, with beaches in Thailand, Hawaii, Israel and the Philippines also included.", "description": "A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9406/9cabd462599c417596cb348198c4079b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
