Quinones, 30, allegedly ran a red light and then refused to pull over, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nAnthony Souffle/Star Tribune via AP\n\nThe Sheriff's Office has not publicly identified Quinones as the deceased. But family members publicly confirmed his death and the Hennepin County Medical Examiner later identified the man as Quinones, according to ABC affiliate KTSP.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve it; he didn\u2019t deserve to leave the world like this,\u201d Joshua Quinones, Brian\u2019s brother, said in an interview with KSTP. \"He was a musician, he was a barber, he was just such a humble person.\"\n\nIn the Facebook Live video, Quinones can be seen getting out of the vehicle with what appeared to be a knife. Officers are then heard shouting commands at Brian. Twenty seconds after Quinones gets out of the car, multiple gunshots are fired. The chase ended in the nearby town of Richfield.\n\nJoshua Quinones said he spoke with his brother earlier in the day and knew something was up. \u201cHe was just tired,\u201d he said. He said local law enforcement failed his brother.\n\n\u201cI'm just speechless of what happened. I just think they could've done better,\u201d Joshua Quinones said. \u201cAt least Tased with a Taser gun or something. Really? Shoot him between four police officers. That's just too much.\u201d\n\n\"The Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office continues to investigate a Sept. 7 officer-involved shooting, the City of Edina grieves alongside the family of the deceased, the officers involved and their families, and the Richfield and Edina communities,\u201d according to a joint statement from the Richfield and Edina police departments.\n\nThe shooting is an active investigation, officials said.", "description": "A Minnesota man is dead after confronting officers following a police chase with authorities that he livestreamed on Facebook.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/livestream-car-chase-02-ap-jc-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
