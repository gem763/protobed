Other parties are also opposing an election until the EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay, although the DUP hinted on Saturday it could back the move.\n\nHowever, in a sign that the coalition opposed to an election is under strain, the Liberal Democrats have drawn up a plan allowing Johnson to secure a December poll with a simple majority of MPs, with the support of Jo Swinson\u2019s party and the SNP.\n\nUnder the one-page Lib Dem bill, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act would be amended to state that the next election would take place on 9 December, three days earlier than under Johnson\u2019s plans. It states that the new election date would be cancelled should the EU fail to grant a three-month Brexit extension.\n\nThe party is asking Johnson to adopt the bill and guide it through parliament between Tuesday and Thursday of this week, before dissolving parliament. It believes the timing of its plan means the prime minister would not be able to bring back his Brexit deal to the Commons before the election campaign starts \u2013 which he is currently threatening to do.\n\nSwinson said last night: \u201cBoris Johnson has missed his \u2018do-or-die\u2019 deadline and is now asking parliament to give him a general election and time for him to ram through his Brexit bill through parliament. That is a bad deal, and Liberal Democrats will not vote for it. We need to get Boris Johnson out of office, unlock the gridlock in parliament and give people the chance to vote to stay in the EU.\n\n\u201cA general election on our proposed timetable would take no-deal off the table, and give the public the chance to elect a Liberal Democrat government who will revoke article 50 or increase the number of MPs who support a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d\n\nParty officials concede that the plan\u2019s success lies in whether Johnson takes up the plan. However, it is a move that sees the Lib Dems shift support more clearly behind agitating for an early election.\n\nIan Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, gave his blessing to the plan on Saturday night. \u201cI\u2019m very keen that we work together on a mechanism, whether that be with Jo\u2019s bill that we will support or any other mechanism \u2013 such as a vote of no confidence \u2013 to bring parliament to a speedy end and have an election as early as is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lib Dems and SNP are also writing to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, calling on Brussels to offer Britain a Brexit extension to the end of January next year.\n\nThe news comes with an Opinium poll for the Observer suggesting the Conservatives have a 16-point lead over Labour, which is split over an election.\n\nJeremy Corbyn said on Saturday that his party would \u201cbe very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table\u201d. However, it remains unclear how that can be achieved. Figures on the left of the party are pushing to go to the polls, but Nick Brown, Labour\u2019s chief whip, has warned Corbyn that scores of MPs would disobey any order to vote through an election.\n\nJohnson repeated his demand on Saturday night for Labour to back his Brexit deal and vote for an early election and suggested that Brexit could drag on well into next year. He called on Labour to say how much more time it wanted to scrutinise his Brexit bill.\n\n\u201cInstead of grabbing this great new deal with both hands and helping move our country forward, parliament chose to ask for more tunnel,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThey agreed the deal but then they threw out the timetable. Unbelievably, Jeremy Corbyn then handed over the decision on what happens next to Brussels, so parliament\u2019s delay could take us to 31 January at least.\n\n\u201cMy worry is this parliament will just waste the next three months like it\u2019s wasted the last three years.\n\n\u201cParliament cannot hold the country hostage any longer. Millions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures, this paralysis is causing real damage and the country must move on in 2020.\u201d", "description": "Amendment to Fixed-Term Parliaments Act could prevent Brexit deal coming back to Commons", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e679d56dd83a2aaffc7329cdfffe4c5f2b148e8e/593_342_4975_2985/master/4975.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cfcac6513b772537bf87bbc2af3dbb9e", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
