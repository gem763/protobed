Here's why I plan to return.\n\nThere are many hotels that hold a firm place in my heart and the Riviera Palm Springs will always be one of them.\n\nThough, it's worth disclosing that some of my rose-tinted lens has to do with the fact that I'll be marrying at the Riviera next month. Yet my love affair with the Riv started much before wedding planning did. Super mod with a retro feel, the elegant grounds come together to form a property that's just so Palm Springs.\n\nWith rates as low as $90 nightly in low summer season (when temps hit 110 plus), rising to approximately $200 to $250 in high winter and spring months, even at its busiest, this Marriott Bonvoy resort remains incredibly affordable for a four-star hotel. Other boutique counterparts easily run closer to $350 per night, even in slower seasons.\n\nBeloved by Palm Springs purists who savor throwback vintage vibes, as well as pool partiers who wish they scored tickets to Coachella, the Riviera is the kind of place you book when you want to feel like Elizabeth Taylor with a healthy dose of Rat Pack revelry.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by the Riviera Palm Springs", "description": "The Riviera Palm Springs is a glam desert getaway that's also affordable.
