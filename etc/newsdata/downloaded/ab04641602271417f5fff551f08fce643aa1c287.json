Young\u2019s world mark is 46.78 seconds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say afterwards that this was going to happen but I wasn\u2019t too sure to be honest,\u201d said Warholm.\n\n\u201cThis was a very hard race, I had a pain in my chest, I thought I was going to die but here I am world champion.\n\n\u201cNorway is only a small country so to be showing up on the world stage is amazing.\u201d\n\nFor the final event of the night the athletes were introduced with a spectacular light show worthy of a race expected to produce fireworks.\n\nWith three of the four quickest men ever in the event on the starting blocks, the 400m hurdles was circled early as the marquee event of the world championships.\n\nBIGGEST CROWD\n\nThe race was expected to come down to a duel between the Norwegian and the American who pushed each other to career best times in Zurich in August and it unfolded as predicted.\n\nThere has been precious little for Qataris to cheer at Khalifa Stadium but the home fans were on their feet when Samba, the third fastest man of all time, stepped onto the track.\n\nThe cheers echoing through the stadium were a welcome change for the hosts who have endured days of criticism over sparse attendances and searing temperatures that have forced some competitions to begin in the middle of the night.\n\nThe women\u2019s 3,000m steeplechase and the men\u2019s 5,000m drew the first real noise of the championships as a crowd seemed to magically appear midway through the session.\n\nBut by the time the 400m hurdles began the fans that suddenly appeared had all but vanished, even the possibility of a rare medal unable to convince them to stay.\n\nSamba did not seem to notice and could not hide his delight at landing on the podium.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy... I\u2019m over the moon,\u201d said the beaming Qatari. \u201cIf I could find the words now I would but there are no words for how I am feeling right now.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you so much the people coming to the stadium. I was fighting to the end.\n\n\u201cI want to dedicate my medal to the people of Qatar.", "description": "Norway's Karsten Warholm completed a perfect season by blazing to world championship gold in the 400 metres hurdles on Monday while Abderrahman Samba finally gave the hosts something to cheer by claiming a bronze to secure Qatar's first medal.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435660542&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1DE", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
