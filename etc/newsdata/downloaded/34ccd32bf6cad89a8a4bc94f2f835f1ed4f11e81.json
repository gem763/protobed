We just have to trust the process, stay humble and make sure we're perfect.\"\n\nTamura admitted there were a few sore bodies after a bruising battle with Samoa but joked that Leitch was in a particularly \"chipper mood\" at breakfast on Monday, his 31st birthday.\n\nTongan-born lock Uwe Helu added that the Japan team -- half of whom hail from overseas -- would take their talismanic leader out for a shabu-shabu beef hotpot to celebrate.\n\n\"We all belong to one culture,\" said Helu, explaining the team's close-knit bond. \"The Japanese give everything, they respect everything. They have this fighting spirit as the samurai had -- it's a model we'd like to follow.\"\n\nWilliam Tupou, meanwhile, said it would be a \"dream come true\" for Japan to progress to the quarterfinals.\n\n\"If we execute our plan we can do amazing things,\" said the Auckland-born utility back. That showed against Ireland, but we want to start from zero and take that same mindset into a big game against Scotland -- the boys are believing in what we can do now.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japan fly-half Yu Tamura has been one of the standout players of the Rugby World Cup to date -- but captain's orders are apparently all Greek to the silky playmaker.
