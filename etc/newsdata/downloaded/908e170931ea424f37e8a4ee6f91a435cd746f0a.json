Former referee turned Bellator analyst John McCarthy explained the change in rules over the years.\n\n\u201cBack in 2001, when we were doing the unified rules, we started talking about grounded fighter because at the time, in the UFC, if you had someone that was on the ground, I could only punch at them,\u201d McCarthy explained. \u201cI could not kick. I couldn\u2019t kick him to the body, couldn\u2019t kick him to the head obviously, no body, nothing \u2013 couldn\u2019t kick their arm, couldn\u2019t kick. So when we did the unified rules, they said, \u2018Well, the standing fighter should be able to kick to the body,\u2019 so we changed that, but then the question was, \u2018What are we going to say is a grounded fighter,\u2019 and then we went right back to boxing is what they wanted to do.\u201d\n\nIn boxing, you can score a knockdown without your opponent being completely on the ground. If anything other than the soles of their feet touches the ground after getting struck, it is considered a knockdown. So when the unified rules in MMA were changed, fighters started to take advantage of the rule, by merely placing the tips of their fingers on the mat, so that they\u2019re considered a grounded fighter.\n\nBut McCarthy said that rule had to change, as it made it hard for referees to exactly define and determine what a grounded fighter entailed.\n\n\u201cSo we came up with the thing of, \u2018All right, we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019 but we were afraid of young fighters,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t usually happen with really mature and good fighters, getting hit with a leg kick, their legs going out, catching themselves on their hands and feet, trying to pop themselves back up, and punting them in the face while they\u2019re down, so we said \u2018All right, both hands palm- or fist-down, and both feet makes you down.\u2019 The whole point was for a fighter to never bend over at the waist.\u201d\n\nHowever, once again, discussions of the rule emerged, as different states employed different rules, making them far from unified. McCarthy explained how now a fighter has to only have one hand fully palm-down to be considered grounded, a rule that all states have agreed to use.\n\n\u201cNow the rule is, as of 2018, going back to one hand, palm-down, fist-down,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cSo they can\u2019t do anything with fingers. It\u2019s not about bearing weight. They come down here (puts palm on the ground) that puts you down, (puts fingers only on the ground) that does not. So that\u2019s where it is, in all states.\n\n\u201cFlat down, or you\u2019re not down.\u201d", "description": "Former referee turned Bellator analyst John McCarthy properly explains the current definition of a grounded fighter in MMA.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/john-mccarthy-explains-the-current-form-of-grounded-fighter-.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
