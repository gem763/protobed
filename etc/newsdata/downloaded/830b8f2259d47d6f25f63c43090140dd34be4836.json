By 2018 the population had dwindled to two remaining females, Najin and Fatu at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, who are the last of their kind in the world.\n\nCesare Galli said his team collected five immature eggs from each female which were airlifted to the Italian laboratory. There, the eggs were incubated to provide three mature eggs for Najin and four for Fatu.\n\nThe scientists then used a common IVF procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, to fertilise the eggs. Fatu\u2019s were injected with thawed out sperm taken from a dead male called Suni, while Najin\u2019s eggs were fertilised with poorer quality sperm collected from a male called Saut. After 10 days of incubation, two of Fatu\u2019s eggs developed into viable embryos, but none of Najin\u2019s made it.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, it seemed like the production of a northern white rhino embryo was an almost unachievable goal, and today we have them,\u201d said Jan Stejskal at Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in the Czech Republic, where Najin and Fatu were born.\n\nThe last of the male northern white rhinos was 45-year-old named Sudan who rose to fame in 2017 when a fundraising effort listed him on the Tinder dating app as \u201cThe Most Eligible Bachelor in the World\u201d. He was put down in March last year for health reasons brought on by old age.\n\nThe dramatic decline of the northern white rhinos was driven by poaching. Sudan was the last known male to be born in the wild, in the country from which he got his name. The southern white rhino and the black rhino are also targeted by poachers, who kill them for their horns to supply illegal markets in parts of Asia.\n\nAbout 21,000 southern white rhinos still exist and females will be used as surrogate mothers in the effort to save the northern species. Scientists hope that the first northern white rhino will be born from an IVF embryo in the next two years.\n\nEven if healthy northern white rhino calfs are born from the IVF embryos, conservationists will still face an enormous challenge in the lack of genetic diversity in the population. One way to broaden the animals\u2019 gene pool is to create eggs from rhino skin cells stored around the world, but the technology may not be available for another decade.\n\n\u201cThis is a major step forward in our efforts to recover the northern white rhinos,\u201d said Richard Vigne, managing director of Ol Pejeta Conservancy. \u201cWe have a very long way to go and we must remember that, for most species facing extinction, the resources that are being dedicated to saving the northern whites simply don\u2019t exist. Global human behaviour still needs to radically change if the lessons of the northern white rhinos are to be learned.\u201d", "description": "Two embryos have been created in an attempt to rescue northern white rhinos", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837ed3dd2d33e565fb61acbec8cfd5b2c9f4e2fa/0_312_4655_2792/master/4655.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e7e84acc059d8539a80aa50f157b61c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
