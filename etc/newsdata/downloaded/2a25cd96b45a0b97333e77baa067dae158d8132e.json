It\u2019s a different time period. It feels like things are stacked up against me.\u2019 \u2014Alf Seccombe, a borrower who owes $223,000 in graduate school loan debt\n\nHe makes six figures in retail fashion marketing, but is still sliding into credit-card debt to pay his loans. Seccombe thinks of his in-laws, who both worked as teachers and bought a house with an ocean view. His house is on a highway and has plumbing work that needs to be put off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a different boat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different time period. It feels like things are stacked up against me.\u201d Seccombe already works at least 50 hours a week and has wondered about a weekend job. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the choice between, \u2018Am I going to raise my kids or not?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOne year at any four-year institution cost $26,593 during the 2016 to 2017 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Adjusting for inflation, the center said the 1985-1986 cost to pay for that same year of schooling was $12,274.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The No. 1 university in America now comes with a total sticker price of over $293,000\n\nBut not everyone empathizes with debt-holders. One-third of adults aged 45 and up say graduates are most at fault for their student debt, according to a new survey. In fact, 25% say young people should look for lower interest rates and 19% say graduates should work harder to pay it off.\n\nThe 18- to 44-year-olds participating in the CreditRepair.com survey \u2014 those most likely paying off loans right now \u2014 see things differently. Only 21% say students are at fault, while 40% say the responsibility rests primarily with the government.\n\nAnd just 10% of younger participants in the survey said graduates need to work harder. Their No. 1 solution (according to 27% of this age group) was free public college; only 18% of older Americans said they felt the same way.\n\nBorrowers between the age of 18 and 39 owe $840 billion of the nation\u2019s approximate $1.5 trillion dollar student debt as of this year\u2019s second quarter, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data, while those aged 18 to 49 owe $1.16 trillion. Americans with student-loan debt had an average $32,700 balance as of the end of last year, the Fed noted.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This budget shows how a $350,000 salary barely qualifies as middle class\n\nAdvocates say minority students face steeper costs and consequences because they are more likely to borrow money for school. One recent study found that white men paid down 44% of their debts 12 years after school, but the balance for black women increased 13% over that time.\n\nAt a congressional hearing earlier this week, comedian Hasan Minhaj called student debt \u201ca paywall to the middle class.\u201d \u201cPeople are putting off marriage, kids, home ownership and retirement,\u2015especially my generation,\u201d said the 33-year-old host of Netflix\u2019s NFLX, +2.13% \u201cPatriot Act.\u201d\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), 55, said debt levels were a crisis, but pressed witnesses on whether student loans were absolutely necessary for schooling. (A Loudermilk spokesman said the congressman likely wouldn\u2019t have time Friday to review the survey.)\n\n\u201cTwo of my three children graduated from four-year college institutions with zero debt and no scholarship,\u201d Loudermilk said. \u201cThey actually worked and paid for their tuition.
