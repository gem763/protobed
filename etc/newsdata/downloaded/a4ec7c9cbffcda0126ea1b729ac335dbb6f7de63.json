A lot of the buzz was created organically on social media,\" Athayde said. \"Our guests were engaging with us and we decided to have some fun alongside them.\"\n\nThen on Aug. 27, Popeyes announced the sandwiches were sold out and the company was working with suppliers to bring it back as soon as possible.\n\nAthayde said most Popeyes restaurants are franchised and that employment matters are handled by the franchisees.\n\n\"Across the system, franchisees have worked to increase staffing to be ready to serve guests once the chicken sandwich returns,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve learned from this experience and are looking forward to serving the Chicken Sandwich to our guests again.\"\n\nIn August, USA TODAY conducted an unscientific Chicken Sandwich Bracket Twitter poll.\n\nIn the first round, the top seed Chick-fil-A easily took down KFC with more than 80% of the vote while chicken sandwich newcomer Popeyes vanquished Wendy's, capturing 69% of the vote, to set up the final round we all expected.\n\nIn the final round, 54% of the 5,062 votes cast were for Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A and 46% for Popeyes.\n\nIn a short, 20-second long YouTube video posted Monday announcing the return, a highway sign showing Popeyes and Chick-fil-A's names is updated to add the words \"open Sunday\" under Popeyes, a dig at its competition, which is well-known for staying closed on Sundays.\n\nPopeyes also shared images promoting the sandwich's return: \"Y'all ... The Sandwich is back. This Sunday. Yes. Sunday.\"\n\nChick-fil-A' schedule does have a major fan: Kanye West\u2019s new \u201cJesus is King\u201d album has a song called \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d where he mentions Chick-fil-A with the lyrics, \u201cClosed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A. You're my number one, with the lemonade.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Chicken sandwich alert: Popeyes chicken sandwich returns Nov. 3", "description": "Popeyes is preparing to relaunch its popular chicken sandwich Sunday, which sold out in about two weeks.
