And contrast it with now.\n\nContrast it, for example, with the scene that unfolded in front of a few curious onlookers at lunchtime in the underpass beneath the Gijido Street bridge in Shinjuku a few hours before the game.\n\nOn a patch of concrete sandwiched between some empty bike racks and a restaurant called Royal Host, a group of men who looked like giants in the tight, enclosed space linked arms in a huddle and then went to work.\n\nJones leaned against some railings and watched as his England players went through line-out drills, shouting a code then throwing, leaping, catching and off-loading. And then repeating. Jones smiled through it all.\n\nEddie Jones took over after the 2015 debacle and has rejuvenated the squad in the years since\n\nIt lasted for maybe 15 minutes. Then there was another huddle and the players strolled away across Chuo-Dori Avenue and back to their hotel.\n\nThere were four hours until kick-off of the biggest game of their World Cup so far but they looked like men at ease with themselves and what lay ahead.\n\nThey were relaxed and confident. Four years ago, England wore a haunted look. The pressure was too much. Not this time. So far, at least, the attitude could not be more different.\n\nENGLAND AT THE 2019 RUGBY WORLD CUP September 22: England 35-3 Tonga, Sapporo\n\n35-3 Tonga, Sapporo September 26: England 45-7 USA, Kobe\n\n45-7 USA, Kobe October 5: England 39-10 Argentina, Tokyo\n\n39-10 Argentina, Tokyo October 12: England vs France, Yokohama\n\nvs France, Yokohama October 19-20: Opponent TBC, quarter-final\n\nBefore they left their makeshift practice area, Jones dropped a ball on to his foot and sent a grubber-kick, bouncing and bobbling across the hard surface straight into the arms of one of his staff. Jones, too, looked like a man in his element, eager for the test to come.\n\nWhen early evening came and England ran out in the sultry heat to face Argentina, the arena had changed but the routines and the focus stayed the same.\n\nNine minutes had gone when England's first lineout code was called. Jamie George threw it in and Maro Itoje climbed so high as he caught the ball that he would have hit his hands on the roof of that Shinjuku underpass.\n\nItoje caught and held and a driving maul pushed him onward and onward towards the line. When the ball broke loose, it was fed to George Ford on the blind side and he found Jonny May, who darted over the line to put England 5-3 ahead. On grass, just as on concrete, England looked like a team in control.\n\nThey were never headed again on their way to a convincing win. Sure, they have not hit the top of their game yet but they have not needed to. 'That was a banana skin game for us,' Jones said after the match.\n\nGloucester wing Jonny May scored the first try of the match, set up by fly-half George Ford\n\n'We can only beat what is put in front of us. I was pleased with the leadership of the game. We are just concentrating on getting better with every match.'\n\nAnd that is the reality. England will be concerned by an injury to Billy Vunipola, who was forced off at half time. Jones tried to make a joke of it by saying he had 'slipped on some Kobe beef'.\n\nIt appears Vunipola has hurt his ankle but it is too early to say how badly. Apart from that, England are exactly where they want to be at this stage of the competition.\n\nThe victory over Argentina was, as everyone expected it to be, their sternest examination of the tournament to this point but they withstood the early intensity of the Pumas without losing their cool or being sucked into a battle about who could show the most passion. Kyle Sinckler conceded one penalty that allowed Argentina to take an early lead but that was it.\n\nThe only negative for Eddie Jones on Saturday was a potential injury to No 8 Billy Vunipola\n\n'When you play Argentina, it's a test of manhood,' Jones had said on the eve of the game. But it is also a test of control and Argentina lost theirs midway through the half when lock Tomas Lavanini was sent off for a juddering high tackle that jolted Owen Farrell's head back with shocking force. They had to play for more than 60 minutes with 14 men.\n\nArgentina could have few complaints about the red card shown by Nigel Owens. 'It was fair,' their coach Mario Ledesma said after the match.\n\nThe opening stages of this World Cup have been dogged by debate about whether World Rugby is going too far in its attempts to make the game safer but Lavanini was a big man out of control when he made the challenge on Farrell. The damage could have been a lot worse.\n\nTomas Lavanini was sent off for a dangerous tackle on England skipper Farrell in the first half\n\nLavanini (L) receives his marching orders - a moment which flipped the game on its head\n\nIt still seemed puzzling that Farrell did not have a head injury assessment after he took the hit. He appeared unruffled by the incident but he missed all three of England's conversions and a penalty in the first half.\n\n'It could be a technical glitch or mistiming when he got his bell rung,' former England fly-half Paul Grayson said. Farrell insisted afterwards that the impact was on his jaw and there was no need for an HIA.\n\nEngland gradually made the extra man, and their general superiority, count and stretched their lead as the half wore on.\n\nAs soon as it became obvious the result was no longer in doubt, thoughts inevitably began to shift towards their final group game against France, in Yokohama next Saturday and the permutations about who they may face in the knock-out phase.\n\nGeorge Ford celebrates his try early in the second-half which put victory beyond all doubt\n\nJones refused to get carried away by the victory. Argentina had lost 10 Tests in a row before they struggled past Tonga last weekend. They reached the World Cup semi finals in 2007 and 2015 but they have been in decline since they reached the last four in England four years ago.\n\nBut England made this look routine. There were no alarms. There was nothing to counter the idea that they are growing into this tournament.\n\nSome England fans complained about a lack of fluency in the aftermath of their victory but even though they conceded a late try, it could not disguise the fact that they had controlled the game with relative ease.\n\nThey have three bonus point wins from three matches. They ran in six tries on Saturday morning. They are improving with every game. Things could be a lot worse. They could be waiting to play Uruguay next week.\n\nJack Nowell's impact off the bench was immediate as he bounced his way over the whitewash\n\nOnce more, Jones was able to bring players off the bench early on Saturday so they could get a feel for the intensity of the competition and if there were concerns about Vunipola, there was also a huge boost for team morale when long-term injury absentee Jack Nowell came off the bench in the second half and scored a typically indomitable try in the corner.\n\nFrance, who edged past Argentina in the group's opening game, may provide another step-up in opposition next weekend when the two teams meet to decide who will win their pool. The winner of that match is likely to play Australia in the quarter-finals. The loser may face Wales. The consensus is that Australia would be the preferable opponent. There is much to play for.\n\n'It's like a tea bag, isn't it?' Jones had said of whether his side was battle-ready. 'You don't know how good it is until you put it in hot water.' The water started to get warmer here but England are showing no signs of losing their taste for glory.", "description": "MAIL ON SUNDAY CHIEF SPORTS WRITER OLIVER HOLT IN TOKYO:  England made this look routine.
