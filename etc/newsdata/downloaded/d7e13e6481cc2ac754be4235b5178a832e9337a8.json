This interpretation of events is a key underpinning of Web Design: The Evolution of the Digital World 1990-Today (Taschen, $50), a new visual-heavy book from author Rob Ford and editor Julius Wiedemann that does something that hasn\u2019t been done on the broader internet in quite a long time: It praises the use of Flash as a creative tool, rather than a bloated malware vessel, and laments the ways that visual convention, technical shifts, and walled gardens have started to rein in much of this unvarnished creativity.\n\nThis is a realm where small agencies supporting big brands, creative experimenters with nothing to lose, and teenage hobbyists could stand out simply by being willing to try something risky. It was a canvas with a built-in distribution model. What wasn\u2019t to like, besides a whole host of malware?\n\nThe 640-page book, full of pictures of interactive websites from prior eras, benefits from taking a wide view of the visual culture of the past: Starting at the embryonic stages of the World Wide Web, it follows the art of web design through periods of extreme experimentation on the way to the convention-driven scaffolding we have today. The book makes a compelling case through its general structure that the sweet spot of creative web design came during the late 1990s through the mid-2000s\u2014periods in which major brands were willing to invest a whole lot of money in a website intended for show, not just tell.\n\nFord, who is known for running the long-running Favourite Web Awards (FWA), is very much in the \u201cshow\u201d category. In an email interview, Ford listed off a dizzying array of iconic websites, pages that once wowed the broader internet and helped uncover key design mechanisms\u2014for example, Ford says 1998\u2019s EYE4U, an early influence on many Flash developers, \u201cshowed us responsive design 15 years before the term was coined,\u201d while sites like 2002\u2019s Who\u2019s We Studios and 2003\u2019s tokyoplastic brought personality to the equation.\n\nThere was a lot of it because of the artistic influences these creators brought forth. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting how many super-creative talents have a \u2019background\u2018 in rave and club culture, whether that be as punters or promoters,\u201d Ford said.\n\nThese sites, reliant on animation and Flash\u2019s underlying ActionScript language, were the kind that excited creatives, ready to embrace an artistic medium, but frustrated usability experts, who would rail against the way the sites flouted basic convention.\n\nIf any one website sort of hits these two tensions perfectly, it\u2019s Subservient Chicken, the popular Burger King-produced web interactive which hits right in the middle of the nearly three-decade period covered in this book. At the time of its creation, it was widely discussed and dissected by advertisers who realized that its combination of visuals and ELIZA-style text commands represented something new. Given the move towards chatbots and memetic videos in the years since, it feels downright predictive.\n\n\u201cSubservient Chicken gave us something we hadn\u2019t experienced before, that was real time (even though it actually wasn\u2019t real time, it faked it very well) interaction but, more importantly, an emotional \u2018live\u2019 personal experience,\u201d Ford notes, adding that it also predicted voice assistants that work in similar ways.\n\nBut the aggressive creativity offered by Flash eventually would prove impossible to bring to the mobile era in quite the same way, as portability and improved HTML rendering capabilities made it obsolete. Around the time of Steve Jobs\u2019 famous open letter to Adobe, Ford noted that many of the Flash era\u2019s creators \u201ccompletely moved away from the web and used their talents elsewhere.\u201d There were still some notable HTML5-based creations during this period\u2014including the Arcade Fire\u2019s Google Chrome \u201cexperiment\u201d \u201cThe Wilderness Downtown,\u201d which Ford calls \u201cthe biggest, most influential website in over a decade.\u201d But the social era\u2014particularly Facebook Pages\u2014proved \u201ca final nail in the coffin for web design,\u201d he noted.\n\nBut all those wild ideas had to go somewhere, and many of them didn\u2019t appear in the App Store. Ford says that while the modern web has largely eschewed the creative risks of the Flash era, it can be found in physical mediums and augmented reality, places where many of the creative explosions that web tools like Flash and HTML5 initially allowed can be furthered and built upon\u2014with many of the same creators behind the initial rise responsible for much of the modern excitement.\n\n\u201cThe progressive interaction and visual creativity is happening outside of the web browser now,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe rise in interactive installations, AR, and experiential in general is where the excitement of the early days is finally happening again.\u201d\n\nThis book, which hits next month, comes just at a time when Flash\u2014a tool first developed by FutureWave, then improved upon by Macromedia and exploited on a mass scale by Adobe\u2014is about to meet its maker, and the internet has moved past it for perfectly sensible reasons. (Seriously, Flash is hacked all to hell and you probably should avoid it in most circumstances.)\n\nWhile a book may be static rather than interactive, this feels like a fitting coda for a kind of digital creativity that\u2014like Geocities and MySpace pages, multimedia CD-ROMs, and Prodigy graphical interfaces before it\u2014has faded in prominence. But when it was there, we needed it, because of all the creative folks it inspired.\n\n\u201cWithout the rebels we\u2019d still be looking at static websites with gray text and blue hyperlinks,\u201d Ford said.", "description": "A new book highlighting the visual evolution of web design paints a picture of a risk-taking creative culture that hasn\u2019t been quite the same since Steve Jobs stuck a knife into Flash.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9ce2e7408a4c000a7e2858/lede/1570564483571-tokyoplastic.png?crop=1xw:0.937708102108768xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
