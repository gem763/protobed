Lutz made a 58-yard field goal as time expired, and the Saints beat the Houston Texans 30-28 on Monday night in a game that had three scoring plays in the final minute.\n\n\u201cThat one\u2019s got to be a top-one moment for me,\u201d Lutz said, adding that as much as he tries to treat each kick the same. \u201cI got to be honest. That one felt a little different.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins are built to lose. And it looks like their players hate it Read more\n\nNew Orleans had lost their previous five season openers. And after last season ended with a bitter loss in the NFC title game, the Saints had expressed urgency to start the 2019 campaign well. \u201cI knew how big this win would be,\u201d Lutz said.\n\nThe moment the ball left Lutz\u2019s foot, punter Thomas Morstead, who holds on field goals, turned toward his kicker, triumphantly flexing both arms at his side. Moments later, the crowd noise in the Superdome reached an ear-splitting crescendo as the ball split the uprights and Saints players jubilantly streamed on to the field.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to ex-Saints receiver Kenny Stills with 37 seconds left, capping a two-play, 75-yard drive that put the Texans in front after they began their final possession down by six with 50 seconds left. But that left just enough time for Brees, who capped a 370-yard, two-touchdown performance by completing a 15-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr, an 11-yarder to Michael Thomas and another pass to Ginn for nine yards in quick succession. That allowed New Orleans to save their final timeout until just two seconds remained and set up Lutz\u2019s career-long kick.\n\n\u201cWhen you have Drew as your quarterback, all I cared about was getting ready for the kick, because I knew with 37 seconds left there was going to be a chance,\u201d Lutz said.\n\nNew Orleans Saints (@Saints) 58 YARDS.\n\nICE IN HIS VEINS.\n\nWIL. LUTZ. pic.twitter.com/3za5pOsr2W\n\nHad the Saints lost, it would have marked the second straight game in the Superdome in which a league-acknowledged officiating mistake worked against New Orleans. In last season\u2019s NFC championship game, missed pass interference and helmet-to-helmet contact fouls against the Los Angeles Rams went uncalled in the final minutes. This time, a botched ruling left the Saints with 15 fewer seconds to run their hurry-up offense at the end of the first half. New Orleans had to settle for a 56-yard field goal try that Lutz narrowly missed.\n\nThe Saints came back from an 11-point, third-quarter hole to win anyway, but Brees wasn\u2019t letting the officials or the league off the hook. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen. That\u2019s a game changer,\u201d Brees said. \u201cIf we had 15 more seconds, are you kidding me?\u201d\n\nNew season, same Patriots: New England crush Steelers on Sunday Night Football Read more\n\nThe 40-year-old Brees completed 32 of 43 passes, mirroring his NFL-record 74.4 completion percentage last season. One of his TD passes went to reserve QB and utility player Taysom Hill, who also subs in as a tight end or slot receiver. The other went to second-year pro Tre\u2019Quan Smith.\n\n\u201cPlaying on the road against a great quarterback like Drew Brees, you\u2019ve got to be able to put the game away,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe had the opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn Oakland, the night started with Raiders fans derisively chanting at former disgruntled receiver Antonio Brown and ended with coach Jon Gruden celebrating a victory in the Black Hole.\n\nThe saga that consumed the football world for days didn\u2019t hamper the Raiders a bit. Derek Carr threw a touchdown pass on the opening drive of the season, rookie Josh Jacobs ran for two scores and the Raiders responded to a tumultuous week surrounding Brown by beating the Denver Broncos 24-16.\n\n\u201cAs much as people talked about it, I mean my god. I feel like somebody was smashing my temple on the side of the head,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cGet over it, man. It\u2019s over. We were good this pre-season without him. We were fine without him. We wish him the best. We gave it a shot. Now New England gets their turn. Good luck to them. I can\u2019t deal with it any more.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Josh Jacobs celebrates after scoring his second touchdown of the game.

The offensive line cleared holes for Jacobs and protected Carr, and the defense harassed Joe Flacco into three sacks and kept Denver out of the end zone until 2:15 remained in the game. The win spoiled the Denver debuts for Flacco and coach Vic Fangio and ended the NFL\u2019s longest opening weekend winning streak at seven games.", "description": "Wil Lutz made a 58-yard field goal as time expired in a game that had three scoring plays in the final minute", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f040e3d9539ebbbdb6ac07c0d944ef32f2bad3c5/0_76_3989_2395/master/3989.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02a7b8c076e887baecbe8f269d835972", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
