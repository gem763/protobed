A music critic lays it out.", "language": "en", "text": "Why does an orchestra need a conductor? And what, exactly, does a conductor do?\n\nIt\u2019s not a stupid question. Plenty of people ask it. Whole books have been written on the topic, such as John Mauceri\u2019s recent \u201cMaestros and Their Music,\u201d one conductor\u2019s smart and engaging view of the art. Musicians joke about it \u2014 warning colleagues not to look at a conductor they dislike, since his podium antics may prove a distraction to playing the music. Then there are orchestras that play without conductors, including the New York-based Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Such groups sound very good, but when I hear them play with a soloist, I often come away feeling that something is missing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo figure in classical music is more iconic than the conductor, or more misunderstood. The authoritarian figure on the podium, waving his arms and demanding that everyone follow him, is the embodiment of the worst sides of patriarchal classical tradition. Yet the conductor also is the ultimate communicator, the person charged with bringing the best out of a hundred musicians to create compelling music. No job in music is harder to quantify, and no job is, when it\u2019s done well, more important.\n\nSo here\u2019s a brief look at the function of the conductor.\n\nIn the most basic terms, the conductor beats time. Whether the music is written with four beats to a measure, or three, or seven, and especially when it switches from one to another, it\u2019s essential to have someone at the front of the ensemble acting as a traffic cop. In the early days of classical music, this was achieved by banging a large staff on the floor. An essential piece of conductor lore is the example of the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, who was pounding away with his staff in a performance in 1687 when he hit his foot by accident. Gangrene subsequently set in, and he died of the injury. (Cue jokes about the dangers of art.)\n\nKeeping the beat is still important. The staff of Lully\u2019s day has shrunk into the baton of today, which serves as a useful focal point for musicians glancing up from their scores. The baton, though, varies in size from one conductor to another; Valery Gergiev, the longtime head of the Mariinsky Theatre, famously uses a toothpick. Some conductors dispense with the baton altogether, shaping the music with their hands. The general idea is that one hand is used to keep time and the other is used to signal expression \u2014 bringing in the cellos, encouraging the second violins to play more loudly, reminding the winds of a sudden decrescendo. The expressive side of the conductor\u2019s art has developed to a point that it is sometimes hard to find the beat in all of the gestures \u2014 Christoph Eschenbach, who until 2017 was music director of the National Symphony Orchestra and is now principal conductor of the Konzerthausorchester Berlin, for example, can be opaque \u2014 though musicians tend to appreciate a clear beat when they see it.\n\nThe secret, jet-setting life of a world-famous conductor\n\nConducting, however, involves much more than beating time. Conducting today is communication: A conductor develops a vision of how she wants a piece of music to sound, and then tries to transmit that vision to 80 or 100 players. Hearing the difference between different conductors\u2019 interpretations isn\u2019t hard, even for classical music newcomers. Test it for yourself on YouTube by comparing the start of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony as conducted by Gianandrea Noseda, the music director of the National Symphony Orchestra, and by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, the legendary 20th-century German conductor. You\u2019ll find plenty of contrasts.\n\nIn rehearsal, some conductors try to explain in words what they want before starting to play, but in general, orchestra musicians vastly prefer less talk and more action. Thus, conductors develop repertories of gestures that are as specific to them as their tone of voice.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to codify a gesture. Yes, there are some gestures that are nearly universal \u2014 beckoning with one hand to get a section to play louder, for example. And some conductors are technical machines, such as Pierre Boulez or Lorin Maazel, whose brains were veritable musical computers, capable of subdividing beats with mathematical precision or hearing minute variations in pitch, and never leaving their musicians in doubt about exactly what they wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor some, a minimalist approach works best: Fritz Reiner, a 20th-century Hungarian autocrat, famously conducted with gestures so restrained and small that once, a musician in the back of the orchestra brought in a pair of binoculars. (Reiner responded by writing \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d on a piece of paper and holding it up when he saw the binoculars come out.) Leonard Bernstein, by contrast \u2014 who was one of the most beloved conductors of the Vienna Philharmonic \u2014 leaped around the podium, gesticulated and thrust his pelvis in Elvis-worthy contortions. Yet there\u2019s also a video of Bernstein conducting a movement of a Haydn symphony while standing, his arms folded, using his eyebrows and flicking motions of his eyes.\n\nOne of the visual pleasures of a live orchestral concert is watching the conductor and seeing what kinds of gestures he makes and what difference, if any, those make to what you hear the orchestra doing. Some conductors make a great show on the podium but to little effect; others\u2019 every move is reflected in the music. And \u2014 as demonstrated by the Bernstein Haydn video \u2014 there\u2019s also an intangible communication that flows like an electric current among musicians when the connection has been joined.\n\nIn the documentary \u201cThe Art of Conducting: Great Conductors of the Past,\u201d which offers valuable insights on all of these issues, a timpanist with the Berlin Philharmonic recalls sitting in the back of a rehearsal, following a score, when he suddenly heard an audible shift in the orchestra\u2019s sound. He looked up to see what had changed and saw that Furtw\u00e4ngler had walked into the room.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was his personality alone that created a new sound \u2014 just by being in the room,\u201d the timpanist said.\n\nWhich offers another answer to the question of exactly what a conductor does: You may not be able to say, but you\u2019ll know it when you hear it.\n\nGergiev: Maddeningly uneven orchestra incites range of emotions.\n\nBernstein\u2019s legacy: conductors on their mentor\n\nFrom the archives: can Eschenbach and the NSO give each other a fresh start?\n\nAD", "description": "The maestro does much more than keep the beat.", "authors": ["Anne Midgette", "Classical Music Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/l-7K1Sy6lhnlUlnSijezgXZ6C1g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4RWQWXDWII6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
