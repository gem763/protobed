Shares rose 0.7% in regular trading Tuesday after GoDaddy GDDY, +0.68% announced in San Francisco a new software product that helps small businesses build websites with a suite of marketing tools.\n\nGoDaddy also benefited from the buzz of two special guests: New company pitchwoman Ayesha Curry and her husband, Stephen, the two-time MVP of the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors. The power couple launched a new website for their \u201cEat. Learn. Play\u201d community foundation for low-income families, built from GoDaddy\u2019s new software.\n\n\u201cWe want to make building websites for small businesses simpler, simpler, simpler, because a large percentage of them do not have a website,\u201d Bhutani said in his first interview since officially taking over as CEO on Sept. 4. He joined GoDaddy from Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, +1.07%, where as president he once reported to Dara Khosrowshahi, who is now CEO of Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, -0.41% . It takes as little as an hour for small businesses to build websites from GoDaddy\u2019s new product, he said.\n\nIf only CEO succession plans went so smoothly.\n\nBhutani assumed the reins in the midst of the Trump administration\u2019s tariff war with China and a slump in the market \u2014 not to mention momentary uncertainty over the surprise resignation of Wagner, who oversaw a surge in the company\u2019s fortunes. \u201cYeah, you can say a lot was going on at the time,\u201d Bhutani said, laughing.\n\nFrom mid-2017 to mid-2018, after Wagner succeeded Blake Irving, GoDaddy\u2019s stock catapulted 56%, as the company reached 18 million paying customers and revenue topped $2.5 billion. In an interview then, Wagner predicted bigger things: Nearly 25 million paying customers and about $5 billion in revenue by 2023.\n\nThings have cooled appreciably since, however.\n\nThe Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company reported non-GAAP earnings of 61 cents per share for its second-quarter results in August, missing the FactSet consensus estimate of 79 cents. Revenue improved 13% year-over-year to $737.2 million, edging FactSet\u2019s estimate of $735.5 million.\n\nThe company expects revenue between $2.97 billion and $3 billion, up 12% to 13% year-over-year.\n\n\u201cScott had a good plan in place, and we will continue the same strategy,\u201d Bhutani said. \u201cWe think alike. At our town hall (in August), we finished each others\u2019 sentences.\u201d\n\nDespite its quarterly hiccup, the company continues to grow internationally in the U.K., Canada, Australia, India and elsewhere. Case in point: In 2012, about 2 million of GoDaddy\u2019s 10 million small-business customers, about 20%, came from outside the U.S.; this year, about 8 million of its 19 million customers, or 42%, are non-U.S.\n\nMore than 1 million of them are in India, where, despite massive infrastructure obstacles, GoDaddy has established a growing customer base.\n\nAt the same time, the company feels immune to fears of declines in IT spending, as cautioned by Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -1.10% and HP Inc. HPQ, +0.00% in recent earnings calls. \u201cOur customer base couldn\u2019t be more different,\u201d Bhutani said. \u201cSmall businesses are our life blood.\u201d", "description": "Shares of the Internet-domain registrar and web-hosting company have tumbled 10% since Scott Wagner retired in August due to health reasons.
