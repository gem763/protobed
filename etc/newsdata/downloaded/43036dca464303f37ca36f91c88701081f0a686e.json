He currently owns a little over one fifth of WeWork.\n\nSoftBank has also agreed to extend him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co (N: ), as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.\n\n'SURREAL TO CRAZY'\n\nWeWork cofounder Miguel McKelvey had kicked off the meeting by introducing Claure to the staff at the company's New York headquarters and addressed the tumultuous few weeks WeWork had experienced.\n\n\"I think I've run out of words to describe what's been going on from surreal to crazy to unbelievable to...bonkers,\" McKelvey said.\n\nIn August, WeWork filed for a splashy initial public offering. This week, it was struggling for survival as it has been quickly burning through the cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe IPO was abandoned in September as investors balked at sky-high valuations - a deal in January had tagged its worth at $47 billion. The rescue by SoftBank now values it at just $8 billion.\n\nInvestors also questioned both whether its business model was sustainable given big losses it was suffering and the way that Neumann was running the company, triggering his resignation as CEO.\n\nClaure, who was previously CEO of U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp (N: ), set an upbeat tone during the hour-long meeting at which he encouraged questions.\n\n\"My goal is to be part of one of the most amazing comebacks in history and to build jointly with you guys,\" said Claure, who is also the chief operating officer at SoftBank.\n\nClaure said that the new cash injection meant WeWork was not going to struggle to survive.\n\nHowever, it was going to focus very differently, he said. \"Make no mistake, the world has changed. The growth stories don't sell any more,\" he said. Adding that the challenge was to \"build a company that has an amazing product, that delights our customers, but also makes money.\"\n\nAnd that meant deciding which of the markets around the world \"makes sense for us to be in, which market doesn't,\" he said. According to its website, WeWork has 856 office sites in 123 countries that are open or about to open.\n\nClaure said he did not know how many layoffs would take place as WeWork looks to \"go back to basics.\" Sources close to the company have mentioned a range of figures for possible layoffs in recent weeks, from as few as 2,000 to as many as 5,000 out of its 12,500 employees.\n\nClaure said that despite the turmoil, WeWork's landlords were \"eager to find different models of working with us.\"\n\nWeWork had $18 billion in long-term lease obligations as of the end of June, according to its most recent public financial disclosure. It also had $1.3 billion in net debt.\n\nThe company is closing or selling a number of businesses outside of the main office-sharing operations. It recently announced it would close the WeGrow private school in New York City after the current school year.\n\nWeWork did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "WeWork's new chairman defends payouts to founder, says company will survive", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M1X7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
