I\u2019m ready to see these boys blossom.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the opponents think of us. I just know sometimes when you walk off games, we\u2019re not doing bad here. Sometimes there\u2019s a gap. I\u2019ve felt that a couple of times, but not very often.\u201d\n\nUnited have made their worst start to a league season in 30 years and the result in the Netherlands extended their winless run on the road to 10 games across all competitions.\n\nLike Solskjaer, Newcastle boss Steve Bruce is also facing widespread criticism with his team currently 19th in the table and without a win since August.\n\n\u201cBrucey is going to set up a team to win,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cI\u2019m going to set up a team to try to win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going there, it\u2019s a great stadium to play at. We\u2019re looking forward to the game. We\u2019ve hopefully got many players fresh for Sunday.\u201d\n\nUnited midfielder Paul Pogba missed the midweek game for further treatment on his ankle injury, and Solskjaer does not expect him to be ready for the weekend\u2019s trip to St James\u2019 Park.\n\n\u201cIt might be time for us to give Paul 10 or 14 days extra to be ready for Liverpool,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\nJesse Lingard is also likely to miss out after suffering a hamstring injury against Alkmaar while the game may come too soon for Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw.", "description": "Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer accepts his side are no longer the force they were during the trophy-laden years under former manager Alex Ferguson but has backed the new generation of players to build a brighter future.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437008222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930VS", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
