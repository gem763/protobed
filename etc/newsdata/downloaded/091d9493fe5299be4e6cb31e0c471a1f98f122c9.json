In Scandinavia, it\u2019s a business practice that\u2019s quite common.\n\nIn recent years, mixed-gender sauna parties have become regular side events at festivals, conferences and company away-days for Scandinavia\u2019s thriving start-up and creative communities. The parties are designed to encourage both local and international attendees to talk shop in the informal setting of a wooden room or cabin fired up to 80C (176F).\n\n\u201cIt is a good ice breaker,\u201d argues Inna-Pirjetta Lahti, CEO of Ping Helsinki, a media and influencer agency that regularly organises sauna parties, typically at the beginning of business conferences. \u201cIn Finland, it is a sign of trust to share sauna moments... and we want to build up a base for open discussions in the rest of the conference or workshops.\u201d\n\nHowever, even in the Nordics, where the ritual of roasting in a sauna is baked into everyday life, there is an increasingly vocal backlash against incorporating the tradition into the start-up scene, at a time when it\u2019s lack of gender diversity is already in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cI really like saunas, but I don\u2019t want to go to one in that environment,\u201d argues Henna Ker\u00e4nen, 32, head of partnerships and digital marketing for Sting, a major incubator for start-ups based in Stockholm. She says she has turned down multiple invitations to sauna parties in the region. \u201cFor me as a woman, it doesn\u2019t feel right to be sat there half-naked... a sauna should be a private event, not job-related.\u201d", "description": "Saunas at tech and business events are causing a heated debate in the Nordics, where critics say the traditional Scandinavian habit is dampening efforts to improve diversity.", "authors": ["Maddy Savage"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/nq/p07rnqhk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
