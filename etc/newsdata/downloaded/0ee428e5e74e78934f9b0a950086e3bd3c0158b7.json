I\u2019m trash, you\u2019re trash. Your sweet aunt is trash. And so is your kid. Which is exactly why we don\u2019t deserve the nice concepts Suzuki has dreamed up for the upcoming Tokyo Motor Show. They are too good and pure for this world.\n\nSuzuki\u2019s theme this year is \u201cWaku Waku Switch for Everyone,\u201d which, as a press release explains, is Suzuki\u2019s take on cars, motorcycles, motorised wheelchairs and outboard motors that \u201cdelight customers.\u201d In particular, I\u2019d like to show you the cars you can expect to see at the Suzuki booth. (Also, I apologise in advance for the low-resolution images; Suzuki\u2019s press site only offered everything 400 pixels across.)\n\nThe first is this Waku Spo concept, which is a wonderful compact. Suzuki says it represents a \u201cshareable future \u2018small car\u2019\u201d that can \u201ctransform\u201d to fit each driver\u2019s needs. It\u2019s also a plug-in hybrid. The concept looks like a tribute to the Japanese compacts of the 1960s, such as the first Toyota Corolla and the Datsun 510.\n\nThen we have the awesome Hanare concept, which is fully autonomous and described as a \u201cmobile room.\u201d It\u2019s designed to shuttle its passengers around in a comfortable space that\u2019s similar to a \u201cdetached cottage\u201d (which is what \u201chanare\u201d apparently means in Japanese). It sounds like an incredibly cosy way to travel\u2014and it\u2019s a great looking van!\n\nThe Hustler concept is imagined as a \u201cmini crossover wagon.\u201d It looks to be an updated version of the Hustler wonderhatch from 2014. I\u2019ll never say no to one of these.\n\nAnother version of the Hustler concept is this rugged, outdoor one. It has fun paint and decals, as well as a roof rack for all your fun, rugged, outdoor toys like toboggans and caribou.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s this Every Combi concept, based on the Suzuki Every microvan. The concept was developed in collaboration with baby stuff brand Combi and gives people room for baby activities like changing diapers and breast-feeding while on the go or at outdoor events. It could even act as a shelter during natural disasters.\n\nLeaves the babies out of it, I say! I\u2019d like this little utilitarian microvan for myself.\n\nWill Suzuki ever come around to building these wonderful machines? Maybe, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get them here. We\u2019ve strayed too far from the light of God. So, so far.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the Tokyo area in the next month or so, definitely think about heading over to the show for a peek. Public days start on Oct. 24 and run through Nov. 4.", "description": "We are trash. I\u2019m trash, you\u2019re trash. Your sweet aunt is trash. And so is your kid.
