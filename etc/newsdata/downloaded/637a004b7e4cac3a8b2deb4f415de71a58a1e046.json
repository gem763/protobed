I don\u2019t play a ton of Pok\u00e9mon, but I do enjoy the universe and I love learning more about the creatures in it. So, Here\u2019s Another Pok\u00e9mon! It\u2019s Whimsicott!\n\nWhimsicott Details\n\nType: Grass/Fairy\n\nAverage Height: 2'04\"\n\nAverage Weight: 7kg.\n\nFirst Added In Generation V\n\nWho is the Ashton Kutcher of Pok\u00e9mon creatures? If I knew more about Kutcher I would probably have a better answer. But I only know two things about Ashton Kutcher, which is that he is an actor and that he hosted a show called Punk\u2019d where he pranked celebrities. Whimsicott also pranks people and so it\u2019s the Ashton Kutcher of Pok\u00e9mon. Glad we figured that out.\n\nWhimsicott is a small puff of hair and magic. According to Pok\u00e9dex entries, this cute Pok\u00e9mon can squeeze through cracks, no matter how narrow they might be. That allows the Whimsicott to enter people\u2019s homes and move around their furniture, which is something it actually does. Why? It\u2019s a prankster who loves to prank, that\u2019s why. It will also leave behind cotton balls sometimes, which doesn\u2019t seem like a great prank. I feel like I have cotton balls in my home, but I don\u2019t remember buying them. They just exist. So maybe Whimsicott has already pranked me?\n\nWe should all be thankful that Whimsicott is using its incredible powers to only move couches and leave behind the fluff. Having the ability to squeeze through any crack, regardless of its size, sounds like a useful skill. It could rob banks, sneak into military bases or break into corporate headquarters. It could steal secrets, money, nukes or more. Instead, it just pops into homes and leaves cotton balls.\n\nAccording to Bulbapedia, Whimsicott can also ride upon the winds. But nobody seems to really understand what that means. Maybe it just weighs very little and rides strong winds? Or maybe it can create powerful gusts of air? Seems the Pok\u00e9mon scientists need to spend a bit more time studying fluffy little Whimsicott.\n\nFavourite Fan Art\n\nFans are dangerous for this small little creature. Even a small fan like the one featured in this artwork could probably blow the fuzzy ball across a house.\n\nRandom Facts\n\nIn Japan, Whimsicott is called Elfuun which translates to Typhoon. That is a cooler name, but not sure how accurate it is...\n\nWhimsicott is part of the Unova horoscope and represents the month of April.\n\nIf the wind is too strong it can blow off the cotton on Whimsicott\u2019s head. Talk about a bad hair day! (Sorry. That was a bad joke. Please forgive me.)\n\nBest Comment From Last Week\n\nAlso, the farting Pok\u00e9mon? That\u2019s Skuntank: - MegaBlastoise\n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to sound so much like a fart and then I listened to it and well, yeah... that\u2019s a fart.", "description": "Every Pok\u00e9mon is interesting and worth talking about.
