The airline is offering pilots a pay increase worth 11.5 per cent over three years, which it describes as \u201ca deal already accepted by members of the Unite and GMB unions, which represent 90 per cent of British Airways\u2019 staff, a deal which we believe is fair.\u201d\n\nThe British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) does not think it is good enough, and is demanding captains and first officers should get, on average, an additional \u00a31,150 each year.\n\nThe union\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, says: \u201cIf the public understood the financial sacrifices that pilots made in BA\u2019s lean years, including pay cuts and loss of terms and conditions, they might recognise that the gap between us, of less than 0.5 per cent of BA\u2019s profit, is not unreasonable.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This means around 1,600 flights cancelled and 240,000 passengers affected.\n\nCancellations include all the departures on key long-haul routes such as Heathrow to New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Delhi, Johannesburg and Hong Kong, and Gatwick to Orlando and the Caribbean.\n\nAlmost all short-haul flights have been axed during the 48-hour spell.\n\nSome flights on Sunday 8, Wednesday 11 and into Thursday 12 have also been affected. For example, a Wednesday morning flight from Madrid to Heathrow has been grounded, while the cancellation of Wednesday\u2019s Sydney-Singapore-Heathrow service automatically means no Thursday arrival for flight BA16.\n\nWhat if I am booked on a British Airways flight on Monday or Tuesday and have not been told it is cancelled?\n\nIt is likely to operate as scheduled. BA CityFlyer services to and from London City airport are unaffected (except that they will be extremely busy with passengers from cancelled flights).\n\nSome other services, such as a single round-trip between Heathrow and Barcelona, and from Gatwick to New York JFK, will also be operating, using non-striking crew. Other key links, including Miami (important for cruise passengers), are being partially protected.\n\nHow much is it costing British Airways?\n\nThe lost revenue over the two days is around \u00a375m-\u00a380m. Additional costs, from hotel rooms to parking charges for planes at long-haul destinations, are likely to push the bill to about \u00a3100m.\n\nWhat options and entitlements are there for people whose flights are cancelled?\n\nAffected passengers were contacted two weeks ago to be told about the cancellations (along with thousands who were erroneously informed their flights were grounded).\n\nThe European air passengers\u2019 rights rules provide for three choices for travellers whose flight are cancelled:\n\n1. They can cancel for a full refund (covering both legs if a return has been booked). This may suit some passengers whose plans have changed, or who have found a cheaper alternative route.\n\n2. They can be rebooked either on the same airline or, if no flight is available on the first day, on another flight on a different airline. This is the option that is likely to suit most passengers, with nothing more than mild inconvenience.\n\nWhile BA has rebooked tens of thousands of travellers on dozens of other airlines, it has declined to buy seats on easyJet \u2013 which, for many passengers at Gatwick, would be the obvious and appropriate choice.\n\n3. They can travel on a different date. If appropriate \u2013 eg someone on holiday in Istanbul extending their trip by two days to await a BA flight home \u2013 the airline must pay for accommodation and meals during the wait.\n\nIs there likely to be more disruption on the day?\n\nBritish Airways has cancelled so many flights that I imagine it is confident that the few that remain will operate as planned. But as with aviation in any circumstances, disruption from many quarters is always a possibility.\n\nMy flight on Wednesday 11 September is running, but might I lose my seat to someone stranded on the previous two days?\n\nNo, passengers on cancelled flights go to the back of the queue. Travellers already booked on flights that are operating always take priority.\n\nCould the strike be called off?\n\nIn theory, and indeed in 1997 a planned two-day cabin crew strike was cancelled at the very last moment.\n\nOn Thursday BA\u2019s pilots offered to return to work if discussions could begin on a new set of proposals. British Airways rejected the approach, saying it would talk without preconditions, and pointing out that the damage has largely been done with tens of thousands of passengers making alternative arrangements.\n\nIs there enough room for all the grounded planes?\n\nThere will be a squeeze at both Heathrow and Gatwick. It is possible that some empty planes will be \u201cpositioned\u201d (ferried) to BA\u2019s long-haul maintenance base at Cardiff.\n\nLong-haul aircraft are being kept on the ground at foreign airports, too.\n\nWhat is the effect on other airlines?\n\nPositive. Rival carriers are pickling up business from BA. In addition, operations will be much smoother on Monday and Tuesday. With at least half the flights at Heathrow being cancelled, and one-fifth of those at Gatwick also grounded, the local air-traffic congestion will be dramatically eased.\n\nWhen is the next strike, and when will affected passengers be told about their options?\n\nA 24-hour stoppage is scheduled for Friday 27 September and could affect flights between Thursday 26 and Sunday 29 September.\n\nNormally after an initial strike, things would go quiet for a few days while the parties re-engaged. But I calculate that British Airways will need to send out cancellation notices on Wednesday 12 September in order to avoid the obligation to pay compensation.", "description": "Around 1,600 British Airways flights have been cancelled between late on Sunday 8 September and early on Thursday 12 September.
