Conkers are the seeds of the horse chestnut tree. They are hung on a piece of string, secured by one or two knots. Players take turns to swing a conker at their opponent's, which is held still. The winner is the player whose conker succeeds in breaking the other's. The hardest conker typically wins. Conkers can be artificially hardened with age, vinegar, baking or nail varnish \u2014 if you want to cheat, that is. The shape of the hole drilled in the conker can impact its strength. A conker is prepared for battle\n\n'It is alarming that over half of Europe\u2019s endemic tree species are now threatened with extinction,' said IUCN Red List Unit head Craig Hilton-Taylor.\n\n'Trees are essential for life on earth, and European trees in all their diversity are a source of food and shelter for countless animal species such as birds and squirrels.'\n\nThey also play a key economic role in Europe, Mr Hilton-Taylor said.\n\n'From the EU to regional assemblies and the conservation community, we all need to work together to ensure their survival.'\n\nThe IUCN has now classified horse chestnuts are being 'vulnerable' to extinction in Europe, following declines caused by the leaf-miner moth, Cameraria ohridella.\n\n'Vulnerable' is the Red List's highest level of threat beneath endangered and critically endangered.\n\nThe leaf-miner moth is an invasive species whose caterpillars feed inside horse chestnut tree leaves, damaging them.\n\nThe pest originated in the isolated mountains of the Balkans, before spreading throughout Europe.\n\nHorse chestnuts are imperilled by the leaf-miner moth that eats the foliage from these iconic trees whose seeds, conkers, have been made into toys for generations\n\nThe leaf-miner moth, pictured, is an invasive species whose caterpillars feed inside horse chestnut tree leaves, damaging them. The pest originated in the isolated mountains of the Balkans, before spreading throughout Europe\n\nWhile horse chestnut trees can now be found across Europe, they were originally native only to Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia.\n\nNational-scale studies have found that conker trees are endangered in both Bulgaria and Greece, and critically endangered in Albania.\n\nThe leaf-miner moth's destructive activities have added to other pressures provided by forest fires, logging and tourism.\n\nThe evaluation of the health of different trees is part of an effort by IUCN experts to focus on overlooked species for the European Red List.\n\nThe finding comes from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, which identifies at risk species that need conservation action. Pictured, horse chestnut seeds\n\nThe European Red List of trees, which incorporates all 454 species of native tree, found more than two-fifths are under threat of becoming extinct. Furthermore, 58 per cent of species that are only found in Europe are under threat. Pictured, horse chestnut leaves damaged by moths\n\nAmong the UK trees studied, scientists found that three related deciduous species \u2014 the Cheddar, Twin Cliffs and Gough's Rock whitebeam \u2014 are critically endangered.\n\nThese three species were only discovered in Cheddar Gorge, in Somerset, around 10 years ago.\n\nAll belong to the genus 'Sorbus', a grouping which is at particular risk in Europe, with three-quarters of species considered under threat.\n\nResearchers also found that three species of whitebeam only recently discovered in Somerset are now critically endangered. Pictured, conkers from a horse chestnut tree\n\nResearchers also found that more than a fifth of land molluscs, like snails, are under threat, as are the bryophytes \u2014 plants including hornworts, liverworts and mosses.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly a half of all shrub species are also being threatened.\n\nThe primary threats to these species are the destruction of Europe\u2019s wild areas, along with agriculture, the impact of invasive species and climate change.", "description": "Horse chestnuts in Europe are imperilled by the leaf-miner moth that eats the foliage from\u00a0these iconic trees whose seeds, conkers, have been made into toys for generations.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/13/19009684-0-image-a-29_1569587680301.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
