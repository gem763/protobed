The worst-hit area in the state was Ocracoke Island, with water levels some 13 inches higher than the levels wrought by a storm in 1944, which had long been considered the worst. Officials are going door to door to check on residents.\n\nDorian also brought tropical storm-force winds to southeastern Massachusetts and Nantucket Island and Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Saturday morning, according to an advisory from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.\n\nHurricane Dorian is expected to make landfall in Canada\u2019s Nova Scotia province on Saturday night and has regained its Category 2 strength, with winds of up to 100mph (150 kph). It will leave up to 7 inches of rain before pushing further east as a weakened post-tropical storm by Sunday, the National Hurricane Centre said. Forecasters say the storm is likely to uproot trees and bring the possibility of flash flooding, as well as likely power outages.\n\nThe Bahamas had suffered \u201ca tremendous loss of life,\u201d the country\u2019s health minister, Duane Sands, said.\n\nThe medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau said two refrigerated, 40-foot trucks would be needed to hold the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of bodies likely to be found.\n\nMore than 1,100 Bahamians arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday, after being evacuated by a cruise ship from their hurricane-battered islands.\n\nThe Grand Celebration vessel returned to its home port after setting sail Thursday for Freeport, Grand Bahama, to deliver more than 112 tons of supplies and ferry dozens of health workers and emergency crews.\n\nThe destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian is seen from the air, in Marsh Harbor, Abaco Island, Bahamas (AP/Gonzalo Gaudenzi) More\n\nAn array of organisations, countries and companies, including the United Nations, the US government, the British Royal Navy, American Airlines and Royal Caribbean, have mobilised to send in food, water, generators, roof tarps, flashlights and other supplies.\n\nDonald Trump said on Saturday that the death toll in the Bahamas would have been significantly higher without his help.\n\nIn a tweet, the US president thanked Bahamian prime minister Hubert Minnis for his \"very gracious and kind words\" that \"without the help of the United States and me, their would have been many more casualties\".\n\nHe then went on to thank FEMA, the US Coast Guard, and the \"brave\" people on the Bahamas.\n\nThe UN estimated 70,000 people were in \u201cimmediate need of life-saving assistance\u201d such as food, water and shelter.\n\nThe UN World Food Programme was airlifting storage units, generators, prefab offices, and satellite equipment as well as eight metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6082822785001", "description": "The official death toll from Hurricane Dorian has risen to 43 and is likely to keep rising amid fears that a \u201dstaggering\u201d number of people have died in the storm-ravaged Bahamas.The country's leaders believe hundreds and perhaps thousands of people are missing in the archipelago nation after Dorian", "authors": ["Samuel Osborne", "Dave Maclean"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OwgjouPxcfwiDY1s8HTuag--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b03549cc42d456266ff058706e634f4f", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
