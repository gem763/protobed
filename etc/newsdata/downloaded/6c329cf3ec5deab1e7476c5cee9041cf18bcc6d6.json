The 34-year-old made the unnerving confession to author Cherlyn Cadle in letters and interviews for her explosive upcoming book, Letters from Christopher\n\nHe wrote: 'I had a dream Cece was dancing next to the chair in my cell. When she was dancing, all of my folders on the chair started moving... Then I woke up. I'm hoping she comes back! I hope everyone comes to visit me'. Pictured: Watts with daughter Cece (left) and Bella (right)\n\nCadle said that Watts has spoken about these visits with her. Watts has told Cadle that he will not submit to psychiatric testing in prison and does not believe he is mentally ill\n\nCadle said that he has spoken about these visits - once by Celeste and once by Shanann through a phone conversation.\n\nWatts has told Cadle that he will not submit to psychiatric testing in prison and does not believe he is mentally ill.\n\n'Christopher and his mother have both told me he has never been tested for mental illness.'\n\nWatts confessed his deepest feelings to Cadle, a 65-year-old grandmother from Illinois, who wrote him a letter earlier this year asking if he would take part in a book to put to rest any lingering questions about the case.\n\nTo her great surprise, he agreed. The book, Letters From Christopher, is on pre-order and will be published October 7.\n\nCadle has pressed Watts for his motives in committing such horrific violence and his answers are conflicting at best.\n\nAlong with suggesting that he was under the 'spell' of his mistress Nichol Kessinger, who he said he wouldn't have killed his family for if he never met her, Watts also introduced the idea that he may have been possessed by demons or evil spirits.\n\nWatts has confessed his deepest feelings to Cadle, a 65-year-old grandmother. He agreed to let her use his letters for her upcoming book Letters From Christopher\n\n'Christopher has said that he felt 'darkness' on him for weeks before the murders and it put thoughts into his head,' Cadle said.\n\n'Christopher told me that he had never thought of demonic things before or felt there was a demon possession.\n\n'He has also talked about how he felt God gave him three chances to pull away from Nikki but he did not listen to any of those voices.'\n\nHe also talks at length in his letters about the visits he gets from his daughters in jail cell.\n\nIn an exclusive letter from April 23, released to DailyMailTV, Watts wrote: 'I don't know if this was a spiritual visit, but I had a dream Cece was dancing next to the chair in my cell.\n\n'When she was dancing, all of my folders on the chair started moving and I thought she was in trouble, so I said Watch out, get away, watch out! Then I woke up. I'm hoping she comes back! I hope everyone comes to visit me.'\n\nHe described how he had smothered his daughters with pillows in their beds, only to have them wake up. He then drove them with their dead mother to the oil field where he worked.\n\n'I dumped Shanann on the ground, then I walked back to the truck and with the blanket that Celeste was holding, I put it over her head and smothered her.'\n\nWatts squeezed Celeste's body through an eight-inch hatch in one of the oil tankers.\n\n'I couldn't believe how easily it was to just let her drop through the hole and let her go. I heard the splash as she hit the oil.'\n\nAs part of her research, Cadle spent 15 hours meeting face-to-face with Watts in prison, had phone calls three times a week and exchanged dozens of letters. Cadle has pressed Watts for his motives in committing such horrific violence and his answers are conflicting at best\n\nFollowing the shocking letter about his daughters' ordeal, Cadle said she was left with many questions, which Watts answered in later conversations. Pictured: One of the letter envelopes sent from Watts to Cadle\n\nHe then relived for Cadle, in appalling detail, how he killed his eldest daughter Bella after she had watched him murder and dispose of her sister. He spoke of his surprise that: 'Little quiet Bella had a will to live.'\n\n'Out of all three, Bella is the only one that put up a fight. I will hear her soft little voice for the rest of my life, saying, 'Daddy, NO!!! She knew what I was doing to her. She may not have understood death, but she knew I was killing her.\n\nThe writer says that Watts is acutely aware of his fame and notoriety and is keen to present himself as a 'good guy'.\n\nCadle said: 'He feels famous. He's very careful, he wants people to think good of him.\n\n'It's very hard for him to be called a monster or to be called a murderer. He doesn't like that. I said, But Christopher you are a murderer which makes you a monster for what you did.\n\n'But he does not agree with that. He's not a monster, he says, and he says he's not necessarily a murderer. Very delusional, I believe, even though he'll say, yes I killed my family.'\n\n'One thing that struck my husband when we visited him the last time was he said something like, ''You know, what I did to Shanann'' - just casual and nonchalant.\n\n'It's very important [for him] to keep up this image that he is a good guy. That he's always been just a good guy.'\n\nAlong with maintaining his 'good guy' image, Watts appears to believe that if he doesn't step out of line in prison that one day he may be eligible to leave.\n\nCadle said: 'He read that in most prisons, and in most states, if an inmate has been on good behavior, after about 25 years they'll be released. Maybe there's cases where that has happened.\n\nThe writer says that Watts is acutely aware of his fame and notoriety and is keen to present himself as a 'good guy'. Cadle said: 'He feels famous. He's very careful, he wants people to think good of him.' She also revealed Watts hopes to get released from prison someday\n\n'Christopher is very determined to follow all the rules in prison because I think he believes that will be his path to getting out of prison someday.'\n\nIn a letter Watts sent Cadle, he wrote: 'Do I feel like I should be incarcerated? For the act I committed, I most definitely thinks so. Do I imagine myself ever doing anything like this or be a danger to society? I most definitely think NOT!\n\n'If I were to ever be released, I know I would go straight to a ministry and start going to jails/prisons and help inmates.\n\n'If God led me to be ordained, I would go that route as well; possibly even be a Chaplain. Maybe the laws will change one day.\n\n'My attorney team could see I was different and knew that this was a one-time occurrence for me. They told me that in Europe, the law is I would serve 20 years or so for homicide, and in California, after 25 years of imprisonment, on a life sentence you can be released if you've had good behavior.\n\n'So, there's hope for everyone to live outside prison walls. I know physically I'm behind these walls, but my spirit is FREE with Christ!'\n\nCadle is clear that her book is not an attempt to help Watts get an appeal nor, she says, does it appear that he wants one.", "description": "Chris Watts told author Cherlyn Cadle he believes he was visited in prison by his dead family member while serving 5 life sentences for murdering them last August in Fredrick, Colorado.", "authors": ["Louise Boyle In Chicago", "Illinois For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/14/19298254-0-image-a-37_1570196086123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
