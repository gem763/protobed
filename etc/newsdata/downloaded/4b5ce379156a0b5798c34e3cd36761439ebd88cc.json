Worth more than 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), the project was jointly launched by Cuba-headquartered medical group BioCubaFarma and Guangxi Fukang Medical Investment and Management Co Ltd.\n\nThrough the cooperation, the two sides will jointly produce nine world-class medicines in the pilot zone, to be used in the treatment of cardio-cerebral vascular disease, skin cancer, brain cancer and chronic hepatitis B, among others.\n\n\"We want to build a cooperative platform to increase the public's overall health. The Fangchenggang pilot zone, which interconnects with ASEAN countries by land and sea, offers us good opportunities. We are looking to boost cooperation and contributions,\" said Ricardo De La C. Silva Rodriguez, general manager of the Beijing representative office of BioCubaFarma.\n\nNoting that good health for everyone is the common aspiration of mankind and a key part of the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, Xi said advancing the global health cause is also important in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\n\"The medical pilot zone will create unprecedented opportunities for regional medical cooperation. All sides present will proactively participate in the establishment of the pilot zone, strive to eliminate policy, technology and trade barriers in medical cooperation, and share the accomplishments of mutually beneficial cooperation,\" the SCO said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the statement, all parties are devoted to facilitating policies, which will allow new technologies and new products that conform to international standards to enter the pilot zone, to be produced, applied and transported, as well as obtain preferential financial, customs, taxation and personnel policies. The participants are also ready to offer assistance to this initiative, and expect that the pilot zone can provide a new platform for medical innovation and cooperation in the region.\n\nThe pilot zone's location in Guangxi also facilitates support from ASEAN member states, as the region interconnects China with ASEAN.", "description": "South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region is hoping to foster international exchanges and cooperation in the healthcare sector by building a medical pilot zone in the city of Fangchenggang.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d3ebaa310cf3e97a03a2a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
