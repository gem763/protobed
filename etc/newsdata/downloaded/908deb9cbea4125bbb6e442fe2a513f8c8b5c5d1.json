He will be joined by Deacon Jack Sullivan, who has attributed his recovery from a serious spinal condition to Newman\n\nThe Cardinal had left a 'lasting legacy' as an educator, and the Catholic community owed 'an incalculable debt to his tireless work'.\n\nIn the age when he lived, he was a figure who stood 'for the life of the spirit against forces' seeking to lower human dignity - and guided the church back to its Catholic roots.\n\nWhile at the same time he was open to learning from Anglican traditions such as the role of the laity.\n\nBefore Cardinal Newman, John Ogilvie was the last Briton to become a saint\n\nThe Prince added how people find the Cardinal a 'powerful ally' who 'championed the individual conscience against an overwhelming relativism' - whose book The Idea of a University is still 'defining' today.\n\nHe 'could advocate without accusation, could disagree without disrespect' and 'could see differences as places of encounter rather than exclusion'.\n\nCharles told L'Osservatore Romano: 'And perhaps most relevantly of all at this time, when we have witnessed too many grievous assaults by the forces of intolerance on communities and individuals, including many Catholics, because of their beliefs, [Newman] is a figure who stood for his convictions despite the disadvantages of belonging to a religion whose adherents were denied full participation in public life.\n\n'Through the whole process of Catholic emancipation and the restoration of the Catholic Church hierarchy, he was the leader his people, his church and his times needed.'\n\nCardinal Newman was a Church of England priest before converting to Catholicism in 1845 and is seen as a bridging figure between Anglicanism and Catholicism.\n\nWhen he died in 1890, thousands took to the streets for his funeral procession.\n\nThe most recently declared British saint, in 1976, was John Ogilvie, a Scottish martyr who died in 1615.", "description": "Cardinal John Henry Newman is to be canonised at the Vatican in Rome tomorrow.
