Bush and Barack Obama, of scientific assessments being either watered down or language softened. He pointed to past research on lead in school lunchboxes and on the impact of fracking on drinking water.\n\nBut the scientists said that under President Donald Trump, political interference had reached a new level.\n\nAs Clement highlighted, a study into the rules needed to protect the health and safety of offshore oil rig workers was canceled right before a set of measures to protect the workers was rolled-back. Similarly, a study into the health impacts of surface coal mining was canceled right before making moves to support the coal industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther studies have been delayed, such as one on the health impacts of PFAS chemicals in drinking water for fear of a \u201cpublic relations nightmare,\u201d while agencies have seen some scientists self-censor their work out of fear, such as removing the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from reports.\n\n\u201cThe American people lose when we end up with manipulated, suppressed, or distorted information,\u201d Halpern said. After all, as multiple experts testified, it\u2019s taxpayer money that funds government scientists \u2014 the public paid for that research and deserves to see it.\n\nThe result is \u201cdirtier air, dirtier water,\u201d added Clement, who resigned from his post at the Interior in July 2017 after being reassigned to \u201can unrelated job\u201d by former Secretary Ryan Zinke. Clement saw the move as an attempt to push him out for speaking out about the impacts of climate change on Alaskan native communities.\n\nThe hearing on Wednesday follows the release of a bill by committee member Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), called the Scientific Integrity Act, earlier this year. The bill, which has the support of nearly 200 House members, is intended to insulate \u201cpublic scientific research and reports from the distorting influence of political and special interests\u201d according to Tonko.\n\nWhile Tonko reminded everyone at the hearing that he began working on the bill in 2016 under the Obama administration, he added, \u201cThe abuses directed by this President [Trump] and his top officials have brought a new urgency to the issue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile more than 20 federal agencies have some type of scientific integrity policy, not all of these policies are successfully or fully implemented. As an April report by the Government Accountability Office found, of the nine agencies reviewed, seven have \u201cspecific, documented procedures\u201d for identifying and addressing alleged violations. The report also made 10 recommendations to agencies for addressing the need to better educate staff on the issue, provide greater oversight, and develop procedures to identify and address potential violations.\n\nLast year, the EPA announced it would begin an investigation to see whether its scientific integrity policy was being properly implemented. This came after a survey was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which showed that government scientists across 16 agencies and departments had concerns with the degree of political influence over their work.\n\nSpecifically, the annual survey for 2018 showed that a third of the nearly 449 EPA respondents worried about the \u201cinfluence\u201d of political appointees or White House officials over \u201cscience-based\u201d decisions. Less than 30% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \u201cMy agency adheres to its scientific integrity policy.\u201d\n\nIn addition, roughly a third of EPA respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they had either been asked directly to omit or independently decided to avoid the use of the term \u201cclimate change\u201d in their work.\n\nThere is technically nothing stopping an agency from dismantling its scientific integrity policy, said Halpern. That\u2019s why a bill such as the one proposed by Tonko would go a long way to buttress, or add \u201cstatutory heft,\u201d to agency policies as Clement described.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClement called the Scientific Integrity Act a good first step, but noted that in order to be truly effective, broader ethics and integrity standards were needed across agencies.\n\nIndeed, many of the individuals overseeing agencies come from the industry they are now responsible for regulating. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Interior (DOI) have faced numerous ethics scandals regarding potential conflicts of interest and alleged industry influence.\n\nIn March, for instance, The New York Times revealed documents showing DOI Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to block a study showing pesticides might threaten the existence of 1,200 endangered species; Bernhardt has a history of lobbying against the Endangered Species Act.\n\nBut due to the \u201chostile leadership situation,\u201d there are many scientists who are simply keeping their heads down and staying quiet about issues surrounding scientific integrity under the current administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love if every policymaker thought of science as the North Star,\u201d said Clement, \u201cbut I hope it\u2019s part of the constellation.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-475548644.jpg?w=1024&h=637&crop=1"}
