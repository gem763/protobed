Even investors who don\u2019t trade currencies should pay attention to the strength of the U.S. dollar, according to a note out Monday. That\u2019s because while the strong dollar has a lot of effects, its cause, at least right now, is that investors around the world are skittish.\n\nNormally when the greenback gets this strong, something gives, and other currencies start to strengthen, observed Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, it means something is very different this time around. And \u2018different\u2019 in this case probably doesn\u2019t mean \u2018good\u2019 when it comes to investor risk appetites,\u201d he said.\n\nThe currency measure Colas prefers is called the Trade Weighted U.S. Dollar Index: Broad, Goods, and it\u2019s hovering around all-time highs \u2014 although data only goes back to the mid-1990s. The index tracks how well America\u2019s currency is performing against currencies for other countries with whom the U.S. has a trading relationship.\n\nThe biggest contributors to the index are in the graphic above. And for some context, here\u2019s a chart showing the index\u2019s level over its full history:\n\nThe question of what, exactly, it means for a currency to \u201cperform against\u201d others is important, and anyone who pays attention to President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter tirades about the dollar has a sense of both its significance and its ambiguity.\n\nFact check: true. It does make it harder for American companies that export to remain profitable when the currency is higher. But focusing only on manufacturers misses a lot of the bigger context, as well as why things are so complicated right now for the dollar.\n\n\u201cSuper-cap tech stocks \u2014 important market leaders for U.S. equity markets \u2014 have the greatest financial exposure to non-dollar revenues of any S&P group,\u201d Colas noted. \u201cAt 57% non-domestic revenues, Tech companies face a strong currency headwind just now.\u201d Other sectors that have a higher-than-average exposure to the dollar include materials, consumer staples and energy.\n\nRead: This ETF offers a little yield in a falling-rate world\n\nWhere else does a strong dollar create potential headaches? The Federal Reserve.\n\nThat\u2019s because when interest rates are low elsewhere in the world, investors try to find places to get a little yield. Of course, when more investors are chasing U.S. bonds, that drives the price up \u2014 and returns down. Depending on what kind of policy the central bank is trying to achieve, that can be a headwind or a tailwind. But it\u2019s a mistake to assume that the Fed can make monetary policy in a vacuum.\n\nAs Colas notes, it\u2019s not just the trade war, and the corresponding 6% hit to the yuan, that\u2019s keeping the dollar index so high. The euro, which has the biggest position in the index, \u201cis 11% lower from its March 2018 high-water mark, back when the German 10-year bund was yielded +0.6% instead of its current -0.4%.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s how to play the trade war with ETFs\n\nWhy would investors chase a yield of -0.4% when they could pick up 1.7% on the U.S. 10-year bond TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% ?\n\nThere\u2019s a final component of what\u2019s making the dollar so strong, and it\u2019s the one that serves as a signal for how markets may behave over the coming months. As MarketWatch\u2019s Bill Watts explained in late September, the U.S. dollar is the world\u2019s safe haven \u2014 even when the U.S. is the one making global markets so uncertain, in part, because of its dominance in the global payments system.\n\nOne of the reasons European interest rates are so low, in other words, is that the U.S.-China trade war isn\u2019t just confined to those two countries.\n\n\u201cRisk aversion, negative European/Japanese interest rates, and trade war blowback are the trifecta of reasons the dollar sits at multidecade highs,\u201d Colas concluded. \u201cIf we\u2019re moving from that story line to something more positive in 2020, then the dollar should begin to weaken soon. And if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s an important sign as well.\u201d\n\nSee: Central bankers now know: hang together or most assuredly hang separately", "description": "The strength of the U.S. dollar doesn\u2019t help U.S. companies \u2014 but it\u2019s the relatively perkier yields on U.S. government bonds that\u2019s attracting more capital...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT236_dollar_ZG_20191014101511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
