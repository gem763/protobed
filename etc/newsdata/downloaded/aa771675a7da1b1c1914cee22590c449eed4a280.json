And it\u2019s not because the \u201cfraternity of presidents\u201d requires O to maintain the same sort of respectful silence towards his successor as George W. Bush maintained for Obama himself. Trump obviously isn\u2019t and won\u2019t be part of that fraternity; criticism of Obama remains a staple of his own rhetoric.\n\nO keeps his mouth shut because he understands he\u2019s a perfect foil for the president. Republicans dislike him deeply and think most of his policies were stupid. The surest way to get GOPers who are troubled by the Ukraine business to rally around Trump would be for Obama to blast him over it. Likewise, the surest way to get Republicans to rethink their discomfort about abandoning the Kurds would be for O to slam Trump for ordering it \u2014 especially given how pitiful Obama\u2019s own Syria judgment often was. There was never a good option on whether to intervene or not but O somehow made a bad situation worse, humiliating himself by refusing to enforce his own stated \u201cred line\u201d against the use of WMDs by Assad and then half-assing an attempt to arm Syrian rebels. By the end of his presidency his most prominent diplomatic initiative was to reach out to the Shiite terrorist state sponsoring Assad for a nuclear deal. His Syria policy was so bad that Trump\u2019s decision to bomb a Syria airfield early in his presidency after Assad used poison gas again is the only one I can think that actually earned him some grudging favorable comparisons to O in the media even among Obama alumni (mostly anonymously).\n\nAgain, Obama grasps all of this and has kept his mouth shut, depriving Trump of an easy way to rally Republicans around him. Alas for Dems, not everyone who worked for him is as shrewd as he is:\n\nTONIGHT: Former National Security Advisor @AmbassadorRice tells us what she really thinks about Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds in northern Syria. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/nLeT2TPOMK \u2014 The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) October 8, 2019\n\nShow of hands: Who feels *worse* about Trump\u2019s judgment on Syria now that the Obama White House\u2019s foreign policy brain trust has condemned it?\n\nAnyone?\n\nIf you want a reason to worry about the decision to evacuate northern Syria (and there are many), read this account of how haphazardly it appears to have been made. No one in the field, starting with the Kurds, had any notice that the American shield protecting them from a Turkish onslaught was about to disappear.\n\nAccording to multiple current and former U.S. officials, the White House\u2019s announcement of the decision late Sunday night blindsided not just America\u2019s Kurdish partners in the fight against the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, in Syria, but almost everyone \u2014 senior officials at the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House, lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East\u2026 Sunday\u2019s phone call between Trump and Erdogan was held to try to ease the Turkish leader\u2019s fury that he didn\u2019t get a one-on-one meeting with Trump last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, according to three current and former officials. Erdogan made it known to U.S. officials that he was not happy his only interaction with Trump during the gathering of world leaders in New York was at a large reception, according to the officials\u2026 But Sunday\u2019s phone call didn\u2019t go as expected, officials said. Erdogan was adamant about Turkey going into Syria, officials said. Even Trump\u2019s offer of a White House visit wasn\u2019t enough to deter him. Trump told Erdogan that a moderate incursion, such as clearing out a safe zone, would be acceptable, officials said. But he said a large invasion that leads to major combat operations would be unacceptable, officials said.\n\nReportedly Trump threatened on the call to withdraw the American troops who are serving as a buffer between Turkey and the Kurds if Turkey went ahead and launched a major military push instead of something more limited. Erdogan called his bluff. Go ahead and withdraw. I\u2019ll blow them to bits. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, although naturally Trump is spinning it as some sort of methodical attempt on his part to keep his promise about bringing American troops home.\n\nAnd somehow, Erdogan is getting his White House visit anyway.\n\nMichael Weiss peers into the not-very-distant future and sees a winner emerging from the Turkish/Kurdish conflagration:\n\nFor years, ISIS has watched as America\u2019s reliance on the YPG/PKK has enervated the second-largest army in NATO. It has cleverly preyed upon this tension by waging terror attacks in Turkey it declined to claim credit for, knowing full well that Erdogan and his government might blame them on the PKK, which it did on more than one occasion. Turkey, meanwhile, had maintained a see-no-evil policy (or worse) with respect to ISIS as its sovereign territory became a staging ground for exported jihad, not to mention a fallback base of operations for the many agents of ISIS\u2019s Amniyat, or intelligence service, who were dispatched out of Syria and into Western Europe. In other words, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (yes, he\u2019s still alive) exploited the Kurdish Question before and will exploit again now that all-out war between Turkey and Syria\u2019s Kurds is a foregone conclusion.\n\nAmerica will probably be lighting military and political fires that help ISIS spread, then putting them out, then lighting them again for the indefinite future as political currents in the Middle East shift. Maybe Rice will catch on in the next Democratic administration and show us amateurs what to do.", "description": "C'mon.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/s-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
