Kent said he told the Obama administration in 2016 that they should not hold an event with Burisma because of the company\u2019s extensive corruption in Ukraine.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who spoke to reporters after witnessing Kent\u2019s deposition, failed to mention the State official\u2019s warnings about Burisma.\n\nIt appears that the warning came before or during Hunter\u2019s tenure as the board member of Burisma, which began in 2014.\n\nIn the fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump urged his counterpart to investigate corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAs vice president, Biden pushed Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who was investigating the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nHunter had been serving on the board of Burisma at the time, prompting allegations of corruption.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegation that Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens during the July 25 call triggered the impeachment probe. Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegations.\n\nKent also testified that he was ordered by a superior to \u201clay low\u201d when he raised concerns about the activities in Ukraine of Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Connolly told reporters, according to NBC News.\n\nGiuliani traveled to Ukraine on behalf of Trump to lobby the government to investigate the corruption allegations against the Bidens.\n\nTrump\u2019s private lawyer has maintained that he did nothing wrong in Ukraine. Combatting corruption in Ukraine is a component of U.S. policy.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who witnessed Kent\u2019s deposition along with Connolly, blasted the House Democrat for leaking details of the testimony after they were told not to discuss it.\n\n\u201cHe was barely there, and he walks out and starts telling the public of what substantively happened behind closed doors,\u201d Zeldin, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, declared, referring to Connolly, the Washington Post reported. \u201cThis is a disgusting strategy that has been on display.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat-led Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are pursuing the impeachment investigation. Connolly is a member of two of the panels.\n\nThe congressman said Kent testified that he was sidelined by White House chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who told him to leave Ukraine policy in the hands of three other Trump administration officials \u2014 Energy Secretary Rick Perry, European Amb. Gordon Sondland, and special envoy Kurt Volker who has resigned.\n\nConnolly said the trio called themselves the \u201cthree amigos\u201d and pushed other State Department officials out of the way.\n\nThe Democrat congressman reportedly proclaimed:\n\nHere is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries, one of which is Ukraine, who found himself outside of a parallel process that he felt was undermining 28 years of U.S. policy and promoting the rule of law in Ukraine. And that was wrong. He used that word, \u2018wrong.'\u201d\n\nHouse Democrat leaders have refused to make the transcripts of the testimony by impeachment probe witnesses public, prompting criticism from Republicans. GOP lawmakers have accused Democrats of cherry-picking and mischaracterizing evidence. Republicans have asserted that the Democrats are leaking bits and pieces of testimony to fuel their impeachment agenda.\n\nEchoing the White House position, several Trump administration officials and Giuliani have opted not to cooperate with the impeachment probe, dismissing it as illegitimate.", "description": "Kent told lawmakers he warned the Obama administration the Ukrainian company that employed then-Vice President Joe Biden's son was corrupt.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Joe-and-Hunter-Biden-with-Obama-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
