In the nine years prior to that execution all death sentences were commuted, and usually in such cases the sentences were reduced to life imprisonment.", "description": "Myanmarese on death row for British tourist murders ask Thai king for clemency", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N0J5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
