In fact, I think the contrary is true,\" Bolton, a hardliner towards North Korea and Iran, said at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nUnder current circumstances, Bolton said, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily\".\n\nIt was Bolton's first speech since he was forced out of his post three weeks ago.\n\nIn firing Bolton, Trump said he \"disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions\". Trump has met Kim to negotiate North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.\n\nBolton, Trump's third NSA, had pressed the president not to let up pressure on North Korea despite diplomatic efforts.\n\n180323080234524\n\nIn his speech to the CSIS, Bolton issued a litany of warnings about how Washington was handling the North Korea threat, from sanctions not being enforced effectively and US complacency about Pyongyang's missile testing to suspension of \"war games\" with South Korea.\n\n\"I think right now we are in a classic standoff with North Korea,\" Bolton said. \"They want a piece of something that we should not be prepared to give them.\"\n\nBolton, a chief architect of Trump's strident stance against Iran, had also argued against Trump's suggestions of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership and advocated a tougher approach on Russia and, more recently, Afghanistan.\n\n\"Time works against those who oppose nuclear proliferation and a relaxed attitude to time is a benefit to the likes of North Korea and Iran,\" he said.", "description": "In first speech since he was forced out, John Bolton says North Korea has no intention to give up nuclear weapons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/12/bc521c463ae245919664df97794ac43a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
