Who helps them with that situation into the pathway that will deliver them into the system to create a good clinical outcome?\n\n\"We noted that when we looked at the market people were confused about the system. This program is to help guide the person through the mental health system.\"\n\nYounger workers hardest hit\n\nEmployees are experiencing mental health challenges, both with and without a formal diagnosis, that affect their wellbeing at work. Younger workers suffered the most, with the study showing that over two-thirds of workers aged 18-25 worry about their mental health.\n\nRoughly 86 per cent of Australians think more should be done in their workplace to promote better mental health, and Australian workers are more likely to have encountered multiple mental health episodes than in the US or Canada, the study found.\n\nMr Vickers said Mental Health Navigator can help in getting people the right level of care and expertise, which is supported by a broader range of services with the company providing expert opinions for all physical conditions.\n\nWhile shares in $US4.7 billion ($7 billion) Teladoc have rocketed high this year, in recent weeks the stock has been under pressure as online giant Amazon launched its own version of a virtual healthcare service, Amazon Care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeladoc, which offers online doctor visits, had 26.8 million paid members in the quarter ended June 30 and clocked 908,000 virtual visits. Most of its members are enrolled by their insurers and health plans.\n\nAmazon chief executive Jeff Bezos has recently started a virtual healthcare service for its workers in the Seattle area. Reed Saxon\n\nMr Vickers downplayed Amazon's entry to the sector, saying he was \"not overly concerned\".\n\n\u201cWhen someone the size of Amazon gets into the market, people take notice,\" he said.\n\n\"But we are confident in the way in which we approach virtual care and have been doing it many years, and doing it globally for many years. It\u2019s not an area in which you jump into and have success.\"\n\nMr Vickers said Best Doctors is looking to expand its Australian offering in 2020 to include the full range of services from GPs to mental health support, the latter of which is a key focus.\n\nIt's also a key focus for Health Minister Greg Hunt, who in August promised to fix Australia's ailing mental health system, foreshadowing a boost to services in next year's federal budget.", "description": "Over two-thirds of workers aged 18-25 worry about their mental health, and 86 per cent of Australians think more should be done in their workplace to promote better mental health.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_55/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d11f3daa29e56468123cc3ad9895bb778af30098", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
