The deal is an ambitious plan to combat climate change in just ten years that Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats have previously touted.\n\nShe shouted: \u2018I think your next campaign slogan has to be this: We have got to start eating babies\u2026I\u2019m so happy that you are really supporting a Green New Deal, but it\u2019s not enough.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Even if we were to bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution.

It was reportedly intended to be satire that mirrored Jonathan Swift\u2019s tongue in cheek essay \u2018A Modest Proposal,\u2019 which suggested the Irish should sell their babies for food to combat poverty and unfair trade relations with Great Britain in 1729.\n\nThe group later tweeted: \u2018It was us.
