(Image: Marvel Studios)\n\nThe internet is currently in what feels like an endless cycle of asking artsy film directors their thoughts about Marvel movies and then getting mad at those thoughts. So, you know, it\u2019s just a regular time on the internet. But among that tiresome discourse, at least one director had a point we could get behind: Let these people fuck.\n\nPedro Almod\u00f3var \u2014 who has spent his decades-long career giving us sexy, melodramatic romance tales like Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Live Flesh, and Broken Embraces \u2014 is but the latest auteur to be sacrificed by the Content Gods to the question of whether or not That Popular Thing You Like Is Good. But weirdly enough, his comments about superhero films are not among the current wave of seemingly endless remarks from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and others as to whether the Marvel movies hold higher value beyond being smash-hit blockbusters.\n\nAlmod\u00f3var was on the discourse train months ago, thanks to an interview with Vulture. That interview is now being resurfaced and re-litigated by the site thanks to the current news cycle. We all needed something to do that wasn\u2019t talk about Star Wars this week, apparently.\n\nAnyway, when Vulture put forth the question to the cult favourite at the Film at Lincoln Centre\u2019s 50th Anniversary gala back in April, Almod\u00f3var gave an answer that\u2019s a bit more offbeat: These movies just aren\u2019t sexy enough for him.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many movies about superheroes,\u201d Almod\u00f3var told the site. \u201cAnd sexuality doesn\u2019t exist for superheroes. They are neutered. There is an unidentified gender, the adventure is what\u2019s important. You can find, among independent movies, more of this sexuality. The human being has such sexuality! I get the feeling that in Europe, in Spain, that I have much more freedom than if I worked here.\u201d\n\nAnd you know what? I\u2019m inclined to agree.\n\nIn part, at least. For Almod\u00f3var to say that superhero movies are sexless isn\u2019t exactly true \u2014 these are films filled with romance, if, disappointingly, there are currently more romantic tales about men named Steve in these movies than there are LGBTQ+ ones.\n\nThere are relationships, innuendos, tragic sacrifices made out of love, great victories earned in its name. There are, for the more juvenile among us, questions about the female orgasm (thanks, Wonder Woman), masturbatory jokes (thanks, Guardians of the Galaxy), even commentary on dick sizes (thanks, again, to Wonder Woman).\n\nThey\u2019re also films that, as part of the inherent superhuman ideal of peak bodies engaging in feats of strength, invite a certain amount of lust on the part of the audience. Who among us has not gazed at a Hollywood Chris or six across the multiple shirtless superhero scenes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or wondered if Brie Larson could push us uphill like she does 2,270kg Jeeps?\n\nBut these romances are, the vast majority of the time, depressingly chaste (Batman v Superman\u2019s bathtub aside, but that it is the peak of sexy superhero times in these blockbusters says a lot). They often exist to put a film\u2019s female lead aside on a pedestal, a goal for hero and villain to fight over rather than an actual character, and are often sealed with a kiss and nothing more. They are rarely the focus, rarely of any real dramatic weight next to all the punch ups and comic book fun. They\u2019re just... kinda boring?\n\nWhat makes superheroes so fascinating is the contrast between the Ego and Alter-Ego, the banality of their \u201cnormal\u201d selves contrasted and conflicted with the moments they put on some Spandex and beat up some bad guys. That contrast often gets in the way of things like love and romance, and sexuality \u2014 to dramatic effect \u2014 but most of the time these movies only treat that drama as an afterthought to, well, the bit where they put on some Spandex and beat up some bad guys.\n\nSuperhumans are still human, and sex, love, and sexuality are parts of that humanity. Examining the reality of that life is something these movies could stand to explore now that we\u2019ve established in the age of Avengers and Leagues of Justice that, yes, the general public is going to accept a great deal of comic book fuckery on the big screen.\n\nWhat about if they accepted some actual fuckery too \u2014 that outside the day job of being superheroes these characters are meant to be people, people who live rich and deep and complex lives, like we all do? Lives that can be lived intimately with other people, to boot in profound, intense ways. Sexily intense ways.\n\nThat this is as close to erotic as a Marvel movie can get is, well, a point proven. (Image: Marvel)\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that the next Avengers movie should re-do the Endgame assemble moment except everyone gets down and dirty instead of fighting a bunch of space aliens. After all, these are movies made by massive corporations like Disney and Warner Bros. \u2014 they are wide-reaching, all-appealing blockbuster films, and movies that are aimed at families and all age groups aren\u2019t really going to be able to tackle sexuality and sensuality beyond the relative chastity that Almod\u00f3var railed against. A movie that John and Jane Doe are taking their Spidey-loving toddler to isn\u2019t the space to really engage with that kind of text.\n\nBut superhero films have grown big enough and the genre framework itself is loose enough; after all, superhero stories are not really a genre, they\u2019re series of stories across myriad genres that happen to star superpowered protagonists. There are now more places than ever, in comics, in films, in television, in streaming, for experimentation that could lead to a story that is real, human, and sexy as hell being told with superhero characters.\n\nSuperheroic TV has at least been much better in this regard than its cinematic counterpart, serving the typical romance tales we\u2019ve come to expect alongside some comical raunchiness, much more LGBTQ love (although still not nearly enough), plenty of cake of both the beef and cheese varieties, and in more serious manners in shows like Jessica Jones, frank and graphic examinations of sex and the trauma of sexual violence.\n\nImagine if Disney+\u2019s WandaVision show, in its weird and messed up examination of the idealised \u201850s world the Scarlet Witch and the Vision have dreamed up for themselves, also tackled the sexual side of their relationship?\n\nNot just from the perhaps lurid perspective of what a synthezoid who can change the density of any part of his form \u2014 any \u2014 and a woman with access to chaos magic can do in the bedroom, but also in a way that is allowed to truly examine a long and dark romance from the comics that is perhaps too weird and messy, too complex and too human for the mainline MCU films to dive into. Human, despite being about the aforementioned Avenging Android and Actual Witch!\n\nSuperheroes can be so many things. If they\u2019re going to be the dominant force of our current culture, there is space for one of those things at least to be sexy as all hell.", "description": "The internet is currently in what feels like an endless cycle of asking artsy film directors their thoughts about Marvel movies and then getting mad at those thoughts.
