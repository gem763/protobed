REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay (Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters)\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 From the moment they arrived in Stuttgart, the U.S. women\u2019s gymnasts, led by the incomparable Simone Biles, made clear they\u2019re not letting anything stand in their way of history.\n\nNot the bankruptcy proceedings or general instability of their sport\u2019s national governing body, USA Gymnastics. Not even a scoring snub from the sport\u2019s international governing body itself.\n\nTrue to form, following a world-best performance in qualifying, Biles and her teammates defied controversy as effortlessly as they defied gravity at the 2019 World Gymnastics Championships Tuesday, routing the field to claim a fifth consecutive team gold medal and seventh overall.\n\nIn the process, Biles, the reigning Olympic and world all-around champion, became the most decorated female gymnast in history, collecting her 21st world championship medal to move past Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina. Her haul of gold medals at world championships \u2014 which now stands at 15 \u2014 was already a record. She\u2019s expected to add to her tally over the next five days, when she\u2019ll vie for her seventh world all-around title and contest medals in all four event finals.\n\nRussia took silver, lagging 5.801 points behind the United States, and Italy was the surprise bronze medalist.\n\n[Simone Biles pushes herself, and team, to the limits]\n\nWhile Biles shouldered the scoring load, it was a four-gymnast effort to claim the team gold. Under the format, each of the eight countries that advanced to Tuesday team final chose three gymnasts to compete on each of the four events. All three scores counted, so any athlete\u2019s misstep was costly to the group.\n\nLike Biles, 16-year-old Sunisa Lee, the youngest on squad, competed all four events for the United States. Just one year removed from junior competition, she finished second to Biles in qualifying to advance to Thursday\u2019s all-around competition. With a team gold at stake, she led the Americans on uneven bars but fell and wobbled twice on beam.\n\nRounding out the U.S. team were Jade Carey, 19, of Phoenix, who scored well on vault and floor; Kara Eaker, 16, of Grain Valley, Mo.; and Grace McCallum, 16, of Isanti, Mich.\n\nAs she has since winning her first world all-around title in 2013, Biles carried U.S. women\u2019s gymnastics on her shoulders Tuesday, proving, at 22, that she has not finished raising the bar for what is possible in the sport.\n\nIn her case, she is pursuing a standard that she alone can reach.\n\nBiles made history in Stuttgart on Day 2 of qualifications, having two new skills named for her by becoming the first to successfully land them on the world or Olympic stage: the Biles II on floor, a triple twisting double somersault; and the Biles dismount on beam, a double-twisting, double somersault.\n\n[Biles challenges boundaries of gymnastics with array of tumbling passes]\n\nBut instead of celebrating Biles\u2019s innovation and risk-taking, the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG), in effect, penalized her by deliberately devaluing her unprecedented beam dismount. Biles made her displeasure clear on social media; USA Gymnastics \u201crespectfully disagreed\u201d via a formal letter.\n\nThe federation responded that it didn\u2019t want to give lesser gymnasts an incentive for attempting such a difficult, hazardous skill.\n\n\u201cAm I in a league of my own?\u201d Biles said afterward when asked about the snub. \u201cYes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t credit me for what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Biles chose a slightly safer dismount, with one twist in her double somersault.\n\nDespite McCallum\u2019s hiccup on uneven bars and Lee\u2019s fall on beam, the Americans extended their lead after each rotation on a day littered with tumbles. They closed the competition with another strength, floor exercise, sending out Lee, Carey and Biles.\n\nBy the time Biles closed the competition, the United States had such a hefty lead that she could have taken a nap after her first two tumbling passes and still clinched the team gold. Nonetheless, she dazzled, hitting impossible heights with her triple-double and sticking the landing. Wearing an enormous smile, she tumbled on to her sassy music, as the crowd clapped along.\n\nBiles and Lee return to the competition floor Thursday to contest the prestigious All-Around, which consists of the 24 top-scoring gymnasts from qualifications, with a maximum of two per country.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. men will contest the team event after an error-strewn qualifying effort, barely making the eight-country cut. They\u2019re not expected to medal, lagging well behind top qualifiers Russia, China and Japan.", "description": "Biles becomes the most decorated female gymnast in history in capturing the gold, her 21st world championship medal", "authors": ["Liz Clarke", "Sports Reporter Focusing On Tennis", "October At Am", "Liz Clarke Has Covered Nine Olympics", "Three World Cups", "Written Extensively About College Sports", "Tennis", "Auto Racing.
