Neither is making those comments on social media \u2014 we saw plenty of that in 2015.\n\nBut what's fascinating this time is the speed at which it all gets out in the public domain \u2014 and how that forces politicians to react just as swiftly (or just simply forces them off message).\n\nWe saw an example of that right out of the starting gate.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May told our show early last week that she could try to dissuade her future MPs from re-opening the debate on abortion but, under her party's policy, she has no power to whip their votes and block them from introducing any kind of legislation.\n\nMark Vercouteren is the Green candidate in the southwestern Ontario riding of Chatham-Kent\u2014Leamington. (Mark Vercouteren/Twitter)\n\nA few hours after those comments were reported, the party issued a clarification, insisting that no candidate opposed to a woman's right to choose could get through the Greens' vetting process.\n\nAt least one did, though. A Green Party candidate in Southwestern Ontario filled out a questionnaire, available via any Google search, in which he was asked (among other things) whether he believed there were any circumstances under which women should have access to abortion. He answered \"no.\"\n\nSo we reached out to the party again. Its reply was \u2026 odd.\n\nThe candidate, we were told, \"doesn't remember\" filling out the questionnaire \u2014 but rest assured, he's pro-choice.\n\nMs. May generously made herself available for another interview at the end of last week, during which she sang a different tune. The candidate in question, she said, was being \"re-vetted.\" (I spoke to a source in her party's campaign who summed up the entire affair as a \"cluster----.\")\n\nBut May also (correctly) pointed out that every party is dealing with candidates crashing and burning. Will it matter to voters?\n\nPower & Politics: now on Sunday mornings and your podcast playlist\n\nCatch up on the latest election news with the new Power & Politics Sunday podcast. In today's episode: Vassy Kapelos talks to candidates about vetting issues. Plus, the Power Panel weighs in on which leader had the best campaign out of the gate and where they should be headed in the coming week. Listen to the lastest episode here\n\n\n\nAnd watch Power & Politics' Sunday edition live at 10 a.m. ET on CBC News Network for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nOn his campaign plane Saturday night, headed to Vancouver, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer scrummed with reporters and nearly every question focused on candidate vetting.\n\n\"As long as someone takes responsibility for what they've said and addresses the fact that in 2019 some things that may have been said in the past are inappropriate today, that if anything that they've ever said in the past caused any type of hurt or disrespect to one community or another and have apologized for that, I accept that,\" Scheer said.\n\n\"I accept the fact that people make mistakes in the past and can own up to that and accept that.\"\n\nCan voters move past it too? Or will it matter to them when they vote?\n\nLikely the presence of controversial candidates will itself turn off voters. It's how the parties and their leaders deal with those candidates that matters.\n\nI covered the 2012 campaign in Alberta and I can tell you that, until just a few days before the election, most people would have put money on the Wildrose Party under Danielle Smith sweeping to power. That definitely didn't happen.\n\nSmith didn't deal quickly with problem candidates who came to light right before the vote. She let them stick around to scare enough people away from her party to turn a certain victory into a massive loss.\n\nMost politicians seem to have learned from that example; they drop problem candidates quickly. But it's not cut and dried.\n\nParty leaders and party brass have to weigh the case put forward by the candidate, their relative importance among the candidates and the significance of the riding in which they're running. And still they sometimes appear to wait until media coverage forces them to respond. The case of the Liberals' Quebec candidate near Montreal is a good example of that.\n\nThis campaign is just getting started, of course. If more candidates with controversial views come to light and if most of them seem to be running for a particular party, that could turn into a bigger problem. And spare a little sympathy for the poor party functionaries whose job it is to do the vetting. (How would you like to spend weeks poring over years of social media comments?)\n\nBut every party ought to know it has to be done \u2014 because anything one party's vetting committee misses, its rivals will pick up and weaponize. There will be more candidate eruptions, but they don't have to knock the campaigns off track \u2014 not if they are dealt with openly and quickly.\n\nReading this online?

Expect Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team to continue to build on the momentum and excitement of early campaign announcements focused on making life more affordable for Canadian families and small businesses.\n\nRachel Curran senior associate at Harper & Associates Consulting\n\nThe Conservatives will spend the first full week of the campaign next week rolling out their proposals to make life more affordable and help them get ahead. Leader Andrew Scheer will focus on building out the policies the CPC will talk about for the remainder of the campaign, while reminding voters of Justin Trudeau's ethical failings and broken promises.\n\nKathleen Monk principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group\n\nNew Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh came into this campaign relatively unknown to most Canadians. With a strong first week and a winning debate performance, he did a good job introducing himself to voters. In the second week, look for the NDP to continue to build momentum, talking about plans to make life more affordable in concrete ways.\n\nPoll Tracker Takeaway\n\n\u00c9ric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.\n\nWill our old assumptions about elections need to be re-written in 2019?\n\nIt's an almost sacrosanct assumption about Canadian federal politics that to win a majority, a government a party needs at least 38 per cent support.\n\nNo party has ever won a majority government with less than that. Jean Chr\u00e9tien's Liberals set the low end of the bar at 38.5 per cent in the 1997 federal election. The last two majority governments were won with about 39.5 per cent of the vote.\n\nBut this time, it is theoretically possible \u2014 if not probable \u2014 that either the Liberals or the Conservatives could win a majority government with far less than 38 per cent of the vote.\n\nThe Poll Tracker puts the two parties at 34 per cent support each. That could be enough to put either party just a few seats short of the 170 needed to form a majority government. It wouldn't take much to push either party over that threshold.\n\nFor an explanation, let's look at what's happening with the other parties.\n\nThe latest seat projection suggests that less than 10 per cent of the House of Commons could be filled by MPs who sit with neither the government nor the Official Opposition. That would be the lowest share for third parties since 1958.\n\nThe gap between second and third in the polls is about 21 points. If that holds through to election day, that would be the widest margin since 1962.\n\nIn other words, it has been more than half a century since support for third parties has been so low or (and this is really important) so divided.\n\nThat has a big impact on the electoral math, because the first-past-the-post system penalizes smaller parties below a certain threshold of support.\n\nBecause the New Democrats are polling so low and the Greens are polling so high (but without enough regional concentration to win the party many seats) the old rules about what's needed to win a majority government may not apply in this election.\n\nIt's just another reason why 2019's vote is looking so unpredictable \u2014 and why every seat could count.\n\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker\n\nPoll averages as of the morning of September 15, 2019. (Eric Grenier/CBC)\n\nAsk CBC News\n\nSeveral CBC readers and viewers asked: Why aren't you calling Justin Trudeau the prime minister?\n\nYou may have noticed CBC News referring to Justin Trudeau as \"Liberal leader.\" Yes, he's still prime minister. However, now that the election has been called, incumbents who are running for re-election are referred to by their party affiliation only. According to the CBC Language Guide, this is done to \"avoid even the perception of giving incumbents an advantage.\"\n\nThere are exceptions, though. Political titles are allowed if it is a non-election story, where they are acting in their official role. Right here and now, though, it's Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.\n\nMore from CBC Politics\n\nThe 60 ridings that tell the story of where the election will be won and lost\n\nWhere do Justin Trudeau's Liberals need to win to secure re-election? What is the path to a majority government for Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives? What does the future for the NDP under Jagmeet Singh look like? And can Elizabeth May's Greens, Maxime Bernier's new People's Party or Independents like Jody Wilson-Raybould change the electoral map?
