Despite that, only 43 per cent ultrasound positions are being filled in NSW\n\nSonographers\n\nThese are the people who take medical images with an ultrasound device to monitor a pregnancy or check a woman's breasts for lumps or cancer.\n\nThey also check a patient for heart or bone problems.\n\nThe most common salary for a sonographer in Australia is $120,000, data from jobs site Seek showed.\n\nDespite the generous pay package, which is more than double Australia's median annual salary of $55,400, there are few applicants.\n\nIn Queensland, just 27 per cent of vacancies are being filled while the figure stands at 43 per cent in New South Wales, the Department of Employment and Skills said.\n\nThe situation is so dire there are just 1.4 applicants, on average, for every advertised job in a hospital or a private clinic.\n\n'Employers had difficulty filling vacancies across the public and private sectors,' the government said.\n\nSurveyors are commonly offered $120,000 salaries but in NSW, only a third of positions are being filled six weeks after it has been advertised\n\nThe full list of six-figure salary jobs that CAN'T be filled DENTIST: $180,000 salary but only 47 per cent of positions filled across Australia MINING ENGINEER: $130,000 salary yet only 48 per cent of positions filled SONOGRAPHER: $120,000 salary but only 27 per cent of positions filled in Queensland AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRICIAN: $110,000 salary but just 15 per cent of vacancies filled in Queensland OPTOMETRIST: $110,000 pay yet only 33 per cent of positions filled nationally VETS: $103,000 salary but only 29 per cent of positions filled in Australia ELECTRICAL ENGINEER: $103,000 salary but a bare majority or 52 per cent of positions filled in NSW SURVEYOR: $103,000 but just 33 per cent of positions filled in NSW Sources: Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business skills shortage profiles and Seek data on the most common salary for each occupation\n\nSurveyors\n\nEmployers are also struggling to find enough people who want to work outside.\n\nSurveyors can often be seen at building sites using a theodolite to determine the boundaries of a property.\n\nA $103,000 salary is the most common pay package for this kind of work, Seek said.\n\nEven this kind of remuneration isn't enough with just 33 per cent of positions being filled in NSW, with employers struggling in Sydney and regional areas.\n\nThere were also just 5.8 applicants on average for each position.\n\n'Demand for this occupation has been underpinned by solid construction activity over the past few years,' the government said.\n\nMining engineer\n\nNot even salaries of $130,000 are encouraging enough people to apply for advertised mining engineer positions.\n\nAcross Australia less than half, or 48 per cent, of jobs are being filled.\n\nJust a dozen, or 12.5 candidates, on average are vying for the highly-paid jobs.\n\n'The labour market for mining engineers has tightened over the year and shortages have become evident,' the government said.\n\nNot even salaries of $130,000 are encouraging enough people to apply for advertised mining engineer positions. The Department of Employment acknowledged remote location was an issue for prospective candidates\n\n'Employers find it increasingly difficult to attract applicants they consider suitable and the majority of vacancies have gone unfilled.'\n\nMany of these jobs involve working in remote areas, like the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where strong Chinese demand for iron ore, used to make steel, is creating jobs.\n\n'Difficulty filling residential positions in remote areas has been raised consistently by employers and recruitment agents over multiple years,' the government said.\n\n'Shortages were most prevalent in Western Australia and Queensland.'\n\nDuring the past year, the spot price of iron ore has surged by 30 per cent.\n\n'As a result, demand for mining engineers has increased,' the government said.\n\nEmployers are also struggling to find enough candidates who want to design electrical systems. Electrical engineers are more likely to receive a $103,000 salary yet in NSW only 52 per cent of positions are filled\n\nElectrical engineer\n\nEmployers are also struggling to find enough candidates who want to design electrical systems.\n\nElectrical engineers are more likely to receive a $103,000 salary yet in NSW only 52 per cent of positions are filled.\n\nThe Department of Employment noted there was a skills shortage in 2019 that didn't exist last year.\n\nThe skills are needed in a wide variety of sectors, from mining to manufacturing and transport infrastructure.\n\nEmployers are particularly frustrated at the lacked of sufficiently skilled applicants, with 16 candidates on average applying for work but only two being qualified.\n\nSydney's commuters are continuing to suffer from a shortage of electrical engineers, with an electrical circuit fault at Wynyard station on Friday morning significantly delaying peak-hour trains from crossing the Harbour Bridge.", "description": "From building and mine sites to the hospital, at least half the advertised positions are remaining unfilled after six weeks despite salaries of at least $100,000.", "authors": ["Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/04/19567946-0-image-a-16_1570763437461.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
