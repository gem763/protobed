(AP Photo/Wade Payne)\n\nTennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said Friday that LB Jeremy Banks had been dismissed from the football team.\n\n\u201cI have made the decision to remove Jeremy Banks from our football program,\u201d Pruitt said in a Friday afternoon statement. \u201cWhile I will continue to support Jeremy in the next steps in his life, information I recently received made it clear that this decision is in the best interest of the football program and the university.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe new information Pruitt received is reportedly related to a threat Banks made toward a female Tennessee student on Aug. 24. From ESPN:\n\nWhile Pruitt did not specify the source of the new information, a source told ESPN's Chris Low that he was made aware of a video of an Aug. 24 incident in which Banks told a woman he would \"smack\" her after she refused to let him into a party.\n\nBanks was suspended for Tennessee\u2019s Week 4 loss against Florida after a Sept. 15 arrest. He was arrested after he was pulled over for making an illegal u-turn and police discovered a warrant was out for his arrest after he failed to appear in court on a citation for driving with a suspended license.\n\nBanks called Pruitt, threatened woman\n\nThe details of Banks\u2019 arrest became public this week when a Knoxville TV station obtained the police footage.

At one point in the call \u2014 which happened in the early morning hours after Tennessee\u2019s win over Chattanooga \u2014 Pruitt remarked that \u201cthis is the silliest s--- I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Banks was put in the back seat of the University of Tennessee police car, he told a woman on a ride-along that she did not want to be a police officer.\n\n\u201cMa'am, you don't wanna be an intern because where I'm from we shoot at cops. I'm from Memphis, Tennessee,\u201d Banks said to the woman.\n\nBanks and Pruitt both issued statements through the school after the police footage was made public. In his apology, Banks said, \u201cI deeply regret my language and attitude in the video. I have great respect for our policemen and women, and I am embarrassed by my actions that night. That\u2019s not who I am. I promise to be a better representative for the University of Tennessee moving forward.\u201d\n\nTMZ has video of Aug. 24 incident\n\nTMZ posted video of what happened on Aug. 24 on Friday.
