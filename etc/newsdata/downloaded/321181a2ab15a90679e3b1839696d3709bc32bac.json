Wilson. We have an instinctive drive to connect with nature, he said, and the more we connect, the happier we are. That\u2019s why a walk in the woods can feel so good, or a sit on a quiet beach.\n\nIn our homes, we might try to bring the outside in with a potted tree, some herbs on the window sill, perhaps floral wallpaper or landscape art.\n\nSome other creative ideas from innovative designers today:\n\n\u201cWhen I first started reading about biophilic design and how we needed to be flooding our homes with gorgeous natural views, daylight and plants I thought, \u2018Well that\u2019s dandy, but how about people in homes and work spaces that just don\u2019t have access to these things?\u2019\u201d says Phoebe Oldrey, who runs Smart Style Interiors in Tunbridge Wells, England.\n\n\u201cHow do I, as an interior designer, give them the benefits of biophilic design? The answer came in the choice of materials we use in our designs, and natural materials is the way to go.\u201d\n\nIn one home, she designed floating maple cabinetry inlaid with a pattern of swallows in flight. In a dining/kitchen space with doors opening onto a leafy outdoor area, she placed a large light fixture composed of colorful glass bubbles; it\u2019s as though a cluster of errant balloons drifted in from the backyard. And in a weekend cottage, she placed a ceiling fixture made of woven sticks over the bed, evoking a cozy bird\u2019s nest.\n\nLighting is a great way to bring a biophilic element into a room.\n\nIf you like the idea of that stick fixture, check out Serena & Lily\u2019s Vero pendant made of wispy woven rattan twigs. All Modern has the Organique chandelier, a freeform \u2018nest\u2019 of rubbed bronze. Arteriors Home has the Tilda fixture made of whitewashed wood sticks, and the Wichita floor lamp crafted of downed teak tree trunks.\n\nBrooklyn\u2019s Nea Studio has found a formula for treating green marine algae so it becomes firm yet malleable. Designer Nina Edwards Anker handcrafts the algae into light shades that cast a warm glow. Anker has also created a solar chandelier made from shells and photovoltaic modules; hang the fixture in a window and it becomes a solar clock, turning on at dusk. Passing breezes make it a wind chime, too.\n\nNew technologies are giving us lighting that\u2019s more reflective of outdoor light. Ketra offers an LED system that can be tuned so the room lighting moves from warm candlelight to a wintry Arctic sky. Nanoleaf\u2019s light panels interlock; affix them to a wall, then operate them remotely to cycle through arrays like \u201csunrise\u201d and \u201cNorthern Lights.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re renovating or building, think about adding cutouts beyond the traditional windows and sliding doors - horizontal lighting like skylights, for instance.\n\nBo Sundius of Bunch Design in Los Angeles says the firm always thinks about how sun and light moving across rooms can be used to connect interiors to the outdoors.\n\nIn one converted garage project, long clerestory windows were placed high on the walls of a small living room. Afternoon light streams through a west-facing skylight, and a stepped ceiling creates more interesting light plays. \u201cThe house sits in the middle of a dense residential neighborhood,\u201d says Sundius, \u201cyet it feels airy and open.\u201d\n\nThis fall, Farrow & Ball debuted Colour by Nature, a collection done in collaboration with London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Rare books, including an early color guide used by Charles Darwin, provided inspiration. There\u2019s an orange-tinged white inspired by the breast feathers of an owl; a green evinces the emerald hue of a mallard\u2019s neck.\n\nBehr Paint\u2019s 2020 color of the year is a soothing green called Back to Nature; complementary colors include Light Drizzle, Secret Meadow, Dragonfly and Bluebird.\n\nMurals can showcase nature dramatically; they work well in family rooms, hallways or bedrooms. For something unusual, consider Flavor Paper\u2019s Saguaro Sessions collection. The studio\u2019s founder, Jon Sherman, and photographer Boone Speed were inspired by a trip to Saguaro National Park to make wallpapers that showcase macro photography of gemstones and minerals, with the crystalline structures creating unique patterns in extreme close-up.\n\nRoche Bobois\u2019 Bois Paradis collection from Maison Lacroix features wood cabinets and screens, and upholstered seating, printed with a woodland scene. On the casegoods and tables, the pattern is in silhouette, giving them an air of mystery.\n\nBedding maker Buffy offers the Breeze comforter made of sustainable eucalyptus, and stitched with a wave and wind pattern inspired by the rolling hills of artist Maya Lin\u2019s Storm King Wavefield in Orange County, New York.\n\nBuffy\u2019s also introduced a collection of naturally dyed sheets, with dye experts Maria Elena Pombo and Kathy Hattori. They\u2019ve used botanicals like walnut, gardenia, turmeric and pomegranate to gently color the textiles.\n\nMiami-based design house Plant the Future is known for biophilic installations like \u201cliving\u201d plant murals on building exteriors. They also clad the walls of a Florida client\u2019s dining room in a blanket of soft green moss, and created a 3-D mural out of mushrooms for a client in Spain. They sell preserved moss circles and hearts to hang on the wall, moss letters, and a lush, cursive \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nAnd to bring the outdoors in via scent, Otherland has soy-based candles with scents of smoke, wood fires, grass and desert sand.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The term \"biophilia,\" an affinity for the living world, was coined back in the 1980s by American biologist and author E.O.
