It exploded two weeks ago, and has been coiling and consolidating for a couple weeks now. On Wednesday, it popped 28 cents, or 10%, to 3.20, on 882,081 shares traded. To me, it looks like it\u2019s about to pop and go. If it gets through 3.40, I\u2019m looking for 4, and then 4 3/4 as target.\n\nSwing trade Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Ltd (NASDAQ: ) gained 20 cents, or 1.54%, to 13.22, on 73,303 shares traded on Wednesday on an inside day. It looks to me like it\u2019s poised to pop. The wedge is right at resistance. If it gets through that zone, 16 is your target.\n\nAudioCodes Ltd (NASDAQ: ) has been awesome for a year now, and on Wednesday, it ran 1.02, or 5.06%, to 21.18, on 433,488 shares traded. Basically, it broke out from the 6.00-7.00 zone, and since, has tripled. The recent wedge or coil that formed has broken out and been up for six days, having run from under 17 to 21.50. I think it\u2019s near the top of the channel, and may have only a little bit left toward 23-24. So, keep an eye on that one.\n\nSwing trade Avita Medical Ltd (OTC: ) had a key breakout on Wednesday, popping 66 cents, or 9%, to 7.94, on 412,222 shares traded, and reaching new all-time highs at 7.95. With this kind of pattern, it wouldn\u2019t shock me if it went to 11.80, 14, and 15.\n\nMinerva Neurosciences Inc (NASDAQ: ) is at the point where it might explode. In June it made a big pop, pulled back, formed a wedge, consolidated for another month, broke out and retested. The volume was pretty low on the pullback, but it popped again on Wednesday, and gained 31 cents, or 4%, to 8.42, on 315,060 shares traded. For me, I think it\u2019s ready to go. I\u2019m looking for a move to 9 1/2 and 11 1/2.\n\nStocks on the long side included Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (ABEO), Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
