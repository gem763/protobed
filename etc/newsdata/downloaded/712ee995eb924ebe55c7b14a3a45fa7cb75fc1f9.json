It keeps our food fresh and holds liquids without going soggy. It can also be moulded into a variety of shapes and, unlike glass, it doesn\u2019t shatter if you drop it. But one of the qualities that makes it so useful \u2013 its durability \u2013 also means that it takes approximately 450 years to biodegrade.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore imperative that we reuse, redesign and recycle plastic packaging so that it doesn\u2019t end up buried in landfill or clogging up our oceans for centuries to come. But given that only about 14% of plastic packaging gets recycled today, there\u2019s clearly a lot of work still to do \u2013 especially when it comes to creating packaging designs that are easier to recycle, use less material and contain more recycled plastic.\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to better designs is the higher cost and more constrained supply of recycled plastic compared with virgin types. So, from April 2022, the UK government plans to introduce a new tax on plastic packaging that does not contain a minimum of 30% recycled content. It hopes this will transform the economics of sustainable packaging by driving up demand for recycled materials and discouraging the production of single-use packaging with no recycled content.\n\nThe EU also wants to make all plastic packaging across Europe recyclable or reusable by 2030, and is allocating an additional \u20ac100m on top of current spending to research better designs, durability and recyclability. Initiatives such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the New Plastics Economy, which aim to build momentum towards a plastics system based on circular economy principles, have also brought together stakeholders from across the plastics value chain to rethink the way plastics are designed, produced, used, recycled and reprocessed.\n\nShining a light on black plastic\n\nBlack plastic, which is often used to package ready meals, is high on the list of packaging that needs redesigning. The near-infrared technology found in plastic sorting facilities uses light reflection to identify different types of plastic and sort them appropriately. But due to the presence of carbon black, those ready meal trays and other types of black plastic simply absorb the light rather than reflecting it back to the machine, effectively rendering them unrecyclable.\n\n3D printing a plastic prototype; Dr Thorsten Leopold\n\nHenkel, the global chemical and consumer goods company behind well-known brands such as Loctite, Pritt, Sellotape and Schwarzkopf, Dylon and Colour Catcher, decided to tackle the black plastic problem in partnership with its colouring supplier, Ampacet. Together they developed a black plastic that uses an alternative carbon-free black colour, which can be detected by sorting machines. \u201cWe have already begun integrating it into our product portfolios, starting with our bottles of toilet-cleaning products,\u201d says Dr Thorsten Leopold, head of international packaging development for home care products at Henkel. In time the carbon-free colour should be rolled out across all the company\u2019s black plastic packaging, which will ensure this formerly \u201cunrecyclable\u201d plastic doesn\u2019t become waste.\n\nThe project is part of Henkel\u2019s goal of making 100% of its consumer packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, while also increasing the share of recycled plastic in its European consumer goods products to 35%. In order to meet these targets, Henkel\u2019s packaging developers follow three main principles: prevent, reduce and reuse. This means producing less packaging and waste, developing better packaging and enabling a circular economy. For example, the company\u2019s Laundry and Home Care and Beauty Care businesses have recently launched packaging made solely from recycled plastic \u2013 up to half of which is also classed as Social Plastic.\n\nPlastic that alleviates poverty\n\nThis Social Plastic comes from Henkel\u2019s partnership with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment while helping to alleviate poverty in countries such as Haiti and the Philippines. It encourages people to collect plastic waste and bring it to Plastic Bank recycling collection centres, where it can be exchanged for money, goods or services. The Social Plastic is then integrated back into the plastic supply chain. In total, approximately 200 tonnes of collected Social Plastic will be processed for Henkel this year.\n\nA Plastic Bank recycling collection centre\n\nPierre Defaix, global purchasing category lead for plastic resins and masterbatches at Henkel, says that part of the appeal of the partnership is the proven scalability of Plastic Bank\u2019s solution for tackling ocean plastic. \u201cIts business model tackles the environmental challenge of ocean plastic,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut it also has a social dimension that addresses poverty and the lack of work opportunities for many people ... We want to create the demand that will help this business model fly.\u201d\n\nTricks up their sleeves: the packaging solutions that make for smarter recycling Read more\n\nAs well as using more Social Plastic in future, Henkel is also exploring other ways of improving the lives of plastic collectors. \u201cEarly this year, for instance, Schwarzkopf included four Plastic Bank collectors in its Million Chances charitable initiative, which supports projects that empower women to build a successful personal and professional future.\n\n\u201cThis is in the Philippines, where Schwarzkopf teaches disadvantaged young people hairdressing skills so they can change their lives by developing a steady income,\u201d says Defaix.\n\nRecycled plastic challenges\n\nSeveral issues have to be taken into consideration when incorporating more recycled plastic into product packaging. For instance, the properties of recycled plastic \u2013 such as its colour and odour \u2013 are more varied than those of virgin plastic. \u201cThis is something of a challenge for our supply chain, but also for the performance of our products,\u201d says Leopold.\n\nBottles produced from recycled plastic on the Social Plastic production line; Philippe Blank of Henkel\n\nCertain colours of recycled polyolefin plastics, for instance, are hard to source in large amounts. Recycled PET plastic also tends to be less transparent than a virgin equivalent, and may have a greyish or yellowish tinge. That poses a challenge when it comes to creating beauty products with shelf appeal. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a huge demand from our marketeers, and also from the consumers themselves, that the product, in terms of packaging, needs to be attractive,\u201d says Philippe Blank, head of innovation and sustainability for Henkel Beauty Care. \u201cIt\u2019s not a solution to end up with beauty packaging that only comes in shades of grey or yellow.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, designers might add a coloured tint to recycled PET to hide the fact that it\u2019s not as transparent as the virgin kind. Sleeves that completely cover the bottle are another option. \u201cThat means you can put a lot of recycled plastic into the body,\u201d says Leopold, \u201cand the greyish or yellow colour of the bottle is covered by the sleeve. That\u2019s a nice example of how smart design can foster the use of recycled plastic.\u201d\n\nSmarter multi-layer design\n\nSmart design is also part of Henkel\u2019s approach to making multi-layer packaging more sustainable. This type of packaging, which consists of multiple layers of film, foil, plastic or paper, is tear-resistant, lightweight and good at keeping out external factors. However, the layers are difficult to separate during the recycling process, so the packaging is often incinerated or thrown into landfill sites after use.\n\nThe padded mailers that protect e-commerce purchase during transit fall under this category of packaging. Around 20bn of them are used each year, which adds up to a heavy environmental footprint \u2013 one that Henkel engineers have helped to make a bit lighter by designing a new type of recyclable mailer. \u201cThe product that we came up with can be put straight into the paper recycling bin,\u201d says Marcin Lapaj, global business development manager for the circular economy at Henkel. \u201cIt shows how a traditional product can be reinvented and made in a different way, with circularity as priority number one.\u201d\n\nOf course Henkel isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s trying to make plastic packaging more sustainable. In the UK, Coca-Cola has developed new technologies that mean 100% of the packaging the company uses in its \u201cSmartwater\u201d bottles is now recyclable. Samsung, meanwhile, has substituted all the plastic packaging used for its products for environmentally sustainable materials such as recycled and bio-based plastics and paper. And where these companies lead others will hopefully follow, so that plastic waste becomes part of the past rather than the future.\n\nFurther information about Henkel\u2019s efforts to make plastic more sustainable can be found at: https://www.henkel.co.uk/spotlight/features/plastic", "description": "Cutting-edge packaging innovations are helping to reduce waste plastic and ensure it remains part of the supply chain", "authors": ["Duncan Jefferies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da581a3e15e48ab9697c31b8edda1e59fdb4babb/866_279_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be4241cc22fda989f1dc1336abfa13b6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
