And getting addicted to anything is unhealthy.\n\nSo Google has decided to do something about it and launched another phone -- well, sort of. It promises to help you fight smartphone addiction.\n\nReuters/Google\n\nGoogle has unveiled Paper Phone, which is essentially everything important from your phone, on a piece of paper. No this is not an April fool's prank in Halloween, but in fact, it is Google's attempt of making its users healthily combat smartphone addiction.\n\nThis Paper Phone is developed by a London-based design studio called Special Projects (surprisingly it didn't get leaked like the Pixel 4). All you need to do is install an app on your phone, select what you want on your Paper Phone (contacts, notes, maps etc) and when done, it'll give you an option to print it on a paper.\n\nDon't Miss 973 SHARES 163 SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 526 SHARES\n\nAfter printing, just fold it up and you've got yourself a Paper Phone. While it might seem pretty juvenile (like a kid's craft project) this paper phone will truly hold everything you need to get through the day. You can also add Suduko or crossword puzzles to help you combat boredom. You even get tiny slots to add your credit card to, in order to replace NFC-based wallet system.\n\nGoogle\n\nSmartphone addiction is becoming one of the most serious issues of our time. To combat this, many smartphone makers have been including time-out apps to help people control their reliability on a smartphone. Google has quite a few apps in its Digital Wellbeing portfolio on Android and Apple's Screen Time helps parents limit kids' screen time on its devices (although kids have found a way to walk past this).\n\nWould you give up your phone for a day and try using the Paper Phone?
