USA TODAY\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates will take the stage again come November, and answer questions posed by a panel of all women, the debate hosts announced Wednesday.\n\nMSNBC and The Washington Post, co-hosts for the Nov. 20 debate in Georgia, said MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, MSNBC host and NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell, NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post reporter Ashley Parker will moderate.\n\nVenue and format details will be announced at a later date, the hosts said. The debate is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. ET and last until 11 p.m.\n\nThe announcement comes after criticism that the Democratic primary debates have so far lacked substantial discussion on women's health issues. At the October debate, candidates California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker both raised concerns about reproductive health care, and candidates chimed in later when a question on abortion was asked.\n\nMore: Top moments from the October Democratic debate\n\n\"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said.\n\nBooker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said.\n\nThe November debate will surely see fewer candidates on the stage because the Democratic National Committee raised its requirements to qualify yet again. Twelve candidates debated on one night in October. The hosts said that eight hopefuls have qualified for November's debate so far.\n\nThey are:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\n\nSouth Bend, Indianan Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nBusinessman Tom Steyer\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang\n\nCandidates had to receive individual donations from at least 165,000 people, which includes 600 donations in 20 states, and stand at 3% or higher in at least four approved national or early state polls. Or, they can reach 5% or higher in two early state polls.\n\nMore: Following debate criticism, Elizabeth Warren will outline how to pay for 'Medicare for All' plan\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/23/democratic-debate-november-debate-moderators-all-women/4078049002/", "description": "The hosts said that eight candidates have met the requirements to appear at the November Democratic debate so far.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published P.M.
