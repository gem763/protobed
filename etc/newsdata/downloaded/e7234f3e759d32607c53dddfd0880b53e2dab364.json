Abolish Air Passenger Duty", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to Refresh \u2013 a series of comment pieces by young people, for young people, to provide a free-market response to Britain's biggest issues \u200b\n\nIn the early days of a new government \u00e6 and the days leading up to Brexit \u2013 wildly popular, low-cost, genuinely effective policies aren\u2019t easy to come by.\n\nIn the political climate of Brexit, the best policies are those which are outward-facing, can help make the economy competitive, and won\u2019t cost the Chancellor an absolute bomb.\n\nSo it\u2019s a wonder to me that we haven\u2019t heard more about abolishing Air Passenger Duty (APD).\n\nGetting rid of APD is exactly the kind of policy that Boris (and Dominic Cummings) would embrace wholeheartedly. It\u2019s a cheap, feel-good idea which is likely to be embraced by hard-working people, and can be sold as Britain turning its face towards the world.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Isaby, formerly of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, \u2018Air Passenger Duty is just another way for the taxman to squeeze the extra bit more from hard pressed families planning a well-earned holiday.\u2019 There are very few countries which specifically tax flights - and the rates in the UK are disproportionately high compared to them - it adds more than \u00a378 to all long-haul adult tickets. Germany \u2013 the next highest in Europe \u2013 has a significantly lower rate. Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark all phased APD out years ago.", "description": "Welcome to Refresh \u2013 a series of comment pieces by young people, for young people,  to provide a free-market response to Britain's biggest issues \u200b", "authors": ["Matt Gillow", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion", "Charles Moore", "Robert Buckland", "William Cook", "Rosa Prince", "Ross Clark"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/08/08/TELEMMGLPICT000184284670-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
