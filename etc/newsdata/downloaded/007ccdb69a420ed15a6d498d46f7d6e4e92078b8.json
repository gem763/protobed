The man using equations to find love", "language": "en", "text": "Mathematician Bobby Seagull has tried to use numbers to solve his romantic difficulties. Is he on to something?\n\nThey say love is a numbers game. Bobby Seagull \u2013 the mathematician who rose to fame as a finalist on University Challenge in 2017 \u2013 took them literally.\n\nA few years ago, he sat down to try to work out why he had been so unlucky in life. \u201cI was 32 or 33, I was single, I loved maths and science \u2013 I thought: \u2018Can I use maths and science to help me?\u2019 It was a genuine, earnest attempt.\u201d\n\nInspired by Peter Backus \u2013 a Manchester University economics lecturer who in 2010 wrote a paper titled Why I Don\u2019t Have a Girlfriend \u2013 Seagull used the Drake equation, developed to estimate how many intelligent alien civilisations there might be in the galaxy, to determine his number of potential partners. \u201cYou start by assuming there\u2019s infinitely many, then you keep on making the pool smaller and smaller.\u201d\n\nFrom the total female populations of London and Cambridge \u2013 the cities between which he split his time \u2013 Seagull selected those roughly his age and up to 10 years younger. Then he reduced that group to the proportion that were likely to be university educated, to reflect the reality of his networks, as a school maths teacher and doctorate student.\n\nThen came a harder parameter: what fraction Seagull might find attractive. After going through his Facebook friends list, he found 1,200 women who met his criteria for age, location and education \u2013 and of one in every 20, he says he thought that he \u201ccould imagine us, in another life\u201d.\n\nThat left Seagull with 29,369 potential girlfriends: as he puts it, a decent-sized crowd at the old West Ham ground at Upton Park. But that did not account for two important factors: his next girlfriend would have to be single \u2013 and she would have to find him attractive, too.\n\nSeagull found himself with a final total of 73. Whether that figure floods you with optimism or despair may mark you out as a romantic or a realist. On one hand, it\u2019s nowhere close to filling up a football stadium. On the other, it is significantly greater than one. As in, the One.\n\nNumbers have long factored into the dating game, even for those who have a ropey grasp on them. We might wonder, of a couple\u2019s particularly serendipitous origin story: \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d Or we might console someone who is unhappily single that \u201cit only takes one\u201d.\n\nOnline dating has strengthened mathematics\u2019 role in the search for love, not only in serving up seemingly infinite potential partners, but in using algorithms to sift through them. As it is increasingly accepted that there is no perfect one for each of us, the numbers are on our side \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean the search is easy.\n\n\u201cI think there are many \u2018ones\u2019,\u201d says Seagull. \u201cThere are 107 billion people who have ever existed \u2013 if you really think there is one person who is truly your \u2018one\u2019, they\u2019ve probably died.\u201d\n\nNow 35 and still single, Seagull has continued his investigation into \u201cmaking the maths of love work for you\u201d in his book, The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers, as well as on dates. When he had reached that 73 figure, he says, he showed his working to his mum as a somewhat tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to her persistent inquiries as to why he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, that\u2019s on paper \u2013 it doesn\u2019t tell you whether you\u2019re compatible in person. On paper, I\u2019m probably a perfect match with my dad, if he was a woman, and not related to me.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s 73 people that I think would be a perfect fit for me \u2013 I may not be a perfect fit for them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps understandably, on being confronted by a pool of potential partners who could fit comfortably on one double-decker bus, Seagull says he has learned the need to relax his criteria. After all, he says, the mathematician Hannah Fry found that the most successful couples have a \u201clow negativity threshold\u201d, meaning they argue often but easily move on. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got to start thinking: what\u2019s the most efficient way of dating people so that you can quickly establish their potential?\u201d\n\nSeagull supports a \u201clittle bit of stress-testing\u201d even at the dating stage; his suggestion is to bring up Brexit, less to weed out leave or remain voters than to test a potential partner\u2019s capacity for disagreement. (Excluding leave voters would further reduce his pool from 73 to about 40, he says, sounding dismayed.)\n\nLike the Drake equation, online dating can present you only with a pool of suitable partners you could potentially meet. Attraction must be assessed in person, \u201cand there is no formula for that\u201d, says Seagull. Or at least not yet, he adds; he is confident that machine-learning technology will eventually be able \u201cto read your mood, your mind \u2026 and detect bits of our personality\u201d to predict the presence of that elusive spark.\n\nIn decades to come, it may even be possible to simulate dates the same way that it is football matches now, modelling every variable \u2013 although, Seagull says, probably not soon enough to be of any use to him.\n\nFor now, the most efficient approach to dating is to meet as many potential partners as possible \u2013 and apps connect us with a seemingly infinite number. There can often be an element of the paradox of choice: sure, this match seems good, but what if an even better one is a swipe away?\n\nThis is where optimal-stopping theory can come into play, identifying the point in a process at which to stop for best results \u2013 and here the magic number, says Seagull, is 37%. Say he wanted to be in a relationship by the age of 40, and was prepared to commit to going on two dates a week, for 50 weeks of the year, for five years: 500 dates total. Optimal-stopping theory would have Seagull go on 185 dates \u2013 taking him the best part of two years \u2013 then, armed with the insights he gained along the way, pursue the woman he liked best from the 186th on.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know at what stage in these 500 dates you will meet your most suited person, and you\u2019re probably going to miss them \u2013 but mathematically, this is how you can settle better.\n\n\u201cThis is where you really need to trust the maths \u2013 you might think that the first person you meet is amazing, but you\u2019ve got to get through the first 185. If we simulated our lives a million times, the person that you would date best would still be after 185.\u201d\n\nKeeping track of that number would inevitably necessitate a spreadsheet, or at least note-taking, which even Seagull sees as a step too far: \u201cI haven\u2019t got that cynical yet.\u201d\n\nThe key to bear in mind, he says, is that \u201conce you\u2019ve got your potential pool, you need to maximise your chances by meeting as many of them as quickly as possible\u201d \u2013 before they get coupled up, leave the country or otherwise remove themselves.\n\nThere is evidence to support coming to a conclusion about potential partners quickly \u2013 even if by gut feeling alone. In 2012, the US mathematician Chris McKinlay successfully hacked dating site OkCupid to identify his best matches, then \u2013 through trial and error \u2013 perfected his own formula for dates: no alcohol; a definite endpoint \u2013 no trailing off; and no concerts, films or anything similarly \u201cinefficient\u201d, as he told Wired\u2019s Kevin Poulsen.\n\nOnce, he took different dates to the same beach, on the same day. It worked for McKinlay (and his fiancee found the story amusing), but Seagull says he has had the opposite approach, being \u201cvery strict about the swipe process\u201d and less disciplined about the actual dates.\n\nHe intends to take a leaf from McKinlay\u2019s workbook and relax his criteria, have more and shorter dates \u2013 and to avoid alcohol. \u201cYou can\u2019t have things that cloud your data set.\u201d But Seagull shies from McKinlay\u2019s tactic of sending the same, boilerplate message to matches he wanted to meet (\u201cYou seem really cool. Want to meet?\u201d).\n\n\u201cThe thing about maths is, it can make you feel a bit cynical sometimes when you\u2019re on dates, going through their personality traits. I think it should be a guidance. Maths can\u2019t take into account every single possible factor.\u201d Such as, for example, human emotions \u2013 although those don\u2019t always make dating easier, either, says Seagull.\n\nI am surprised to learn that he has only been on seven or eight dates since doing Drake\u2019s equation a few years ago. Maybe his mum was right when, on seeing his formula, she told him he was being ridiculous, and \u201cto go out and meet people\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terrible,\u201d he admits. \u201cI leave a long gap between dates. After a date, if you didn\u2019t have a good time, you feel despondent. I had another date, where I liked her and she didn\u2019t like me. As a human, you get upset. That\u2019s why scientists trust the maths: keep going.\u201d\n\nBobby Seagull will present his Mathematician\u2019s Guide to Dating at New Scientist Live, ExCel London, on 11 October", "description": "Mathematician Bobby Seagull has tried to use numbers to solve his romantic difficulties.
