She said about 35 students were involved.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay silent anymore,\u201d the 20-year-old said. \u201cI would like to see President Falwell address this himself and for there to be an investigation into the allegations to see whether or not they\u2019re true.\u201d\n\nAt least one student held a sign that read: \u201cI TRUST JERRY.\u201d\n\nThe Politico story contained allegations that Falwell \u201cpresides over a culture of self-dealing\u201d at Liberty that has improperly benefited him and his family. The story cited unnamed sources described as current and former officials or Falwell associates.\n\nFalwell told The AP on Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cdignify the lies that were reported\u201d in the Politico piece, calling the reporter for the story a \u201clittle boy.\u201d\n\nFalwell said he would ask the FBI to investigate. He also said Liberty has hired \u201cthe meanest lawyer in New York,\u201d whom he declined to identify, to pursue civil cases.\n\nBrooks said student protesters were particularly upset about quotes of emails in the Reuters story posted Thursday in which Falwell allegedly referred to one student as \u201cemotionally imbalanced and physically retarded.\u201d\n\nDavid Corry, Liberty\u2019s general counsel, told Reuters that Liberty wouldn\u2019t respond \u201cwithout knowing the details or seeing email chains in their entirety.\u201d\n\nBrooks grew up in Lynchburg and said she remembers when Falwell\u2019s father, Jerry Falwell Sr., died in 2007. She referred to the elder Falwell\u2019s often-used quote about the school: \u201cIf it\u2019s Christian, it ought to be better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a Christian,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd that quote from Jerry. Sr. really does embody our mission. We didn\u2019t come out here to be angry or militant. We honestly just wanted to show the student body that there are people like them who care and who want to see this place be the best it can be.\u201d\n\nFollowing Friday\u2019s protest, Falwell Jr. tweeted that he was \u201cso impressed with how @LibertyU students conducted themselves today at the protest!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ones who had concerns and the ones who supported me were both respectful and not angry - very Christ-like in their behavior,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur students are an example the world can learn from!\u201d\n\nLiberty was founded in 1971 by Jerry Falwell Sr. with just 154 students. It now boasts an enrollment of more than 100,000, including those in its massive online education program.\n\nFalwell Jr.\u2019s early and ardent support of President Donald Trump created a rift on campus during the presidential campaign and has sparked controversy since.", "description": "Students protested in response to reports that Jerry Falwell, Jr. engaged in self-dealing and sent offensive emails about students as Liberty's president...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bf9f423000058055302a0.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
