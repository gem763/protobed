It was an affront to our democracy.\u201d\n\nHis Socialist Party, which faces a national election next month, has long sought to strip the huge monument in the Valley of the Fallen of its status as a memorial to Franco.\n\nIt was built on the dictator\u2019s orders and contains the remains of combatants from both sides of the civil war he unleashed in 1936.\n\nAround 500,000 people were killed in three years of conflict between Franco\u2019s nationalist rebels, backed by Hitler and Mussolini, and left-wing Republicans.\n\nTens of thousands more were killed or imprisoned in the ensuing dictatorship that lasted until his death decades later.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s ceremony, rich with symbolism of a bygone age and witnessed only by relatives and a small group of officials, Franco\u2019s coffin was taken from its tomb as crowds of media and onlookers gathered outside.\n\nFamily members carried the coffin to a waiting hearse which transferred it to a helicopter for the short flight to the Mingorrubio cemetery north of Madrid.\n\nThere, to a backdrop of supporters chanting his name, Franco\u2019s remains were taken into the family vault for reburial next to his wife in a second private ceremony.\n\nThe exhumation is \u201cintensely symbolic for Spain\u201d, said political scientist Pablo Simon, \u201cbecause the (Franco) monument has always been connected to those who miss the old regime\u201d.\n\nMEDIA BLACKOUT\n\nSeeking to play down its repercussions, the government had enforced a media blackout and forbidden Franco\u2019s family from draping his coffin with the Spanish flag.\n\nRelatives of late Spanish dictator Francisco Franco carry the coffin after the exhumation at The Valle de los Caidos (The Valley of the Fallen) in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, October 24, 2019. Mariscal/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBut in a gesture of solidarity with his ancestor, his eldest grandson and namesake Francisco Franco carried a Franco-era nationalist flag into the valley mausoleum, Reuters TV footage showed.\n\nRelatives then decorated the coffin with a victor\u2019s crown of laurel leaves, a woven cloth bearing the insignia of the family\u2019s ducal coat of arms and five roses representing the Falange party that formed the core of Franco\u2019s nationalist government.\n\nThe ceremony and its symbols highlighted how deeply the political and social divisions over his legacy still run.\n\nShortly after his death, in an effort to ease the transition to democracy, Spain passed a pact pardoning political crimes committed under Franco. It was not until 2007 that the then Socialist government promulgated a law seeking to recognize those who suffered under his dictatorship.\n\nA poll in newspaper El Mundo this month showed 43% of Spaniards favored the transfer of Franco\u2019s remains while 32.5% opposed it.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, the dictator\u2019s grandson accused the government of engineering the exhumation \u201cas propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes before an election\u201d.\n\nAlbert Rivera, whose center-right Ciudadanos party abstained in the parliamentary vote to ratify the coffin\u2019s transfer, said on Thursday that almost two-thirds of Spaniards had not lived or suffered under Franco.\n\n\u201cThe bones of a dictator who died 44 years ago should not be a government\u2019s priority in my opinion. The only silver lining is that (acting Socialist Prime Minister) Pedro Sanchez will stop talking about Franco\u2019s bones,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (40 Images)\n\nBut the dictator\u2019s burial alongside his victims in the Valley of the Fallen had long raised critical questions among historians and campaigners, including 93-year-old Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz.\n\n\u201cIt was time (to move him). It was overdue,\u201d said Sanchez-Albornoz, who as a prisoner of Franco\u2019s Fascist regime was forced to help build the Valley of the Fallen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited many decades for (him) to disappear from this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the dictators of Franco\u2019s ilk have vanished from Europe \u2014 Hitler, Mussolini \u2014 and were not honored with such tombs,\u201d he said.", "description": "Cries of \"long live Franco!\" accompanied the laurel wreath-draped coffin of General Francisco Franco on Thursday as Spain removed the remains of its former dictator from the state mausoleum where he was buried in 1975.", "authors": ["Clara-Laeila Laudette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444484989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N113", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
