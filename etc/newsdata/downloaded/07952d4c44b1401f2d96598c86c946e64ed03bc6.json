Most likely would have taken the top spot \u2013 Now he is also Dead!\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday. He did not identify al-Baghdadi\u2019s alleged successor.\n\nJust confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nThe US president did not specify whether the terrorist chief\u2019s mysterious lieutenant was killed alongside his boss in the US military operation in Idlib, Syria last week, or if he was killed in a separate incident. Trump was likely referring to Islamic State spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, named as a potential replacement for the notorious terrorist leader. The State Department said on Monday that he had been killed hours after the US raid that took down al-Baghdadi.\n\nTrump\u2019s boast about the raid that allegedly killed al-Baghdadi has peeved many liberal pundits and news outlets, with some even airbrushing the head of the worldwide \u201ccaliphate\u201d in hopes of depriving Trump of a foreign policy victory. Others, including the UN, have taken issue with the lack of hard evidence pointing to al-Baghdadi\u2019s demise.\n\nThe Pentagon says that the terrorist leader\u2019s body was swiftly identified using DNA testing, and then dumped into an unidentified body of water \u2013 the same protocol reportedly used to ID and \u201cbury\u201d Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Disposal complete\u2019: ISIS chief al-Baghdadi buried at sea, like bin Laden, but photo & video proof remains classified \u2013 Pentagon\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
