EM ASIA FX-Asian currencies firm on signs of U.S.-China breakthrough\n\n* Asian units firm on trade optimism\n\n* Taiwan dollar, S.Korean won lead gains\n\n* China's yuan rise against the dollar, despite weak trade data (Adds text, updates prices)\n\nBy Patturaja Murugaboopathy\n\nOct 14 (Reuters) - Asian currencies rose on Monday after the United States and China signalled progress in their trade negotiations, which lifted investor sentiment and prompted a hunt for risk assets such as emerging market pairs.\n\nThe improved mood supported currencies of trade-reliant economies, specifically the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean won, which led regional gains.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese imports that was set to take effect from Tuesday. However, he did not revoke any of the existing tariffs on Chinese goods. to Trump, the phase-1 trade deal would cover agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections.\n\nMost Asian currencies have been severely hit since the onset of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies last year, as higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods slowed the regional economies as a whole, with many countries playing a major part of the supply chain to China's exports.\n\n\"The partial deal between U.S. and China should temporarily boost sentiment, remove some of the depreciation pressure on CNH and provide relative support for Asia ex-Japan currencies, including the South Korean won and Taiwan dollar,\" said Saktiandi Supaat, head of FX research at Maybank in a note.\n\n\"The actual signing of the agreement is still four to five weeks away and past experience suggests there is still room for disappointment.\"\n\nThe Taiwan dollar TWD=TP and the South Korean won KRW=KFTC led the regional currencies, each rising more than 0.5% against the greenback.\n\nThe Taiwan dollar, in fact, touched a more than one-year high of 30.61 to the dollar.\n\nChina's yuan CNY=CFTC , also jumped to a two-month high against the dollar despite its recent trade data showed slowing exports and imports, pointing to a further weakness in the economy. Indian rupee INR=IN and the Philippine peso PHP=PH also gained over 0.25% each on Monday.\n\nSINGAPORE DOLLAR\n\nThe Singapore dollar gained 0.28% against the dollar on Monday.\n\nThe Sino-U.S. trade optimism boosted the export reliant nation's currency, despite data showing its economy grew less than expected in the third quarter on an annualised basis. the economy avoided slipping into a technical recession, preliminary data showed on Monday.\n\nIn a statement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said it would lower slightly the slope of the Singapore dollar's policy band, while the width and centre of the band would not be changed. rationale for easing is clear: subdued core inflation and weaker economic growth with output below potential. Overall, we think MAS is keeping its option open to more easing ahead,\" said MUFG Bank in a report.\n\nThe following table shows rates for Asian currencies against the dollar at 0533 GMT.\n\nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR\n\nChange on the day\n\nat 0533 GMT\n\nCurrency\n\nLatest Previou\n\ns day\n\nMove Japan yen\n\n108.33\n\n108.4 +0.06\n\nSing dlr\n\n1.369\n\n1.3725 +0.27 Taiwan dlr\n\n30.580 30.850 +0.88 Korean won\n\n1183.5 1188.8 +0.45\n\n51.450\n\n51.6 +0.29 Rupiah\n\n14110.\n\n14123 +0.09\n\nRupee\n\n70.868\n\n71.02 +0.22 Ringgit\n\n4.178\n\n4.184 +0.14\n\n7.055\n\n7.0890 +0.48\n\n*Thai markets are\n\nclosed for holiday\n\nChange so far in\n\nCurrency\n\nLatest End\n\nMove Japan yen\n\n108.33 109.56 +1.14\n\nSing dlr\n\n1.369\n\n1.3627 -0.45 Taiwan dlr\n\n30.580 30.733 +0.50 Korean won\n\n1183.5 1115.70 -5.73\n\n30.410\n\n32.55 +7.04 Peso\n\n51.450\n\n52.47 +1.98 Rupiah\n\n14110.\n\n14375 +1.88\n\nRupee\n\n70.868\n\n69.77 -1.55 Ringgit\n\n4.178\n\n4.1300 -1.15 Yuan\n\n7.055\n\n6.8730 -2.58\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/35t1VEp\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "EM ASIA FX-Asian currencies firm on signs of U.S.-China breakthrough", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA8F0KP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
