But playing them for a living isn't all sunshine and roses.\n\nGame-streaming has taken off in recent years, thanks in part to the growing number of incredible games released each year, and lowered barriers to entry: Webcams and microphones aren't expensive, and most new computers these days have more than enough power to handle playing a game and streaming it online simultaneously.\n\nThousands of people have turned their game-playing habits into full-fledged careers. Many don't reach the heights of, say, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, who rose to fame after rappers Drake and Travis Scott played \"Fortnite\" with him on Twitch one fateful night (\"Fortnite\" was the most popular game in the world at the time, and Blevins is one of its best players, which helps). But even if you don't become a celebrity through streaming, people can still make a decent living from playing video games in front of a live audience.\n\nStill, playing games for a living isn't easy \u2014 or fun all the time.\n\nWe talked to eight professional gamers, who stream games for a living or play them professionally in tournaments around the world, and we asked them about the biggest upsides and downsides to their chosen profession.
