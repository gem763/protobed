So, if he follows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency. I would argue for him to go back to the status quo. The safe zones were working, patrolling with Turkey and international forces to protect the Kurds and Turkey is the way to go. If we pull out, the Kurds are in a world of hurt, and ISIS comes back, and President Trump will own it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is Obama. Obama did the same thing in Iraq.\u201d\n\nGraham later stated, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a lie that the \u2014 that ISIS has been defeated. The caliphate\u2019s been destroyed, but it will reemerge.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's \"Fox & Friends,\" Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) stated that President Trump's tweet about | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Lindsey-Graham-pointing-closeup-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
