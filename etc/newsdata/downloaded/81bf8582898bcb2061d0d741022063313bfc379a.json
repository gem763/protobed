He grew up among the green valleys and hills of KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nIn September Rob won R1 million and a brand-new car when he was crowned winner of the seventh season of reality series Survivor South Africa.\n\n\u201cWow, so many positive things have happened to me. I\u2019m extremely happy,\u201d Rob says in an exclusive interview with YOU. \u201cI\u2019d like to be back on TV soon \u2013 the presenter of my own show which will include adventure, travel and positive talking points.\u201d\n\nHe can\u2019t reveal more at this stage. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know,\u201d he promises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crazy about Jozi. The pace is fast and you get a lot done. KwaZulu-Natal is so beautiful, you focus on that and don\u2019t get around to working,\u201d he jokes.\n\nHe travels a lot for work, especially to Cape Town and Durban, and he tries to visit his family as often as possible. \u201cIn work in the entertainment industry. I enjoy doing MC work and motivational speaking to share the lessons I learned on the island in Samoa.\n\n\u201cI speak at schools, free of charge. My life has been changed for the better and I\u2019m extremely grateful for that. I want to inspire kids.\n\n\u201cI come from humble beginnings in a small town. I had many financial difficulties but now, though it\u2019s exhausting, I\u2019m happy for the opportunity to chase my dreams.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s planning to learn to scuba dive. And next year, he\u2019s set aside 40 days from his schedule to spend time with Buddhist monks in the Himalayas in Nepal.\n\nNext week Rob and Nicole Capper, a finalist on Survivor SA, plan to climb Mafadi in the Drakensberg, the highest mountain peak in SA.\n\nHe still sees some of his fellow \u201ccastaways\u201d, including Dur\u00e3o Mariano and Rocco van Rooyen.\n\n\u201cI just signed a six-month lease [in Joburg] to give me enough time to find a good property investment to buy into,\u201d Rob says. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything big or fancy, just something comfortable, modern and safe.\u201d\n\nThough he enjoys the fast pace of Jozi, he says, \u201cWhen I need to slow things down, I take a drive to the Magaliesberg to unwind and get in touch with nature again. I miss my family in KZN. Also, it\u2019s that culture of ubuntu that I miss the most about Zululand, my heart will always be there no matter what.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not interested in the lavish lifestyle, he says. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a kid from the bush who\u2019s hungry for adventure.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future, he\u2019d like his fans to know he\u2019s not planning on leaving anytime soon. \u201cSouth Africa is my home. And I want to keep inspiring them like I did on Survivor.\u201d", "description": "\u201cAll the work is here,\u201d Rob Bentele tells us from Johannesburg, where he lives now.
