But it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the end of the \u201cendless war.\u201d Islamism, in all its fury and diversity, goes marching on.\n\nFive years ago, Baghdadi was proclaimed (by his followers) the caliph \u2014 successor to the Prophet Mohammed. Even Osama bin Laden was never so audacious.\n\nThe Islamic State in Iraq, a splinter from al Qaeda, had been organized in 2006. Eight years later it re-branded as the Islamic State \u2014 successor to the Ottoman caliphate which collapsed less than a century ago, an historical blink of the eye.\n\nAt its zenith, the Islamic State occupied a territory the size of Great Britain, established \u201cprovinces\u201d in a dozen other countries, ordered up terrorist attacks in Europe, and attracted volunteers from around the world.\n\nSome young Muslim men came from impoverished lands where opportunities for meaningful employment and marriageable women were scarce. Others came from America and Europe, drawn to what they imagined would be an exciting lifestyle \u2014 wielding AK-47s, zipping around in the fighting vehicles known as \u201ctechnicals,\u201d slave-raiding, and occasionally slitting the throats of infidels and apostates.\n\nStill others, men and women alike, regarded themselves as pious pioneers. They were eager to contribute to what they saw as the restoration of the power and glory that had been stolen from the global Islamic community by the forces of unbelief and their wayward Muslim allies.\n\nThe death of Baghdadi deals a devastating blow to the Islamic State. One obvious reason: His skills and stature will be difficult to replace. One not-so-obvious reason: In the theology to which Baghdadi subscribed, it is Allah who decides the outcome of battles and wars. That the caliph \u2014 not just a soldier seeking martyrdom \u2014 could be taken down by Delta Force operators and Army Rangers suggests to the faithful that his mission lacked divine endorsement.\n\nStill, the Islamic State will attempt to reinvent itself. Military strategist David J. Kilcullen warned this week that it \u201cmay prove even harder to defeat in its next incarnation.\u201d\n\nIt always surprises me how many government officials, academics and journalists, after all these years, remain confused about Islamists \u2014 who they are, what they believe, why they fight.\n\nThat was vividly illustrated by the headlines that appeared online Sunday morning over Jody Warwick\u2019s otherwise informative Washington Post obituary of Baghdadi. The first read: \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Islamic State\u2019s \u2018terrorist-in-chief,\u2019 dies at 48.\u201d\n\nSome Post editors apparently considered that insufficiently respectful of the deceased. The next version read: \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48.\u201d\n\nAs \u201cabsurdly deferential as this headline is\u201d noted M. Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, \u201cit confirms what Islamists \u2014 including those appearing in the pages of the Washington Post \u2014 strenuously deny: that Baghdadi was actually a respected \u2018scholar\u2019 of the global Islamist establishment.\u201d\n\nPost copy editors gave it another try: \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48.\u201d That\u2019s better, though a casual reader might assume he had slipped in the bathtub rather than been chased into a dead-end tunnel by American commandos.\n\nTwo questions strike me as worth further consideration. How odd it is to think of Baghdadi as \u201caustere\u201d? True, in his youth, he was offended \u201cat the sight of men and women dancing in the same room,\u201d as Mr. Warwick duly reports. But when he assumed the mantle of caliph, he \u201ckept a number of personal sex slaves\u201d including Yazidi women, and Kayla Mueller, an American hostage who eventually died in captivity.\n\nAs for Baghdadi\u2019s Islamic scholarship, he had degrees from the University of Baghdad and the Saddam University for Islamic Studies to prove it. How well do you think a non-Muslim arguing that \u201cIslam is a religion of peace\u201d would have fared in a debate against him?\n\nNevertheless, I disagree with those on the far right who argue \u2014 as Baghdadi would have \u2014 that less belligerent readings of Islam should be dismissed as inauthentic and even heretical.\n\nWhich brings me to a final point that goes against the conventional grain: The ideology which Baghdadi espoused and the goals for which he fought do not significantly differ from those of al Qaeda, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nTrue, Muslim Brothers prefer a tie and jacket to a turban and dishdasha. True, too, Iranian followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini may be well-educated, cultured, fluent in the language of diplomacy, and comfortable in the company of (friendly and compliant) unbelievers. Also true: The strategies these factions employ are not identical.\n\nHowever, all believe in the imperative of Islamic supremacy, envisioning a world ruled by and for Muslims, one in which infidels are at least relegated to an inferior status. All believe in \u201cDeath to America!\u201d And all are prepared to wage an \u201cendless war\u201d if that\u2019s what it takes to achieve their objectives.\n\nAs Baghdadi\u2019s followers mourn, what may give them hope is the war-weariness and isolationism rising on both the right and left in America.\n\nPresident Trump deserves credit for eliminating the leader of the Islamic State. But I hope he now realizes that had he withdrawn all American forces from Syria months ago, cutting off the American partnership with the Kurds \u2014 who supplied critical intelligence on Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts \u2014 this mission could not have been accomplished.\n\nAwful as the prospect of endless war may be, conceiving a worse alternative should not require much stretching of the imagination.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
