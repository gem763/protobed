Boeing is currently updating the plane, which has been grounded since March, but has defended its design as safe.\n\nThe updates have not yet been approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration or its equivalent regulators around the world.\n\nThe final report, released today, criticized Boeing for not including details about the MCAS system in manuals and training for the plane's pilots.\n\n\"The absence of information about the MCAS in the aircraft manuals and pilot training made it difficult for the flight crew to diagnose problems and apply the corrective procedures,\" the report said.\n\nAn audio recording from a meeting between American Airlines pilots and Boeing executives after the Lion Air crash that was shared with Business Insider showed the pilots confronting Boeing for not sharing details about the system.\n\n\"I would think that there would be a priority of putting explanations of things that could kill you,\" one pilot then said.\n\nLion Air victim mourning More", "description": "Indonesian investigators pointed to Boeing's plane design, as well as how Lion Air and its pilots responded to its faults, as reasons for the crash.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nZhlFZYJkQzrX8jVgxH9Mw--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/3f65f7b21d735bb5c3682c57a23d1712", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
