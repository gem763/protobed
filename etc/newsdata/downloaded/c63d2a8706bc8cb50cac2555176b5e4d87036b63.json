Now he wants kids to find their own \u2018superpower\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The Seattle-area-based cartoonist has also kicked off a \u201cDo Good\u201d book tour to promote his latest Dog Man bestseller, \u201cFor Whom the Ball Rolls,\u201d The tour has brought him to Washington, D.C., including for a Library of Congress special performance from \u201cDog Man: The Musical\u201d on Friday evening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPilkey chatted with Book World en route to Washington to discuss how dyslexia motivated him, why his books get banned and how his comics reach young readers. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: You have used puns like \u201cThe Hallo-weiner\u201d in your books. What\u2019s your most shameless pun?\n\nA: It might be \u201cHally Tosis.\u201d And I can\u2019t take credit for that \u2014 that\u2019s my dad\u2019s joke. We had a dog when I was a kid and her name was Halle, and she did have a horrible breath. My dad used to call her \u201cHalle Tosis.\u201d And I just thought that was a funny, cutesy little name until I was a little bit older and I realized what it was.\n\nQ: At what age were you diagnosed with attention deficit and dyslexia?\n\nAD\n\nA: I was probably about 8. They didn\u2019t have the term ADHD. They called it extreme hyperactivity disorder. Back in those days, the specialists prescribed caffeine for me, so I was drinking coffee for breakfast.\n\nAD\n\nQ: How did that work out?\n\nA: The only way I could get it down was, my mom would put in chocolate syrup with cream. I think I was so buzzed off the sugar that it didn\u2019t quite work out.\n\nQ: And you had to sit in the hall in elementary school?\n\nA: So little was known about those conditions back in those days, and I think it was just seen as I was distracting everyone in the class with my silliness. I couldn\u2019t stay in my chair and keep my mouth shut. So the teachers from second to fifth grade just put me in the hall. It ended up being kind of a blessing for me, too, because it gave me time to draw and to create stories and comics. I guess I made lemonade out of it.\n\nAD\n\nQ: So you created Captain Underpants while in school?\n\nA: I did. And Dog Man, as well. They were the first comics that I remember creating. In fact, my second-grade teacher gave me the idea for Captain Underpants. She mentioned underwear in class and everyone laughed and I was like: \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good subject. I\u2019ll do something with that.\u201d And so that was that.\n\nAD\n\nQ: So while you were sitting in the hall, you were also sitting on a future publishing empire?\n\nA: Making comics was a way for me to stay connected to my classmates. I wasn\u2019t just a kid in the hallway. I guess in a way I\u2019m still trying to connect with my readers.\n\nQ: You must hear from young readers who tell you about their own difficulties and why your books help them.\n\nAD\n\nA: I do. That\u2019s actually one of the reasons I love to go out on the road and tour so much. Sometimes they\u2019re proud in a way. There will be kids who will have posters they hold up that say that they\u2019ve \u201cgot dyslexia like Dav,\u201d or they\u2019ll tell me proudly that they have ADHD. I don\u2019t call it Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. I call it Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Delightfulness. I want kids to know that there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. You just think differently, and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s good to think differently. This world needs people who think differently; it\u2019s your superpower.\n\nAD\n\nQ: Why do you think Captain Underpants gets challenged so much and ends up on Banned Books lists?\n\nA: I can only talk about what they say \u2014 that it encourages children to misbehave or question authority. I don\u2019t know that questioning authority is a bad thing. I think that\u2019s actually a good thing, and I don\u2019t think it encourages kids to misbehave \u2014 they\u2019re going to misbehave anyway. I hope it encourages kids to think for themselves and to use their imagination. I don\u2019t see a problem with that. That banning, I don\u2019t really understand it, but not everybody likes the same thing. I get that.\n\nAD\n\nQ: What is the focus of your current \u201cDo Good\u201d tour?\n\nA: The theme is something that came from the books. There\u2019s a character named Petey, and then this little kitten comes along, and slowly the bad guy is starting to change. It might sound corny, but the power of love is transforming him. I was really surprised that the kids are responding to that. This was kind of my story, as well, trying to be a better person now. The newest book explores the idea of doing good. I\u2019m turning that into a verb and an action word: If you see a kid eating lunch by himself at school, invite him over. That\u2019s how we can all do good. We formed a tour around that whole idea, and we have this wall where kids can write how they\u2019re going to do good. Some of the things that the kids come up with are funny, and some of them are just sweet. Some of them bring tears to your eyes.\n\nAD\n\nQ: And now, as you bring the tour to D.C., you\u2019ll get to see numbers from your musical performed in a Library of Congress setting.\n\nA: I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s all happening together. We\u2019re just so excited to have everybody [from the cast] in Washington, D.C., because I am such a huge fan of [Librarian of Congress] Carla Hayden and all the work that she does. She\u2019s out there doing good.\n\nAs part of the year-long National Book Festival Presents series, Pilkey is appearing at the Library of Congress on Friday at 7 p.m.\n\nAD", "description": "The \u201cCaptain Underpants\u201d author has launched a \u201cDo Good\u201d book tour for his latest \u201cDog Man\u201d release.", "authors": ["Michael Cavna", "Writer Artist For Comic Riffs", "Covering Visual Storytelling", "Cartoon Art Illustration", "Comedy Satire"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9gTnscxarpF4qCz4KxeQa_5kwE8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F5UXPPXMKQI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
