Franklin/AP)\n\nCindy McCain is voicing a dim view of some of the ways the Republican Party is doing business in 2019.\n\nAsked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election during an episode of Politico\u2019s \u201cWomen Rule\u201d podcast that was released Wednesday, the widow of John McCain, the longtime Republican senator from Arizona, pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that \u201cit\u2019s not functioning well\u201d and excludes people who aren\u2019t \u201cwalking the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not right,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the party my husband and I belonged to.\u201d\n\nWhile those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party\u2019s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state\u2019s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized \u2014 and vocal \u2014 Latino population and transplants from around the country.\n\nIt was unclear from the interview whether McCain was speaking at times about the broader Republican Party or specifically about the Arizona arm of the GOP. The Washington Post reached out to a representative for McCain seeking clarification but did not immediately receive a response.\n\n\u201cI can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.\u201d\n\n[The 2020 electoral map could be the smallest in years. Here\u2019s why.]\n\nHer home state, which her husband represented in Congress for more than 35 years, is among a small cluster of reliably red states that could turn blue next year.\n\nArizona, with its 11 electoral votes, may prove an attractive target for Democrats heading into next year.\n\n\u201cThe Arizona as you knew it is gone,\u201d Republican pollster Bill McInturff told The Washington Post in August.\n\nIn other parts of McCain\u2019s wide-ranging, half-hour-long interview, she reflected on her life as a special ed teacher, a political spouse and her courtship with the late senator. No longer a political spouse in the year since her husband\u2019s death, McCain has focused her efforts on bringing civility back into politics.\n\nIn the interview, McCain lamented that much of the political discourse has \u201cdegenerated into name calling.\u201d She didn\u2019t linger on President Trump, who feuded with and often insulted the late senator \u2014 even after his death in 2018 from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. McCain characterized the president and vitriol from the House and Senate as \u201ccertainly not helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen the last of men like my husband,\u201d McCain said, \u201cat least for right now.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018We got things done\u2019: Biden recalls \u2018civility\u2019 with segregationist senators\n\nPerspective: Here\u2019s how political science explains the GOP\u2019s obsession with civility\n\nTrump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help for Biden investigation, memo shows", "description": "The wife of the late U.S. senator also predicted a Democratic sweep of Arizona come 2020.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N-wIYRhaApciE9N75_zSmMHDEW8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KHW2SJGD5YI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
