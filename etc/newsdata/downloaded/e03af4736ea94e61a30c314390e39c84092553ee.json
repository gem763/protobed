Crude prices fell for a third day in a row on Thursday after Riyadh said it was back up and fully running, triggering more clawback of the risk premium factored into a barrel.\n\nWall Street\u2019s slide on fresh developments related to a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump also curbed risk appetite. After days of pressure by Democrats, the White House released a reconstructed transcript of a call between the president and his Ukrainian counterpart, where Trump is heard asking a \u201cfavor\u201d before discussing a corruption probe in the East European nation that links to his political rival former VP Joe Biden.\n\nwas down 50 cents, or nearly 1%, at $55.99 per barrel by 12:55 PM ET (16:55 GMT)\n\nslid 23 cents, or 0.4%, to $62.16.\n\nOil jumped as much as $8 a barrel, or nearly 15%, right after the Saudi attack, which briefly disrupted about 5% of daily global crude production.\n\nThe rally came as industry experts and veterans predicted it would take many weeks, even months, for the kingdom to regain full output at its damaged Abqaiq crude processing plant, which turned out 5.7 million bpd before the attack. There was also fears that Riyadh and the United States might launch a military offensive against Iran, which they accused of carrying out the attack but has denied the charge.\n\nThe speculation has come to nought, with Saudi Arabia saying on Wednesday it now had a higher oil production capacity, at more than 11 million bpd. The kingdom and the U.S. have also softened their stance on any response to the attack.\n\n\u201cSome doubt still exists about the quality constitution of the current Saudi production capacity, but that is not enough to scare the market,\u201d said Olivier Jakob of Zug, Switzerland-based oil risk consultancy PetroMatrix.\n\nRiyadh\u2019s lightning pace in restoring production after the attack, ostensibly to safeguard the IPO prospects of its state oil company Aramco, has taken a toll on the risk pricing in oil. Crude prices retrenched within days nearly 8% of their initial gains and more than 4% in the past three days.
