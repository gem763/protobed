With the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949, Mao declared: \u201cOurs will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation. We have stood up.\u201d After the political crisis in 1989 and the widespread disillusionment that followed the brutal crackdown at Tiananmen Square, the Chinese Communist Party began a nationwide patriotic education campaign to encourage pride in China\u2019s achievements and in the party for helping the country overcome a \u201ccentury of national humiliation.\u201d\n\nSuch propaganda has been surprisingly effective at creating room for the government to maneuver amid international challenges. For example, in 2013, as tensions escalated with Japan, instead of using force, Beijing employed fiery words and demanded that foreign aircraft identify themselves and comply with Chinese instructions when flying over the East China Sea. In 2001, after a midair collision with an American spy plane, China defused the crisis by mourning the \u201cmartyred\u201d pilot while avoiding a repeat of the anti-American demonstrations that had swept the country in 1999. In my research, I have found that the government has helped shore up public approval by reminding citizens of the nation\u2019s long struggle and emphasizing that China will ultimately prevail by biding its time for future success.\n\nYet this strategy has costs. Chinese leaders risk tying their hands in the long run if invoking historical grievances hardens the public\u2019s desire for vindication in the future. Opinion polls show that the public is hawkish on territorial disputes and American military operations in Asia, making it hard for Beijing to reassure the region that its intentions are peaceful. And each time the government spins up and then winds down nationalist anger, whether online or in the streets, it breeds resentment against its heavy-handed manipulation. Blanketing the airwaves and the internet with propaganda may foster the appearance of conformity, but it also hides public disenchantment.\n\nAnd under Mr. Xi, nationalism has taken on a particularly virulent form. The government has detained more than a million of its Muslim minorities in Xinjiang Province and sought to \u201cSinicize religion\u201d by replacing expressions of ethnic and religious identity with patriotic slogans. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s attempts to inculcate loyalty and squelch opposition among the diaspora in Taiwan and Hong Kong have aroused concerns that Beijing cares more about its vision of ethnic unity than respect for sovereignty and the rule of law. These efforts may bolster the hand of those in the United States promoting a new \u201cred scare\u201d that targets ethnic Chinese and policies that restrict scientific research on the basis of national origin.\n\nFor all of Mr. Xi\u2019s rhetoric about \u201ca China solution to humani\u00adty\u2019s search for better social systems,\u201d the Chinese Communist Party has not tried to export its ideology or system of government, unlike Soviet efforts to spread communism or American programs to promote democracy. In seeking to make the world safer for the party, Beijing has made it easier for authoritarian states to coexist alongside democracies. Mr. Xi\u2019s overriding focus is not on spreading his brand of autocracy, but on eliminating risks to his rule at home and securing his nation\u2019s economic growth and security.", "description": "From climate change to Taiwan, China\u2019s foreign policy is about impressing the masses at home, not fighting enemies abroad.", "authors": ["Jessica Chen Weiss"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/opinion/sunday/29ChenWeiss/29ChenWeiss-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
