REUTERS/Stringer NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES\n\nTurkey has been poised to advance into northeast Syria since the U.S. troops began vacating the area in an abrupt policy shift by U.S. President Donald Trump widely criticised in Washington as a betrayal of America\u2019s Kurdish militia allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkish officials told Reuters that the military had struck the Syrian-Iraqi border to prevent Kurdish forces using the route to reinforce the region, though details of the strikes were hazy.\n\nAnkara has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in order to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil, but the scheme has alarmed some Western allies as much as the risks posed by the military operation itself.\n\nFor Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria as terrorists because of their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey, an influx of non-Kurdish Syrians would help it secure a buffer against its main security threat.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s communications director Fahrettin Altun said YPG fighters could either defect or Ankara would have to \u201cstop them from disrupting\u201d what he described as Turkey\u2019s struggle against Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly,\u201d Altun wrote in a tweet and in a column published in the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cTurkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,\u201d he said.Turkey\u2019s Demiroren news agency (DHA) said Syrian rebels travelled from northwest Syria to Turkey in preparation for the incursion in Syria\u2019s northeast.\n\nThey will be based in the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, it said, across the border from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, with 14,000 of them gradually joining the offensive.\n\nThe Hamza Brigade rebels from the National Army, the main rebel grouping that Turkey supports in northwest Syria, travelled in a convoy of buses accompanied by trucks loaded with ammunition, DHA said.\n\nA large convoy of buses carrying Syrian rebel fighters and trucks loaded with equipment arrived at the Turkish border town of Akcakale early on Wednesday, a Reuters witness said.\n\nAt Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad, howitzers were deployed behind earth embankments and pointed towards Syria, a Reuters witness said on Tuesday. Multiple launch rocket systems were stationed at Suruc, some 60 km (40 miles) to the west, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani, he said.\n\nERDOGAN VISIT\n\nThe prospect of a military offensive has unsettled Turkish financial markets, with the lira this week hitting its weakest level since late August. The currency TRYTOM=D3 firmed slightly to 5.8220 against the dollar on Wednesday morning.\n\nErdogan will visit the United States on Nov. 13 at Trump\u2019s invitation, a White House spokesman said. On Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw after a phone call he had with Trump, adding that talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would continue.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\u201d U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington\u2019s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, said it was not told in advance by Washington or Turkey about any agreements to pull U.S. troops.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nKurdish-led forces have denounced the U.S. policy shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nSignalling a further potential shift in the region\u2019s power balance, the Kurdish-led forces said they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. withdrawal.\n\nTrump denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it acted \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria.", "description": "Turkish forces and Syrian rebel allies will cross the Syrian border \"shortly\", a Turkish official said early on Wednesday, as a surprise withdrawal of U.S. troops made way for the Turkish incursion.", "authors": ["Ece Toksabay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438671286&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9803U", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
