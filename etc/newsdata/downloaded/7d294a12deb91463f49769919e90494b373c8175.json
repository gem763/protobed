But Senate Republicans will have to battle with House Democrats, who included no border wall money in their version of the homeland security bill.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of damn money. I mean, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who said he will not be able to support the legislation because of the wall money.\n\nHe complained that he didn\u2019t have any clue how the $5 billion would be spent, and he asserted that Homeland Security Department officials don\u2019t know either.\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito, the Republican chair of the subcommittee, disputed that. She said Homeland Security presented a lengthy justification for its border wall plans last year, delivering a thick volume of plans and an extensive briefing on how the money would be used.\n\n\u201cWith the $5 billion that\u2019s in this bill, this gets us through the top 17 in the high-priority areas,\u201d Ms. Capitol said.\n\nThe $5 billion matches what Mr. Trump requested in his 2020 budget submission earlier this year.\n\nHe made the same request last year, but Congress ended up approving just $1.375. Mr. Trump then turned around and declared a border emergency and grabbed billions of dollars in Pentagon money he directed toward wall-building.\n\nThat move continues to irk senators in both parties.\n\n\u201cThere is a line here that I believe has been overstepped,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican.\n\nShe said she will back the $5 billion in this bill, but said she\u2019ll vote later this week to end Mr. Trump\u2019s latest emergency declaration earlier this month that redirected an additional $3.6 billion in Pentagon money to wall building.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
