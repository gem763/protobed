Axon provides dashcams under a brand of products called Axon Fleet, and the company told the board that the next generation of its cameras will include the readers.\n\nThe cameras will be able to process video of license plates through a laptop in an officer\u2019s car. While some police departments already use readers mounted to their cars, Axon believes that a camera sitting on a dashboard \u201cwill enable agencies to deploy ALPRs more broadly than before, potentially across an agency\u2019s entire fleet of cars,\u201d according to the board\u2019s report.\n\nUnder \u201cideal conditions\u201d \u2014 based on lighting, distance, and vehicle speed \u2014 Axon says its camera \u201capproaches\u201d 100 percent accuracy, but will register a scan if it is 90 percent confident in its accuracy. The board\u2019s report notes that the cameras will likely also be able to recognize vehicle characteristics.\n\nALPR has been a controversial law enforcement tool. Privacy advocates have questioned the wisdom of giving police the power to closely monitor the movement of vehicles, and errors in a system could be disastrous. Axon, which, along with the Taser, has produced surveillance tools like body cams, will likely have its ALPR tool closely monitored by civil rights groups.\n\nAs part of the announcement, the company\u2019s ethics board released recommendations on how ALPR should be regulated. Among other suggestions, the board recommends law enforcement have a clear ALPR policy, that data on their use is shared widely, that ALPR systems are audited, and that cars aren\u2019t stopped solely because of an ALPR hit.\n\n\u201cWithout regulatory intervention,\u201d the company\u2019s ethics board writes, \u201cthere is a risk that competition will encourage a race-to-the-bottom of more pervasive and more powerful surveillance.\u201d", "description": "Axon, formerly known as Taser, is entering another controversial surveillance business: the automatic license plate reader industry.", "authors": ["Colin Lecher", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZSO6CXVVK4v_JOd4-_gyrgscMk=/0x385:5376x3200/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19306575/1177152936.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
