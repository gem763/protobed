PG&E has warned that they might have to do without power for days after the winds subside because \"every inch\" of the power system must be inspected by helicopters and thousands of groundworkers and declared safe before the grid is reactivated.\n\n\"It's just kind of scary. It feels worse than Y2K. We don't know how long,\" Tianna Pasche of Oakland said before her area was powered down. \"My two kids, their school situation keeps moving every second. It's not clear if we need to pack for a week and go out of town or what to do. So I'm just trying to make sure we have water, food, charging stations and gas.\"\n\n\"For me, this is a major inconvenience in my life as a parent but also, if it saves a life, I'm not going to complain about it,\" she said.\n\nResidents of the Oakland Hills, where a wildfire in 1991 killed 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes, spent the morning buying bottled water, getting cash and filling their cars with gas.\n\nIn the northern wine country, most of downtown Sonoma was pitch black when Joseph Pokorski, a retiree, showed up for his morning ritual of drinking coffee, followed by beer and cocktails.\n\nThe Town Square bar was open and lit by lanterns, but coffee was out of the question and only cash was accepted. Pokorski decided to forgo a 30-minute wait for a cup of joe from the bakery next door and move on to beers and a couple greyhound cocktails of vodka and grapefruit juice.\n\n\"I'm not a coffee freak,\" Pokorski said. \"I can take it or leave. It's no big thing.\"\n\nIn the El Dorado Hills east of Sacramento, California, Ruth Self and her son were taking an outage in stride while leaving a Safeway grocery store that had been stripped nearly bare of bottled water and ice.\n\nSelf said she wasn't upset, given the lives lost nearly a year ago in Paradise, invoking images of people who burned in their cars trying to escape.\n\n\"I just can't imagine,\" she said. \"Hopefully (the outages) are only for a couple days. I think it's more of a positive than a negative. Ask me again on Friday night when I haven't had a shower in two days, when I've had to spend two days playing card games.\"\n\nThere was some good news. PG&E also announced that by reconfiguring its power system, it had restored electricity to 44,000 customers who weren't in areas of high fire risk, and it could bring back power to 60,000 to 80,000 customers in the Humboldt area, where gusty winds had subsided.\n\nAlso because of shifting forecasts, the utility said it was reducing the third phase of its blackout plan, set to begin Thursday, to only about 4,600 customers in Kern County \u2014 one-tenth of the original estimate.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the unprecedented blackouts sparked anger. A customer threw eggs at a PG&E office in Oroville. A PG&E truck was hit by a bullet that shattered a window in Colusa County before Wednesday's outages, although authorities couldn't immediately say whether it was targeted. PG&E put up barricades around its San Francisco headquarters.\n\n\"We realize and understand the impact and the hardship\" from the outages, said Sumeet Singh, head of PG&E's Community Wildfire Safety Program. But he urged people not to take it out on PG&E workers.\n\n\"They have families that live in your communities, they have friends, they are members of your communities,\" he said. \"They're doing this work in the interest of your safety.\"\n\nPG&E took drastic action because of hot, dry Diablo winds sweeping into Northern California, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist. They were also part of a California-wide weather system that will produce Santa Ana winds in the south in the next day or so, he said.\n\n\"These (weather) events historically are the events that cause the most destructive wildfires in California history,\" Strenfel said.\n\nWinds gusting as high as 70 mph in places were forecast to begin hitting Southern California later Thursday. Southern California Edison warned that it might cut power to nearly 174,000 customers in nine counties, including Los Angeles and its surrounding areas. San Diego Gas & Electric has notified about 30,000 customers they could lose power in back-country areas.\n\nWhile many people said the blackouts were a necessity, others were outraged \u2014 the word that Gov. Gavin Newsom used in arguing that PG&E should have been working on making its power system sturdier and more weather-proof.\n\n\"They're in bankruptcy due to their terrible management going back decades,\" Newsom said in San Diego. \"They've created these conditions. It was unnecessary.\"\n\nSingh said the utility has more than 8,000 employees and contractors who have been clearing brush, inspecting power lines and putting power lines underground.\n\nBut he said the power grid wasn't built to withstand the changing weather and the previous safety factor \"no longer exists.\"\n\nAlthough fire agencies had beefed up their crews because of red-flag conditions of extreme fire danger, very few fires were currently burning in California. Only a tiny fraction of acreage has burned, so far, this year compared with recent years, though no one has attributed that to the power cuts.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMelley reported from Los Angeles.
