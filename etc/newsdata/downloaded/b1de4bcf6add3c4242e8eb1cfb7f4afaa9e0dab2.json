Another baby is being treated and four recovered\n\nThe deaths, he said, 'may have been a result of the infection complicating an already vulnerable state.'\n\nAs a precaution, the hospital is transferring babies born at less than 32 weeks' gestation to other hospitals and diverting other expected premature deliveries to other hospitals. Full-term pregnancies amount to 40 weeks of gestation.\n\n'It's important to remember that we are only talking about diverting these very premature infants, less than 32 weeks, both the moms who would be delivering at that age or the babies already born,' said Dr Rosemary Leeming, the hospital's chief medical officer.\n\nDoctors said they first became aware of an unusual infection in early August.\n\nThe neonatal intensive care unit is inside a children's hospital that is part of a larger campus. It could take weeks to determine how the infections occurred, although it's likely the pathogen was brought in from outside the children's hospital, investigators said.\n\nCultures of the water supply and surfaces inside the neonatal intensive care unit, where all the infections occurred, tested negative for Pseudomonas, officials said.\n\nPseudomonas is a very common germ in the environment, found in water, dirt and plants.\n\nIt also naturally and harmlessly lives on some people's armpit or genital skin.\n\nThe average person isn't very vulnerable to infection by Pseudomonas, but people on ventilators or with open burn wounds are susceptible.\n\nAnd it can become quickly lethal to them.\n\nHospitals are one of the more common settings for outbreaks of the infection, which can spread if employees' hands and equipment are not properly cleaned.\n\nWorryingly, pseuomonas is one of several infections often associated with hospitals that is becoming increasingly hard to treat because it's developing antibiotic resistance.\n\nAuthorities are currently trying to track down where the Geisinger outbreak might have originated, but have little more than guesses at the moment.\n\n'It's really too soon to say exactly where the organism is coming from, but the information we have so far suggests that it's someplace outside of the neonatal intensive care unit,' said Dr Mark Shelly, Geisinger's director of infection control and prevention.\n\nThe hospital has increased chlorination of water, bolstered water filtering, performed extra cleaning and changed some of its processes.\n\nThe investigation may not reveal exactly what went wrong, Shelly said.\n\nSeven of the eight babies were born at less than 26 weeks of gestation, and the eighth was born at less than 27 weeks', according to the hospital.\n\nThe Danville hospital's neonatal intensive care unit treats more than 600 babies a year.", "description": "A Pennsylvania hospital is racing to determine the source of a waterborne germ that appears to have infected at least eight babies in the ICU there.
