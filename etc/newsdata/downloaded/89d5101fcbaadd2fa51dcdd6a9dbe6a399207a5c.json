In his killing spree, which lasted seven minutes between 12:53 and 13:00 CEST, Michael H. entered his office of the police headquarters, mortally wounding two police officers who were having lunch, then trying to enter another office where three others were on a break but could not go past the locked door. He then attacked another employee, who died of her injuries, and wounded another before he was stopped by a 24-year-old intern, who shot him.\n\nHe used two knives \u2014 one of them an oyster knife \u2014 he had bought on the morning of the attack.\n\nHe had no criminal record, but had been charged, and eventually acquitted, of domestic violence.\n\nHis wife, 38, remains in custody, the prosecutor said.", "description": "In the weeks leading up to the attack, he had adopted an increasingly radicalised behaviour, the prosecutor said, justifying the terror attacks on Charlie Hebdo newspaper that left 12 dead in Paris in 2015, trading his clothes for traditional religious ones and stopping to have contact with women.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/88/76/1000x563_cmsv2_0236fb49-0c05-5cd4-a94e-d662dee6a349-4208876.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
