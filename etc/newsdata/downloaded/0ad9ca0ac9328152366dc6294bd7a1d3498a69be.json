REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nThe decision by the German cabinet was expected after a source told Reuters on Tuesday that Finance Minister Olaf Scholz had chosen Schnabel to replace Sabine Lautenschlaeger, another German, who resigned from the ECB board last month after unsuccessfully opposing more ECB stimulus.\n\nScholz confirmed Schnabel\u2019s nomination on Wednesday and lauded her as a very good candidate for the ECB job.\n\n\u201cShe is an outstanding economist and proven expert in banking and monetary policy issues. She will convince my colleagues in Europe and do a good job in the ECB for the euro zone and for our country,\u201d Scholz said.\n\nA member of the German Council of Economic Experts, the country\u2019s \u201cwise men\u201d, since 2014, the 48-year-old Schnabel is considered a well-connected economic expert and skilled communicator.\n\nWhile Lautenschlaeger was a top bank supervisor, she lacked expertise in monetary policy, and her critics said she was not a powerful enough voice to defend German interests against more stimulus.\n\n\u201cI am honoured to have been nominated by the German Federal Government to become Executive Director of the European Central Bank,\u201d Schnabel said on Twitter. \u201cIf my appointment is approved by the European bodies, I will do my best to meet the high expectations set in me.\u201d\n\nTRUST\n\nSchnabel has argued that the ECB\u2019s most recent stimulus package was excessive, but within the mandate of the central bank.\n\nWith Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann openly criticising the ECB decision, Schnabel also defended the central bank, warning that too much criticism could undermine trust in the ECB.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous that politicians, journalists and bankers reinforce the narrative that the ECB steals the money of German savers,\u201d Schnabel told the German newspaper Handelsblatt last month. \u201cThe ECB, one of the most important European institutions, is constantly being made a scapegoat in Germany.\u201d\n\nThe nomination of Schnabel could change Germany\u2019s influence on the ECB in a more constructive way - especially if incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde should give her a new portfolio when restructuring responsibilities among board members.\n\n\u201cWith Schnabel, Germany would have an excellent economist on the Board, who has been rather supportive of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy decisions of the last years,\u201d ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said.\n\nIreland\u2019s Philip Lane is expected to remain the ECB\u2019s chief economist, but Schnabel could still get a portfolio more economically oriented than Lautenschlaeger, which would give her more influence on monetary policy decisions.\n\n\u201cSchnabel could also emerge as a Lagarde whisperer, giving Germany a much better and much more constructive influence on ECB decisions than the traditional \u2018nein\u2019,\u201d Brzeski said.\n\nLautenschlaeger will leave the ECB board on Oct. 31, but European officials are unlikely to approve her replacement before December, indicating that Schnabel could take up her new role in late December or early January.", "description": "Germany nominated university professor Isabel Schnabel to the European Central Bank's executive board on Wednesday, giving Berlin an expert voice on the bank's top decision-making body and a possible bridge-builder in a time of deep divisions.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444033797&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0K3", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
