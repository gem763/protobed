According to previous reports, about 50 grave markers were stolen from the Patton Cemetery in 2015 and about a dozen bronze markers were stolen from Rolling Prairie Cemetery in 2012,\u201d the La Porte County Herald-Argus noted.\n\nEach of the flag holders was unique to a veteran\u2019s grave and was purchased by members of that veteran\u2019s family. The holders also represented the different kinds of service, according to WSBT.\n\n\u201cWe just want to try and get these items back for the families, because like I said, you can\u2019t get more disrespectful than actually taking from a grave site from someone that served our country,\u201d said Captain Bill Degnegaard of the La Porte City Police Department.\n\n\u201cAnd this is something the families like to do to honor our veterans, and we would like to get those items back for them,\u201d he concluded.\n\nMany of the flags that were previously in the holders are now lying on the ground.\n\nPatton Cemetery Board Vice President and Center Township Trustee Lisa Peurzakowski said she is saddened by the recent incident.\n\n\u201cThis is sad because these men and women went to war for us so that we could have the freedom that we have now,\u201d she commented. \u201cAnd for somebody to come and take those emblems that were there, put there by the different organizations, steal them and probably scrap them for money, we have no idea, but it\u2019s really sad that it\u2019s come down to where they have to start doing stuff like that.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the La Porte Police Department asked anyone with information about the flag holders to contact the department at 219-362-9446.\n\nHowever, Peurzakowski said this is not the first time Patton Cemetery has had trouble keeping people off of the property at night. She also noted that someone had dumped trash there before.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to have to work on something else. We don\u2019t have any electricity out here, but there\u2019s got to be a way of maybe putting cameras somehow,\u201d she commented.\n\nPeurzakowski also noted that the theft will be probably be discussed at an upcoming board meeting.", "description": "About 40 veteran flag holders were reportedly stolen from graves at a\u00a0cemetery in La Porte, Indiana, this week.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/american-flag-waving-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
