It\u2019s not actually her own registry, of course; it\u2019s a list of all the things she thinks happy couples should register for. Obviously Lawrence, a very wealthy person, already has her own nice set of dinner plates and a yoga mat. But these are the nice dinner plates and yoga mat she thinks you, a regular plebe, should register for on the occasion of your nuptials.\n\nBrowsing around the list, you find a disorienting combination of obvious registry choices and just enough kookiness to convince you that, yes, a celebrity who\u2019s not exactly in touch with the needs of regular people may have had some say in putting this guide together. For instance, a $2,000 indoor exercise bike! Or a copper firepit or an air fryer. Or a whiskey decanter etched to look like a globe. Or, mysteriously, both a Ninja multi-cooker and an Instant Pot? Maybe J.Law and Cooke Maroney are a mixed Ninja/Instant Pot household?\n\nLawrence\u2019s Amazon registry guide seems like just the tip of the iceberg of depressing and confusing celebrity sponcon opportunities in the digital age, and although it\u2019s mildly entertaining to browse her selections, it\u2019s mostly interesting for the way the list nearly destabilizes the very idea of what a wedding registry is. Do people really use their wedding registries to get people to buy them \u2026 moisturizer?!\n\nStay in touch.
