Come quick.' So I ran up the staircase, and I found the princess crumpled in the middle of her room with the telephone to her ear, and she beckoned me to come closer. I could hear what her mother was saying.\n\nShe said, \"Listen. Listen to what mummy's saying\".\n\nMr Burrell claims that Mrs Shand Kydd had been drinking that evening and was 'berating the Princess.'\n\nPrincess Diana previously had a relationship with two Muslim men, heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and Dodi Fayed, the son of billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed.\n\nRoyal expert Phil Dampier, author of Diana: I'm Going to Be Me, told MailOnline: 'We only have Paul Burrell's word for this and of course both Diana and her mother are dead.\n\n'But it is certainly true and well documented that Diana hadn't been talking to her mother for several months when she died and they did have a volatile relationship.\n\n'Mrs Shand Kydd did like a drink and Diana had a habit of ghosting people who disagreed with her, so It's quite possible that these remarks were made.\n\n'But some will find it distasteful for Paul to bring this up now and it will certainly be painful for William and Harry.\n\n'They have said in the past that they feel betrayed by Burrell's constant revelations so this won't go down well either.'\n\nRoyals: Burrell, who served Princess Diana (pictured together in 1994) for ten years, claimed the Princess of Wales called him her 'rock' and the 'only man I ever trusted' - her sons would later accuse him of 'betrayal'\n\nHow William and Harry blasted Burrell's 'betrayal' of their mum Princes William and Harry attacked former royal butler Paul Burrell for his 'cold and overt betrayal' of their mother. In a 2003 statement unprecedented for its strength of feeling, William, then 21 and also speaking on behalf of his younger brother, showed his deep pain at Mr Burrell's revelations in his tell-all book. The Princes said the late Diana, Princess of Wales, would have been 'mortified' at his actions if she were alive today and called on him to put an end to his disclosures. Prince William said in the statement released by Clarence House: 'We cannot believe that Paul who was entrusted with so much could abuse his position in such a cold and overt betrayal. 'It is not only deeply painful for the two of us but also for everyone else affected and it would mortify our mother if she were alive today and, if we might say so, we feel we are more able to speak for our mother than Paul'.\n\nMr Burrell made millions from a series of books about his life with the princess and then secured lucrative deals on reality shows such as I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.\n\nMr Burrell also made a series of claims including one that Diana feared for her life and spoke of a plot to tamper with the brakes of her car before she died in 2003.\n\nIn a rare public statement in 2003, at the height of his fame, Prince William and Prince Harry accused him of betraying their mother and said she would have been mortified by his breach of confidence.\n\nThey said in a statement: 'We cannot believe that Paul, who was entrusted with so much, could abuse his position in such a cold and overt betrayal.\n\n'If we may say so, we feel we are more able to speak for our mother than Paul. We ask Paul to bring these revelations to an end.'\n\nHe added that she said : 'That's what you are. I've raised a wh***, who**** around town with Muslim men.\n\n'You should be ashamed of yourself.' Diana was sobbing, saying 'Mummy, please don't say those words to me.\n\n'Please don't call me those names.' She begged her. She kept begging her not to say it.'\n\nAfter the tirade Diana apparently pulled back from her relationship with her mother, and shortly afterwards she was killed in the car crash in Paris in 1997.", "description": "The former royal servant used an US TV show to claim the Princess of Wales' mother used their final conversation to criticise her choice of men after splitting with Prince Charles.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter", "Joe Middleton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20325090-0-image-a-13_1572353574805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
