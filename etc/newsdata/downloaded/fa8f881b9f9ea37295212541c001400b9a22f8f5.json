The \"Skyscraper\" singer made her affection for Johnson known during Brown's season of The Bachelorette, writing on her Instagram Story at one point, \"Mike I accept your rose.\"\n\nAfter his elimination from Brown's season, Johnson tweeted wondering where his \"future wife\" was. \"I'M RIGHT HERE MIKE I\u2019M RIGHT HERE BOO MY MOM ALREADY LOVES YOU TOO,\" Lovato wrote.\n\nThe 27-year-old singer made an appearance during Brown's Bachelorette finale in July, afterwhich the former pageant queen said she was on board with Lovato and Johnson's possible romance.\n\n\"I definitely have the hookup for Demi, if she wants to be with Mike,\" Brown told ET. \"I would give her my blessing.\"\n\nLast month, Johnson said that \"nothing\" had happened between him and Lovato, outside of their flirting on social media -- but it appears things have changed.\n\nInstagram More\n\nOf course, Johnson isn't the only Bachelorette alum to move on with another high-profile romance. The Texas-based portfolio manager opened up to ET last month about his buddy, Tyler Cameron's, relationship with Gigi Hadid.\n\n\"Tyler is happy,\" Johnson said. \"Tyler is good.\"\n\n\"[Gigi is] beautiful, she is. But what I talk to him about is, 'Bro, what are you doing? Like, how are you getting your abs?'\" he joked. \"Literally, that's what I talk to Tyler about.\"\n\nFans lost their minds earlier this month, when Johnson seemed to hint at a double date with him, Lovato, Cameron and Hadid.\n\n\"So if we do this dbl date, your shirt stays on,\" he commented on an Instagram post of Cameron's from Sept. 5.\n\nET has reached out to Lovato's rep for comment.\n\nSee more on Johnson in the video below, and join ET's Bachelor Nation Facebook group here.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'Bachelorette' Star Mike Johnson Comments on Demi Lovato's Inspiring Bikini Pic\n\n'The Bachelor': Peter Weber, Mike Johnson, Derek Peth and Tyler Cameron's Chances to Be Our Next Lead\n\nMike Johnson Reveals What Happened With Demi Lovato\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "A source tells ET that the pair recently went on their first date in Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8IclFYpppp1Zk22rchDRGQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/864400398dcaaeb21bcff5bacb7a54d5", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
