The director of the Royal Ballet, Kevin O\u2019Hare, announcing Samb\u00e9\u2019s recent promotion to principal dancer, highlighted \u201cthe most wonderful personality\u201d that endears him to audiences and company members alike. Critics are easily slain too: agreeing about his athletically ebullient stage presence. And inevitably, as the second black male dancer to reach the Royal Ballet\u2019s top ranks, he is compared to Carlos Acosta and, like the Cuban star, he has come a long way to reach the heights.\n\n\u201cThat community party,\u201d he goes on with his story, \u201cwas a real dancefest \u2013 everyone would bring their own cakes and drinks and we\u2019d dance. I was four years old and remember noticing people\u2019s thrilled faces, watching my rhythmical movements. I was lucky enough to be born into a neighbourhood of African immigrants from Guinea and the Portuguese colonies. I knew dances like kizomba and funana \u2013 all the African rhythms.\u201d\n\nIt was the community centre\u2019s psychologist who first suggested Samb\u00e9 become a professional. \u201cMaria Rosa was an incredible friend and always took care of me. She said: \u2018You live dance, you breathe dance \u2013 do it. You can do it as a career.\u2019\u201d At the time, he had been watching Fame on television and that clinched it: \u201cI want to be at a school like that,\u201d he thought. (He adds that, later, Billy Elliot would be part of what inspired him to come to England.) He was eight when he auditioned for the National Conservatory in Lisbon and the audition did not, at first, go well: \u201cIt was hilarious. I showed up in tracksuit and trainers, didn\u2019t know what ballet was. The atmosphere was sterile, the other kids were preppy and well prepared. I was nothing of the kind. But I could do the splits and I remember I kept doing the splits repeatedly [he laughs].\u201d The panel was not impressed. \u201cThen came the special moment when they asked us just to dance. They played Scott Joplin and I used that as my inspiration to do African dancing. I remember the freedom of it. I performed what I knew, gave my big smile and the judges were enthused.\u201d The African dancing (and, presumably, the smile) got him in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018You have to be proud of who you are\u2019: Samb\u00e9 photographed at the Royal Opera House, London. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\nShortly after that audition, Samb\u00e9\u2019s father died and the Lisbon Conservatory arranged for Marcelino to be fostered: \u201cI had loving parents but, unfortunately, they could not take care of me. After my dad passed away, it was too much for my mum to take care of me and my sister.\u201d It is clear he would prefer not to elaborate but he dutifully volunteers: \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with my mother, although we\u2019ve grown apart. I\u2019m very aware of how she is doing.\u201d He was fostered by Fernanda and Manuel Barroso and \u201cquickly became a real member of their family. They introduced me to the world of art and music and inspired me to pursue my dreams. My [foster] sister Maria was also at the Lisbon ballet school and helped so much, taught me to stay focused.\u201d\n\nLooking at Samb\u00e9 today, he is completely poised. And he tells me something extraordinary. When he is in the wings of the Royal Opera house waiting to go on, he is not the slightest bit nervous. And that is because \u201cI feel very prepared\u201d. Instead he is \u201ccentring\u201d himself. His only fear is of \u201cnot giving everything I have to give.\u201d\n\n'I had so much darkness in me\u2026 I have a huge smile but when I'm dark, I'm dark'\n\nIn 2009, Sambe won the Youth America Grand Prix and, in 2010, a gold medal at the USA International ballet competition. He won a scholarship to the Royal Ballet Upper School, graduating into the company during its 2012-13 season. Within four years, he had become a first soloist, and within six, a principal dancer. In the last season, he played Basilio in Don Quixote (directed by Carlos Acosta) and Blue Boy in Les Patineurs and the third movement of Balanchine\u2019s Symphony in C. In April, he graduated from Mercutio to Romeo and was the lead in Crystal Pite\u2019s Flight Pattern (about the refugee crisis). Hofesh Shechter, who choreographed Untouchable for the Royal Ballet, a piece in which Marcelino created his own role, sees him as a \u201cquick, adaptable dancer, with a cheeky spark in his eyes\u201d and suggests that what makes him so promising ispraises the \u201ctotal engagement and energy\u201d he brings to his work. But how important does Marcelino himself believe his ebullience is \u2013 and how much does personality affect dance? \u201cOh my God \u2013 totally! You see how someone really is, the seed of who they are on stage \u2013 it\u2019s very exposing. Your heart is open and vulnerable. I feel all my past experiences \u2013 and how I got here \u2013 give layers to my dancing. And dancing has given me so much joy, I want to share it.\u201d\n\nSamb\u00e9 does not altogether believe in his own publicity. He wants to set the record straight, to explain what happens when the sun goes in. For just after he became a first soloist in 2017 he got a deep stress fracture in his shin and had to stop for six months. \u201cI\u2019d not been aware of my limitations, I\u2019d thought I was Superman. And my body was like: Hello?! I think you need to reconsider, think about your limitations, learn to grow. There are so many talented boys and men around and you think: I need to keep swimming upstream because, if I stop for a second, I\u2019ll be taken by the stream.\u201d\n\nHe was devastated at not being able to dance on stage: \u201cI had so much darkness in me. I can be quite dramatic. My personality goes every way: I have a huge smile but when I\u2019m dark, I\u2019m dark.\u201d\n\nSlowly, he began to see the injury as an opportunity to \u201crefine\u201d his work. There is a first-class health care team at the Royal Ballet and he had a coach, Brian Maloney, a former company dancer, who \u201cgot me up on my feet so patiently. We\u2019d go back to first position. Wrong! Tendue. Wrong!\u201d I thought: how am I ever going to get back to being a light, jumpy dancer? But now, I\u2019m so grateful to the physios who took care of me. And I caught up with who I want to be as a person. I caught up with friends, I worked on my relationships.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcelino Samb\u00e9 in Crystal Pite\u2019s Flight Pattern at the Royal Opera House in May.

In 2018, he even did a video outside the Opera House to promote Gay Pride month: \u201cThey put a flag outside for the first time to mark Gay Pride. It was so important. After all, the history of LGBTQ people here has been immense.\u201d Sometimes, he imagines what it would have been like to be a gay ballet dancer in the Opera House\u2019s past. To my surprise, he admits to feeling \u201cnostalgic about the 60s and 70s \u2013 as if I\u2019d been there in a previous incarnation.\u201d He imagines a time of \u201cmore mystery\u201d and \u201ccomplicated magic\u201d while acknowledging it must have been \u201cpainful for gay men deep in their hearts\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fulfil your potential if you are not allowed to be 100% yourself. You have to be proud of who you are.\u201d He frequently mentions, though he does not name, his partner (they live in north London). Is he a dancer? \u201cNo, a lawyer. We have completely different backgrounds but lead busy lives and have similar schedules and that helps.\u201d\n\nSamb\u00e9 reels off a typical Royal Ballet schedule: 10am to 11.45am ballet class. 15-minute break, then five or six hours of rehearsals. He finishes at 6.30pm \u2013 or at 5.30pm if he has a show. He admits it is \u201cexhausting\u201d but explains the Opera House is full of \u201cdancing machines with the stamina needed for full-length ballets\u201d. It matters to him to try and lead a normal life \u2013 and he believes it possible if you \u201ccrack the code\u201d. This involves \u201cfriendship\u201d with everyone (he messages his friends during his short breaks). And he tells himself: \u201cYou\u2019re not the nucleus \u2013 everyone\u2019s life matters.\u201d\n\nSamb\u00e9 is proud to be associated with Carlos Acosta, but believes there is a more urgent issue to address than diversity at the Opera House: \u201cWhat matters is that ballet should not just be for elite kids from well-fed families. And black kids with talent need to be nurtured from a very young age. A lot of time and effort was put into me. I was difficult as a child. I was often not prepared to come to class, did not have the right kit, did not do the homework. But the teachers had a special place in their hearts for me, understood I came from a troubled background and needed their support.\u201d Funnily enough, he goes on to hail Acosta as being one of those teachers, albeit later in life: \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Carlos intimately \u2013 when we were doing Quixote, he made me feel I could do it. He made me trust the process and be patient.\u201d\n\nNext year, Samb\u00e9 will dance Siegfried in Swan Lake and Franz in Copp\u00e9lia. He says he loves the way the Royal Ballet is as much about acting as dance: \u201cI\u2019ll be thinking: OK, I can do an incredible step, but how am I going to do it?\u201d And as a principal, how will he do \u2013 or be \u2013 that? \u201cPeople say that when you become a principal, you have to change. I\u2019m wondering: how can I make it different?\u201d\n\nIt is hard to imagine how Samb\u00e9 finds time for it but it turns out that he is also an ambitious choreographer (he was chosen for Youth Dance England\u2019s Young Creatives scheme in 2012). He believes opportunities to choreograph will materialise \u201cif I put in the effort.\u201d He dreams in particular of creating an Othello, with music by Nico Muhly. \u201cA ballet of Othello has never been done at the Opera House,\u201d he exclaims. You can see Marcelino Samb\u00e9 is on a high of the sort that can only be achieved by exceptional talent and hard work. Is there anything he would want to change about his life? \u201cI have many moments when I think to myself \u2013 how lucky am I to be able to do what I love, have an incredible partner, friends and a supportive family. There is nothing I want to change \u2013 although there are a lot of things I\u2019d like to change about the world \u2013 but that\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nMarcelino Samb\u00e9 dances in Manon (as Lescaut), 9 and 12 October; and in Concerto, 22 and 26 October, Royal Opera House, London WC1", "description": "More underprivileged boys and girls should be getting a chance in ballet, says the Portuguese star", "authors": ["Kate Kellaway"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/018571375c431c745e8964138bf7268625a193d5/0_668_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2692503f15baedc00653a266e59a435", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
