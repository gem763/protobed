He was met by a sea of V-signs.\n\nIt may be predictable to state the pressure is mounting on the Everton manager following a fourth successive Premier League defeat but predictable was Everton\u2019s afternoon here. A starting lineup assembled at a cost of more than \u00a3250m were laboured, lacking in discipline plus concentration and beaten on their travels by yet another set-piece.\n\nJames Milner downs Leicester at the last to keep up Liverpool\u2019s perfect start Read more\n\nIt held no surprises for an Everton support who are watching their expensively assembled team stroll through the motions once again and a manager seemingly powerless to prevent another nothing season. Burnley, by stark contrast, amply compensated for any technical gaps with a work-rate, defensive resilience and clinical touch that elevated them to fifth in the table and dropped Everton to 17th.\n\nJeff Hendrick volleyed home an Ashley Westwood corner as the home side capitalised on S\u00e9amus Coleman\u2019s foolish dismissal to record their third home win of the campaign. Their effort, organisation and upward trajectory puts Everton to shame. Silva\u2019s positive take on the game was misguided but not his assessment of the growing anger.\n\n\u201cIf you are asking me if they should be angry with the team and with myself then that is normal,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last four games we didn\u2019t get the results and they have all the reasons to be angry with us.\n\n\u201cIt is up to us to work harder, to be braver, to be more clinical and our attacking players need to be more aggressive and assertive in these type of games. Our confidence is not the best at the moment. I understand 100% why they are angry with us but we have to stick together and the next game is a must-win game for us.\u201d\n\nEverton controlled possession during a tedious first half but showed no attacking intent with it. Coleman was arguably fortunate to escape a red card when he accidentally but dangerously caught Erik Pieters\u2019s ankle having over-run the ball \u2013 a recurring trait throughout the Everton side \u2013 but the foul was deemed worthy only of yellow.\n\nPieters reappeared for the second half but was unable to continue. His aggressor lasted two minutes more, Coleman inviting a second yellow card with a needless leap into Dwight McNeil for a header he was never going to win in an unthreatening area of the pitch.\n\n\u201cA really harsh decision,\u201d said Silva. \u201cThe second yellow had a big impact on the game.\u201d\n\nSean Dyche, more accurately, said: \u201cLet\u2019s make it clear, Coleman is not that type of player but in the modern game he was fortunate not to be sent off. The second one was a poor challenge too. The referee had no choice.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBurnley unsettled the visitors merely by increasing their tempo and getting balls into the penalty area quicker in the first half. That brief period demonstrated how vulnerable the Everton defence could be and their tendency to switch off at set-pieces.\n\nOn the half-hour Westwood swung a corner over from the left to the back post where Hendrick, unmarked, volleyed goalwards and Jordan Pickford saved with his legs.\n\nThe warning was not heeded. With 18 minutes remaining Burnley repeated the trick. Westwood delivered a deep corner from the left and there was Hendrick again, unmarked again, to volley into the roof of the net.\n\nColeman\u2019s dismissal was no excuse with Everton having eight players in their six-yard box to Burnley\u2019s four.\n\nSilva replaced Dominic Calvert\u2011Lewin with Moise Kean, a move met with boos from the away section on account of its predictability rather than a slight on the young Italian striker. Silva\u2019s formation, selections and substitutions are as predictable as his team\u2019s laboured play.\n\nBurnley have a plan. They stuck to it and won. Silva needs something similar and fast.", "description": "Burnley capitalised on Seamus Coleman\u2019s second-half dismissal and beat Everton 1-0 thanks to Jeff Hendrick\u2019s subsequent strike", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5d2644277967bd13ced41ec28a3649b012b51f0/0_68_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64d4fd83aa339fbb0511a09bc33d7c5e", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
