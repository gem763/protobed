Who will coordinate the Investment Coordinating Board ?\n\n\"Will it be the Coordinating Minister for the Economy or the Maritime Ministry? Previously state owned enterprises came under the Maritime Ministry which made sense but not now it is connected to investment portfolio.\u201d\n\nDr Ayla Aldjufrie, a businesswoman with several property ventures - mainly in Bali - hoped the new Cabinet would lift sentiment.\n\n\u201cProperty is one of the cornerstones of our economy and growth has been sluggish in recent years due to the slowing economy and the impact of natural disasters,\u201d she said.\n\nSpecific areas that needed addressing included foreign ownership of real estate and the Ministry of Tourism\u2019s new Bali promotion.", "description": "The Indonesian president has begun his second, five-year term with some bold Cabinet appointments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.339%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_79/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/62b05bb96e62d1f2e4974bcba7c209efcbd3ae33", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
