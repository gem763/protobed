One detailed allegations of war crimes, while the other reported an alleged attempt by a government agency to spy on Australian citizens.\n\nThe campaign on Monday, by the Right to Know Coalition, was also supported by several TV, radio and online outlets.\n\nMichael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp Australia, tweeted an image of his blacked-out mastheads which include The Australian and The Daily Telegraph. He urged the public to ask of the government: \"What are they trying to hide from me?\"\n\nThe company's chief rival, Nine - publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age - ran similar front pages.\n\nABC managing director David Anderson said: \"Australia is at risk of becoming the world's most secretive democracy.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the Australian government reiterated it was possible that three journalists may face prosecution in the wake of the raids.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said press freedom was important to Australia's democracy, but added the \"rule of law\" needed to be upheld.\n\n\"That includes me, or any journalist, or anyone else,'' he said on Sunday.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police raided Australia's public broadcaster earlier this year\n\nThe findings of a press freedom inquiry will be tabled in parliament next year.\n\nWhat do the media organisations want?\n\nThe campaign argues that tougher security laws enacted over the past two decades have threatened investigative journalism, eroding the public's \"right to know\".\n\nSince new counter-espionage legislation was introduced last year, media outlets have lobbied for journalists and whistleblowers to be given exemptions to report sensitive information.\n\nThis forms part of a list of seven demands put to the government on Monday which also call for reforms to freedom of information and defamation laws.\n\nUnusual allies\n\nJay Savage, Australia editor, BBC News Online\n\nYou wouldn't typically expect Australian media chiefs to shelve their competitive instincts - if not occasional hostilities - to publish identical messages on their most prized news pages and bulletins.\n\nBut the police raids had an immediate galvanising effect on the nation's press, stirring them into a co-ordinated response. Some have described the unity as unprecedented.\n\nThe firms have sought to nullify possible criticisms of self-interest by arguing that Australian society is best served by more open scrutiny.\n\nThey argue Australia is weaker than comparable democracies at protecting whistleblowers and has unfairly strong defamation laws which effectively silence reporting.\n\nTogether the outlets wield significant power, but it remains to be seen if their demands will be met.", "description": "The nation's biggest media rivals unite to protest against what they say is government secrecy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1748/production/_109306950_sdsdfsdf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
