They\u2019re also stackable. \u201cYou want to mimic creating shelves in some way,\u201d says Amanda Wiss, founder of Urban Clarity, while Apartment Jeanie\u2019s Jeanie Engelbach recommends utilizing the height of the closet to store shoes. They\u2019re also easy to label, and Jeni Aron of Clutter Cowgirl says, \u201cIf you\u2019re done with a pair of shoes, you can use the box for something else not even shoe related (bathroom, kitchen, pet stuff, meds, etc.).\u201d They come in standard, large, and tall sizes (for heels), but can get pricey if you need a bunch of them.", "description": "The best shoe organizers, as recommended by professional organizers, including boxes, shelving, racks, over-the-door options, and more, from brands like the Container Store, Whitmor, Shoe Slotz, West Elm, Home Bi, and Ikea.", "authors": ["Lauren Ro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2018/09/13/shoe-organizer/13-shoe-organizer-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
