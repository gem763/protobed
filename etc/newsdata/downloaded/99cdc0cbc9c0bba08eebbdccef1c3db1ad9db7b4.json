The quick turnaround comes after weather concerns wiped out play on Wednesday, pushing back games four and five in New York.\n\nThe Astros \u2014 who would host game seven if necessary on Sunday, are seeking their second World Series title in three years.\n\nHicks was delighted to be making the trip to Texas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is too fun.\u201d\n\nThe winner of the series will take on the Washington Nationals in Major League Baseball\u2019s championship showcase.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 DJ LeMahieu and Aaron Hicks homered as New York rocked star Houston pitcher Justin Verlander for four runs in the first inning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/9a928c_aaron-hicks-31-new-york-yankees-celebrates-teammate-hitting-run-home-run-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
