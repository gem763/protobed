VW is seeking to replenish its senior leadership while Stadler remains in custody.\n\nVW had said in July that Duesmann will take up his new position as soon as he is able to do so. He will be the second high-profile defection from rival German carmaker BMW after the poaching of Herbert Diess in July 2015.\n\nDuesmann\u2019s BMW contract runs until Sept. 30, 2019, and it would also have a non-compete clause that BMW board members are required to sign.\n\nBMW had said that Duesmann had informed its chairman that he would not make himself available for an extension of his contract because of personal reasons.", "description": "BMW's engine development and purchasing expert, Markus Duesmann, is set to become the CEO of Volkswagen's Audi premium brand, after BMW dropped its opposition to his early departure, a German newspaper reported on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429884262&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0R0", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
