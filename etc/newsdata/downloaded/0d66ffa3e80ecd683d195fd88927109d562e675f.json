I called a couple of times and the manager was never there, so I just went in. I showed up dressed in fishnets, a garter belt underneath my underwear, and boots, which is weird, because I literally looked like a hooker. I asked for the manager and said, \u201cLook I'm a really good dancer. I have dance experience.\u201d I was a dancer since I was like four years old, and I had always been on a stage. He gave me an audition, and it was full nude. It was terrifically embarrassing, but he gave me the job.\n\nI\u2019ve tried different jobs throughout the years: a non-profit, a distribution center, and I even got promoted at the mall job. I tried that. I just always ended up going back to dancing, because I wasn't happy with the way that management [at the other jobs] ran things.\n\nGreen: What made dancing more appealing than the other jobs?\n\nLiza: I was pretty much my own boss. I could decide when and how much I wanted to work. If I went to work one day and I didn't really feel like working that hard, it was on me. As long as I paid the club what I owed them, it wasn't a big deal.\n\nGreen: You said that you\u2019re free to work as much as you want as long as you \u201cpay the club what you owe them.\u201d What is that pay and fee structure like?\n\nLiza: Largely, dancers are not actual employees of the club. They're independent contractors. When we go into work, some clubs [ask you to] call in, most of them have scheduling, but sometimes you can just walk in. There's always a house fee or a space-rental fee. You also have to pay the DJ and the house mom, who's kind of like the dressing room manager, because they often don't get a paycheck either. Basically we are paying to work there. As long as they get their money, they don't care.\n\nGreen: What is a typical shift or week like?\n\nLiza: Every club is different, but there is an eight-hour shift at most of the clubs that I've worked at. You can be on the floor as much as you want or not. If you wanted to you could sit in the dressing room the entire time. Or, you can be out there talking to people and making money. There are a few clubs in Las Vegas where you can show up literally whenever you want and then leave. If you can get in there and work for three hours and make the money that you need, you're good to go.\n\nGreen: Would you consider the fees that you have to pay to the clubs a significant part of the money you would otherwise get to take home?\n\nLiza: It depends on the season and on the day. It's like being a waitress or being a bartender. Some nights you can walk out of there with a bunch of money and some nights you can walk out with next to nothing. It just depends on what's going on. Summer time is typically a lot slower in strip clubs. People are with their families or going on vacation. Around [fall], things start to pick up considerably. During the holidays people want to go out, drink, and party. People are sick and tired of some things, and they want to get away. It's an escapism business.\n\nGreen: How have you seen the adult entertainment industry change in your five years of experience?\n\nLiza: With the advent of the internet, it's a lot easier to get pornography or web-cam girls at your house for free most of the time. In my state and in my club it is illegal to do sexual favors; prostitution is illegal. If you are caught doing any of that, you are immediately terminated. For the most part, the people who come into strip clubs are looking for companionship, and someone to talk to. It has been more and more difficult over the past five years to be compensated for such services in a way that is lucrative and reliable. When I first started dancing, I think my worst night was my first night when I made $150. My best night in the past five years I probably made $1,500. Recently, $150 has been a good night.", "description": "Liza, a dancer based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, talks about how the stereotypes about her profession affect how she\u2019s treated by clientele.", "authors": ["Adrienne Green"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/11/Liza/facebook.jpg?1522790642", "published_at": "2016-10-19"}
