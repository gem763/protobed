It is too shameful, one says. Another says he is anguished because his family knows he often used to socialize with Nabonibo.\n\nNabonibo shocked many Rwandans in August when he revealed in an interview with a Christian YouTube channel that he is gay in a country where such a public assertion of homosexuality is unheard of. Although the central African nation has been relatively free of the anti-gay rhetoric commonly heard in some other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, homosexuality is still widely despised, and LGBT people keep a low profile.\n\nNabonibo told The Associated Press that he came out in order to live normally. Yet the reaction he has received, from family and friends to strangers, has been mostly \u201chorrible,\u201d he said, underscoring the intolerance faced by LGBT people in many parts of Africa.\n\n\u201cBut there is no going back, because I have to live my real life,\u201d Nabonibo said in an interview in the capital, Kigali. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad to see people you know abusing you.\u201d\n\nNabonibo, who is 35 and a qualified accountant, said he had become an outcast at his workplace as friends isolate him. He is worried he could lose his job. Even at home, news of his homosexuality shocked many relatives, although some have been acting tolerant, he said.\n\nAlthough Rwanda\u2019s penal code does not explicitly proscribe gay sex, same-sex marriage is banned. This means that many homosexuals are forced to live underground lifestyles in order to avoid the harsh judgment of society. Nabonibo said he was compelled to come out because he could no longer \u201clive in denial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a long list of them (gays) in your midst and they include pastors or churchgoers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pretense encouraged me to speak out.\u201d\n\nWilliam Ntwali, a Rwandan human rights activist, said society in the country still stigmatizes gay people even when they are safe under the law.\n\n\u201cIf you are gay, members of your community ostracize you,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think you are not normal, and they look at it as an abomination.\u201d\n\nSome of Nabonibo\u2019s best friends who spoke to the AP said they were too embarrassed even to talk about him. They requested anonymity for their own privacy.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy. I don\u2019t understand why he thinks this is normal,\u201d said one friend, shaking his head.\n\nAnother friend, a man who attends the same church as Nabonibo, said he was in a state of \u201cagony\u201d since the rest of his family knows he used to hang out with Nabonibo. Now he has blocked Nabonibo from all phone contact, saying he wants to \u201ckeep safe.\u201d\n\nThere has been a similar reaction on social media, with many Rwandans questioning Nabonibo\u2019s intentions and others condemning him. One wondered on Twitter: \u201cHow can a gospel singer be gay?\u201d\n\nA senior government official, however, expressed support for Nabonibo, saying he is protected under the law and urging the singer to continue his worship ministry.\n\n\u201cAll Rwandans are born and remain equal in rights and freedoms,\u201d Olivier Nduhungirehe, Rwanda\u2019s state minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, 32 African nations have varying laws criminalizing homosexuality. In many cases most of the anti-gay laws are left over from the colonial era, one reason gay rights activists have fought vigorously to have the laws jettisoned.\n\nIn June, the gay rights movement in Africa scored a victory when a court in Botswana, upholding the rights of LGBT people, overturned laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations.\n\nBut there have been some setbacks.\n\nIn 2017, Chad enacted legislation criminalizing same-sex relations for the first time in the country\u2019s history.\n\nIn May, a court in Kenya ruled against overturning a colonial-era law criminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults. Activists there who had challenged the law in court said they faced discrimination and threats to their dignity.\n\nIn neighboring Uganda, a government minister in charge of ethics is threatening to introduce another version of an anti-gay law passed in 2014, and subsequently voided by the country\u2019s constitutional court, that provided for jail terms of up to life for those convicted of engaging in gay sex. The original version of that bill, first introduced in 2009, had included the death penalty for what it called aggravated acts of homosexuality.\n\nIn Rwanda, the way ahead can be challenging, Nabonibo said.\n\nSome neighborhoods in Kigali are filled with gossip about how a certain gay man might spoil other citizens, he said.\n\n\u201cCriticism and sadness. What does it matter? What\u2019s important is that I have taken my choice,\u201d he said softly.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Friends of Albert Nabonibo, a well-known gospel singer in Rwanda who recently came out as a gay man, do not want their names revealed.
