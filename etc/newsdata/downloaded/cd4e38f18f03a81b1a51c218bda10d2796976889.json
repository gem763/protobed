That and more in Trysta Krick's Week 7 overreactions. USA TODAY\n\nWeek 7 was something of a wild one in the NFL, one that saw some quarterbacks light up the box scores, one that saw a couple of battles for first place in a pair of divisions, and a few familiar faces in new places after some trades.\n\nThe midway point of the season is quickly approaching, but before that, here are the winners and losers from Week 7.\n\nWINNERS\n\nNew DBs in new places: It was a good week for Jalen Ramsey and Marcus Peters. They each were traded, with Ramsey landing with the L.A. Rams and Peters ending up with the Ravens. Both their teams won, and both of them made big plays that helped their teams win. Ramsey had four tackles and a forced fumble in a 37-10 victory against the Falcons. Peters had one tackle, one pass defended, and a pick six in a 30-16 victory against the Seahawks. You could even throw in Baltimore safety Earl Thomas, as he totaled five tackles against his former squad in a game that was clearly personal for him. You could (kinda) throw in Cardinals corner Patrick Peterson, too, whose strip sack fumble helped seal Arizona\u2019s 27-21 victory against the Giants in his first game back after serving his six-game suspension for a violation of the NFL\u2019s performance-enhancing substance policy.\n\nWEEK 7: 32 things we learned\n\nQUITE A DAY: Aaron Rodgers earns first perfect passer rating for Packers\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nAaron Rodgers\u2019 MVP chances: This may have been the finest performance of his career. Rodgers set a Packers record in a 42-24 victory against the Raiders, becoming the first Green Bay quarterback in franchise history to notch a perfect QB rating of 158.3. His day of 25 for 31 for 429 yards, five touchdowns \u2014 as well as a rushing score \u2014 suddenly launched him into the MVP race. He\u2019s got the Packers looking like a legit contender at 6-1 and it\u2019s clear the rapport with rookie coach Matt LaFleur is only just getting going. Arguably most impressive was that this was without his best receiver in Davante Adams and with Marquez Valdez-Scantling and Geronimo Allison both on snap limits after getting dinged up last week. It also helps Rodgers\u2019 chase for the MVP that Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes reportedly will miss some time with a knee injury and that Seahawks passer Russell Wilson had his first average performance of the season.\n\nKirk Cousins: Sometimes, all it takes is a \u201csorry.\u201d In the weeks since Cousins \u2014 the Vikings' quarterback \u2014 apologized to receiver Adam Thielen for playing poorly, Cousins has been rolling. After Minnesota smashed the Lions, 42-24, Cousins has now completed 75.6% of his passes for 976 yards, 10 touchdowns and only one interception over the team\u2019s last three games. More importantly, the Vikings have won them all, are 5-2, and just one game back of the Packers in the NFC North.\n\nIndianapolis Colts: In what was basically a battle for first in the AFC South, the Colts looked refreshed off their bye and took down the Texans, 30-23. Jacoby Brissett hit career highs in passing yards (326), and passing touchdowns (four), and he improved to 4-0 in his career as a starter against the Texans. The Colts sacked Deshaun Watson twice, after Houston didn\u2019t allow one sack in its previous two games. Indianapolis\u2019 defense limited Watson and Houston to 4-12 on third-down tries and two of five in red zone trips. Perhaps the best sign of things to come for Indy is the upcoming schedule. The Colts (4-2) now have games against the Broncos (2-5), at the Steelers (2-4), against the Dolphins (0-6), and against the Jaguars (3-4), before they face Houston again, on the road, in Week 12.\n\nLOSERS\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: In what was a battle for first in the NFC East and a pivotal game that would put the victor in the driver\u2019s seat in the division, Philly dropped a dud, losing to the Cowboys, 37-10. They turned the ball over \u2014 fumbling twice on their first two possessions, prompting an early, two-touchdown hole \u2014 and coughing it up four times, overall. They struggled in the red zone, failing to convert any of their two trips inside the 20 into touchdowns. And they had no answer to the Dallas pass rush. When coach Doug Pederson led the Eagles to their Super Bowl a couple of seasons ago, those were all areas they excelled in. With the NFC looking like a strong conference with playoff spots at a premium, winning the NFC East might be the only way a team from the division gets in the playoffs. Philly\u2019s shot at that took a big hit Sunday night.\n\nMitchell Trubisky: We might be nearing the point where the Chicago Bears need to think about alternate plans at quarterback. A 36-25 loss to the Saints was the model of ineptitude for Trubisky and this Bears offense. Trubisky, now in his third season as Chicago\u2019s starting quarterback, still has not shown enough progress or development to give him a vote of confidence for the future. He sometimes doesn\u2019t see wide open targets, misses on throws, and can\u2019t consistently deliver balls down the field. This was the Bears catching the Saints with a number of key players out \u2014 running back Alvin Kamara, tight end Jared Cook, receiver Tre\u2019Quan Smith chief among them, not to mention Drew Brees. Yet, it was Teddy Bridgewater who outplayed Trubisky and it wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nL.A. Chargers: It\u2019s almost amazing how sometimes it feels like the Chargers have found the most disappointing ways to lose. Their 23-20 stumble against the Titans, however, was on another level. Consider this: Los Angeles had the ball, down three, at the Tennessee 1-yard line with 39 seconds after Titans coach Mike Vrabel gifted them with an inexplicable timeout. Then there was a false start that pushed them back. Then a defensive pass interference gave them the ball back at the one. Then running back Melvin Gordon got a touchdown that was later reviewed and marked short. Then Gordon fumbled. Tennessee took over and the game ended. Los Angeles is now 1-4 in its last five games, and a team that many people thought could be a Super Bowl contender lacks an identity and looks nothing like it.\n\nArthur Blank: It looks like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the Atlanta Falcons blow it up and fires coach Dan Quinn. The Falcons are reeling after their 37-10 loss to the Rams that dropped them to 1-6, tied with Washington for worst record in the NFC. Quarterback Matt Ryan suffered an ankle injury and was in a walking boot after the loss, but this feels like it\u2019s just the start for Atlanta. Team owner Arthur Blank said \u201cI still support\u201d Quinn after the game. The Falcons rank 16th in total offense (367.4 yards a game) and only 20.7 points a game (19). With an offense that has Ryan, Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Mohammed Sanu, Devonta Freeman and a re-worked O-line, there\u2019s just no excuse for that kind of ineffective production.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
