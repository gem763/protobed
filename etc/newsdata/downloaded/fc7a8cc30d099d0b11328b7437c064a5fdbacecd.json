Uganda\u2019s population is around 42 million.\n\nThe new lenders are likely to face stiff competition from the crowded field, Ramathan Ggoobi, an economics lecturer at a Kampala university, said.\n\nCompetition in the sector has reached \u201cpredatory levels\u201d, he said, with some banks devising strategies to win customers from other banks rather than cultivating new ones.\n\n\u201cThey are crowding around a very small market ... and it\u2019s not likely that they will be sustainable in the long run,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials from the two lenders were not immediately available to comment.\n\nMajor players in the sector also include the local units of international giants Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered, as well as local lenders DFCU Bank and Centenary Bank.\n\nFor various reasons including insolvency and posing a systemic risk to country\u2019s financial system, Bank of Uganda closed seven banks between 1993 and 2016, according to a parliamentary report.", "description": "Uganda's central bank has licensed two new banks, bringing the total number of commercial banks serving the East African country's small economy to 26, including a local unit of South Africa's Standard Bank which dominates the market.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
