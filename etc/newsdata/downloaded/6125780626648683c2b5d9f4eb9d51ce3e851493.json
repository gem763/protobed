Elijah Cummings early Thursday has made a widow of Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the chair of Maryland's Democratic Party.\n\nShe released a statement, calling her husband \"an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion and humility.\"\n\nShe says Cummings \"worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem.\"\n\nShe says \"It has been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:30 a.m.\n\nMaryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, his congressional office said. He was 68.\n\nA sharecropper's son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a U.S. House committee that investigated President Donald Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his district that encompassed a large portion of Baltimore.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations into Trump's governmental dealings. The investigations angered the president, who criticized the congressman's district in 2019 as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\"\n\nCummings responded that government officials must stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments\" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
