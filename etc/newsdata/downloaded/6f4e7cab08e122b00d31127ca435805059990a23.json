No ifs, ands or buts about it.\u201d\n\nLate on Wednesday, the firm started briefing journalists on the move, pushing its view that the HKmap.live was being \u201cused in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Apple chief executive Tim Cook dropped an email into the inboxes of his employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.\u201d\n\nLong-time Apple commentator John Gruber wrote of Mr Cook\u2019s email: \u201cI can\u2019t recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u2018Innocent passers-by\u2019\n\nApple has yet to provide any additional information about those claimed incidents. Charles Mok, a Hong Kong legislator who represents the IT industry in the territory, posted a letter to Mr Cook on Twitter.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The HKmap.live app crowdsources information about law enforcement movements\n\n\u201cThere are numerous cases of innocent passers-by in the neighbourhood injured by the Kong Kong Police Force\u2019s excessive force in crowd dispersal operations,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed.\u201d\n\nMr Mok went on to argue that users on major social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also share information about police activity - but were not being held to the same standard.\n\n\u201cWe Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.\u201d\n\nApple has not responded to the letter.\n\nCensored South Park\n\nApple\u2019s decision comes against a backdrop of major American firms being seen as bowing to political pressure from Beijing.\n\nIn just the past week, the NBA grovelled its way around a tweet from a team executive supporting the protests, while video games published Activision Blizzard banned e-sports competitor Ng Wai \"Blitzchung\" Chung for showing his support for the movement.\n\nAnd Google removed a role-playing game called \u201cRevolution of Our Times\u201d from its app store after deeming it violated its policies on depicting \u201csensitive events\u201d (the player plays the role of a Hong Kong protester). According to the Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong authorities had contacted Google with concerns about that app - though the company has said it decided to take action before any communication took place.\n\nOne bucking of the trend, however, came via Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games, the firm behind online multiplayer game Fortnite.\n\n\u201cEpic supports everyone\u2019s right to speak freely,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, in response to a question about gamers voicing support for Hong Kong protesters. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns 40% of the firm.\n\n\u201cChina players of Fortnite are free to criticize the US or criticize Epic just as equally as all others,\u201d Mr Sweeney said.\n\nIn characteristically astute timing, an episode of Comedy Central\u2019s South Park earlier this month led Chinese censors to \u201cdelete virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pages\u201d, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe episode featured four of the show\u2019s main characters working on a film script that gets constantly altered so that it could be distributed in China.\n\n\u201cWell you know what they say,\u201d the film\u2019s director in the show says, \u201cYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.\u201d\n\nExerting power\n\nIn Apple\u2019s case that means revenues that are on course to exceed $40bn this year - almost a fifth of the firm\u2019s total global sales. Apple\u2019s reliance on Chinese manufacturing means the relationship goes far deeper than just local sales. The firm has 10,000 direct employees in the firm; the economy around Apple\u2019s presence in China is responsible for around 5m jobs.\n\nWhat happens next depends on the extent to which China feels its hardline stance is working - and there are indications officials are becoming wary. According to reporting in the New York Times, Beijing is concerned its actions are drawing more attention to the protests and harming the country\u2019s standing on the global stage, adding yet more tension to relations with the US as trade talks restart in Washington.\n\nThe rows have also bolstered concerns that China has few qualms when it comes to making demands of companies both based in the Communist state, as well as those who merely want to do business there.\n\n\u201cWhat would Huawei do if they were the dominant 5G provider for a country, and that country\u2019s leaders said the wrong thing?\u201d speculated Elliott Zaagman, who covers Chinese business and investment,\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
