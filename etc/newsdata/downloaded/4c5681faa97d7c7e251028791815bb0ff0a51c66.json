She alleges that her privacy was invaded by the hidden camera and her manager retaliated against her when she reported it to them.\n\nShe discovered the livestream when the pilot, Capt. Terry Graham, asked Steinaker to come to the cockpit so he could use the bathroom. Per airline policy, there must be two employees in the cockpit at the time.\n\nBut as Steinaker entered the cockpit she noticed an \u201ciPad mounted to the windsheild left of the captain\u2019s seat\u201d and saw a livestream of the bathroom. When Graham entered the bathroom, his image came on the screen.\n\nThe co-pilot, Ryan Russel, could see the iPad from where he was so Steinaker confronted him about it. Russell panicked when her realized she could see the iPad, the suit said. Steinaker said in the suit that Russell said the cameras were hidden \u201cso that no one would ever find it\u201d and called them a security measure that had been installed in several Southwest planes.\n\nSteinaker took a photo of the iPad so she could report the incident. When Graham returned, he allegedly tried to hide it from her.\n\nSteinaker \u201cbecame physically ill\u201d at the thought that pilots had \u201cwatched and possibly recorded her disrobing and using the toilet.\u201d She was also worried about children who may have used the bathroom.\n\nUpon landing in Phoenix, she reported the incident to Southwest and was told it was being investigated but no disciplinary action would be taken against the pilot or co-pilot.\n\nThey continue to fly for Southwest.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the invasion of her privacy, Plaintiff Renee Steinaker has been damaged,\u201d the suit states. \u201cShe was unable to work for several days, sought counseling and continues to have physical and mental injuries as a result of the incident.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the pilots denied that the two livestreamed the bathroom.\n\nSouthwest said its planes do not have cameras in the bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThe safety and security of our employees and customers is Southwest\u2019s uncompromising priority,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \u201cAs such, Southwest does not place cameras in the lavatories of our aircraft. At this time, we have no other comment on the pending litigation.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 26 (UPI) \u2014 A Southwest Airlines flight attendant is suing the airline after accusing two pilots of live streaming video from inside an airplane", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
