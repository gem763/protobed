The Rays are a really good team. You don\u2019t win 96 games and outscore opponents by 113 runs by getting lucky. In the Rays\u2019 case, you do it with an army of pitchers and a strategy that often encourages using as many of them as possible.\n\nAs yet, by nearly every measurement, the Houston Astros are a vastly superior team. The Astros boast the best offense in baseball, according to wRC+, an advanced stat that measures offensive production. The team\u2019s starters combined for a 3.61 ERA, which ranked third. Even Houston\u2019s bullpen was solid. Astros relievers combined for a 3.75 ERA in the regular season, which ranked second in baseball \u2014 just barely behind the Rays. The Astros also posted a run differential of 280, the best in baseball. Houston isn\u2019t just the favorite to win this series, they are the favorite to win the whole thing.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the Rays can\u2019t win. Of course they can. Sillier things have happened in a five-game series. Tampa Bay\u2019s strategy doesn\u2019t even have to change. Use that army of pitchers, keep the powerful Astros hitters guessing and do just enough at the plate to scrape out three wins. That\u2019s not easy to do against the Astros, so the Rays will need to execute perfectly to win this series.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Rays might be underdogs, but they can still win the ALDS against the Astros.

They came out on top in the regular season. The Rays went 4-3 against the Astros in 2019. Tampa Bay was outscored by 13 runs, mostly due to a 15-1 win by the Astros in August. Three of the Rays\u2019 wins came during the first series of the season, all the way back in March. Both teams have changed so much since then that you can just throw those games out. In fact, you can throw out the entire head-to-head matchup because seven games isn\u2019t a huge sample. It\u2019s also not predictive. What happened in the regular season doesn\u2019t matter when the playoffs start.\n\nThe Astros will throw their workhorses in the first three games of the ALDS.

Cole, Greinke and Verlander combine to form a murderer\u2019s row for Houston. If all three of them are on, the Astros will win the series easily. Cole\u2019s 2.50 ERA ranked third, Verlander\u2019s 2.58 ERA ranked fourth and Greinke\u2019s 2.92 ERA ranked ninth this season. Houston has no issue keeping those guys on the mound as long as possible. The team averaged 92 pitches from their starters throughout the season. That figure ranked as the fourth-highest in baseball. In an era of openers and aggressive pitching changes, the Astros want their starters to go deep.\n\n\u2022 If one of those pitchers fails to produce, the Astros\u2019 offense can carry the team. Houston\u2019s 125 wRC+ makes them the best offense in baseball. The team\u2019s lineup is deep with All-Stars you know \u2014 like Michael Brantley, Alex Bregman, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But it also boasts some surprising breakouts like Yordan Alvarez and Yuli Gurriel. Fantasy players might remember Jose Altuv\u00e9\u2019s slow start, but he rebounded to hit .325/.372/.622 in the second half. The Astros\u2019 offense \u2014 particularly the team\u2019s top seven spots in the batting order \u2014 is relentless.\n\nCan the Rays' pitching hold off a tough Astros offense? (AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\nRays keys to victory\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s all about pitching matchups. The Rays are the most aggressive team with its starters, averaging a league-low 70 pitches per start in 2019. Once their starter leaves a game, the Rays try to overwhelm teams with a steady diet of elite relievers. Nick Anderson, Diego Castillo and Emilio Pag\u00e1n may not be household names just yet, but they made the A\u2019s hitters look silly Wednesday. If those guys are tired, the team can rely on Chaz Roe and Ryan Yarbrough to pick up the slack. While it\u2019s risky to rely on so many pitchers, the Rays offset that by only asking them to pick up a few outs per appearance. That can minimize damage if one of those relievers is having an off night.\n\n\u2022 It might seem small, but the Rays run the bases much better than the Astros. Tampa Bay ranked eighth in baseball with 94 steals, which have become a dying art in today\u2019s game. It\u2019s not just about steals, though. It\u2019s also about knowing when to be aggressive on the base paths and judging when it\u2019s safe to take the extra base. That\u2019s something the Rays did well in 2019, according to BsR, FanGraphs\u2019 base-running metric. It could be the Rays\u2019 key to maximizing their run production against the Astros\u2019 dominant starters.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
