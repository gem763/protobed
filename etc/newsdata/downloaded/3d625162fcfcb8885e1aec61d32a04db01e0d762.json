That\u2019s because China is engaging in an unprecedented push to leverage its massive domestic market power to silence critics abroad.\n\nAnd it\u2019s working \u2013 even in the United States.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve been lost at sea for most of 2019, Hong Kong erupted in protest in March after the government in Beijing announced controversial revisions to its criminal extradition laws. Going forward, the Chinese central government decreed, Hong Kongers accused of crimes would be sent to mainland China for trial. Such an idea is anathema in Hong Kong, which enjoys significant autonomy from the mainland.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy rallies have been staggering in their size and durability. In late August, nearly 1.7 million people took to the streets to protest a sharp rise in police brutality. Wounded protesters have taken on the status of folk heroes. Hong Kongers\u2019 outrage now targets something much more fundamental: the unjust use of Chinese state power to silence dissent.\n\nAn increasing number of protests have turned into violent clashes with security forces, straining Beijing\u2019s patience at a time when Chinese Premier Xi Jinping would prefer to emphasize the unity of China\u2019s 70th anniversary under communism. A growing number of human rights organizations fear Xi may toss caution aside and send in the military. The disproportionality of violence against Hong Kongers now fills international news sections.\n\nThen the National Basketball Association got involved.\n\nThe Houston Rockets have a long history with Beijing. They recruited Chinese 7ft 6in basketball phenom Yao Ming in 2002, sparking what sports writers often refer to as basketball\u2019s \u201cMing Dynasty.\u201d Yao was and remains a cultural icon to Chinese people: in 2008, Yao carried the Olympic torch into Tiananmen Square to kick off the Beijing games.\n\nThat put Yao and the Chinese central committee in a tough position when Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a pro-Hong Kong image on Twitter last week, with the accompanying words, \u201cfight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIn normal times, Morey\u2019s tweet would have garnered little reaction. But basketball fans on the mainland \u2013 China is the NBA\u2019s second-largest market outside the United States \u2013 bristled at what they viewed as an American sowing disharmony in Hong Kong. The Chinese government suspended its ties with the league, threatening to tune out its 500 million basketball viewers at a cost of some $4 billion to the NBA.\n\nFaced with the loss of its invaluable Chinese viewers, the NBA made a feint towards resistance before quickly capitulating to China\u2019s demand that criticism of Hong Kong be held off-limits. NBA agents now advise their clients even more directly: there is \u201cno upside to speaking out\u201d in support of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement. Such talk makes Beijing unhappy, and an unhappy Beijing means an unhappy NBA.\n\nChina\u2019s use of its markets as weapons to enforce orthodoxy and limit criticism of Beijing\u2019s antidemocratic policies may not be new, but it is brutally effective. Even in a free-speech bastion like the United States, for-profit corporations like NBA teams and video game publishers depend on a steady flow of Chinese revenue to keep the lights on.\n\nThrough it all, one constant China critic has been eerily silent: President Donald J Trump. Eager to wrap up the trade war currently destroying his re-election prospects, Trump promised Xi Jinping his silence on the Hong Kong protests. He hasn\u2019t said a word about a hostile foreign government bullying American businesses into pushing anti-democratic Communist Party propaganda.\n\nFor a president who signed an executive order promoting pro-conservative \u201cfree speech zones\u201d on college campuses, Trump\u2019s silence in the face of direct Chinese aggression is an indication of just how narrow his view of free speech really is.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just multi-millionaire NBA team owners feeling the heat of Chairman Xi\u2019s displeasure \u2013 the $1 billion world of esports also felt the bite of Chinese market diplomacy this week.\n\nEsports, like basketball, has its superstars. One of the most popular is Chung \u2018Blitzchung\u2019 Ng Wai, a Hong Kong native who made his name in the Activision Blizzard competitive card game Hearthstone.\n\nActivision Blizzard caused an international uproar after suspending Chung for a year \u2013 and seizing his prize money \u2013 after Chung shouted, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\u201d during a Hearthstone competition streamed live around the world. The speed of Activision Blizzard\u2019s punishment, video game industry journalists noted, may have something to do with Blizzard\u2019s heavy investment in Chinese gaming companies and esports leagues.\n\nIn a connected bit of irony, Activision Blizzard also holds the rights to publish NBA-licensed basketball video games in China.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Senator Ted Cruz traveled to Hong Kong last weekend, where he was largely ignored by protest leaders. There have been calls for the State Department to put pressure on Beijing to resolve protests peacefully \u2013 but so far, there\u2019s no sign Secretary Pompeo wants to get serious.\n\nIf China is allowed to pursue its market diplomacy unchecked, the results won\u2019t just muzzle Hong Kong \u2013 they will aggressively work to silence criticism from any company dependent on Chinese markets.
