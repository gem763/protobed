Any excuse for a celebration, eh?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a quick photo opportunity, either, as the ceremony even had guests and food, and the pair were \u2018married\u2019 by the family\u2019s cattle dog.\n\nInitially the couple got Gandalf, two, in 2017 but he was getting frustrated being alone, so a few months later they decided to get him a girlfriend, Galadriel, one.\n\nThe pair love snuggles (Picture: ERIN ADAMS/ CATERS NEWS)\n\nErin, a photographer, said: \u2018We felt we needed to make their relationship official, they are obviously madly in love, Gandalf will only share his food with Galadriel, not the other dogs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He growls and protects the food from them for both himself and Galadriel.\n\n\u2018We wanted to wait until Galadriel was full grown and Gandalf didn\u2019t want to marry a child \u2013 he had to wait for her to be old enough to wed.\u2019\n\nFair play.\n\nThe couple who have seven children, Sabin, 22, Andrew 20, Eli 17, Madelynn 11, Sofia 10, Isaiah 8, and Ella 6, got the pups dressed in their special wedding attire, and made some snacks for the back garden ceremony.\n\nThe dogs had a great time, and appear to be delighted their love has been confirmed.\n\nErin added: \u2018When we brought Gandalf home he was so clingy and lonely we could, not leave the house without him getting worked up in a fit \u2013 so we decided to purchase him a bride. Best decision ever!\n\n\u2018Gandalf thinks he is 10 feet tall, he is a lover, a flirt, gives the smoulder and constantly has to be touching someone for a snuggle.\n\n\u2018He is able to do all the tricks his cattle dog fur siblings are able to do.\n\n\u2018Galadriel, as her name, is regal, royalty, head always up, always together looking her best, she is the queen of the house, and she knows she\u2019s gorgeous.\n\n\u2018They love to snuggle, bark, walk, bathe, they do everything together.\u2019\n\nTrue love really knows no species.\n\nMORE: Mum shares photos of her loose skin to celebrate embracing her post-partum body\n\nMORE: Can cats, dogs and other pets eat pumpkin seeds?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In a wedding with a difference, two daschunds got married in the most beautiful ceremony EVER.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92552497_1572100190.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
