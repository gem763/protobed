REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nProsecutors in the city of Braunschweig said on Tuesday they would press criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, as well as non-executive Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn.\n\nThe charges show how the German company, which in September 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, is struggling to move on from a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.\n\nCourt proceedings are under way over that admission. The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig - in Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) home region of Lower Saxony - is part of a separate legal push to try managers over an alleged delay in informing investors of the company\u2019s wrongdoing.\n\nLawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges that they knowingly held back vital information, while Volkswagen said its supervisory board would meet immediately to discuss the indictments which, if accepted by a Braunschweig state court, will lead to a trial date being set.\n\nVolkswagen this year bucked a trend of falling demand for passenger cars by launching a range of popular sport utility vehicles, and is investing billions to try to become a leader in electric and self-driving technologies.\n\nIts shares were down 2.9% at 152.08 euros at 1205 GMT.\n\nDiess\u2019s lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company.\n\nVolkswagen shares lost up to 37% in value in the days after the scandal broke. Had investors known about the emissions test cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, plaintiffs have argued.\n\nVolkswagen and its executives have said the fallout from the scandal was not foreseeable, and that they had expected to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities prior to the disclosure of the test cheating.\n\nRELEVANT INFORMATION\n\nBraunschweig prosecutors said the accused should have kept investors informed.\n\n\u201cThey pursued a strategy to achieve a settlement with the U.S. authorities without disclosing all relevant information,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nWinterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke, having been CEO for eight years. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than Volkswagen had officially admitted.\n\nPoetsch became a management board member at Volkswagen in 2003 and was made chairman in 2015.\n\nThe 636-page indictment alleges Winterkorn was fully aware of the matter and potential financial damage to Volkswagen as of March 2015. Poetsch was allegedly informed on June 29 and Diess on July 27.\n\nInvestigations into the alleged perpetrators of the illegal engine control software, also known as defeat devices, have seen the arrest of the then CEO of Volkswagen\u2019s Audi unit, Rupert Stadler. In July 2019, Stadler - whose contract was later terminated by Volkswagen - and three defendants were charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices. Investigations into a further 23 suspects continue, the Munich prosecutor said at the time.\n\nBraunschweig prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four other managers with fraud over their role in the manipulation of emissions testing.", "description": "German prosecutors have accused Volkswagen's CEO of holding back market-moving information on rigged emissions tests four years ago, raising the prospect of fresh upheaval at the carmaker just as it tries to reinvent itself as a champion of clean driving.", "authors": ["Ludwig Burger", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433295317&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0OT-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
