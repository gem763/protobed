Its speed makes it even harder to hit.\n\nChina also showed off the DF-100 hypersonic cruise missile which can travel up to 3000km, a supersonic surveillance drone and a lightweight tank.\n\nMr Roggeveen said China had prioritised systems that allowed it to neutralise American strength at sea and in the air, which its military bases in Asia offered.\n\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute defence program director Michael Shoebridge said the display \"was the fruits of sustained military modernisation\" but believed the US still had the edge.\n\n\"Seeing stuff on trolleys and being towed around is very different to seeing stuff that works,\" he said.\n\nHe said China's military was still dealing with challenges imposed by a reorganisation within, a purge of leaders under Mr Xi and the integration of new systems all at once.\n\n\"They are making progress but they are like a boa constrictor that has swallowed three goats,\" he said.", "description": "China has showcased updated long-range nuclear weapons, bombers and drones in a challenge to the military superiority of the United States.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.306%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_68/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7630ad9da799d43cc0a84a7891138ba4dee05e84", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
