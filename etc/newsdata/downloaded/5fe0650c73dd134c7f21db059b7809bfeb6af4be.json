In an order obtained by TIME, Kastrenakes wrote that the publicity surrounding the case was a factor in his decision.\n\n\u201cGiven the abundant publicity surrounding Mr. Somerville\u2019s case, I have concluded that the importance and seriousness of a sworn juror abiding by the law has been made clear,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSomerville was summoned for jury duty for the first time this summer and was selected to serve as a juror on a civil case, AP reports. He was set to arrive in court the following day at 9 a.m. but missed his alarm and decided instead to head to work after waking up around 11 or 11:30 a.m., failing to inform the court or bailiff he was not attending. According to the Associated Press, the 21-year-old works at an after-school program and lives with his grandparents, helping to take care of his ailing grandfather.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Somerville was found guilty of criminal contempt during a Sept. 20 hearing and was immediately handcuffed and taken into custody \u2014 spending the next 10 days in jail until his Sept. 29 release.\n\nOn Friday, Oct. 4 Somerville appealed his case in court and read an apology letter to Judge Kastrenakes, court records show. \u201cUpon waking up and realizing I was extremely late, I failed to comply with rules and contact the courthouse to notify them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was an immature decision that I made, and I paid the price for my freedom.\u201d\n\nAfter Somerville read his apology letter, Kastrenakes reduced his sentence to three months probation and lowered his community service down to 30 hours, court records show. But on Monday, Kastrenakes changed his mind again and decided to rescind the contempt finding, clearing Somerville\u2019s criminal record entirely. In his latest decision, Kastrenakes says Somerville no longer needed to be punished following the publicity of the case.\n\n\u201cI know he now understands and respects our system of justice and the critical role jurors play in that system,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote. \u201cIn conclusion, I do not want even a finding of contempt to be gleaned from a perusal of his background or record.\u201d\n\nSomerville\u2019s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Daniel Eisinger, tells TIME that Somerville and his family are \u201crelieved and happy\u201d his record is expunged and that Somerville is looking forward to putting this experience behind him. \u201cFor him (Somerville) it goes back to the harrowing experience of having to go to jail for the first time,\u201d Eisinger tells TIME. \u201cIt\u2019s a traumatic event for anybody but especially for a young man like that, that has really been in no trouble in his entire life. So I think that while he\u2019s moving on and he\u2019s doing pretty well, that is going to be something that\u2019s going to take some time to get over.\u201d\n\nEisinger says that while he was surprised about the timing, he knew that once the judge would get to know Somerville as a person he would be inclined to clear Somerville\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cI thought that when we presented all the information to the judge \u2014 when he learned more about Deandre, more about his family, his upbringing, all the good work he does for the community and his grandfather and church \u2014 I thought at some point the judge would consider vacating the entire thing,\u201d he says.\n\nSomerville\u2019s sentence made national headlines, with many expressing outrage at the harshness of the sentence. A Change.org petition posted on Sunday asking to punish Judge Kastenakes for his \u201coverkill punishment\u201d has already garnered over 11,000 signatures as of Tuesday.\n\nReferring to Kastenakes, the petition said, \u201cThis man clearly abused his power as a judge and deserves punishment for his actions equal to that of what he sentenced Mr. Somerville for, or he should just be relieved of his position altogether!\u201d\n\nCelebrities including Chelsea Handler also weighed in, stating that race was a deciding factor in sentencing.\n\n\u201c10 days,\u201d Handler tweeted. \u201cHe\u2019s spending the same amount of time in jail that parents who committed college bribery are spending. Why? Because he\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com.", "description": "A Florida judge vacated a contempt finding for Deandre Somerville, who served 10 days in jail after oversleeping and missing jury duty", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-174197278.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
