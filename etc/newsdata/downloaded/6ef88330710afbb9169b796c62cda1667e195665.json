(Adam Ewing/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe negotiations begin after my husband, Dante, our two teenage kids and I pack ourselves into our car and head out of town on a recent Friday afternoon: Cellphones stay in airplane mode, only to be used for music listening or photo taking. No grown-ups obsessively checking their work emails, reading headlines or scrolling through Twitter, and no kids texting friends, watching inexplicable YouTube videos (often of other people playing video games) or trying to capture Pok\u00e9mon. If all goes according to plan, this weekend will be about connecting with one another instead. Because sometimes it seems awfully hard to juggle both digital and family interactions \u2014 without compromising something meaningful.\n\nWe\u2019re on our way to West Virginia for a low-tech weekend at Lost River State Park \u2014 promisingly named, given our mission \u2014 just across the Virginia border in Mathias, W.Va. I\u2019ve chosen it not only because the park sounds beautiful, with lots of hiking trails, but because the cellphone service is spotty at best there. Plus, I\u2019ve been told that the cabin we\u2019ll be staying in has no WiFi, which will prevent the intrusions of work, school, social obligations, politics.\n\n\u201cThe average American checks their phone 80 times a day while on vacation,\u201d says Tiffany Shlain, author of \u201c24/6: The Power of Unplugging One Day a Week.\u201d \u201cYou look at your phone,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019s going to be something that stresses you out, whether it\u2019s an email, a text, a news headline \u2014 something that\u2019s going to take you out of being in that moment.\u201d\n\nRight now, Dante B, 14, isn\u2019t very pleased to be in this particular moment. In the back seat I hear him mumbling, \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I just don\u2019t like this whole thing.\u201d\n\nAfter stopping for burgers at the laid-back Lost River Grill, about 15 minutes outside the park, we head five miles down a winding road through the woods to the entrance and administrative building. An envelope with our key and instructions is taped to the front door. We\u2019re in a Legacy cabin, one of 15 in the park that were constructed in the 1930s with a wooden frame and logs by the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps. It\u2019s perfect: two bedrooms, a little living room and a bathroom. The fully equipped kitchen has a breadbox on the table where we all agree to stash our phones whenever we\u2019re in the cabin \u2014 \u201cthe breadbox of modernity,\u201d we call it. I read through the short welcome note in the envelope indicating \u201ca pay phone on the front porch of the Administration building for your convenience.\u201d And handwritten in pen at the bottom: a WiFi password. (Turns out they\u2019d wired up the place two weeks before our arrival, says Samuel England, chief of the West Virginia State Parks system, when I call him after the trip to ask about the surprising amenity. \u201cPeople feel like they need to stay connected when they\u2019re on vacation,\u201d he explains.) But I make no mention of it to my family.\n\nThat night we play the board games we\u2019ve packed \u2014 a few that had been stored, unused, in a living room cabinet for years. They include Cards Against Humanity, a party game where one person reads a question from a set of cards, and the others offer one of their response cards, trying to come up with the funniest answer. I realize midgame that some of the questions are R-rated or worse, but I can\u2019t remember the last time we\u2019ve laughed so hard together.\n\n\n\nA barn in fog outside Green Bank, W.Va. (Adam Ewing/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe next morning we explore Lost River State Park, a gloriously quiet spread of about 3,900 acres. Its most beautiful hike may be the 3.5-mile Millers Rock Trail, which leads to an overlook with an expansive view of tiny towns, fields and mountains. Nobody stops to check their phones for new texts or emails along the way \u2014 because we can\u2019t. Instead, we chat about the possibility of a bear sighting (highly unlikely) or enjoy the silence.\n\nIn the afternoon we drive south to Seneca Rocks, the magnificent rocky tower of white-gray Tuscarora quartzite rising 900 feet above the North Fork River in Monongahela National Forest. We climb the 1.3-mile trail, up steps and switchbacks for 700 feet to the top, impressed by the handful of rock climbers we can see scaling the peak the hard way. While we walk, I chat with my 16-year-old daughter, Mia, who says she thinks \u201csociety\u201d has a problem with cellphone addiction. \u201cI try to talk to my friends at lunch, and a lot of times they\u2019re just looking at their phones,\u201d she notes, adding that she sometimes wishes she didn\u2019t have a phone \u2014 or, much better, that no one had one.\n\nAfter lunch at the nearby Front Porch Restaurant, we head off to the Green Bank Observatory, home to the Green Bank Telescope, used to gather radio data from space. It\u2019s the reason the surrounding 13,000-square-mile area (most of it state and national forest) is labeled the National Radio Quiet Zone, where radio transmissions are limited to prevent disruptions to the telescope\u2019s reception \u2014 though only the approximately 150 people closest to the observatory aren\u2019t allowed WiFi, or in some cases even microwaves. We\u2019re given a bus tour of the grounds and background on the massive, 17-million-pound telescope and how scientists there work, in part, on finding signs of life beyond Earth.\n\nWe\u2019re all too tired for games when we finally get back to the cabin. Mia points out that we were so busy, it wasn\u2019t such a challenge to ignore her phone. My husband says he\u2019s been surprised by how many times he\u2019s reached for his pocket to check his email throughout the day and stopped himself \u2014 \u201cseveral times an hour,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt makes me realize how it\u2019s basically become a robotic habit.\u201d I\u2019ve been the same way: It\u2019s an almost unconscious impulse whenever there\u2019s a moment of downtime. It makes me want to retrain myself to be comfortable with a little boredom, if that\u2019s what a lack of digital stimuli is these days.\n\n\n\nA family at the Big Bend Campground (Cabins) in West Virginia. (Adam Ewing/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn Sunday, as we head home, we do a postmortem. We didn\u2019t check our emails or post photos on or scroll through social media all weekend. Countless Pok\u00e9mon went uncaught, friends and family went untexted, and all the maps we consulted were paper.\n\n\u201cI think we should do a trip like this every year,\u201d Dante B says, putting in his ear buds as we near home. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to listen to a podcast now.\u201d\n\nIf You Go\n\nCastaway Caboose (Durbin). You can board the Durbin Rocket, a steam train that drops off you and your fully renovated Wabash Railroad caboose (with bathroom facilities and fridge and cooking area) in a remote area by the Greenbrier River, with no cell service. The caboose holds up to six people. $330 for first night, $225 for second night, $190 for third night. 304-636-9477. mountainrailwv.com.\n\nLost River State Park (Mathias).

This seriously off-the-grid campground in the gorgeous Smoke Hole Canyon in Monongahela National Forest is a favorite for fishing \u2014 it sits by the South Branch of the Potomac River \u2014 and hiking. Its 46 sites are available from April through late October. Camping fees range from $22 to $40 a night, with bathroom and shower facilities. 877-444-6777. recreation.gov.\n\nChristina Ianzito is a writer and editor in Washington.", "description": "Is unplugging for a weekend considered roughing it these days?", "authors": ["Christina Ianzito"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E6RjatZm4zNIxfpwbfGpHqA-8nQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7L4TEOWCVII6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
