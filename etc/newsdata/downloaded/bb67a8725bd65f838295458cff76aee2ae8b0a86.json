Key areas of collaboration and development will include carbon emissions tracking and supply chain transparency \u2014 with projects to tackle provenance tracking, chain of custody and production methods.\n\nJ\u00f6rgen Sandstr\u00f6m, Head of the Mining and Metals Industry at the WEF, has given a statement outlining that:\n\n\u201cMaterial value chains are undergoing profound change and disruption. The industry needs to respond to the increasing demands of minerals and materials while responding to increasing demands by consumers, shareholders and regulators for a higher degree of sustainability and traceability of the products.\u201d\n\nAlongside the WEF, the initiative\u2019s members are Antofagasta Minerals, the Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore International AG, Kl\u00f6ckner & Co., Tata Steel Ltd. and Tracr, which represents AngloAmerican and De Beers.\n\nInternational regulators and NGOs are also expected to provide input for the firms\u2019 collaborative development of blockchain solutions for the industry.\n\nWEF\u2019s blockchain policy guidance\n\nThis summer, the WEF published a Blockchain Value Framework guide advising global businesses to invest time in understanding blockchain technology, identifying incentives and accounting for potential risks, and to align its implementation with their strategic priorities.\n\nAt the end of May, the WEF had announced the formation of six separate \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d councils to work on new technology policy guidance.\n\nAhead of today\u2019s industry-wide venture, bilateral blockchain projects in the mining and metals sector have included a Tracr pilot for De Beers and Russia\u2019s Alrosa \u2014 the world\u2019s largest diamond mining firm.", "description": "The World Economic Forum and seven major mining and metals firms are partnering to develop responsible sourcing and sustainability practices using blockchain", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDEyYTljY2Y3M2VkMTEzNTIxOTNhZTgwMzFhODllOTEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
