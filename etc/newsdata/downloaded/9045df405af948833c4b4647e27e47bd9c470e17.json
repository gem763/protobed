She is an amazing grandmother, and we can rely on her to do what she says she will do.\n\nShe can also be selfish and overstep boundaries, and this seems to be getting worse as she ages.\n\nWhen I ask her questions such as, does she want to do this or visit on this date, or when I try to establish a boundary gently, sometimes I get a look and a non-answer.\n\nShe hears me. My husband will do this, too, but I can ask him for a verbal response, even if it's \"I need to think about that.\" Typically it's when she doesn't want to do something or doesn't agree with me, but I am not sure because I can't read minds yet.\n\nI don't expect her to agree or to say yes, but sometimes I do need an answer to continue planning.\n\nI just feel it's rude not to respond or say SOMETHING. I have said things like, \"What do you think?\" and I still get a non-answer. It feels like a control tactic to me. Suggestions?\n\nBlink Once for Yes, Twice for No: You don\u2019t need to read her mind; you just need to guess at it. Nothing says you have to be right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll take that to mean you don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d\n\nThen: \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead with X\u201d \u2014 with X being whatever your preferred plan is that doesn\u2019t require her input \u2014 \u201cso just let me know if have something else in mind.\u201d\n\nDone. That way you have an answer, if not the right answer, which allows you to continue planning \u2014 and she has her opportunity to correct you by speaking up as she should have in the moment, if there was something she wanted to say. Be prepared to hold your ground as needed if, say, she speaks up too late in the planning process.\n\nPlus, if these non-answers are in fact a control tactic (certainly sounds possible), then you\u2019ll have foiled it utterly. Projecting her answer and then acting on it means your plans are no longer at her mercy.\n\nBest of all, if cheerfully done, this tactic leaves the loveliness of your relationship intact. Think of it as a grand jet\u00e9 over an obstruction, as if it\u2019s not even there.\n\nDear Carolyn: A friend of my sister-in-law has a daughter who is getting married soon. Sister-in-law was invited, my wife and I were not.\n\nNow sister-in-law's plus-one cannot go. We saw the bride's mom by chance in public and she invited my wife to be the plus-one.\n\nI said to my wife that was a classless thing to do. Inviting a married woman to a wedding and not her husband?\n\nMy wife is now mad at me, because she thinks she was only invited to be the plus-one. I said it was not the bride's mother's job to pick the plus-one. Thoughts?\n\nAnonymous: I think you\u2019re overthinking, over-judging, over-harrumphing.\n\nThis was a generous, impromptu offer for two sisters (right?) to be together in celebration of someone they both know \u2014 someone you aren\u2019t as close to as they are. Right?\n\nIf so, then why on Earth begrudge your wife that?", "description": "Here\u2019s the answer for the non-answer.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
