Some 45% of major characters on broadcast, cable and streaming TV were female, the report found, up from 40% in 2017-2018.\n\nMeanwhile, women made up 31% \u2014 an increase from the previous record of 28% in 2016-2017 \u2014 of those working in top behind-the-camera gigs like directing, writing and producing. Women made up one in four creators, edging up from 22% during the previous year.\n\n\u201cIt is heartening to see moderate but widespread gains for female characters and women working behind the scenes this year, but we need to consider the numbers within the larger context of women\u2019s employment in television,\u201d study author Martha Lauzen said in a statement.\n\nFor example, \u201cin 2018-19, women comprised 26% of directors. This is a historic high, up from 17% in 2017-18,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, men continue to direct the vast majority of programs. In this context, \u2018historic high\u2019 still means that men outnumber women 3 to 1 in this role.\u201d\n\nAdding to the reality check: More than half of programs had five or fewer women working in behind-the-camera roles measured, while just 3% of programs had 14 or more women occupying those jobs. On the flip side, 17% of programs had five or fewer men working behind the camera, and 38% had 14 or more men. Nearly all (96%) didn\u2019t have any female directors of photography, while almost eight in 10 had zero female directors, editors or creators, respectively.\n\nFemale characters were also less likely than male ones to be identified by their job (66% versus 75%, respectively) and to be shown at work in their workplace (44% versus 56%). Moreover, they were far more likely than their male counterparts (53% versus 39%) to play roles oriented toward personal life, like a mother or wife, than to play roles oriented toward work.\n\nResearch suggests that the portrayal of women in popular TV shows and movies can influence viewers\u2019 lives. A 2018 study by 21st Century Fox, the Geena Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson Intelligence, for example, found that nine in 10 women familiar with \u201cThe X-Files\u201d character Dana Scully said she was a role model for women and girls. Nearly two in three women working in STEM called her a personal role model.\n\nMeanwhile, a study published earlier this year in the peer-reviewed Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media linked regular viewing of the women-led political dramas \u201cMadam Secretary,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d with greater political interest (like following news about government and elections) and political self-efficacy (the extent to which they felt able to make a difference by participating in the election process).\n\nAnd the more women work as creators, the greater the chances of women cropping up in other aspects of production, Lauzen\u2019s study suggests: Programs that had at least one female creator \u201cemployed substantially greater percentages of women in other key behind-the-scenes roles and featured more female characters in major and speaking roles than programs with exclusively male creators,\u201d she wrote.", "description": "\u2018We need to consider the numbers within the larger context of women\u2019s employment in television.\u2019", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ672_womeni_ZG_20190904122107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
