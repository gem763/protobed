In south west London last Sunday, supporters of a few clubs were gathered to watch the day\u2019s football, when Aaron Cresswell curled in West Ham United\u2019s second against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side.\n\nThere were initial raucous cheers, but they were gradually engulfed by laughter. It wasn\u2019t that relishing laughter, either, of the type that comes with a rare setback. It was a more mocking laughter, at the predictable hilarity of it all. Season four of this comedy show was really picking up speed.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat in itself is a stark but predictable turn from the utter dread this same club used to inspire. United were often a horror for everyone else.\n\nIt\u2019s not that long ago that a 2-0 lead against Manchester United \u2013 even with little of a game to go \u2013 would have been a cause for fear; for trepidation. You knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cIt was sometimes as if they gave teams the lead for sport,\u201d Andy Heaton of the Anfield Wrap says. \u201cThey conditioned the opposition, any opposition, at any level, to expect what was to come by the final whistle.\u201d\n\nThis was the other side of every single United win. Every great success was someone else\u2019s great humiliation, to become a trampled victim of their victory. United lording it for so long had so many underfoot.\n\nEvery spring day seemed \u201canother good afternoon for Manchester United in the title race\u201d.\n\nEvery other club has their specific resentment; their day when Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s team made them feel so small.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWatching them batter various West Ham teams over the years was to see a side operating on a different plane to everyone else, much as [Pep] Guardiola\u2019s City side are now,\u201d Jim Kearns of \u2018The H List\u2019 blog says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen us lose 6-0 and 7-1 at Old Trafford.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hated them, the late goals, the arrogance, the Status Quo cup final song tripe,\u201d Stephen Goldsmith, of Sunderland\u2019s \u2018Wise Men Say\u2019 podcast adds.\n\nIt was something that Patrice Evra articulated well on social media on Monday.\n\n\u201cPeople are laughing at us because we hurt them so much in the past!\u201d\n\nAnd in so many ways.\n\nThere was one way that stood out above all, that fittingly lasted longest in the memory: the last-minute winner.\n\nIt was almost the ultimate display of the club\u2019s power, as if they had a command of time itself.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer scores the winning goal against Liverpool in 1999 (Rex Features)\n\nMost bad memories of United revolve around this, as with Heaton and Liverpool in a 1999 FA Cup fourth-round tie. Michael Owen had put Liverpool 1-0 up after four minutes, the scoreline it still was with two minutes left. You know the rest. Dwight Yorke, then Solskjaer.\n\n\u201cThe very second we dared to believe, United did what they always do,\u201d Heaton says \u201cTwo goals in four minutes, the second as predictable as it was gut-wrenching. They\u2019d done it again, and you couldn\u2019t escape thinking that the manner of it was almost by design. And of course, they repeated the trick later that season, at the Nou Camp, and not one person in Liverpool was surprised.\n\n\u201cThat the scorer of the winner in both those games now occupies the manager\u2019s seat at Old Trafford is one of those quirks only football tends to throw up.\u201d\n\nManchester City perhaps show this, and suffered this, more than anyone. They conceded three different last-minute winners to United in the 2009-10 season alone.\n\nJust as all that felt so karmically reversed by City scoring three late goals to make it 6-1 at Old Trafford in October 2011, all of the current glee is a consequence of all that pain.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to dread United any more. And all that dread has been replaced by a delight, locked up and cranked up for years.\n\n\u201cI remember getting into school the day after a City defeat in about 1997 and a United-supporting friend greeted me with a version of Oasis\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger\u2019: \u2018And so City can wait, they know it\u2019s too late, cos they\u2019ve lost once again\u2026\u2019\u201d David Mooney, of City\u2019s Blue Moon podcast explains.\n\n\u201cHe was symptomatic of what a lot of United fans of my generation are \u2013 or were. They believe, or believed at least, that there was something genuinely different about them and that line about it being in their DNA was more than just hyperbole. I used to hate that, so it\u2019s nice to see a lot of those types of United fan \u2013 and there are more down-to-earth United fans, but they weren\u2019t teasing me in school \u2013 having to watch the club sink into insignificance.\u201d\n\nUnited appear an altogether different side now (Getty)\n\nKearns goes further.\n\n\u201cFans of teams like Manchester United only need to look at wider society to understand their unpopularity and the glee over their downfall. You can\u2019t hoover up so much of the resources in the game, fix the finances to your own ends and expect people to like you. They are the living embodiment of privilege.\u201d\n\nThis, however, is what is so marked about United\u2019s decline. The privilege of wealth remains. You only have to look at the latest financial figures.\n\nThis is why one parallel remains, right down to the glee that went with that, not least from United fans: Liverpool in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cSince Ferguson\u2019s exit \u2013 and it\u2019s only now people are confident enough to say it publicly \u2013 but our hope was they\u2019d stutter in much the way Liverpool did under Souness,\u201d Heaton explains. \u201cThe thinking was that they\u2019re so powerful solutions would be easily afforded and implemented. But if anything, it\u2019s their size and weight of history that is their biggest issue, like a super tanker struggling to turn in testing waters, and having tried pretty much every different approach possible, they\u2019re, at least on the pitch, unrecognisable.\u201d\n\nOff the pitch, everyone now recognises executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThe fact they haven\u2019t made a good decision in five years and are still a leading team is also a problem,\u201d Kearns adds. \u201cAs soon as they replace Woodward and Solskjaer with anyone halfway competent they\u2019ll be back on top again, such are their financial advantages. Another reason to explain the current outpouring of joy.\u201d\n\nBarney Chilton, of United\u2019s Red News fanzine, feels all this should just be new motivation for his club.\n\n\u201cI am honestly not bothered about rival fans. When you lord it up for 23 years with incredible success we could only have dreamed of in the 1980s \u2013 hoping we would win just one title \u2013 you now have to take your medicine. You would like to think it makes those at United acutely aware how bad things now are. More painful is we dropped the ball and messed things up just at the wrong time as our two biggest rivals got their act together. We are outsiders to what was our party.\n\nTimes have changed at Manchester United (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe are not as bad as Utd in the 1980s, but I fear this is not the bottom of how bad things could get.\n\n\u201cAs each year passes I am more fearful. Football does give pain and pleasure in cycles but because we seem so loathe to implement a sensible long term vision and approach with, say, a proper footballing structure above the manager, letting Ed Woodward and his ego continue to fail, I can\u2019t see how we can get out of this loop of making the same mistakes. A mess much of our own making, you wonder what Fergie feels of how the club have handled it.\u201d\n\nWe know how everyone else feels.\n\n\u201cUnited\u2019s time may come again, but for now it\u2019s over,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cYou won\u2019t find much sympathy from City fans who grew up being told that United were just a better club and that no team would ever be as good as them.\n\n\u201cIf the best they can do these days is to postpone City winning a title by a week with an unexpected win at the Etihad, then they\u2019ve become exactly what they derided others for in the past.\u201d\n\nAnd everyone else is now revelling because of that past.\n\nRead more\n\nHow United\u2019s Rochdale scare exposed Solskjaer\u2019s biggest problems", "description": "A little scene that says a lot, not least about the shadow cast by Manchester United\u2019s long history of success.
