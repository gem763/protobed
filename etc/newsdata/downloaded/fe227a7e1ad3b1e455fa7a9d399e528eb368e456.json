The boy is thought to have slipped to a depth of 100 feet\n\nInitially, a thermal camera had been used to monitor the child's body temperature while oxygen was supplied through a pipe.\n\nAuthorities said the child was wedged in a position about 30-feet deep when he first fell, before slipping in an upright standing position further into the well.\n\nLocal media reports suggest the young boy is now stuck 100 feet into the well, posing an additional challenge to the rescuers who are struggling with both the depth of the well, and the rocky ground.\n\nAttempts to use robotic devices to lower ropes to latch onto the boy's wrist failed on Saturday.\n\nWorkers used an oil drill to dig a hole parallel to the well on Sunday, but the rig broke down at around 33 feet deep because of the hard, rocky surface.\n\nImages on social media show dozens of workers and at least two diggers at the site of the well where the boy remains trapped.\n\nTamil Nadu state's health minister told reporters rescuers getting through the rock proved challenging.\n\n'Even the high powered rigs have struggled to break through the rock,' he said.\n\n'We have just reached about 40 feet and the work has not progressed as planned. We have sought an advanced drill bit from Chennai and it will come soon. That will be an ultimate attempt,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, workers will continue to try to also rescue the boy using a rope system, despite previous failed attempts.\n\nThe rocky ground is posing a challenge to workers who are trying to dig into the ground and find a way of pulling out the trapped toddler\n\nWhile, the officials are trying to rescue on one side, Sujiths mother, Kalairani on the request of rescue officials has started striching a cloth bag in which they hope to bring Sujith up after expanding it inside the borewell. #SaveSujith @xpresstn @NewIndianXpress pic.twitter.com/btcu4eGuJq \u2014 Jayakumar Madala (@JayakumarMadala) October 26, 2019\n\nLocal reporters have said the mother is at the site calling to her son, asking him not to cry.\n\nHis mother, named by local media as Kalairani was also seen stitching a cloth bag, which rescuers hoped to use to bring the toddler up out of the well.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his concerns about the fate of the young boy after meeting with the rescuers.\n\n'My prayers are with the young and brave Sujith Wilson...Every effort is being made to ensure that he is safe,' he said.\n\nMy prayers are with the young and brave Sujith Wilson.
