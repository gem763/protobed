However, it could hinge on the actions of a handful of independents and the Democratic Unionist party, as well as the Liberal Democrats and SNP who have historically voted for remain and second referendum options rather than soft Brexit ones.\n\nPlay Video 1:33 Brexit process 'a waste of time and energy', says Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 video\n\nLabour has said it will back an amendment in favour of a customs union and accepts that one proposed by backbenchers has the best chance of cross-party success.\n\nNo 10 said Johnson would not accept a customs union. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, told the BBC now was not the time to discuss Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU and matters such as the customs union.\n\n\u201cThis is a piece of legislation which simply puts into effect in UK law what the prime minister has managed to negotiate. The critical thing is the future relationship will be subject to a negotiating mandate that will be debated and voted on in the House of Commons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose MPs who have concerns about issues such as that [the burden on businesses sending goods to Northern Ireland] or the customs union ... they will have the ability to discuss and vote on that later on, once we have left the European Union.\u2019\n\nJenrick added: \u201cThose MPs who want to deliver Brexit will be voting with the government today.\u201d", "description": "At least five MPs put names to amendment that could result in PM pulling EU bill", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10970d9de6b9a4d8ce74e936324a5bdc88e53dce/0_113_3937_2363/master/3937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=227f9fcd630410e03a465b5c3083e44e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
