This take isn\u2019t controversial; it\u2019s really barely even an opinion, given the abundant, well-established evidence that backs up the benefits of introducing some kind of practice\u2014be it yoga, tai chi, or just meditation\u2014into your life. Stress reduction, improvements in memory function and ability to focus, and decreases in emotional reactivity are just a few of the ways mindfulness can make your brain straight-up function better. But a new series of studies posits another neat thing that mindfulness can do: Improve your demeanor as a worker!\n\nThe paper in question, published in the September issue of the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, includes a trio of studies conducted by business professors. Researchers observed workers at an American insurance company and an Indian IT consulting center and concluded that even seven to eight minutes of meditation a day can \u201cmake people more helpful\u201d in their work environment. \u201cEven with a one-time intervention, you\u2019re getting smoother, pleasant, more helpful workers,\u201d said Lindsey Cameron, one of the paper\u2019s co-authors and a University of Pennsylvania professor in an interview with Knowledge@Wharton. OK, \u201csmooth, pleasant, and helpful\u201d is a great way to characterize dolphins who rescue people from shipwrecks. But as a description of actual human beings, it rings a little more hollow.\n\nMindfulness in the workplace has become increasingly common at massive corporations where offices double as adult playgrounds (or, like, very swanky dungeons). Cameron\u2019s argument, and the argument in general, for marrying mindfulness to workplace productivity is that because work looms so large in our lives, it\u2019s only reasonable that we dedicate as much physical and mental energy to it as possible. \u201cWe spend more time at work than we actually do with our family, and sometimes there can be frictions. People are working in teams, so mindfulness can act like a buffer to improve relational coordination and functioning,\u201d Cameron said to Knowledge@Wharton. Not to be all \u201cHave you guys seen the new season of Black Mirror?\u201d but the idea of practicing mindfulness specifically to become a more pleasant employee is bleak and dystopian.\n\n\n\nSorry, but if my Buddhist family members, the Outdoor Voices exercise dress, and that picture of Lindsay Lohan looking blissed out in front of a temple in Thailand haven\u2019t convinced me to meditate for 15 minutes every day, the prospect of being a more pleasant employee is not gonna be my tipping point!!!\n\nIt\u2019s especially rich to see mindfulness touted as a tool for improving worker performance when work-related stress has been climbing for literal decades. Programs like Google\u2019s Search Inside Yourself, a \u201cmindful leadership initiative\u201d that has since expanded into an independent training program, stand in stark contrast to the way the company treats its legion of contractors, some of whom just unionized last month in a historic first for white-collar tech workers. Employees don\u2019t need to breathe deeply and purposefully or get into desk-bound yoga\u2014we need adequate wages, benefits, parental leave, and a robust work-life separation. If the people I know are any indication, sleep-disrupting, relationship-impacting stress might be the only work trend hotter than mindfulness right now.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "I would rather quit my job than strive to be \u201csmooth, pleasant, and helpful.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9cd41db84028000ab6baaf/lede/1570561330222-ARC_Shutterstock_1033273873_Smiling_woman_yoga_lotus_pose_VICE_RF.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
