So I've got something to look forward to.'\n\nIn an emotional interview with GMB he paid tribute to his 'great supporter' who was a 'fantastically gorgeous looking woman'.\n\nViewers said they were 'in floods of tears' after watching the candid interview and praised Vinnie for setting an example to men afraid to talk about their emotions.\n\nVinnie Jones broke down in tears as he revealed his wife Tanya told him and their daughter 'not to grieve' as she will be waiting for them both in heaven\n\nVinnie told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid he is speaking out about his grief in order to help others.\n\nAsked how he is doing, he said: 'Keeping busy, that's the first thing. You've got to get out there for other guys who are struggling.\n\n'It's made a difference, I didn't see that coming.'\n\nHe added that the 'enormity' of his grief hit him when he saw the world continuing as normal after Tanya passed away.\n\nHe said: 'The hardest part of it all for me even that day everybody's life goes on.\n\nViewers said they were 'in floods of tears' after watching the candid interview and praised Vinnie for setting an example to men afraid to talk about their emotions\n\n'You're looking around and saying this is the biggest tragedy of my life, but people are going to work, they're coming back from work, they're still queuing for Starbucks.'\n\nVinnie said he and his family got through 360 tea bags in just one week following Tanya's death.\n\nShe spent her final moments surrounded by her family at the family's Hollywood home with 24-hour intensive medical care after Vinnie refused to have her moved to a hospice.\n\nA tearful Vinnie Jones has spoken of the moment his beloved wife Tanya died after a six-year battle with cancer\n\nHe said: 'The worst thing about it is we went in to the hospital one day and there's a window where people go to be told it's a week, day month a year.\n\n'They took us into that bad news room. That's when you know.'\n\nAsked what the doctors said to him, he replied: 'It was about a hospice. I said she ain't going to no hospice.\n\n'Over the years I have slept in the room with her every night she was in overnight.\n\n'Three intensive cares we had her in as well.'\n\nHe continued: 'She said: 'You'll look after me Vin, won't you?

That was my moment. I knew she'd gone.'\n\nComparing Tanya's behaviour to that of other footballers' wives Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy (pictured with husband Jamie) and their ongoing spat, he said: 'She's the opposite to these girls now.'\n\nVinnie said his wife would 'never want to be special', refused to give press interviews and didn't want to ruin her family's festivities when she got a call to say her cancer had spread to her brain last year.\n\nComparing her behaviour to that of other footballers' wives Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy and their ongoing spat, he said: 'She's the opposite to these girls now.\n\nComparing her behaviour to that of other footballers' wives Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy and their ongoing spat, he said: 'She's the opposite to these girls now.\n\n'I think it's quite funny.
