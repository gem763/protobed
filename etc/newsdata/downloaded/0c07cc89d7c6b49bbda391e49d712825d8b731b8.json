Fox News was granted exclusive access to a prison holding foreign fighters.\n\nWhat we found was a facility desperately understaffed \u2013 with its 5,000 fighters but hardly any guards. The camp authorities told us half of them had been sent to try and hold back the Turkish invasion.\n\nAT ISIS PRISONER CAMP IN SYRIA, BENJAMIN HALL 'STRUCK' BY SCARCITY OF GUARDS\n\nThey\u2019ve asked for Western help, but many European countries, won\u2019t take their prisoners back -- instead they\u2019ve stripped them of citizenship and left the Kurds to deal with them. It\u2019s a dire situation and one which could easily allow ISIS to re-form.\n\nAlready there are sleeper cells in the region, which keep trying to break them out using vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices to blow holes in the prison walls. 100 are thought to still be at large, after a series of jailbreaks.\n\nJAMES CARAFANO: AFGHANISTAN IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO US THAN SYRIA - AFGHANS NEED AMERICAN TROOPS\n\nAmong the prisoners -- sleeping about 25 to a room, in triple bunk beds -- was 27-year-old Zakkariyah Elogbani from London. He lost his legs in an explosion while with ISIS and is now hoping to be allowed home. He says he would take 20 years in a British prison rather than rotting here. Elogbani is softly spoken but his old social media posts are anything but. The man who was once a fervent believer in jihad freely admits he joined ISIS to kill.\n\nHowever, speaking inside the prison, he opened up about his five years with the terror group and how he now regrets that time. The sentiment is common among inmates, with not a single soul failing to express regret, while all amazingly claim to have been just cooks or cleaners -- not murderous fighters. Their guards disagree -- I don't doubt them.\n\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: IN NORTHERN SYRIA, AN UNCERTAIN WAY FORWARD\n\n\u201cThe whole experience was a mistake,\u201d Zakkariyah told me\u201d a big mistake - I had more zeal than sense.\u201d\n\nZakkariyah was one of the original British jihadis. He attended the same university in London as the now-infamous \"Beatles\" \u2013 the British group of terrorists who beheaded Western journalists. He traveled to Syria around the same time as them, but claims he didn\u2019t know them. \"I might have met them, but I don't remember,\" he claims.\n\nThe allegedly reformed fighter offered up what he would say to the families of those who have been killed at ISIS' bloody hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever I say it's not going to be enough.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry for the ones that were oppressed -- I\u2019m not expecting mercy from the people, we did things but it\u2019s better for us to be sent back to our countries.\n\nOther fighters told the same story, often complete with a litany of excuses. Some were too young, some were tricked, some were forced, while others attest they were always trying to escape.\n\nDozens of fighters have said the same thing -- essentially, they did nothing wrong, they claim. It\u2019s as if the whole episode was a sorry chapter, they\u2019d like us to forget.\n\nBut doing so is impossible. The scars ISIS caused run deep through the region -- and there isn't a family that has been spared the group's brutality.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMany fighters claim to want forgiveness.
