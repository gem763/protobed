(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the possibility of a United Auto Workers strike against General Motors (all times local):\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union has extended its national contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, but the pact with General Motors is still set to expire on Saturday night.\n\nGM has been picked as the union's target company, meaning it's the focus of bargaining and will be the first company to face a strike. The four-year contract with GM will expire at 11:59 p.m. Saturday.\n\nExperts say a strike against GM is likely given the wide gulf between the union and company on wages, plant closures and other issues.\n\nOne Detroit local union hall already has posted picket line schedules with no dates attached.\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nA strike against General Motors looms large as contracts with the United Auto Workers and Detroit's three automakers is about to expire.\n\nThe union's national agreements with GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler end at 11:59 p.m. Saturday. The union has picked GM as its target company.\n\nIt's possible that contracts will be extended or an agreement is reached. But 49,200 UAW members also could walk out of GM plants next week.\n\nExperts say both sides are far apart, with workers wanting a bigger slice of record company profits and automakers seeking to cut labor costs that are higher than U.S. factories owned by foreign-based companies.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union has extended its national contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, but the pact with General Motors is still set to expire on Saturday night.
