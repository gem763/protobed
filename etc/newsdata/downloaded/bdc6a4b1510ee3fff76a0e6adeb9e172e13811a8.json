Microsoft is enabling subscribers to its consumer plans to buy up to 1 TB of additional OneDrive storage, supplementing the 1 TB of storage they already get with their Office 365 subscriptions.\n\n\n\nIn June, Microsoft said it would be offering new, paid OneDrive Personal plans \"in the coming months.\" On September 23, Microsoft Director of Program Management Omar Shahine tweeted that the plans are now available to Office 365 Home and Personal customers. (Thanks to MSPoweruser.com for the link to his tweet.)\n\nConsumer Office 365 subscribers can buy more storage in 200 GB increments for $1.99 per month, up to 1 TB of additional storage, totaling $9.99 per month.\n\n\n\nOfficials said the maximum amount of storage Microsoft is allowing OneDrive consumers to get will be 2 TB (1 TB paid; one included in their subscriptions). There are currently no plans to offer more, officials said. Also, for those who have multiple users with 1TB each under their Office 365 Home plan, only the primary account holder is eligible for the extra storage purchase.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has been rolling out another new OneDrive option called OneDrive Personal Vault over the past few months. OneDrive Personal Vault is a new protected area in OneDrive that users can access only using a second source of identity verification.\n\nMicrosoft started making the feature, which will not cost anything additional, to OneDrive on the Web, OneDrive mobile and Windows 10 PC users starting first in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Microsoft plans to make it available to all of these customers worldwide by the end of calendar 2019.", "description": "Microsoft is rolling out the promised ability for Office 365 Home and Personal users to buy extra OneDrive cloud storage in 200 GB increments, up to 1 TB.", "authors": ["Mary Jo Foley"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/24/5a7ddccf-eef9-4e3c-b4db-4375588d6a72/thumbnail/770x578/69db7f6f0c364c1f4c37e2bea08e728a/onedrivepaidconsumerplans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
