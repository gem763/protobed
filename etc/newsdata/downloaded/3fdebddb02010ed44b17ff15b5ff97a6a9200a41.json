Many of the measures are expected to form the basis of the next Tory election manifesto.\n\nIn the Commons, Mr Johnson said his plans would help make Britain \u2018the greatest place on Earth\u2019. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the programme a \u2018farce\u2019, pointing out that the Prime Minister was 45 votes short of a majority.\n\nAllies of the PM last night conceded that MPs are likely to reject the Queen\u2019s Speech when it is voted on next week. Such a move would be the first time a Government had lost its entire legislative programme since 1924, when the then Conservative PM Stanley Baldwin was forced to resign. But Downing Street said Mr Johnson would not quit, and would continue to try to govern until Labour agreed to hold an election.\n\nBoris Johnson told the Commons the government's new legislative programme set out his vision to 'get Brexit done' and create an 'open, free-trading country'. He added how his plans would usher in \u2018a new age of opportunity\u2019, pledging to \u2018get this amazing country of ours moving again'\n\nHis official spokesman said: \u2018If MPs do choose to vote against the Queen\u2019s Speech it will be for them to explain why they are voting against greater support for public services including the police, school and hospitals, why they are blocking legislation that will lead to serious and dangerous offenders spending more time in prison, and why they are standing in the way of significant infrastructure improvements.\u2019\n\nSources said the Fixed-term Parliaments Act meant the loss of a Queen\u2019s Speech was no longer an automatic resignation issue.\n\nThe speech included:\n\nSeven anti-crime Bills, including measures to ensure serious offenders serve at least two-thirds of their sentences;\n\nPlans for a crackdown on single-use plastic as part of a wider package of environmental measures;\n\nA pledge to tackle the social care crisis, together with plans for a 2 per cent surcharge on council tax to help pay for it;\n\nA renewed commitment to take the UK out of the EU by the end of this month, with a deal if possible;\n\nControversial plans to require voters to produce photo IDs at polling stations to tackle electoral fraud;\n\nLegislation to end free movement and introduce a new points-based immigration system after Britain leaves the EU;\n\nPlans to force restaurants to hand over all tips to staff;\n\nLegislation to allow for no-fault divorces.\n\nMr Johnson said his plans would usher in \u2018a new age of opportunity\u2019. Pledging to \u2018get this amazing country of ours moving again,\u2019 he added: \u2018People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change. They don\u2019t want to wait for improvements in their hospitals.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t want to wait for their streets to be made safer. They don\u2019t want to wait for their schools to have the funding they need. And they don\u2019t want to wait any longer to get Brexit done.\u2019\n\nIn the speech, the Queen said it was the Government\u2019s \u2018priority\u2019 to leave the EU on October 31. But accompanying documents stated: \u2018We are leaving the European Union on October 31.\u2019 Number 10 denied the anomaly reflected a split between Downing Street and the Palace.\n\nThe Queen is pictured waiting patiently in the Lords chamber for MPs to trail in from the House of Commons for her speech today. She said it was the Government\u2019s \u2018priority\u2019 to leave the EU on October 31\n\nThe Prime Minister heads into the House of Lords with opposition Corbyn for the Queen's Speech - and according to Downing Street Mr Johnson would not quit if his programme was rejected and would continue to try to govern until Labour agreed to hold an election\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018Queen\u2019s Speeches are written in a particular form of language. They are different to the form of language the PM uses.\u2019\n\nMr Corbyn savaged the new package, saying: \u2018There has never been such a farce as a Government with a majority of minus-45 and a 100 per cent record of defeat in the Commons setting out a legislative agenda they know cannot be delivered in this Parliament.\u2019 He also suggested he could shortly back calls for an election.\n\nBut he was savaged by Mr Johnson for his flip-flopping on Brexit and mocked over reports that Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is masterminding a silent coup against him.\n\nMPs will now debate the plans ahead of a crunch vote on the package next Tuesday.\n\nA Budget will take place on November 6, just a week after Britain is due to have left the EU, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced yesterday. He said he would use it to \u2018shape the economy for the future\u2019.", "description": "Boris Johnson will not resign if his Queen's Speech is rejected next week - and will try to govern until Labour agree to hold an election.
