What Manchester United have had in the last four to five years is a mix of Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho players.\n\n'Ole is trying to get back to what Manchester United used to be, picking young hungry players - like Dan James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire,' he said.\n\nUnited legend Ryan Giggs insists that the Norwegian needs time to put his stamp on the squad\n\nGiggs also said that his former team mate should be given time at the helm, like rival managers Klopp and Guardiola.\n\n'But he's unfortunate in a way to be in the same era as Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola.\n\n'Klopp is in his fourth year at Liverpool. Pep established Man City during that time. Maurcio Pochettino has had six years with Spurs.\n\n'Ole has to be given time too. You need that time to mould your team into the way you want them to play, although whether managers always get that time in this day and age is another thing.'\n\nGiggs said Solskjaer should be given time at the helm, like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola\n\nKlopp took over from Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool after the Irishman was sacked in October 2015.\n\nThe German guided Liverpool to the Europa League final in his first season, losing out to Sevilla.\n\nHis side finished a lowly eight in the Premier League but in July 2016, Klopp and his coaching staff signed six-year extensions to their deals keeping them contracted at Liverpool until 2022.\n\nGuardiola has managed United's bitter rivals, Manchester City, for three years now\n\nThe success has been obvious, with Liverpool reaching two Champions League finals in two years, winning one, and coming within touching distance of winning the club's first Premier League title last season.\n\nGuardiola has managed United's bitter rivals, Manchester City, for three years - in which time he has won two English titles having gone trophy-less in his first season at the Etihad.\n\nUnited have a chance to put three points on the board when they travel to St James' Park on Sunday to face 19th-place Newcastle United.", "description": "Giggs - who made 963 appearances for the side - insists the Norwegian needs time to put his stamp on the squad.
