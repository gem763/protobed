It\u2019ll wrap up in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden 10 days before Christmas. And if that wasn\u2019t enough merriment, Carey will also re-release the album on Nov. 1.\n\nCarey really didn\u2019t need to go to such lengths to remind everyone of her supreme holiday majesty. Last year, \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d topped Spotify\u2019s all-time record for the most-streamed song in a single day on Christmas Eve, with just under 11 million streams.", "description": "\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" just crept back onto the iTunes charts.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daff4f0210000251e34ac60.jpeg?cache=woee2xax1s&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
