(Frank Augstein/Associated Press)\n\nFar from the tempest of the English Premier League, on a quiet suburban field where his parents played college soccer, Christian Pulisic was at ease as the U.S. national team gathered for a workout Wednesday at George Mason University.\n\n\u201cMy dad texted me after the first training and said, \u2018I scored 38 goals on this field, and your mom scored 10,\u2019 \u201c Pulisic said, allowing a smile to crack through a typically stern expression. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see where they used to play. I\u2019ve never really been here.\u201d\n\nThe Fairfax ties were a small, pleasant distraction in his complicated life. There is a lot on his agenda here, too. But 10 days with his American chums \u2014 first in the Washington area, then in Toronto for Nations League matches \u2014 are a respite from the elevated expectations and searing scrutiny that have shadowed him in London since Chelsea purchased him in January for $73 million, by far the largest transfer fee for a U.S. player.\n\n[One Cuban soccer player is able to chase his pro dream in the U.S. \u2014 without defecting]\n\nThe transition has not been seamless. Pulisic, a Hershey, Pa., native who turned 21 three weeks ago, has started some matches, subbed into others, sat on the bench a few times and did not pull on a uniform for a Champions League affair last week.\n\nThe inconsistent playing time has raised questions about the club\u2019s spending wisdom. The public reaction also has illuminated the nature of international soccer\u2019s cutthroat culture and the demand for instant returns.\n\n\u201cWhat did anybody expect, you know?\u201d said Michael Bradley, a U.S. national team midfielder. \u201cPeople thought he was going to walk in and play 90 minutes every single game? That\u2019s not how it works. He is going to move himself along in the right ways. It\u2019s not gone exactly how he would have hoped or envisioned so far, but that\u2019s all part of it.\u201d\n\nPulisic did arrive at U.S. camp on an upbeat note, contributing a fine assist Sunday during a 10-minute stint in a 4-1 victory at Southampton. It was his first Premier League appearance since Aug. 31.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pulisic did not want to discuss his Chelsea status, saying the national team \u201cis really all that\u2019s on my mind right now.\u201d\n\nThree days earlier, though, he told European-based reporters: \u201cObviously, I haven\u2019t been getting as many minutes as I would like. I will just keep going, keep pushing. I know my time\u2019s going to come.\u201d\n\nSince a promising preseason, Pulisic has slipped on the depth chart. Aside from veterans Willian and Pedro, he is battling Mason Mount, 20, and Callum Hudson-Odoi, 18, for assignments on the flanks.\n\nThose at the heart of the matter are preaching patience.\n\n\u201cHe has just turned 21,\u201d Chelsea Manager Frank Lampard said last week. \u201cSo if anyone is getting too excited about this [playing time], they should calm down, frankly.\u201d\n\n[Jozy Altidore will miss USMNT matches with injury]\n\nThere is no ignoring the buzz around Pulisic. For years, many U.S. players have made their way to the sport\u2019s most famous league, but none came with his skill set and attacking capacity.\n\nGiven the mind-blowing transfer fee and Pulisic\u2019s teenage success in Germany at Borussia Dortmund, expectations have tailed him like a speedy defender.\n\nAs Pulisic settles into Chelsea, U.S. officials say they understand the challenges.\n\n\u201cHe is a player we believe in,\u201d national team coach Gregg Berhalter said. \u201cWe\u2019re patient. We know things take time. We know sometimes adapting to different leagues takes time as well. We are patient with this process. If he has a good process in place \u2014 which we believe he does \u2014 we think his quality will come through.\u201d\n\nWith a break in the Premier League schedule, Pulisic is with the U.S. squad for matches against Cuba on Friday at Audi Field and Canada on Tuesday in Toronto. He arrived in Washington on Monday for workouts at the same complex off Route 123 where his father, Mark, was a potent forward between 1986 and 1989 and his mother, Kelley, was a starting defender from 1989 to 1992.\n\nBoth are planning to attend Friday\u2019s match, he said.\n\nThere is pressure here, too \u2014 pressure to lead the United States to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after the program\u2019s colossal failure to quality for the 2018 competition in Russia. Pulisic was part of that effort as well, and while he was not among the main culprits, he took it hard.\n\nWhen the next qualifying cycle begins a year from now, Pulisic will grasp a greater leadership role.\n\nHowever, \u201cI don\u2019t want to put it all on myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI see a lot of good things here. We\u2019re going to go in a confident bunch of guys.\u201d\n\nPulisic is no longer the kid in camp. Philadelphia Union midfielder Brenden Aaronson, 18, is new to the senior group.\n\n\u201cHe is younger than me, right?\u201d Pulisic asked reporters before Wednesday\u2019s practice. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as young anymore.\u201d\n\nHe does not see himself languishing on the Chelsea bench, either. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to keep pushing and earn my spot,\u201d he said recently.\n\nBerhalter would love to see his prized player logging 90 minutes every weekend in England, experience that would carry over to the national team. The reality, though, calls for a slower timetable.\n\n\u201cAll of us, we want to rush things sometimes, myself included,\u201d Berhalter said, \u201cbut this is the case where he is quality and his time will come.\u201d\n\nUnited States vs. Cuba\n\nWhat: Nations League, group stage.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday.\n\nWhere: Audi Field\n\nTV: Fox Sports 1, UniMas.\n\nRead more on soccer:\n\nD.C.
