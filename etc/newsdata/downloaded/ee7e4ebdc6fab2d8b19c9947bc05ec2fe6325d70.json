The fans gasped at every jump and roared each time he cleared the bar.\n\nAfter delivering a gold medal - to go along with his 2017 world championship and his silver from the Rio Olympics - Barshim stood in silence on the podium, waiting to hear his name and the Qatari anthem.\n\nBut the sound system broke down just when it was needed most. There was a smattering of confused applause as Barshim and his fellow medalists departed without their medals.\n\nThey will be back for another try at the medal ceremony Saturday. A perfect incentive for the crowds to return, especially if free tickets are being handed out again.\n\n\u201cThey came because they believed,\u201d Barshim said. \u201cI am happy about that because tomorrow is better because I am tired and I need everyone there to sing the national anthem.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s emir - the spectator who ultimately bankrolled this first track and field world championships in the Middle East - was there to savor Barshim\u2019s crowning moment.\n\nSince winning a disputed bid for the 2022 World Cup nine years ago, Qatar has taken criticism for luring sports events to this desert nation despite the difficulty of attracting fans, the oppressive heat and the need to build new stadiums with air-conditioning. Sports is a key part of the image-building movement to bolster the tiny nation\u2019s reputation as something more than a gas producer and an importer of foreign labor.\n\nBarshim\u2019s gold medal was one of the rare celebrations of a home-grown athlete on the world stage. Qatari 400-meter hurdles bronze medalist Abderrahman Samba was born in Saudi Arabia, and many other national athletes have moved to Qatar. But Barshim was born here.\n\nEvery jump was cheered uproariously, none more so than clearing 2.37 meters for a world-leading height this year that sealed gold. Russians Mikhail Akimenko and Ilya Ivanyuk both failed all three attempts at that height.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure, but I need pressure to jump,\u201d Barshim said, \u201cto push myself to the maximum. I am really happy I got to do it at home.\u201d\n\nBarshim quit after the Russians failed. This was a night for defending a world title not for chasing the world record of 2.45. There were celebrations, particularly with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\n\u201cI felt the love from the crowd, from the emir himself to everyone,\u201d Barshim said. \u201cHe was really happy and proud.\u201d\n\nAfter a week of global headlines about poor attendances, fans filling the seats should be a tonic for the nation.\n\n\u201cThey are the champions tonight,\u201d Barshim said. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\nSpectators from Qatar\u2019s migrant worker population told The Associated Press they were given free tickets to fill the venue, which still had one upper tier of seats covered. But some struggled to get into their sections. The tickets were for Category A areas and had the price of 0 Qatari riyal on them.\n\nElectrician Leonard Agbottah said he registered for free tickets two days ago and picked them up at the stadium Friday.\n\nThe local organizing committee did not respond to questions about tickets being handed out for free, only saying \u201cevery effort to accommodate both existing - and new - athletics fans.\u201d\n\nAny fans here Saturday will be hoping to hear the stadium announcements and anthems.\n\n\u201cThe in-stadium system that is responsible for the distribution of the audio signal to the speakers failed and the backup did not kick in as it should have,\u201d the IAAF told the AP. \u201cThey are calling in the technicians to check it over before tomorrow.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even when it all seemed to finally go right for the Qataris and their hometown hero, there was still a hitch.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/qatar_athletics_worlds_32490_c0-235-5616-3509_s1770x1032.jpg?22449b62918975d4b3a41c3dcdea763d54d91807", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
