I\u2019m not sure if anybody has ever seen how he crosses the River Aire in the Yorkshire city, but I\u2019m guessing he never uses a bridge.\n\nA Frenchman called Sofiane Takoucht was the selected sacrifice for Saturday night, a seasoned, hard-faced campaigner with three tight defeats in 39 fights and a justifiable reputation for toughness. Takoucht had never been stopped, but Warrington slapped him all about the ring, too fast, too powerful, possessed and dropped him heavily twice with short fights, altering his battered face to end the massacre after just 2:54 of round two. It was the statement he needed and promised.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt was a new Warrington on Saturday night, sending a clear memo of intent to the champions, challengers and former champions, all part of a convenient flotilla of men with a clear reluctance to fight Warrington, but a bad habit of being critical of him. Men have vacated two of the other three titles after rejecting offers, which included both fights in Leeds - a return to Elland Road - and potential partial unification fights in America.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do to get any of them in the ring?\u201d Warrington said when he had finally calmed down at close to midnight. \u201cI\u2019m willing to travel for a title fight, everybody knows that. They give me stick, but they will not fight me. I\u2019m prepared to go up if I have to, why not?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nThe \u201cgo up\u201d option means gaining four critical pounds and chasing former featherweight champions Oscar Valdez and Leo Santa Cruz to super-featherweight. It is a genuine option, but not the only one and there is a loose plan for a fight against the Chinese boxer Can Xu, the WBA regular champion, at Elland Road in May or June next year. Xu first has a defence in November and there is a chance that he will be upgraded by the WBA to \u201csuper\u201d champion, one of the preposterous pieces of stupidity in a business of increasing bureaucratic madness. The men in power at the sanctioning bodies simply invent the belts they bestow, handing them over in ceremonies of fake pomp like ancient tyrants showing benevolence.\n\nThe Warrington problem is a classic modern boxing failing, with three other champions at one point all happy to circle each other, vacate to avoid each other and promoters, management groups and television executives all too happy to assist the chaos. \u201cI\u2019m making offers, talking to people, trying to make these fights happen - Josh will fight anybody: He is different to a lot of other fighters,\u201d said Frank Warren, the promoter.\n\nWarrington is now 28, unbeaten in 30 fights, he started in tiny leisure centres, fighting for peanuts, now he sells-out indoor arenas, he put over 30,000 in Elland Road with the Kaiser Chiefs serenading his entrance, he won fight of the year for beating Carl Frampton last December, he visits children in cancer wards in hospital, he is trained by his father Sean and all he wants to do is fight the other champions, men that have dismissed him and would struggle to fill a taxi with their fans. He is the British everyman, a boxer with mass appeal for what he does in his chosen trade and not for his image on social media.\n\nOn Saturday night everybody knew he would ruin Takoucht, shake the facts from the Frenchman\u2019s record of resistance, and triumph easily. It was, in many ways, the easy celebration his last three difficult fights demanded and Warrington took the offer, grabbed the gift and looked savage as he went about his business. It will be different next time, compelling, brutal, a unification and the faithful will be out again, a Saturday night special of pot-bellied karaoke men, glamorous women and good-time folk, all with a devotion to their fighting man.", "description": "The topless summer made a later appearance in Leeds on Saturday night when the faithful removed their shirts, danced in lunatic formation to welcome Josh Warrington to their chosen ring in their beloved city.", "authors": ["Steve Bunce"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/11/warrington.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
