But a new investigation has suggested all is not as it seems.\n\nEliot Fletcher caused quite the stir on BBC One's Saturday morning show Going Live during an phone-in interview with the British group in 1989\n\nBBC reporter Mark Savage made numerous attempts to contact the Twitter user claiming to be Fletcher but was not able to verify his identity.\n\nInstead, he contacted several other people claiming to be the prankster online and found their stories didn't stack up.\n\nEventually he landed on the most promising suspect, who was able to provide an extended tape of the incident which included parts that had been cut off in the original broadcast.\n\nAnother convincing element was that it included the barking of a dog, just like in the TV version.\n\nThis Fletcher described himself as a former Five Star fan who became disillusioned when they started off 'showing off their new Ferraris' and their music 'went downhill'.\n\n'I didn't know I was going to swear or anything,' he said. 'I just knew I wanted to get on there and give them a piece of my teenage mind.'\n\nThe apparent prankster insisted he had 'no regrets' about the incident and still found it amusing.\n\n'No apologies,' he said. 'What's done is done. As an adult you kind of feel slightly different about it, but the child in me is like, \"No\".'\n\nThe revelation will disappoint Doris Pearson, one of five siblings who made up the band.\n\nShe was remarkably generous when the original 'Fletcher' came forward to apologise.\n\nThe revelation will disappoint Doris Pearson, one of five siblings who made up the band. She was remarkably generous when the original 'Fletcher' came forward to apologise\n\nResponding to the post, Pearson wrote: 'I was taken aback by it, we were really young and worked so hard for years.\n\n'Of course nobody wants to hear someone say their work is awful. Now I look at it completely differently and find the whole thing hilarious!'\n\nWhen a follower pointed out Fletcher's Twitter account, Pearson messaged him saying: 'I wanna meet Eliot!! Twitter, do your thing!'\n\nShe then added 'It was nearly 30 years ago - I just find it funny now!' - prompting Fletcher to respond: 'Hi Doris. Thank you and sorry x'\n\nPearson then invited Fletcher on a 'f***ing c**p night out', but he declined, writing: 'Doris would probably throw her drink over me and rightfully so.'\n\nSpeaking to the BBC about the Twitter exchange, Pearson said: 'To be reunited with Eliot and receive an apology from him was completely unexpected.\n\n'At least it's defused any animosity between him and the fabulous Five Star fans, as a lot of them were still upset about it.\n\n'The last thing I'd want is for anyone to get into a fight over it.'", "description": "Eliot Fletcher caused quite the stir on BBC One's Saturday morning show Going Live when he managed to sneak past the switchboard operators during a phone-in interview in 1989.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/18827956-0-image-a-5_1570439277378.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
