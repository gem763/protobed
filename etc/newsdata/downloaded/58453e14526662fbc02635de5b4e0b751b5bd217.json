At 46, she is also the youngest person ever to win the prize.\n\n\u201cIn just two decades, their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics, which is now a flourishing field of research.\u201d\n\nThe committee pointed to how their research divides the often gargantuan task of tackling poverty into \u201csmaller, more manageable, questions\u201d such as improving educational outcomes or child health.\n\nThe committee said their findings had \u201cdramatically improved\u201d the world\u2019s ability to fight poverty in practice.\n\n\u201cAs a result of one of their studies, more than five million Indian children have benefitted from programmes of remedial tutoring in schools,\u201d it said.\n\nBorn in India, Banerjee, 58, is an American economist, while Duflo is a French-American economist. The husband and wife both serve as professors at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where they co-founded the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab.\n\nKremer, 54, is an economist at Harvard, and has won several prizes, including the MacArthur Fellowship, for his work on developing economies.\n\nThe trio have collaborated on research in the fast-growing field of development economics together.\n\nDuflo said on Monday that it was \u201cincredibly humbling\u201d to have been awarded the prize, noting that they did not expect to be in contention for the Nobel until they were older.\n\nIn 2018, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize to two economists, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer, for integrating climate change and technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analyses.", "description": "Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer won the prize \u2018for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.'", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_NOyQwahSeNHSv60EEQWSw--~B/aD0xMTI1O3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/eabcfe00-ee66-11e9-adde-f01e484032d6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
