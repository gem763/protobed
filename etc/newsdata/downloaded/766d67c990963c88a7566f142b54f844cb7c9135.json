Last week, six months after wining, following a tip-off from an unnamed individual, the rider that won was stripped of their title and banned for \u201cdigital doping\u201d \u2013 both from e-racing and real racing.\n\nIt\u2019s not unheard-of for esports professionals to be banned from competition for cheating \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly not unusual to read \u201ccyclist\u201d and \u201cdoping\u201d in the same headline. But in this case we\u2019re presented with the unique question of whether competitors should be banned in real life for something they did in a virtual tournament.\n\nWait, what\u2019s e-racing?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, so let me catch you up. Zwift is an online gamified bike training platform in which real-world riders race against each other in virtual reality. Think of it as one step towards a bicycle-based singularity.\n\nTo participate in Zwift you need a few things, a bike, a \u201csmart trainer\u201d which you attach your bike to, a paid subscription to Zwift, and a device capable of running it. (It can be run on desktop, iOS, or Android).\n\nTypically, Zwift is used by hardcore amateurs to train in a virtual world on rainy days, but pro riders are also using it to train for real-world races \u2013 leading to unexpected wins.\n\nCredit: Zwift Insider Professional racer Mat Hayman training on Zwift while injured. He would later go on to win the iconic Paris-Roubaix bike race after a winter training on Zwift.\n\nOne of Zwift\u2019s biggest criticisms, though, is how it can be hacked, in some cases quite easily. This is a big problem as Zwift has ambitions to become an Olympic sport by 2028, it will have to address digital doping if this is to become a reality. For example, by under-reporting your weight you can gain a power to weight ratio improvement with no effort or you can use \u201cbots\u201d to increase your power or ride for you. Fitness tech guru DC Rainmaker did an excellent write up on the topic, read it here.\n\nAll things considered, this case probably shouldn\u2019t come as all that surprising, but what actually happened?\n\nCycling\u2018s \u201cdigital doper\u201d\n\nBack in March, British professional road racer and YouTuber Cameron Jeffers won the inaugural Zwift eRacing championships. And this wasn\u2019t just streamed from some guy\u2019s basement \u2014 the competition was officially sanctioned by British Cycling and televised on British TV. The riders had to complete qualifying rounds, the competitors were full-time athletes, and the title of \u2018British eRacing Champion\u2019 is truly legitimate.\n\nFollowing an investigation by the sport\u2019s governing body, British Cycling, Jeffers was stripped of the title, was handed a \u00a3250 fine, and a six-month ban from all racing. But what Jeffers actually did, in reality, isn\u2019t quite as nefarious as the punishment suggests \u2013 basically, he just obtained and used an in-game upgrade that he shouldn\u2019t have had access to.\n\nIn Zwift, like with most games, the more you play, the more in game content you unlock. But Jeffers hacked the system by having a \u201cbot\u201d ride for him to complete the achievement goals on his behalf. Ultimately, he used the hack to unlock the Zwift Concept Z1 \u201cTron\u201d bike, one of the fastest bikes in the game.\n\nBritish Cycling\u2019s statement\n\nAccording to a statement from British Cycling, Jeffers manipulated \u201cpre-race data to gain an unfair advantage via in game equipment.\u201d Jeffers himself said on YouTube and Twitter: \u201cAn ANT+ (wireless) simulator was used to climb the 50,000m in game to unlock the bike, which means I didn\u2019t personally operate Zwift to unlock the bike.\u201d\n\nZwift\u2019s senior PR manager added further detail saying that Jeffers used the \u201cbot to ride on multiple occasions at 2,000 watts for distances of over 200km with a weight of 45kg.\u201d\n\nThe high power and low weight means Jeffers\u2019 in game character went up hill faster than the Hulk crossed with Lance Armstrong, probably.\n\nHowever, there was no British Cycling rule that said riders couldn\u2019t use external means to unlock in-game content ahead of the event. It\u2019s like winning a bike race on a stolen or borrowed bike, you might not get banned, but the police or competitors might have something to say.\n\nUltimately, he went on to use the \u201cTron\u201d bike to win the finals of the British eRacing championships. And because of how he obtained it, British Cycling interpreted his use of the bike as \u201cunsporting.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear Jeffers did something unethical, but the scope of how he should be punished is not clear cut.\n\nA heavy-handed reaction\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly the right call to strip Jeffers of the title and slap him with a fine for his unsporting conduct, banning him from real-world races too is a bit heavy-handed. It\u2019s almost going by the mantra of \u201conce a cheater always a cheater.\u201d The scope of Jeffers\u2019 cheating didn\u2019t extend into the real-world, so his ban shouldn\u2019t either.\n\nEsports competitors being banned for cheating is nothing new. Earlier this year, 12 professional PUBG players received bans for using a hack which let them know where enemies were hiding in the virtual world.\n\nThese bans only ever relate to the esport in which the cheating took place, after all there\u2019s no way they could extend into the real-world. Yet with Zwift as an esport, we\u2019re faced with what could be the first situation where the sport\u2019s real-world governing body also oversees the virtual too.\n\nZwift setup including bike, smart trainer, Zwift, and rider\n\nUp until the national eRacing championships, Jeffers\u2019 participation in Zwift had been to take part in training, inconsequential community races, and to \u201cplay the game.\u201d In his own words, he wanted to get the \u201cTron\u201d bike because it looked cool. He seemingly paid little if any attention to the potential repercussions of his actions.\n\nWhat Jeffers did, while unsporting, only gave him an advantage in a very specific scenario; when he was riding the \u201cTron\u201d bike in Zwift. Jeffers\u2019 actions certainly do not extend to the real-world. Now if he had tested positive for a banned performance enhancing substance that would give him a real-world boost too, that\u2019s a very different conversation.\n\nCredit: Zwift Insider The Zwift Concept Z1 \u201cTron\u201d Bike\n\nFor all its opportunity, this whole debacle has highlighted a bigger issue. How to regulate and sanction esports when they blend almost seamlessly into conventional sports which already have their own governing bodies. With Jeffers\u2019 ban the lines between what is real-world cheating and what is exclusively digital cheating blur.\n\nRoad racing and e-racing are two different sports. E-racing has the opportunity to strip away all environmental variables like wind, crashes, punctures, and equipment advantages that could never be removed from real-world racing to create something new. Or it can continue to play second fiddle to the real thing, as it appears to be doing.\n\nWe should recognize e-racing is not the same as real-world racing. While athletes may crossover and compete in both, it\u2019s apparent that e-racing is ushering a new world of sport, worthy of its own regulations, rules, and events.\n\nE-racing shouldn\u2019t try to replicate real-world racing on stage for the guffawing of cycling nerds, but rather should be allowed to flourish on its own, to become a unique sport in its own right.\n\nRead next: Hands on: The OPPO Reno 2 is an elegant, balanced phone with an excellent camera", "description": "This year cycling got its first British National Zwift e-racing champion, but it also got its first cheater.
