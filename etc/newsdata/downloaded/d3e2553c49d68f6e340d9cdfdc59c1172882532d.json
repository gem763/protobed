Granted, that means he\u2019s visited about 15,000 Starbucks across the world.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing Starbucks specializes in coffee, because this goal sounds exhausting -- an excellent excuse for regular caffeine jolts.\n\nThe man, whose full name is reportedly just Winter, recently visited his 15,000th Starbucks in Peru, Fox 35 reports. Despite usually ordering drip coffee, he celebrated with a Colombia Narino Latte Macchiato.\n\nWinter tweeted about the momentous occasion, claiming that he's traveled over a million miles in 22 years to get so far along in his quest. He claims to have visited nearly 12,000 locations in the United States and Canada, along with more than 3,000 internationally.\n\nThe Texas native has traveled to India, Japan, Egypt, France and Costa Rica.\n\nIn March, Starbucks opened its 30,000th store in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSTARBUCKS CUSTOMER CLAIMS BARISTA WROTE 'HIPPO' ON CUP INSTEAD OF HER NAME: 'GROTESQUELY UNPROFESSIONAL'\n\n\u201cI was quite thrilled to finally achieve a significant milestone in my Starbucking quest,\u201d Winter told Fox News in an interview, \u201cone that was long delayed because of my family responsibilities. But it was especially exciting that circumstances allowed me to select not only a store in a new country, but in fact the first store in South America.\n\n\"That choice was additionally special for me because of my Latin American ethnicity.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nWinter would like to clarify one thing: He actually prefers independent coffee to Starbucks brews. \u201cThat\u2019s the definition of irony right there,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if it would take another 22 years to hit 30,000 stores, Winter said it might actually take longer. \u201cGiven that Starbucks growth in North America has peaked, thus requiring me to spend more time overseas to rack up stores, I predict that it will take closer to 30 years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nOf course, he\u2019s already off to a good start. Since hitting 15,000, Winter hasn\u2019t taken any time off from hitting up new Starbucks stores.\n\n\u201cOvalo Gutierrez was my 16th store in Peru,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd after I saw it, I went on to visit 44 additional, for a total of 60 in the country, in four days, six hours. Then I hopped on a redeye flight to Houston, abandoned my connection to Rochester, N.Y., and decided to road-trip 1,790 miles in 48 hours, visiting 13 stores on the way, bringing my current total to 15,057.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile there are still a lot of stores to hit, Winter is apparently looking forward to visiting China and Japan. \u201cThe Starbucks in Kyoto offers tatami mats for seating,\u201d he excitedly explained.
