It was a sentiment many of his constituents in affluent Weybridge in Surrey, where Hammond has been the MP for 22 years, seemed to share.\n\nBrexit: MPs vote on second reading of bill that could block no deal \u2013 live news Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the bullying tactics of Boris. He\u2019s trying to get rid of people who voted against him \u2013 that\u2019s not right,\u201d said Mick Rogers, 72, over poached eggs and toast in Cafe One on Wednesday morning.\n\nRogers, the guitarist and singer from Manfred Mann\u2019s Earth Band, said he had always been a Conservative, and like 50.15% of his fellow constituents had voted remain in the EU referendum. But if Hammond was not reselected after his decision to back a bill that would block no-deal Brexit, Rogers said he would not \u201chave a clue\u201d who to vote for.\n\nSinasi Ozkan, who owns the cafe on the town\u2019s Georgian-designed and union flag-lined high street, felt similarly sympathetic towards Hammond. \u201cI like him, I think he\u2019s good,\u201d said the 60-year-old, who is originally from Turkey.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s involved with the community here,\u201d he said, noting that Hammond had visited the nearby Weybridge centre for elderly and disabled people on several occasions. Like Rogers, Ozkan felt disillusioned with the Tory party more generally: \u201cThey messed up with Brexit, it\u2019s come to a point where nobody knows what they want or what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sinasi Ozkan outside his cafe.

In fact, support for Hammond has only strengthened over the years: in 2017 he won 31,436 votes and 60.9% of the total vote share.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s electoral gamble risks wrecking the Tory party | Jonathan Freedland Read more\n\nBut, outside Stoneleigh\u2019s traditional family butchers, Luisa Maccali said she was going to vote against the Conservatives for the first time. The Italian, who has lived in Weybridge for 15 years, has become exasperated by the government\u2019s stance on the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.\n\n\u201cIt has affected my life and split up my family,\u201d said Maccali, who added that the bank her husband worked for had moved his job to Paris. \u201cFor Philip Hammond to try to get a deal is good. I was happy here and now I\u2019m just waiting to move.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t vote for the Conservatives anymore because they are turning into the Brexit party. I might vote for the Liberal Democrats, or one of the other smaller parties.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is turning their backs on the Tories. Soraya Anderson, 56, and Lisa Challis, 60, looking at the lunch menu outside a Spanish restaurant opposite the butchers, both said they supported the government.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soraya Anderson, left, and Lisa Challis. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n\nAnderson, who works for an equity group, said Hammond \u201cshould have backed Boris because he needs all the support he can get. Somebody had to do something drastic to get us moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Hammond] was a good MP. He hasn\u2019t got a strong presence like Boris does,\u201d Challis said, adding that the prime minister\u2019s defeat by the opposition and those within his own ranks had \u201cmade him stronger\u201d.\n\nTheo Siddons, 22, is a relative anomaly among many of his generation in being a Tory voter, but like many of his peers he said he felt disillusioned with the turmoil in Westminster.\n\n\u201cI think politics are important but it\u2019s difficult to keep faith sometimes. I don\u2019t really see a benefit to things like Brexit,\u201d said the mathematics student from Byfleet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Theo Siddons is disillusioned with Brexit. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n\nHaving voted for the Conservatives in the first two general elections in which he was eligible to vote, Siddons said he would vote for the Lib Dems if Britain were to go to the polls in October. \u201cA lot of people I know feel the same,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the government has repeated its claims that it is prepared to leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October, the events of this week seem to have given people such as Siddons renewed hope that other eventualities are possible.\n\nHe said he was looking forward to the prospect of a general election, \u201cif it can change the outcome of Brexit and if we can get a deal. I know it\u2019s probably not possible but it\u2019s great to think we could not leave at all.\u201d", "description": "Many in Weybridge, where Philip Hammond has been MP for decades, share his anger at Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Amy Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afff69d59e8ef780aff1ffcea792755d56b67153/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c4393ac5ee702eb8ab7a82a10b0fac8"}
