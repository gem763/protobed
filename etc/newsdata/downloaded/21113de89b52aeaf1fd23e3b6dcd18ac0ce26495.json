That effort sought to pressure Zelenskiy\u2019s government to investigate Trump\u2019s rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to challenge Trump.\n\nPerry\u2019s trip raised questions about whether he was seeking to provide certain Americans help in gaining a foothold in the Ukrainian energy business at a time when the new Ukrainian government was looking to the United States for signals of support in its simmering conflict with Russia.\n\nTrump seemed to suggest last week that he made a July 25 phone call to Zelenskiy, during which he repeatedly urged his Ukrainian counterpart to pursue investigations that could politically benefit him, at the urging of Perry. Trump told congressional Republicans last week that Perry wanted him to discuss the liquefied natural gas supply with Zelenskiy, Axios reported.\n\nThat topic did not specifically come up in the call between the two leaders, according to the reconstructed transcript released by the White House. Text messages released last week by House investigators showed that other officials were suggesting that the president speak with Zelenskiy to nail down an agreement for Ukraine to move ahead with the investigations being sought by Trump.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was meeting with Ukrainian and Polish energy officials, Perry said he asked Trump \u201cmultiple times\u201d to hold a phone call with Zelenskiy.\n\nPerry\u2019s role in the diplomacy between the countries highlights the degree to which Trump entrusted his Ukraine policy to an ad hoc coalition of loyalists inside and outside the government, especially after the recall of the ambassador to Ukraine amid questions among Trump\u2019s supporters about her loyalty to the president. It also reveals the extent to which Ukrainian politics and national security revolve around energy supplies.\n\nPerry\u2019s efforts, while broadly consistent with U.S. national security and energy objectives, intersected with those of the figures involved in the pressure campaign. Two U.S. diplomats who attended Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration with Perry \u2014 Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, then the State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine \u2014 pushed Zelenskiy to publicly commit to the investigations and were involved in setting up the call between Trump and Zelenskiy.\n\nThey appeared to work on the effort with Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer and a leading force in the campaign to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue the investigations. Two associates of Giuliani also sought changes to the leadership of the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, Naftogaz. Those changes would have required approval from a supervisory board Perry sought to shape.\n\nOne of Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas, pitched a liquefied natural gas deal to the chief executive of Naftogaz in early spring, as The New York Times reported last month.\n\nThe deal was rejected by the Naftogaz executive.\n\nBut Parnas and a partner who was also involved in Giuliani\u2019s political efforts in Ukraine, Igor Fruman, also sought to install a presumptive ally as Naftogaz\u2019s chief executive. They told a gas executive named Andrey Favorov that they could use their American political connections to help him become chief executive of Naftogaz, suggesting that, if appointed, he might steer the company to buy liquefied natural gas from them, according to Dale Perry, the managing partner of a company that competes with one run by Parnas and Fruman.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- When Energy Secretary Rick Perry led an American delegation to the inauguration of Ukraine's new president in May, he took the opportunity to suggest the names of Americans the new Ukrainian government might want to advise and oversee the country's state-owned gas company.Perry&", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
