And even with ultra-low mortgage rates, prices are not falling enough to bring in new customers.\n\nThere are also meaningful changes in the makeup of the prime-age potential homebuyers \u2014 who now have more debt than ever, are more likely than before to live with their parents, and are reconsidering the attractiveness of a mortgage.\n\nAnd there's an inventory problem. Not enough affordable single-family homes are being constructed, and builders are focusing their efforts on large, expensive projects, Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, argues.\n\nDeclining worker productivity, labor shortages, and regulatory costs also are putting a dent in housing supply.\n\nAs older, more skilled workers retire and younger, less skilled builders take their place, this problem is likely to get worse.\n\n\"I\u2019ve told the industry we\u2019re going to see worker productivity go down before it goes up,\" Dietz says.\n\nThe combination of inflated prices and overburdened Americans has translated to fewer home sales today than in the year 2000, Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, notes.\n\n\"We take a survey of consumers and ask the question, 'Is it a good time to buy?' The number of people who say it\u2019s a good time has overall been turning down.\"\n\nThe bottom line: The world is changing. It's \"the end of the boom,\" Skoczek says.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
