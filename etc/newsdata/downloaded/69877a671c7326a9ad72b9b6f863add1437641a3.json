Only rival Barcelona stopped them winning five on the bounce.\n\nHowever, former England international Michael Owen, who played for Real Madrid for a season, believes that after years of playing catch up, Premier League clubs -- Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea -- will be the teams to beat in this season's tournament.\n\n\"I think the English game is just stepping ahead of the Spanish game,\" Owen told CNN Sport's Christina MacFarlane. \"I would still be going with an English team to win the Champions League again this year.\"\n\nEPL quality\n\nOwen's prediction comes off the back of one of the most tightly fought Premier League campaigns in the competition's history.\n\nBoth Liverpool and eventual champion Manchester City set new standards during a quite remarkable campaign in which Jurgen Klopp's team finished second despite losing just one league game.\n\nCredit for the quality shown by both teams must lay at the feet of both Liverpool boss Klopp and Manchester City's manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe 48-year-old Guardiola, in particular, has created a team capable of dominating any opponent around the world, reminiscent of his miraculous Barcelona side that dominated European football for so long.\n\nHowever, despite its Premier League domination over the last two seasons, City has its sights set firmly of European glory -- something that has avoided Guardiola since he left the Nou Camp in 2012.\n\n\"If Manchester City and Liverpool could do a deal they would switch it around,\" said Owen, speaking about the trophies both clubs won respectively last season. \"They are both craving what each other have got.\"\n\nLiverpool will open the defense of its title away to Napoli on Tuesday whilst Manchester City travel to Ukraine to take on Shakhtar Donetsk Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, last year's beaten finalist Tottenham will begin its campaign against Olympiacos and Chelsea hosts Valencia.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why Nicolas Pepe was destined for greatness Replay More Videos ...

They don't tend to be able to gel together and go on a serious run.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Real Madrid to launch women's team Replay More Videos ...

I don't know why or how but it's ingrained in that ground. So no matter what the score is, if you go to Anfield as a second leg then you are in for it.\"\n\nThere is a wealth of evidence to back up Owen's claim, not least last season's miracle match against Barcelona.\n\nBlown away by Lionel Messi et al in the first leg, Liverpool completed one of the great Champions League comebacks to win the match on its way to winning the trophy.\n\nLiverpool players celebrate their stunning win over Barcelona.\n\nGroup of death\n\nIt was the second consecutive year that the Catalan club threw away a seemingly unbeatable lead. In 2018, it was AS Roma who defied the odds at the quarterfinal stage.\n\nBarca now faces a tricky path to the knockout stages of this season's tournament after being drawn in the \"Group of Death,\" alongside Borussia Dortmund, Slavia Prague and a resurgent Inter Milan.\n\nDespite its fragility on the European stage in recent years, Owen still believes Barca will be favorites to progress from the group by taking advantage of slipping standards in the Bundesliga.\n\n\"I think Inter Milan can be quite a strong team this year,\" Owen said when asked who would miss out on qualification from Group F.\n\n[Dortmund] are a very good team, a lot of experience in the Champions League but German football is just not, I don't know ... Bayern Munich is wobbling a little bit at the moment and not doing so well in the Champions League. Of course, they are still winning the Bundesliga so it might be a reflection of the German league having a slight dip.\"\n\nBarcelona will face Dortmund in its first group game on Wednesday.", "description": "Before Liverpool stormed to victory in the Champions League final in June, there was a spell where English football seemed off the pace of Europe's elite.", "authors": ["Ben Church", "Christina Macfarlane"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190916123955-salah-ucl-lift-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
