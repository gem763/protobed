Partnering with Delta will boost Latam, industry watchers say. Delta shares edged higher on the news.\n\n\"It's hard to envision how Delta's influence over LATAM would not afford significant benefits, in our view,\" wrote Jamie Baker, US airlines analyst at JPMorgan.\n\nThe deal with Latam, the biggest airline in South America, is Delta's largest since it merged with Northwest Airlines over a decade ago. It will also expand Delta's reach to the region, since Latam flies to dozens of destinations in Latin America.\n\nTogether, the two partners will hold the leading position in five of six top markets in Latin America, according JPMorgan, which upgraded shares to \"neutral\" from \"underweight\" and raised its price target to $14 from $10.\n\nRead more: A hedge fund manager who turned $126,000 into $500 million explains his Warren Buffett-esque investment process \u2014 and why he's not concerned with today's stock market valuation\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch Pedro Mariani echoed the positive sentiment, saying the transaction is a net positive for Latam.
