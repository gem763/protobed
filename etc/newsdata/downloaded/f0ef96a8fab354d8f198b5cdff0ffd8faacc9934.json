Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAmerican-history classes often treat FDR\u2019s 1937 \u201ccourt-packing\u201d scheme \u2014 a proposal to expand the size of the Supreme Court by adding as many as six justices \u2014 as a classic example of presidential overreach, which led to a widespread backlash even among Democrats and represented a high-water mark for New Deal audacity, subsequently curtailed. It\u2019s not as well remembered that the Lochner-era conservative majority on the Court, in the habit of holding that virtually all economic regulation by Congress violated the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment, was posing an existential threat not only to the New Deal but to democratic governance. It\u2019s also sometimes forgotten that while FDR\u2019s court-packing threats failed to secure congressional support, they did help frighten Justice Owen Roberts into quietly switching sides and ensuring validation of key New Deal legislation by the Supreme Court (the legendary \u201cswitch in time that saved nine\u201d).\n\nIn other words, the legitimacy and independence of the Court were called into question not by FDR but by his opponents, and he found a way, however indirect and noisy, to restore the balance. As Jamelle Bouie notes in a New York Times column, a future Democratic president may find herself in similar straits:\n\nTrump\u2019s Supreme Court appointments are mired in controversy. Justice Neil Gorsuch occupies a stolen seat, held open during Obama\u2019s tenure by a blockade conducted for nearly a year by McConnell, who cited a previously nonexistent \u201ctradition\u201d of tabling nominations made in an election year. (In the 20th century alone, the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominees in five different presidential election years \u2014 1912, 1916, 1932, 1940 and 1988). And of course Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed last September under clouds of suspicion that stemmed from accusations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct to a bevy of ethics complaints.\n\nDemocrats are left in an unenviable position. Should they win a federal \u201ctrifecta\u201d \u2014 the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives \u2014 they\u2019ll still have to deal with a Trump-branded judiciary. It\u2019s entirely possible that a future Democratic agenda would be circumscribed and unraveled by a Supreme Court whose slim conservative majority owes itself to minority government and constitutional hardball.\n\nYou could add to Bouie\u2019s case that the traditional norms of judicial politics have already been shattered. There\u2019s the fact that Donald Trump broke every taboo by explicitly promising conservative Evangelicals a SCOTUS that would abolish a federal constitutional right to choose abortion, and then set up an outsourced and fiercely ideological judicial-selection process that is radically reshaping all federal courts. But he\u2019s fundamentally and critically correct that what\u2019s at stake in the immediate future isn\u2019t just this or that constitutional precedent, but the ability of a popular majority to enact an agenda, at a time when one of the two major parties has committed itself to minority rule. So if Democrats gain power in 2020 or 2024, they could find themselves in the same position as their New Deal predecessors \u2014 or perhaps an even more dire situation, since today\u2019s reactionaries are deliberately entrenching their allies throughout the federal judiciary, not just the Supreme Court.\n\nSo is it time for Democrats to openly talk about court-packing or something similarly radical-sounding? Bouie thinks so, and seven Democratic presidential candidates (Cory Booker, Steve Bullock, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Wayne Messam, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) have told the Washington Post they are \u201copen\u201d to the idea. Only Buttigieg has released a specific proposal (an expansion of the court to 15 members, with five nominated by each party and five more with short-term appointments chosen by SCOTUS consensus). Perhaps the alarming head count of Trump judges, and/or fresh allegations against sitting SCOTUS justices like Brett Kavanaugh, will make judicial appointments and their number and duration a 2020 primary issue among Democrats.\n\nBut it\u2019s even more likely that any such talk will provide new fodder for the Trump/GOP message that today\u2019s Democrats are dangerously radical and contemptuous of constitutional norms (not that court-packing is the least bit unconstitutional if it\u2019s done by Congress). At a minimum, conservatives will spend a lot of time telling Christian-right audiences that Democrats are now fighting fire with fire and plan to thwart their own government-by-judiciary schemes aimed at a constitutional counterrevolution. And let\u2019s face it: All the threats to democracy that Bouie and others are warning of will get a lot worse right away if Republicans hang on to the White House and the Senate in 2020. If discussion of judicial reform makes that even infinitesimally more likely, it\u2019s probably a topic that should be placed on a back burner until after the election.\n\nAnd if things do turn out well for Democrats and they enjoy a governing trifecta in 2021, they could emulate FDR in utilizing court-packing or similar reforms as a way to get the attention of conservatives and perhaps secure their agreement to de-escalate their politicization of the courts. There\u2019s quite a bit of evidence that FDR really wanted to change the pattern of ancient justices hanging on to Court seats forever (their retirement incomes had recently been slashed by Congress, which didn\u2019t help) while awaiting a president of their party to appoint a successor. If moral suasion doesn\u2019t work, term limits for judges could have a much larger and more permanent impact than court-packing schemes (especially if expanded beyond SCOTUS), and just as importantly, it\u2019s a popular idea. A 2018 Ipsos/UVA poll showed 70 percent of Americans \u2014 and big majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents \u2014 favoring term limits for SCOTUS.\n\nIn any event, whether or not they embrace specific reforms, Democratic presidential candidates and the progressives whose votes they are currently seeking need to make the shape of the federal judiciary a big-time campaign issue for 2020 \u2014 much as Trump\u2019s conservative Evangelical backers did in 2016. Once Republicans become totally addicted to anti-democratic instruments like the courts to hold on to power absent popular support, it may be difficult to cure them. Threatening them with cold-turkey remedies could well be necessary. And if they shriek about court-packing, they should be reminded that their own efforts to pack the courts with ideologues have broken the system.", "description": "Just as FDR used the threat of court-packing to keep the Supreme Court from invalidating the New Deal, Democrats should talk about judicial reform if they gain power in 2021 to reverse a current conservative drive to pack the courts with ideologues.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/17/17-merrick-garland.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
