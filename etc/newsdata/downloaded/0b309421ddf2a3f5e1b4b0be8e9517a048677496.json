This year\u2019s topic was \u201cRise Up,\u201d which naturally leads to thoughts on politics and resistance \u2014 but possibly souffles or sunrises. The focus, and the surprise, is the writer\u2019s choice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKlam, an award-winning writer and satirist, opened his remarks with a history lesson.\n\n\u201cSix hundred years ago, a priest led his congregation in protest through the streets of Prague,\u201d he began. \u201cBut things got out of hand and they stormed the town hall and took the judge, the mayor and several councilmen and threw them out a window where they fell to their deaths.\u201d Thus the term \u201cdefenestration.\u201d\n\nThe subject came up at a writer\u2019s conference this summer where Klam was \u201cfreaking out about mass extinction, burning rainforests, melting tundra and the people in charge making it worse.\u201d Over ice cream with a friend, he asked one of those writerly, hypothetical questions: \u201cIf you could do something that you don\u2019t do because it\u2019s bad for you, but you could do it without any repercussions \u2014 what would you do?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis friend, a woman who struggles with American violence in her poetry, answered, \u201cI guess I\u2019d kill a bunch of people.\u201d\n\nShortly after Klam\u2019s presentation, Townsend, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, went to the lectern uninvited. She began to speak but had trouble being heard without a microphone. One organizer attempted to shut her down: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be great art if it didn\u2019t elicit some sort of reaction, but we do have a program to run.\u201d The music suddenly swelled, a tactic used to end overly long speeches at the Oscars.\n\nThe gala, now in its 31st year, was held at Katzen Arts Center in Washington with a bipartisan and moneyed crowd assembled to support writers and literature. Townsend, who is friends with gala chair Willee Lewis and honoree Ann Brown, has no official role with PEN/Faulkner. But cries of \u201cLet her speak!\u201d came from the audience until Townsend was handed a mic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI spoke out even though my friend Willee asked me not to,\u201d she said. She explained that she thinks jokes about killing are devastating and harmful. \u201cI think art can change and open peoples\u2019 hearts. So when we talk and joke about killing, it doesn\u2019t open our hearts. It closes us down.\u201d\n\nThere was some applause, and then Townsend returned to her seat.\n\nKlam (who never mentioned the Kennedys, President Trump or any other politician in his presentation) said afterward that she had missed his point. What\u2019s important, especially for writers, is to be honest about the worst impulses inside us, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are thoughts that we find to be so unspeakable that we hold them inside and they make us feel isolated,\u201d he said. Klam said he and his friend admitted to a dark impulse \u2014 in this case, \u201cI want to throw someone out of a window.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs he told the crowd: \u201cBy honoring the feelings \u2014 not so much the running narratives, but the rage, fear, shame and exhaustion behind those circling thoughts \u2014 at least, for a moment, I felt hope.\u201d\n\nThe same cannot be said about the gala, which went off the rails and never really recovered. Even the dry wit of emcee Calvin Trillin was waterlogged. The remaining writers talked about racism, genocide and other outrages, leaving many in the audience accustomed to a night of literary uplift less than thrilled. \u201cA disaster,\u201d declared one patron, who vowed not to return.\n\nPEN/Faulkner Executive Director Gwydion Suilebhan said the \u201cRise Up\u201d theme was selected before he joined the organization in January. Previous year\u2019s topics have included \u201cMagic,\u201d \u201cBelonging,\u201d \u201cDanger,\u201d \u201cMasks\u201d and \u201cSpark.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNo one, he said, vets the writer\u2019s presentations in advance, which are original pieces created to support the gala. The writers seldom talk about politics explicitly, although some long-term PEN/Faulkner fans may remember when Terry McMillan created a stir by tearing into John McCain and Sarah Palin weeks before the 2008 election.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLike most cult leaders, they really think the public is stupid enough to drink this Kool-Aid,\u201d said the best-selling novelist. \u201cI am not taking a sip.\u201d All McCain really wanted, she said, was to find a new war; Palin just wanted to fly first class.\n\nNo one spoke up to object to McMillan\u2019s remarks during that gala. This year, though, Townsend decided the time and the place had come to voice her dissent.\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s PEN/Faulkner gala was proof that writers have the power to inspire and provoke,\u201d Suilebhan said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that everyone has a story, and in a civil society, we need to make space for a wide range of voices in our conversations. PEN/Faulkner is honored to engage in that vital work.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Many in the audience, accustomed to a night of literary uplift, were less than thrilled.", "authors": ["Roxanne Roberts", "Feature Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g9NZL2KrAWhaVYw5IScS_a_Xfzk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N245QDHT5UI6FFBUMBCAQVX234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
