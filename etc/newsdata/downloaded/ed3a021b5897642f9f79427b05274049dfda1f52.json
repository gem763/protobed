Dozens called for action after a number of suicides they identified as having gone unacknowledged over the past year. They said they believed the school was deliberately not calling the deaths suicides in an effort to protect its reputation.\n\nLong-term measures coming, school says\n\nAt the time, students who spoke with CBC Toronto raised the need for shorter wait times for counselling, better access to mental health resources, and for the school to explicitly acknowledge when suicides happen on campus. The university acknowledged in that case that \"a student fell to his death,\" but did not use the word suicide itself.\n\nThe Bahen Centre for Information Technology was closed for part of the weekend, after emergency crews descended on the building after a student died inside Friday. (Google Maps)\n\nStudents also raised concerns over a mandated leave policy approved approximately a year and a half ago, for students at risk of harm to themselves or others where mental health may be involved. The policy, which had drawn criticism from students and Ontario's Human Rights Commission, allows the administration to place students on a mandatory leave of absence if it deems it necessary.\n\nThe school's vice-provost for students, Sandy Welsh, meanwhile, said the measure was \"not meant to be punitive.\"\n\nFollowing the demonstration this past spring, the school's president Meric Gertler said the school was open to suggestions from students about how to provide better mental health support, saying the school offered to meet with them.\n\nIn its update Sunday, the school said it has been working since the spring to design permanent changes to increase safety at the Bahen building. Construction of the temporary barriers began Sunday with longer-term measures expected this fall.\n\nThe university has been working with the building\u2019s architects since last spring to design permanent changes that will enhance safety in Bahen. Construction begins Sunday to put temporary barriers in place, with installation of long-term changes expected later this fall. (3/3) \u2014@UofT \"The safety and well-being of our students are our top priorities. We've listened to concerns about the building and are putting in place measures that will improve safety,\" said Welsh.\n\n'We have seen minimal action'\n\n\"We mourn the loss of our student, and we are here to support our community,\" Welsh said. \"Our thoughts are with the student's family, friends, fellow students and instructors.\"\n\nAdditional counsellors and chaplains were made available for six hours at the school's health and wellness centre Sunday, in addition to regular resources.\n\nStudents say wait times to access counselling can often be about a month long. Also at issue is a mandated leave policy approved just under a year ago for students who pose a risk of harm to themselves or others where mental health may be involved. (Mehrdad Nazarahari/CBC)\n\nThe barriers are a welcome move to some, but for student Catherine Clarke, they're still a first step.\n\n\"This is not a permanent solution of course, but it would at least discourage actions in the most accessible place on campus,\" she said, adding that closing off such accessible access points might give students in crisis a moment's more pause \u2014 something that could potentially save lives.\n\nClarke and others held an emergency meeting on campus in the hours after Friday's death to share their concerns and to begin to map out a plan of action to demand more from the school \u2014 including finding a way to permanently decrease wait times at its health and wellness centre.\n\nDozens of students demonstrated at the University of Toronto in the spring, calling on the school to acknowledge what they say is a mental health crisis on campus. (Mehrdad Nazarahari/CBC)\n\n\"After forming several amazing student groups and despite many meetings with university officials since March, when the last suicide occurred, we have seen minimal action from the U of T administration,\" Clarke said.\n\n\"We need change. We need a student death policy, we need more counselling available to students, we need an active task force that actually listens to the students,\" third-year student Hannah Turcotte told CBC News.\n\n\"We need basic human dignity for the people that I know who are no longer here. We need the university to care,\" she said.\n\n\"This crisis has a face,\" Turcotte said.\n\n\"It belongs to every single parent who buries their baby, it belongs to students who hold each other on the steps \u2014 clinging to each other as they try to fathom the unfathomable ... It belongs to the students who won't come back and the students who are already on the edge, the students who have passed out in exams and who have awoken to campus police. It belongs to the administration.\"\n\nThe university says the Bahen building has now reopened and that it will provide an opportunity for members of the school community to pay respects to the student.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nCanada Suicide Prevention Service\n\nToll-free 1-833-456-4566\n\nText: 45645\n\nChat: crisisservicescanada.ca\n\nIn French: Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de pr\u00e9vention du suicide: 1-866-APPELLE (1-866-277-3553)\n\nKids Help Phone:\n\nPhone: 1-800-668-6868\n\nText: TALK to 686868 (English) or TEXTO to 686868 (French)\n\nLive Chat counselling at www.kidshelpphone.ca\n\nPost-Secondary Student Helpline:\n\nPhone: 1-866-925-5454\n\nGood2talk.ca\n\nCanadian Association for Suicide Prevention: Find a 24-hour crisis centre\n\nIf you're worried someone you know may be at risk of suicide, you should talk to them, says the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention.
