Its headliners: Pence and Pompeo", "language": "en", "text": "Vice President Pence is slated to speak at the Trump International Hotel in Washington Thursday. (Peter Summers/Getty Images)\n\nVice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to speak this week at President Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington \u2014 lending their names to events put on by a paying customer of Trump\u2019s private business.\n\nThe planned speeches suggest that Trump and his Cabinet are not shying away from events that drive revenue to the president\u2019s company, even after multiple stories have brought new scrutiny to the blurring of lines between Trump\u2019s business and presidency.\n\nPence spoke Thursday night at the hotel, during a gala put on by the Concerned Women for America, a 40-year-old conservative nonprofit organization that says it promotes \u201cBiblical values and Constitutional principles.\u201d Tickets to that event cost at least $99, according to the group\u2019s website.\n\nPompeo will speak at a separate event at the Trump hotel on Friday, a \u201ccelebration luncheon\u201d held by the same conservative group, his staff said.\n\nNeither the conservative group nor the Trump Organization answered questions about how much these events cost. But similar events in the hotel\u2019s ballrooms have cost in the tens of thousands of dollars, according to hotel documents reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nSpokespeople for Pence and Pompeo defended the speeches, saying the appearances did not steer this business to the president\u2019s hotel, as the nonprofit had already chosen the venue before inviting the two officials. They said the appearances had been vetted for ethical or legal concerns and approved by others in the White House and the State Department.\n\nThe spokespeople for Pence and Pompeo spoke on the condition that they not be named to describe internal discussions.\n\nThe chief of staff for the Concerned Women of America, Toni DeLancey, declined to answer detailed questions about the event. She issued a brief statement that praised the Trump hotel\u2019s \u201coutstanding service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for us, and we wanted our activists to feel valued and to experience the best accommodations Washington, D.C. has to offer,\u201d DeLancey said in the statement.\n\nThe planned appearances by Pompeo and Pence were previously reported by the New York Times and journalist Zach Everson.\n\nPompeo and Pence visit the hotel at a time when Trump and his administration seem to be giving up on a bedrock promise of his presidency: that he would never use his public power to boost his private business.\n\n\u201cI will be leaving my great business in total,\u201d Trump said before he took office. He kept ownership of the business, but said he would follow self-\n\nimposed guidelines to avoid even the appearance that he was intermingling the presidency and his business.\n\nBut in the past few weeks, Trump and top aides have made repeated moves that brought publicity, revenue or both to Trump properties.\n\nIn the past month alone, Trump proposed holding the massive Group of Seven summit of world leaders at his struggling golf resort in Doral, Fla.\n\nIn addition, The Post reported that Attorney General William P. Barr has booked a ballroom at Trump\u2019s Washington hotel for a large holiday party, which will cost in excess of $30,000.\n\nAnd Pence built a major detour into an official, taxpayer-funded trip to Ireland that allowed him to stay at a Trump-owned golf resort, 140 miles from his meetings. Pence\u2019s staff said Trump had \u201csuggested\u201d Pence stay at the hotel, after learning that Pence wanted to visit a cousin in the same town, though Trump has disputed that.\n\nAfterward, the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee said it was launching an investigation into whether Pence had acted improperly to enrich the president.\n\nThis week\u2019s speeches by Pence and Pompeo follow a slightly different pattern: Instead of boosting Trump\u2019s business directly, they will lend their prestige to one of Trump\u2019s customers.\n\nWalter Shaub, who previously led the Office of Government Ethics, said that sends a signal to other potential customers \u2014 which could bring Trump more money. The signal, Shaub said, is: \u201cThe administration is sweetening the pot for outside groups to rent space in Trump\u2019s properties by offering up the vice president or the secretary of state. Or, in this case, both.\u201d\n\nShaub, who left office early in Trump\u2019s term, now works at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). He has been a frequent Trump critic.\n\nIn this case, he said, there are no conflict-of-interest laws that would bar Pence or Pompeo from doing this. But, he said, their actions undermine the honor system that was supposed to stop presidents from enriching themselves in office. He said that honor system could be in total disrepair by the time Trump leaves office.\n\nEven before Thursday\u2019s speech, Pence was a frequent guest at Trump\u2019s properties.\n\nCREW, the watchdog group, has counted at least 11 previous instances where Pence spoke to a gathering put on by a paying customer at Trump\u2019s hotel.\n\nIn some cases, the customer was Pence\u2019s PAC, called Great America Committee. Pence\u2019s PAC has spent more than $200,000 on three events at the Trump hotel in Washington since the start of 2018.\n\nFor Pompeo, however, Friday\u2019s speech appears to be something unusual.\n\nNeither CREW nor Everson \u2014 the journalist who has tracked appearances by 24 current or former Cabinet members at Trump\u2019s Washington hotel \u2014 could identify a past instance where Pompeo headlined an event at the hotel. Pompeo\u2019s spokesperson declined to comment on that question.", "description": "The speeches come amid scrutiny of Trump\u2019s blurring of the lines between his business and the presidency.", "authors": ["David A.
