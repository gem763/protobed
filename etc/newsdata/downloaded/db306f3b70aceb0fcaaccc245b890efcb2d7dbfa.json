(Ann Warner/via Reuters)\n\nTsunami-like storm surge from Hurricane Dorian ripped through North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks on Friday \u2014 a towering wall of water that left residents trapped and powerless. A strong tropical storm once again exposed the vulnerabilities of the narrow barrier islands in an era of extreme weather and rising seas.\n\nThe hurricane that had swooped along the Eastern Seaboard for days made landfall at Cape Hatteras as a Category 1 storm, far weaker than when it was a Category 5 behemoth that delivered a marathon assault on the Bahamas earlier in the week.\n\nBut in this low-lying community built on a foundation of shifting sand, Dorian was still severe enough to cause an \u201cabsolute major disaster,\u201d said Peter Vankevich, a resident of Ocracoke Island, along the southern stretch of the Outer Banks.\n\n[Capital Weather Gang: Dorian exits Mid-Atlantic, heads north]\n\nThe hurricane wrought much of its destruction through swift and severe storm surge from the Pamlico Sound, the long lagoon that separates the islands from the North Carolina mainland. Powerful winds sucked water away from the coast, then pushed it back in a massive wave onto the western sides of Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. In less than two hours, tide gauges measured a water level increase of more than seven feet \u2014 enough to submerge a home\u2019s first-floor windows.\n\n\u201cThe water just poured in and has continued to do so,\u201d said Vankevich, who runs the Ocracoke Observer, the island\u2019s main news source. \u201cIf you were out there walking around, you could have been swept away.\u201d\n\nBy early afternoon, the storm\u2019s eyewall had moved northwest and away from shore. It is expected to scrape by southeastern New England on Saturday, then strike parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before it finally spins out into the North Atlantic after a long and deadly slog across the hemisphere.\n\nDorian began brewing into one of the strongest hurricanes on record more than a week ago, prompting panicked preparations from Florida through the Carolinas. But it was the Bahamas that bore the brunt of the storm\u2019s fury; the tempest stalled for 40 hours directly over the island chain, laying waste to much of two of its northern territories \u2014 Great Abaco and Grand Bahama. An early count of 30 people killed is likely just a fraction of the total death toll, as entire communities were decimated in storm surges that topped 20 feet and winds that gusted to 220 mph.\n\nThousands of Bahamians made homeless by the storm are squatting in broken, abandoned homes or are scrambling for floor space in shelters without steady food and water.\n\nWhen Dorian finally dislodged and swerved north Tuesday, the storm skirted the U.S. coastline, its outer edges scraping by Florida, Georgia and most of the Carolinas. In southeastern North Carolina, where many are still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Florence last year, residents were relieved to escape the worst of it this time.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on in the Bahamas, and you see this massive storm heading right for you, you\u2019re going to be getting worried,\u201d said Tony Catullo, a Myrtle Beach, S.C., resident who spent Friday afternoon sunbathing along the shore. After days of doom-filled forecasts, the mood here was relaxed: The local country radio station was advertising live music and the \u201cpremier hurricane party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe dodged a bullet here,\u201d Catullo said.\n\n\n\nA man and a woman walk past the Riggings condo complex the morning after Hurricane Dorian passed by the area on Friday, in Kure Beach, N.C. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nPeople in Wilmington, N.C., returned home Friday morning to surf beneath clearing skies. In Onslow County, to the north, swiftwater rescuers had little work to do.\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t nothing,\u201d said Thomas Goff, of Onslow Fire and Rescue. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pop-up thunderstorms do more damage.\u201d\n\nNo serious injuries or fatalities from the hurricane have been reported in the United States, though North Carolina and Florida officials have listed other deaths that appear related to storm preparations and evacuations, including a man who fell from a ladder and people who collapsed under the stress of relocating. As of Friday morning, 75 roads were closed across North Carolina as the storm lashed the coastline \u2014 compared with the 750 road closures reported at the same time during Hurricane Florence last year.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region experienced some limited flooding during high tide on Friday, but there was little effect from the storm\u2019s waning winds.\n\nWilliam Stiles, head of Wetlands Watch, a local nonprofit focusing on sea-level rise, was out mapping flooding in Norfolk on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis one was just weird,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just the water. Not the wind. Not the howling horizontal rain we normally get with a hurricane.\u201d\n\nThe threat of flash flooding still loomed, though. And as reports of devastation emerged from the overwhelmed Outer Banks, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) noted that many people are still at risk.\n\nPhotos and video from Ocracoke showed swift-moving, white-capped water rushing through neighborhoods and spilling over window sills. Emergency officials urged people to stay indoors and move to the highest points in their homes.\n\nThough a mandatory evacuation order had been issued for Dare County, many in the Outer Banks opted to remain in their homes. Longtime residents, who can recite the names of past hurricanes like a list of bad exes, are accustomed to weathering storms.\n\n\n\nTornado damage associated with Hurricane Dorian is seen Friday at the Boardwalk RV Park in Emerald Isle, N.C., the day after Hurricane Dorian passed through the area.

(Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nThe beach communities \u2014 accessible only by bridge, boat or plane even in the best of weather \u2014 became all but unreachable as 90 mph winds and torrential rain battered the coastline. An estimated 800 people who did not evacuate remained stranded without power. Emergency responders were forced to wait for the weather to break before they could deliver aid and rescue people via helicopter.\n\nHyde County officials helped airlift several people with medical issues and spent Friday evening canvassing neighborhoods to ensure other residents were safe. But many were waiting to leave, hoping that regular ferry service would soon be restored.\n\nThe Outer Banks have always been especially vulnerable to rough weather. The string of peninsulas and barrier islands, 200 miles long and never more than three miles wide, are the first land masses to be bombarded by water and wind coming off the Atlantic. The ocean regularly overtops dunes and washes out much of Highway 12 \u2014 the only road linking Hatteras Island and the rest of Dare County. The ferry from Hatteras to Ocracoke had to change routes after its usual run began filling in with sand. During strong storms, water will carve out new inlets and wash away acres of beach.\n\nFor years, the island chain has been slowly shifting west, toward the mainland, beaten back by the encroaching sea. Dorian clipped its southern reaches before launching eastward.\n\nThese alterations are nature\u2019s way of redistributing the tremendous energy of the ocean, explained Kitty Hawk resident Reide Corbett, a coastal oceanographer at East Carolina University and executive director of the Coastal Studies Institute in Manteo. The term \u201cbarrier islands\u201d refers to the way these landforms protect coastlines through their shapeshifting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic system,\u201d Corbett said. The resilience of the North Carolina coastline \u2014 not to mention some 30,000 year-round residents and a billion-dollar tourism industry \u2014 depend on it.\n\n\n\nUtility workers fix power lines the morning after Hurricane Dorian passed through Carolina Beach, N.C. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nYet climate change has pushed the system to its limits. Rising sea levels have created a higher floor for storm surge to ride on top of, producing more frequent and more catastrophic floods.\n\n\u201cThe water levels in the ocean and the sound are changing,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cWhen you have 100 mile per hour winds blowing it up against the island, there\u2019s no place for it to go but inundate.\u201d\n\nThe scientist has noticed his neighbors become increasingly concerned about the fate of their islands. Efforts to \u201crenourish\u201d beaches with additional sand are washed away by the next storm. Rows of homes that once looked out onto the ocean have been lost to the incoming waters.\n\nCooper acknowledged the threat posed to his state by climate change while visiting a feeding station in Wilmington on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe know these storms now, unfortunately, are a new normal for us. We\u2019ve had three hurricanes in the state of North Carolina in less than three years,\u201d he said, in a nod to Florence and 2016\u2019s Hurricane Matthew. \u201cWe have a lot to do to become more resilient. We have a lot to do to rebuild not only stronger but smarter.\u201d\n\nKitty Hawk resident John Trubich, who waited out Dorian\u2019s downpour in the same home where he endured countless other storms, was more resigned. The future, he said, is in the hands of Mother Nature.\n\n\u201cThe Outer Banks was made by wind and water,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually, they\u2019ll take it away.\u201d\n\nRoss, a freelance journalist, reported from New Bern, N.C.; Thebault reported from Myrtle Beach, S.C.; and Kaplan reported from Washington.
