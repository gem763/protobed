U.S. natgas futures hold near 3-week low ahead of storage report\n\nSept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures traded within a few cents of unchanged near a three-week low on Thursday as the market waits for direction from a federal report expected to show a bigger-than-usual storage build.\n\nAnalysts said utilities likely added 89 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas to storage during the week ended Sept. 20, up from an injection of 51 bcf during the same week last year and a five-year (2014-18) average build of 74 bcf for the period. EIA/GAS\n\nIf correct, the increase would boost stockpiles to 3.192 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 1.8% below the five-year average of 3.252 tcf for this time of year.\n\nThe amount of gas in inventory has remained below the five-year average since September 2017. It fell as much as 33% below that in March 2019. But with production near a record high, analysts said, stockpiles should reach a near-normal 3.7 tcf by the end of summer injection season on Oct. 31. NGAS/POLL\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly storage report at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Thursday.\n\nOn its last day as the front-month, gas futures for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange were down 1.8 cents, or 0.7%, to $2.484 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 9:32 a.m. EDT, their lowest since Sept. 5.\n\nThat puts the contract down for an eighth day in a row for the first time since January 2012.\n\nFutures for November, which will soon be the front-month, were about down 2 cents to $2.50 per mmBtu, which briefly knocked the premium of the November over October to its lowest on record.\n\nMeteorologists forecast temperatures over the next two weeks would be colder than normal over much of the northern half to the country and warmer in the southern half. Traders said that should boost heating demand in the North and keep cooling demand high in the South.\n\nData provider Refinitiv projected gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states would average around 83.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week and next as heating slowly replaces air conditioning use.\n\nThose demand forecasts include exports, which analysts said would likely rise as more gas flows to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants and pipelines to Mexico.\n\nGas flows to the LNG plants rose to 6.4 bcfd on Wednesday, up from a low of 5.7 bcfd last week following the shutdown of Dominion Energy Inc's D.N Cove Point in Maryland for planned maintenance, according to Refinitiv data. Point remains shut. The extra gas is flowing to other terminals like Freeport LNG's Freeport plant in Texas and Cheniere Energy Inc's Sabine Pass in Louisiana.\n\nRefinitiv projected flows to LNG terminals could rise to a near record high of 6.5 bcfd by the end of next week.\n\nExports to Mexico rose to 5.5 bcfd on Wednesday, up from 5.3 bcfd on Tuesday. That compares with a record high of 5.9 bcfd last week after gas started moving through the 2.6-bcfd Valley Crossing pipeline from Texas. said pipeline flows to Mexico should top those record levels soon now that Kinder Morgan (NYSE: ) Inc's KMI.N Permian Express pipe in Texas entered service. production in the lower 48 states, meanwhile, rose to 92.4 bcfd on Wednesday from 92.0 bcfd on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with an all-time daily high of 93.0 bcfd on Aug. 19.\n\nWeek ended\n\nYear ago Five-year\n\nended\n\nSep 20\n\naverage\n\n20(Forecas Sep 13\n\nSep 20\n\n(Actual)\n\nU.S. natgas storage (bcf):\n\nRefinitiv Heating (HDD), Cooling (CDD) and Total (TDD) Degree Days\n\nTwo-Week Total Forecast\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nPrior\n\n10-Year\n\n30-Year\n\nNorm U.S. GFS HDDs\n\n80 U.S. GFS CDDs\n\n66 U.S. GFS TDDs\n\nRefinitiv U.S. Weekly GFS Supply and Demand Forecasts\n\nPrior Week Current Next Week This week Five-Yea\n\nlast year\n\nAverage\n\nMonth U.S. Supply (bcfd)\n\nU.S. Lower 48 Dry Production\n\n75.2 U.S. Imports from Canada\n\n7.7 U.S. LNG Imports\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Supply\n\nU.S. Demand (bcfd) U.S. Exports to Canada\n\n2.2 U.S. Exports to Mexico\n\n3.8 U.S. LNG Exports\n\n1.1 U.S. Commercial\n\n4.8 U.S. Residential\n\n3.8 U.S. Power Plant\n\n29.9 U.S. Industrial\n\n20.2 U.S. Plant Fuel\n\n4.6 U.S. Pipe Distribution\n\n2.0 U.S. Vehicle Fuel\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Consumption\n\n65.4 Total U.S. Demand\n\nSNL U.S. Natural Gas Next-Day Prices ($ per mmBtu)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nHenry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL\n\nTransco Z6 New York NG-CG-NY-SNL\n\nPG&E Citygate NG-CG-PGE-SNL\n\nDominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL\n\nChicago Citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL\n\nAlgonquin Citygate NG-CG-BS-SNL\n\nSoCal Citygate NG-SCL-CGT-SNL\n\nWaha Hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL\n\nSNL U.S. Power Next-Day Prices ($ per megawatt-hour)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nNew England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL\n\n21.25\n\n22.25\n\nPJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL\n\n32.48\n\n29.50\n\nErcot North EL-PK-ERTN-SNL\n\n170.00\n\n146.75\n\nMid C EL-PK-MIDC-SNL\n\n21.88\n\n30.19\n\nPalo Verde EL-PK-PLVD-SNL\n\n26.50\n\n26.75\n\nSP-15 EL-PK-SP15-SNL\n\n58.50\n\n58.50", "description": "U.S. natgas futures hold near 3-week low ahead of storage report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0E0N3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
