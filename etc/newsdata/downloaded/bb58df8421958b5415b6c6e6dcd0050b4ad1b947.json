There was no such locking mechanism. It didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Lauer wrote.\n\n\u201cIt would have been impossible to confine anyone in my office, for any purpose, and I have never attempted to make anyone feel as if they were confined in my office,\u201d Lauer added. \u201cI have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period.\u201d\n\nNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMATT LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'\n\nLauer, 61, broke his silence in a scathing letter on Wednesday after Variety reported that Ronan Farrow\u2019s highly anticipated book will include shocking claims that he raped a former co-worker. The former \u201cToday\u201d co-host said he was initially quiet for the sake of his children -- but will now defend himself.\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer wrote before also, oddly, addressing the infamous alleged button.\n\nBack in 2017, Variety\u2019s Ramin Setoodeh wrote that Lauer \u201chad a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door from the inside without getting up. This afforded him the assurance of privacy.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s button quickly became a hot topic on social media and people seemed both confused and shocked by the revelation.\n\nIt appears Lauer is denying the ability to lock the door, not the existence of a button.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAn NBC insider told Fox News in 2017 that Lauer\u2019s secret button wasn\u2019t the only one at NBC\u2019s 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters. A similar button exists \u2014 or at least recently existed \u2014 in the office of the \u201cToday\u201d show\u2019s executive producer.\n\nThe button, located under the executive producer\u2019s desk, would cause the door to the cavernous office to swing shut and click closed. The mechanism was actually a \u201cdoor opener,\u201d the source said, \"a remote-controlled device that would automatically open or close a door, and thereby lock it if the door knob was locked.\u201d\n\nThis mechanism was not viewed by NBC staff as a tool for inappropriate behavior, the insider said. \u201cIt was more of a gimmick, an ego thing so the EP didn\u2019t have to get out of his desk to close his door for a private conversation.\u201d", "description": "Former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer denied that his office has a secret button that could trap unsuspecting women inside his office two years after the claim sent shock waves through the media industry.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
