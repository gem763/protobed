Specifically, he promoted transparency and pluralism in science and tech over \"digital authoritarianism\" where technology is used for censorship and surveillance.\n\n\"At stake is whether we bequeath an Orwellian world, designed for censorship, repression and control, or a world of emancipation, debate and learning, where technology threatens famine and disease, but not our freedoms,\" he said.\n\nIn an at times rambling speech, Johnson promoted the United Kingdom as a global leader in technology and invited the world leaders present to attend a summit next year in London. The as yet unnamed summit would be an opportunity to ensure that \"cutting-edge technologies\" are designed with the right \"safeguards in place to protect our peoples,\" Johnson promised.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave his inaugural address to the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday night, just hours after his country's highest court ruled his suspension of Parliament was unlawful.", "authors": ["Helen Regan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925113831-boris-johnson-un-speech-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
