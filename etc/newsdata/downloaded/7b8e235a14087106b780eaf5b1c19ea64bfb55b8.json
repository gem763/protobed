Photo: Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s been in the works for a good while, and the president announced it was about to happen during his fundraising trip to California earlier this week in one of many taunts he flung at the Golden State\u2019s Democratic officeholders. But now the Environmental Protection Agency has made it official: It is revoking the Clean Air Act waiver that has allowed California to set its own tougher auto-emissions policies for nearly a half-century. The move is part of a more general Trump-administration drive to reverse the stronger emissions and fuel-economy standards imposed by the Obama administration nationally and by California and the 13 states (including New York) that track its clean-air rules. CalMatters explains the Trump strategy:\n\nPushing California and the states that follow its auto-emissions and fuel-economy rules back into line is an integral part of this strategy. The administration waxed furious when California reached a surprise deal with four major automakers (Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen) in July to manufacture cars achieving a 50 mpg fuel-efficiency goal by 2026, even threatening an antitrust action against the companies cooperating with the state. Today\u2019s announcement was just the latest, if the most dramatic, development in Trump\u2019s fight with California and with any and all proponents of policies to combat climate change.\n\nNow the fight will move to the federal courts, where California will argue that the administration didn\u2019t follow the necessary procedures in revoking the Clean Air Act waiver, as Rachel Becker and Julie Cart explain:\n\nJulia Stein, supervising attorney at UCLA\u2019s Frank G. Wells Environmental Law Clinic, estimates the lawsuit could take up to 18 months. In the meantime, California may ask the court to keep its waiver in place until any litigation is resolved, Stein said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s air board is confident of its legal standing, in part, state officials say, because the federal agency has failed to make a scientific or technical case for the waiver decision.\n\n\u201cTheir work\u2019s been bad. Their facts are bad,\u201d said Craig Segall, assistant chief counsel for the California Air Resources Board, referring to the EPA\u2019s analysis, which has been widely criticized. Anything can happen in litigation, he acknowledged, but \u201cwe\u2019ve got the better of the argument, and it helps to have facts on your side.\u201d\n\nIn 18 months, of course, we could have a very different administration in Washington \u2014 one that isn\u2019t committed to heavy-handed intervention by the federal government to protect the fossil-fuel industry. If the case makes it to the U.S. Supreme Court, it could be an epochal test of support for the alleged conservative principal of federalism among the Court\u2019s conservative majority.\n\nIf the administration gets its way on the California waiver, says Energy Innovation, a think tank publishing its views at Fortune, it will cost consumers $160 billion in higher fuel costs through 2050 and help drive transportation emissions 10 percent higher by 2035 \u2014 which is not the trend we need. More important, it would signal a national surrender to climate change and its potentially catastrophic effects.\n\nUnsurprisingly, environmental groups are lining up to back California, as The Verge reports:\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is committing an unprecedented and illegal attack on the Clean Air Act that will increase pollution in our communities and steal money from people\u2019s wallets,\u201d Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in a statement. Brune also called Trump\u2019s announcement an \u201cindefensible attack\u201d that is \u201cnothing more than pure vindictiveness from an Administration set on giving Big Oil a polluting pass at the expense of our climate and the well-being of American families,\u201d and said the president\u2019s actions \u201cwill not go unchecked.\u201d\n\nPraising Trump\u2019s action, meanwhile, was the National Automobile Dealers Association.\n\nYou can add this (and all the associated climate-change issues) to the list of very big things that are at stake in the 2020 election.", "description": "In an expected move that accompanies its attack on Obama\u2019s higher fuel-economy goals, the Trump administration has revoked California\u2019s long-established Clean Air Act waiver allowing it and 13 other states to have tougher emissions standards.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/19/19-la-smog.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
