The long battery life, quality sound, and secure fit ranked them as comparable to the popular Apple Airpods, and right now they're down to the best price we've seen since Prime Day, when they reached $120. They are a bit bulky, as most high-end non-Apple options tend to be, so might not be the most comfortable for extended use. But for $36 less than usual, this is an impeccable investment if you wear headphones all the time and hate dealing with cords.\n\nGet the Jabra Elite 65t True Wireless Earbuds for $133.99 (Save $36)\n\n2.
