When asked about gun confiscation policy for so-called \u201cassault-weapons\u201d he replied: \u201cHell yes, we are going to take your AR-15.\u201d\n\nBut Democratic frontrunner Elizabeth Warren has devised a way to disarm the poor \u2014 a steep national gun tax of 30 percent and an ammunition tax of 50 percent.\n\nHer plan would triple the federal excise tax from its current 10 percent (for handguns) and 11 percent (for shotguns and rifles) and nearly quintuple the ammunition tax from its current 11 percent.\n\nThe burden of the tax will fall on the people, not the manufacturer.\n\nUnder the Warren gun tax plan, parents seeking a typical $400 shotgun to protect their family would have to come up with $520.\n\nWho would be unable to buy guns because of the Warren gun tax? Certainly not the oft-mentioned \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d she claims to want to stick it to. Many poor households will be unable to afford a gun to protect their home.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious which group Sen. Warren is targeting. Her tax targets those among us who are already the most vulnerable. Many people under the poverty line live in dangerous neighborhoods. While rich liberals like Ms. Warren can afford private security guards, the rest of us need to be able to defend ourselves.\n\nMs. Warren states her gun tax would \u201creduce new gun and ammunition sales overall and bring in new federal revenue.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren views guns as an inherent evil that must be taken out of existence. She knows repealing the Second Amendment is impossible, so she is attempting to tax the right to bear arms out of existence.\n\nWhen you prevent the poor from owning firearms you put their lives in danger. You take power away from good people and give more of it to gangs and thugs. The only people this law will make safer are criminals.\n\nMeanwhile in Congress, Democrat Danny Davis is sponsoring gun tax legislation. His confiscatory intentions are the same as Ms. Warren\u2019s as shown by a statement he made last year:\n\n\u201cSo if rich people can only get firearms then only rich people would be able to pay the price and if that could prevent some people from getting them, I\u2019d want to prevent all people from getting them,\u201d he told The Daily Caller. \u201cBut if rich people were willing and would continue to pay the high price, then I\u2019d be happy that we kept the other group from getting them.\u201d\n\nEven the staunchest progressives should worry about the constitutional implications of this legislative proposal. Imagine paying taxes to be guaranteed a speedy trial. Or to be read your Miranda rights.\n\nImagine paying a tax every time you said something the government disagreed with.\n\nConstitutional rights should never be for sale. If Ms. Warren imposes a tax on guns, speech or any other right shielded by the U.S. Constitution, she does so with the purpose of preventing as many people as possible from exercising those rights.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s new way of controlling guns is the most dangerous because it has flown under the radar of most Americans. The right to bear arms was put in place to allow the people to defend themselves from government tyranny. But our strongest weapon in this fight is the ballot box. If Ms. Warren becomes president, our right to bear arms will be taxed until it no longer exists.\n\nEven California, the left-wing capital of America, felt the Warren approach went too far. When a similar proposal was brought up in late August, it failed. It was struck down by the legislature after many state representatives pointed out that low-income residents would be hit the hardest.\n\nBut two cities with their own gun tax provide a cautionary tale: Chicago and Seattle.\n\nChicago\u2019s gun homicide rate increased sharply after its 2013 gun tax enactment. The Seattle gun tax was enacted in 2015 and immediately crippled gun sales, preventing many lower-income residents from exercising their right to bear arms. The results were devastating. In contrast to what gun tax proponents claimed would happen, gun violence in Seattle surged after the tax was introduced. In fact, twice as many people were killed the year after the tax was introduced.\n\nThe data is clear: Making it harder for innocent people to arm themselves makes it easier for criminals to terrorize them.\n\nAmericans must take a stand against the Warren gun tax. Taxes should not be weaponized to strip the American people of their rights.\n\nIf we don\u2019t take a stand today for the gun rights of the poor, tomorrow all of us will lose them.\n\n\u2022 Emmanuel Sessegnon is a communications associate at Americans for Tax Reform.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
