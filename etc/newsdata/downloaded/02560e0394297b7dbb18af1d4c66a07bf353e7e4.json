We don't have insurance. We have an insurance card but at every hospital we go to, we have to pay,\" a masked police officer told AFP, asking to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals.\n\nAs they have for two months, presidential detractors demanded that Moise resign. They were joined by some churchgoers on their way out of services.\n\nSince coming to power in February 2017, Moise has had to face the anger of an opposition movement that refuses to recognise his victory in an election widely seen as dubious.\n\nAnger mounted in late August due to a national fuel shortage, and protests turned violent.\n\nBut even before this crisis erupted, Moise was accused of corruption.\n\nAn auditors' court probing two billion dollars in aid from a Venezuelan oil fund found that companies run by Moise before he became president were \"at the heart of an embezzling scheme.\"", "description": "There has been mounting anger in the country since August due to a national fuel shortage, and protests turned violent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/69af322b386c4de79aa53f1f653b15ef_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
