This is what matters to us and what we take into account,\" Putin said, according to a translation.\n\nPutin's comments come at a time after the Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that U.S. manufacturing activity fell last month to its lowest level in more than 10 years.\n\nPutin said that while Russia and the United States haven't arrived at a bright future at this point in time, he hopes the bilateral relationship will come back to normal.\n\n\"We see that the position of President Trump himself has not changed as it has been voiced publicly. He wants restoration of the bilateral relationship. We welcome that. We will use any opportunity to implement that,\" Putin said.", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised President Donald Trump for his economic reforms that have boosted growth in the U.S.", "authors": ["Spriha Srivastava", "Www.Linkedin.Com In Sprihasrivastava"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105993041-1561702851512gettyimages-1152460287.jpeg?v=1561703013"}
