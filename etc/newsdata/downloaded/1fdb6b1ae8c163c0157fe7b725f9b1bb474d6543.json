When everyone cheered me on, I just forget about everything.\u201d", "description": "Lifted by a packed stadium, Qatar's Mutaz Barshim soared to victory in the men's high jump at the world championships on Friday to give the hosts a long-awaited first gold medal.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437142164&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931IT", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
