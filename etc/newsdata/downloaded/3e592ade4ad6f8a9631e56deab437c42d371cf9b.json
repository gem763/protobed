He embodied virtues like passion, integrity, perseverance and always led by example. His character, on and off the field, made all those around him better. His legacy will be preserved forever in Canton, Ohio to inspire generations of fans.\u201d\n\nThe catalyst of one of the iconic images of the early years of the Super Bowl era, Brown played 16 seasons in the NFL from 1963-78, the latter 12 of which were with the Raiders after spending the first four with the Broncos. Brown intercepted 54 passes in 204 career games and also scored two touchdowns.\n\nBut it was a postseason score for which he is best known. In Super Bowl XI, Brown intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in the fourth quarter and returned the ball 75 yards for the score. The play helped Oakland clinch a 32-14 victory in the game, and announcer Bill King's call of \"Old Man Willie\" sealed a signature moment for the veteran, who was in his 15th season in the league.\n\nBrown was a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and a five-time all-pro. He was inducted in the Hall of Fame in the class of 1984.\n\nIn his 12 seasons in Oakland, Brown helped the Raiders play in three AFL championship games, six AFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls.\n\nBrown was undrafted but signed with the Houston Oilers as a free agent. He was cut before the end of training camp in 1963.\n\n\u201cMy job was not catching passes,\u201d Brown was quoted as once saying. \u201cMy job was to stop the receiver from catching it. If I could have played 15 or 20 years without an interception, that would have been fine. Anything beyond stopping a receiver, that\u2019s gravy.\u201d\n\nBrown played at Grambling and was inducted in the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2012. He also served as the Raiders' defensive backs coach from 1979-88.", "description": "Willie Brown, a two-time Super Bowl champion and Hall of Famer who was one of the leaders of the Oakland Raiders' golden era, died Tuesday at 78.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
