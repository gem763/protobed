The Kurdish-dominated administration has alternatively suggested creating a local war crime tribunal.\n\nOther politicians in the group are Conservative MPs Crispin Blunt, a former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, and Adam Holloway plus Lord Glasman, a Labour peer, and former adviser to the party\u2019s previous leader Ed Miliband.\n\nMembers of the group also expressed anxiety that the Turks might begin bombing raids using F16 jets, previously deployed against separatist Kurds in the south of their own country, in a region where aerial superiority provides a critical military advantage.\n\nThe politicians\u2019 warning was echoed by Sally Lane, the mother of Letts. She said she believed that \u201cthe Kurds could suddenly release them\u201d or that \u201cthey\u2019ll ask people if they want to fight for them against Turkey\u201d to deal with the sudden threat.\n\nLane wants her son to be extradited to Canada and face justice there after the UK stripped him of his citizenship over the summer. A Muslim convert, Letts quit his Oxfordshire home and joined Isis before being picked up by the SDF in 2017 where he has been in a crowded prison ever since.\n\nShe said that she was \u201cterrified, what\u2019s going to happen to Jack. I\u2019m worried that he could get killed in the crossfire\u201d, adding: \u201cI know what people think, who cares about hundreds of Isis fighters, but one of them is my son.\u201d\n\nThe White House said in its Sunday night statement that it expected Turkey to take responsibility for the Isis prisoners and others if it did mount military operations, prompting additional questions.\n\n\u0130brahim Do\u011fu\u015f, the founder of the London-based Centre for Kurdish Progress, said if an invasion were to take place \u201cthe SDF may not be able to control the camps and prisons due to relocating its forces while Turkey may decide to release them to use against SDF and then let them go anywhere they want\u201d. Both scenarios were dangerous, he said.\n\nThe British government attempted to sound a note of concern on Monday morning in the immediate aftermath of the unexpected White House announcement. A Downing Street spokesman said the priority for the UK was to secure the lasting defeat of Daesh [Isis] and added: \u201cWe would be concerned by any unilateral action that would threaten the progress we have made towards this aim.\u201d\n\nKurdish politicians have repeatedly said that they need help in dealing with Isis prisoners and in the refugee camps, where support for the Islamist group remains strong. Last month Isis\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, released an audio message calling on Isis fighters to liberate prisoners and those living in refugee camps.", "description": "Policy reversal by Trump raises fears captured militants could escape and return to the UK", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7716526d62f84c933a8353515e823bbcd655fa4/0_0_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e44e835bd4dcb27690418651c3ee3788", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
