This is another example of the MSM making a mistake, admitting it, and fixing it. You worship a president who doubles and triples down on lies \u2014 Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) September 16, 2019\n\nPoor Ron. \u2014 Hey, guys (@jtLOL) September 16, 2019\n\nFirst of all, who\u2019s he saying \u201cworships\u201d President Trump? Joe Scarborough? Or the guy who complained about the MSM\u2019s reputation. And second, who says that editor\u2019s note appended to the book excerpt \u201cfixed\u201d anything? The omission of that information in the original piece seems \u2026 suspicious.\n\nYes, we want to talk about credibility, you incredible hack. You are utterly without shame to pass this off as an example of the media getting it right. \u2014 prop op (@ProperOpinion) September 16, 2019\n\nRon, you have to admit this is a huge mistake by the NYT. Credibility in journalism used to mean something. \u2014 CCD (@ConwayCD) September 16, 2019\n\nIt was obviously a calculated move, with the admission of mistake a tiny printed afterthought added only after the damage intended had been done \u2014 T\u00edo Chon (@didiaskyouhuh) September 16, 2019\n\nIt wasn't a mistake \u2014 Jeffrey Collins (@Collinstaxacct) September 16, 2019\n\n\u201cmade a mistake\u201d lol\n\n\u201cfixed it\u201d haha \u2014 Katie O (@KatieOMerica) September 16, 2019\n\nThe real lie is pretending it was a mistake. \u2014 R. Collins (@RC9511) September 16, 2019\n\n\"Mistakes\" that only go one way\u2026.. \u2014 Habitual Linestepper (@FergusFSU) September 16, 2019\n\nThe mistakes always go one way Ron. \u2014 Ryan B. Leslie (@RyanBLeslie) September 16, 2019\n\nTruth.\n\nMistake? This was as deliberate a smear as I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 Lisa (@kittywhisperer7) September 16, 2019\n\nThey literally just did it again. Not the same type of \"error.\" THE EXACT SAME \"ERROR\" IN A DIFFERENT ARTICLE. Sit down. Forever.https://t.co/s1bGhmrGXS \u2014 Eric Spencer (@JustEric) September 16, 2019\n\nRon how does this mistake happen honestly? If it was a honest mistake\u2026.makes you think the chance this is an honest mistake is so miniscule that it was an honest attempt to mislead\u2026 \u2014 dazed and confused (@HalDoherty) September 16, 2019\n\nWhen every \"journalist\" who spent the weekend braying about credible evidence, and impeachment, tweets out the correction with the same vigor maybe @ron_fournier can claim \"admitting-fixing\".\n\nUntil then this is a clown show media of the highest order. \u2014 Brad Slager: Straight to DVD is Cis-Norm \ud83c\udf78 \ud83e\udd43\ud83c\udfac\ud83d\udcbb (@MartiniShark) September 16, 2019\n\nHow do you \u201cfix\u201d a \u201cmistake\u201d like this? You don\u2019t; you can\u2019t. The fire has already been lit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so sinister. \u2014 G.R. Hall (@Garrett_R_Hall) September 16, 2019\n\nFixing it? You think the damage and narrative are undone? It\u2019s intentional \u2014 Andy Lancaster (@andylancaster) September 16, 2019\n\nNYT made this \"mistake\" deliberately bkz they *knew* the rest of our crap MSM would run with it uncritically. Then let it happen & then, *after the damage had been done*, they issued a correction, which they *knew* most would ignore. THIS WAS DELIBERATE. Because #journalism \u2014 Marie Arf (@schwingcat) September 16, 2019\n\nThese 'mistakes' always happen in one direction. *Always*. The fact that the woman who was allegedly wronged by Kavanaugh had *no* recollection of this incident means\n\nthis should never have been published. That it was is evidence that it was deliberate. Because #journalism \u2014 Marie Arf (@schwingcat) September 16, 2019\n\nLucky for them, the damage hadn't already been done. Oh wait, it had. \u2014 neontaster (@neontaster) September 16, 2019\n\nSo that\u2019s your standard for the media now? \u201cWe omit key facts and mislead readers, but at least we eventually add a correction unlike some politicians\u201d Can\u2019t imagine any reasonable person can honestly believe yesterday was a good day for the media\u2019s credibility. https://t.co/XtWf9hLu04 \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) September 16, 2019\n\nPeople assume dishonesty from politicians and partisans. Some take it a lot farther than others, but the whole point of the media is to sort out the truth for the public. If they are just going to act like activists, they add 0 value. And that\u2019s why journalism is failing. \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) September 16, 2019\n\nHacks gotta hack \u2026 I\u2019m sure YOU understand \u2026 \u2014 Wingo is a Jedi name \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffc (@mikepinkshoes) September 16, 2019\n\n\"making a mistake\" lol. We're not all dumb enough to believe this isn't a concerted effort, despite your gaslighting. \u2014 Antonio Martinez (@djtechchicago) September 16, 2019\n\nWhy do the media mistakes all break the same way? \u2014 Pelosi's Pinkos (@z_killgrave) September 16, 2019\n\nHow have they fixed it? They put an update, not even a real retraction, at the bottom of an article AFTER the vast majority of the clicks occured. This wasn't a mistake and you know it. \u2014 Andrew Follett (@AndrewCFollett) September 16, 2019\n\nThis is a pretty damned significant \u201cmistake\u201d. It\u2019s getting to be a habit, and the \u201cmistakes\u201d never favor conservatives. Why is that, do you suppose? \u2014 While Supplies Last (@corrcomm) September 16, 2019\n\nNYT leaves a lie about sexual assault out there for a day so the mob can swamp social media \u2013 a mistake. Trump makes a joke about light bulbs \u2013 fact checked lie number 10,002!!!! \u2014 May Thewords (@MayThewords) September 16, 2019\n\nThere was NO story so they made one up. Hardly an honest bit of journalism that needed to be \"fixed.\" Enemy of the people is a moniker they will wear for the rest of their days long after Trump is just a memory. \u2014 Tonya still @watchingfoxes (@tonya_still) September 16, 2019\n\nKeep justifying propaganda bud \u2014 oh boy (@Welcome_2_Moes) September 16, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Ron Fournier can't believe people won't just admit the Times made a mistake and \"fixed\" it.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ron-fournier-meet-the-press.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
