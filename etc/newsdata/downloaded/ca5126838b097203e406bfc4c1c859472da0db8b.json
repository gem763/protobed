Choose whichever metaphor you want \u2014 the point is that news of President Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden has supercharged Democratic support for impeachment proceedings.\n\nWhat stands out about the latest crop of converts to the cause is how many are from swing congressional districts \u2014 the kinds of places where bringing charges against the president may be a far riskier political gamble than in safe Democratic areas, given that impeachment has consistently lacked majority support in national polls. The lack of enthusiasm from representatives in these districts is one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been so unenthusiastic about triggering the procedure over Donald Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction in the Russia investigation.\n\nBut the Ukraine story seems to be different. Here\u2019s a running list of lawmakers joining the impeachment push.\n\nHouse Democrats Newly in Favor of Impeachment\n\nAt least 14 House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment for the first time in just the past two days, bringing the total number of representatives on board to 158 Democrats out of 235, according to Politico\u2019s running counter.\n\nOn Monday, Congresswoman Angie Craig, who represents a Minnesota district Trump carried by a point, said she is onboard with impeachment.\n\nLater that night, seven freshman Democrats wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which they deemed Trump\u2019s actions a possible threat to national security. Four of them \u2014 Virginia\u2019s Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria, Michigan\u2019s Elissa Slotkin, and New Jersey\u2019s Mikie Sherrill \u2014 represent districts Trump carried in 2016.\n\nHere's how Trump did in the Impeachment 7 op-ed writers' districts in 2016:\n\n\n\nSpanberger VA-7 Trump +7\n\nSlotkin MI-8 Trump +7\n\nLuria VA-2 Trump +4\n\nSherrill NJ-11 Trump +1\n\nCisneros CA-39 Clinton +9\n\nCrow CO-6 Clinton +9\n\nHoulahan PA-6 Clinton +10\n\n\n\nAVG: Clinton +1 \u2014 Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) September 24, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday morning, New York\u2019s Antonio Delgado joined the impeachment bandwagon. Delgado defeated incumbent Republican John Faso in an upstate district that voted for Trump by more than six points.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Texas\u2019s Colin Allred said if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t turn over the full report of the whistle-blower who alerted the government to Trump\u2019s alleged misconduct, he would support impeachment. In 2018, Allred defeated a longtime Republican incumbent in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton by just two points.\n\nLater, Texas representative Lizzie Fletcher announced her support as well. Fletcher\u2019s district narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 but hadn\u2019t been represented by a Democrat in Congress since 1967.\n\nThe facts we have learned recently are matters of utmost importance for our national security, country, and Constitution. The House should act swiftly to investigate and should be prepared to use the remedy exclusively in its power: impeachment.\n\n\n\nSee my full statement here: pic.twitter.com/xho0DlD107 \u2014 Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (@RepFletcher) September 24, 2019\n\nTwo representatives from Nevada, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, followed suit.\n\nLee\u2019s district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, civil-rights icon John Lewis announced his support for impeachment from the House floor.\n\nBreaking. Rep. John Lewis just now on the House floor: \"I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.\" \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 24, 2019\n\nAs a rough measure of swing-district support, just five Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016 had endorsed impeachment before this week, according to Politico; now that number is up to 12 and is likely to rise.\n\nThese lawmakers\u2019 decisions were apparently not triggered by House leadership in any way, making them all the more significant.\n\nAs one Dem operative notes, this is the opposite of how Hill votes usually pile up: there is NO whipping from leadership, it\u2019s rank and file members coordinating w one another, swallowing and stepping out there. \u2014 Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019\n\nWhile most of the action was in the House on Tuesday, the Democrats\u2019 second-in-command in the Senate, Dick Durbin, joined in as well.\n\nToday, I am calling for the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives of President Donald Trump. \u2014 Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) September 24, 2019\n\nNon-Democrats in Favor of Impeachment\n\nSo far, only one non-Democrat in Congress supports impeachment: Michigan representative Justin Amash, who switched his party registration from Republican to Independent earlier this year after declaring that Trump should be investigated. On Tuesday, he reiterated his call to action in an effort to nudge his erstwhile Republican colleagues.\n\nJust do what is right. Stop waiting for others to act first. Take responsibility for yourself and set an example. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 24, 2019\n\nThere is no sign that any House Republicans will join Amash. In the Senate, one Republican, Mitt Romney, has expressed serious consternation over Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019\n\nWhen asked about impeachment on Tuesday \u2014 hours after Trump had mocked him on Twitter \u2014 Romney didn\u2019t rule it out.\n\nRomney on impeachment: \u201cit\u2019s early to be having those conversations. There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 24, 2019\n\nOther Republicans have either downplayed Trump\u2019s offenses or remained silent.\n\nDemocratic Presidential Candidates in Favor of Impeachment\n\nOf the major presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro, and Tom Steyer have previously called on Congress to impeach Trump. Pete Buttigieg has said Trump \u201cdeserves impeachment\u201d but has stopped short of endorsing it. On Tuesday, Montana governor Steve Bullock, who has struggled to gain traction in the race, said he now favors impeachment.\n\nI see no other option. pic.twitter.com/mmrGBCjJM9 \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) September 24, 2019\n\nJoe Biden, who is at the center of the Ukraine scandal, has so far resisted calls to impeach. But he is set to make a statement on Tuesday that will reportedly endorse the process if the Trump administration does not cooperate with Democrats\u2019 demands for full access to the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint.\n\nNEW: A source says Joe Biden is \"going to make the point that Trump\u2019s latest abuses are on top of all of his prior abuses.\" Biden is going to say if Trump doesn't comply with requests for info on Ukraine & investigations from Congress that \"Congress has no choice but to impeach.\" \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 24, 2019\n\nOther candidates are reaffirming their belief that Trump should face charges.\n\nThe House must impeach. It must start today. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 24, 2019\n\nEnough. It\u2019s time to impeach. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019\n\nIf we allow the president to get away with the crimes he\u2019s committed, then we will set the precedent that some people are above the law. And then, this democracy will be lost to us forever.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time for Speaker Pelosi and the House to do their job. \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 24, 2019\n\nWe knew nearly 2 years ago that Donald Trump had passed the threshold for impeachment. Over 8 million Americans showed up and signed our petition. It is my sincere hope that today is the day the House Democrats stand up for democracy and move to impeach this lawless president. \u2014 Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) September 24, 2019\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nWith pressure building on all sides for Pelosi to act, the Washington Post reported on Monday that the House speaker is \u201csounding out\u201d her caucus on next steps in advance of a key party meeting Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBREAKING: Speaker Pelosi tells @AlexNBCNews when asked about impeachment: \"Later today I will make an announcement after I meet with my chairmen, my leadership and my caucus.\u201d \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) September 24, 2019\n\nImpeachment, which seemed almost certain not to happen just days ago, is now likelier than ever.", "description": "A number of House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment against President Trump for the first time in just the past two days, making it more likely that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will choose to initiate proceedings.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/24/24-impeachment.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
