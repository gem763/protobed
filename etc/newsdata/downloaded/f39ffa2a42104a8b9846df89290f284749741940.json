But the initiative has been perennially underfunded.\n\nThe situation in Burkina Faso has deteriorated in particular in recent weeks. An attack in late August killed 24 soldiers, one of the heaviest losses yet in the nation\u2019s fight against Islamist militants. Last week, 29 people were killed in separate attacks in its troubled central-northern region.\n\nOnce a pocket of relative calm in the Sahel, Burkina has suffered a homegrown insurgency for the past three years, which has been amplified by a spillover of jihadist violence and criminality from its chaotic neighbor Mali.\n\nLarge swathes of Burkina\u2019s north are now out of control, and France\u2019s military Sahel mission began limited operations there earlier this year.\n\n(This story has been refiled to correct title of ECOWAS Commission President)", "description": "West African leaders have pledged $1 billion to combat the spiraling threat of Islamist militancy in the region, the head of the regional ECOWAS bloc said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Thiam Ndiaga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
