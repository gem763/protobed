In some cases, they even photoshopped their kid\u2019s face onto a stock photo of an athlete and submitted it with the college application as evidence of athletic prowess.\n\nThe schemes involved many of the nation\u2019s top universities\u2014including Yale University, Stanford University, UCLA, the University of San Diego, and the University of Texas\u2014although there\u2019s no evidence that the schools were aware of the bribes.\n\nMany of the students also didn\u2019t know that their admission had been contingent on bribes. None of the children were charged.\n\n\u201cThe parents charged today, despite already being able to give their children every legitimate advantage on the college admissions game, instead chose to corrupt and illegally manipulate the system for their benefit,\u201c Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said at a press conference with the FBI Tuesday to announce \u201cOperation Varsity Blues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about donating a building so that a school is more likely to take your son or daughter, we are talking about deception and fraud.\u201d\n\nA 204-page criminal complaint filed Tuesday outlines how an employee of a nonprofit called The Key flipped and helped the feds bring fraud charges against 32 moms and dads, including big names in the business world\u2014the chair of a top law firm, a Napa Valley winemaker, a jeweler, a casino kingpin, a fashion designer, a real-estate developer, a distillery owner, a TV broadcaster, and a bunch of private investors. The parents have been charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.\n\nHuffman was arrested without incident on Tuesday and later released on a $250,000 bond, Reuters reports. Loughlin\u2019s husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, was also reportedly released on Tuesday on a $1 million bond. There\u2019s an arrest warrant out for Loughlin, who is reportedly on a flight to LA. The three have yet to enter their respective pleas.\n\nParents allegedly paid William Singer of The Key, who is now charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice, up to $6 million to bribe coaches and university officials to falsely designate students as athletic recruits\u2014regardless of their abilities\u2014to grease the admissions process between 2011 and 2018.\n\nIn some cases, the complaint noted, the students didn\u2019t even play the sports for which they were \u201crecruited.\u201d Singer, who pleaded guilty on Tuesday, described the scheme to parents as a \u201cside door\u201d that many wealthy families used to win their kids admission.\n\nIn one instance, former Yale women\u2019s soccer coach Rudolph Meredith allegedly accepted a $400,000 bribe to falsely recruit a student, despite the fact that he knew the student did not play competitive soccer. In total, officials said, the student\u2019s parents paid $1.2 million in bribes.\n\nThe feds said some of the bribes went to coaches who vouched for the bogus recruits, including four from USC: senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, ex-women\u2019s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin, ex-assistant soccer coach Laura Janke, and water polo coach Jovan Vavic. UCLA\u2019s men\u2019s soccer coach, Jorge Salcedo, former Wake Forest University volleyball coach William Ferguson, and ex-Georgetown University tennis coach Gordon Ernt were also charged.\n\nAnother scheme involved standardized testing fraud. According to the complaint, Singer would tell his clients to seek extended time for their children on the SAT or ACT, which sometimes required families to fake a learning disability so they could get the medical documentation required by testing companies. He allegedly told one parent to have his daughter \u201cbe stupid\u201d when she was being evaluated for extra time.\n\nSinger also allegedly told families to invent a family event\u2014such as a wedding\u2014to have their child\u2019s testing center moved to one of the two facilities he \u201ccontrolled\u201d: a public school in Houston, and a private college preparatory school in West Hollywood, California. At those centers, he told clients, the administrators were willing to accept bribes.\n\nSometimes, families pushed the boundaries even further. When the son of Jane Buckingham, the CEO of a boutique marketing firm in Los Angeles, couldn\u2019t make it to Houston because he had tonsilitis, Singer arranged for someone to take the test for him\u2014and for the boy to take an at-home test so he wouldn\u2019t get suspicious.\n\nThe cheating at those centers worked in one of three ways, the complaint said. A third party would take the test in the student\u2019s name; administrators would provide answers to the students during the test; or administrators would correct a student\u2019s answers once the tests had been submitted. Clients paid $15,000 to $75,000, often disguised as donations to the charity. One student, who actually scored in the mid-600s on an SAT subject test, got her score bumped up to a perfect 800 when it was corrected.\n\nIn Huffman\u2019s case, Singer met with the Desperate Housewives actress and her husband, who is Oscar-winning actor William H. Macy, at their Los Angeles home before their older daughter took a Dec. 2017 SAT exam.\n\n\u201c[He] advised Huffman and her spouse that he \u2018controlled\u2019 a testing center, and could arrange for a third party to purport to proctor their daughter\u2019s SAT and secretly correct her answers afterwards,\u201d the complaint said. The couple allegedly agreed, and Singer and Huffman exchanged emails about how she could obtain extra time for the test.\n\n\u201cHurray! She got it,\u201d Huffman said in an email after her daughter was approved for double the time. When the school counselor informed Huffman that meant her daughter would have to take the test at the school and not at Singer\u2019s designated center, she fired off another email: \u201cRuh Ro!\u201d\n\nThe proctor, who was flown in from Tampa, told investigators every time he worked for Singer he either changed answers or gave the student help during the test. Huffman\u2019s daughter scored a 1420 on the SAT, 400 points over her PSAT a year earlier, according to court papers.\n\nThe couple talked about having their younger daughter participate in the same scheme but ultimately decided against it.\n\nLoughlin, best known for her role on Full House and Giannulli allegedly agreed to pay $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters labeled as recruits for the University of Southern California crew team, even though they did not compete in the sport.\n\nHeinel, of the USC athletic department, allegedly went along with the ruse. In one call, Singer told Giannulli that he was being audited but assured him, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say anything about your payments going to Donna Heinel at USC to get the girls into USC, through crew.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s attorney declined to comment.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: This is not a case where parents were acting in the best interests of their children. This is a case where they flaunted their wealth, sparing no expense to cheat the system so they could set their children up for success with the best education money could buy\u2014literally,\u201d said Joe Bonavolonta, FBI Special Agent in Charge in Boston.", "description": "Dozens of people\u2014including Felicity Huffman of \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 and Lori Loughlin of \u2018Full House\u2019\u2014allegedly cheated the college admissions system.", "authors": ["Victoria Albert"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1552404452/190312-Albert-college-admissions-scam-tease_heiiek", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
