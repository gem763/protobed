This is not America. I want my smoothies so thick I pass out from cerebral blood loss trying to suck it through the straw. I want my milkshakes so thick that the straw is held in place by the neutron-star density of the shake and if I manage to pull out the straw from the shake I am immediately hailed as the king of England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would be wonderful if someone calculated the carbon impact of all the blenders running for an extra few minutes and discovered that it is equivalent to 40 airplane round trips to New Zealand.\n\nWhat do they think happens to the straws that we throw away? Do they believe they are carefully separated, placed into the hold of a cargo airplane, and then flown out over the ocean until the pilot sees some hapless turtles, whereupon he opens the bay door and the sky darkens with straws as with arrows at Agincourt?\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. It can be taken away, so it should be taken away. Which leads us to a very important piece on the Web publication Vice. It\u2019s about the horrible carbon impact of . . . fun. To be specific, fun on the Internet. The author writes:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one seems to be talking about using Instagram, Netflix or Spotify less in the same way we\u2019re saying no to plastic straws and bottles.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019re not tremulous lunatics who read the weather reports like verses of Revelation.\n\n\u201cThe [tech] sector on the whole \u2014 everything from mobile-phone networks to your television \u2014 is on the same emission level as the global aviation industry.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s 2 percent of global carbon emissions. Maybe! It\u2019s tricky:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to definitively calculate the environmental impact of entire sectors . . .\u201d\n\nBut we know with expertly sciencey science that providing plastic straws \u201cby request only\u201d will reduce the rise of the oceans by 0.001 micrometers over eleventy-six decades.\n\n\u201c. . . since there are complex factors some studies consider and others don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe science has been pre-settled for your convenience, so minor details such as these are just interesting points to discuss at cocktail parties.\n\n\u201cShould TV be included or not? And what about the impact of the extraction of coltan in the Congo, a fundamental component in the production of microchips?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill anyone decide not to buy a computer because of controversial coltan? No. Capitalism will provide a new market for Ethically Sourced Microchips, complete with a leafy-green icon on the product so that your conscience doesn\u2019t claw at you like a ferret that got into the meth.\n\nThe article goes on to measure the impact of cloud services and streaming video, which require innumerable banks of whirring machines in freezing-cold rooms. (A 2050 reboot of Rocky will have the fighter go to a cold-storage facility to punch hard-drive arrays instead of sides of beef.) Netflix takes up 15 percent of global streaming traffic, which means that you can contribute to the planet\u2019s collapse just by sitting home and watching two episodes of BoJack Horseman instead of one.\n\n\u201cSo even if you\u2019ve stopped flying entirely, you cycle to work and don\u2019t eat meat or dairy, you might still be contributing to the climate crisis by reading this on your phone or laptop.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis . . . this is beautiful. The next time someone asks whether you\u2019ve seen that new Netflix series, glower and frown! (Note: Glower and Frown, a hip cop show, is actually on Hulu.) Watch TV? How dare you! How dare you!\n\nWe need remote-control registration. Oh, don\u2019t be silly, no one\u2019s talking about taking away your remote control. We just want sensible regulation. Something that shuts off the TV after 25 minutes. You can hit the fast-forward button if you want to see the whole show. By the way, the batteries on the remote are toxic, so your remote will be solar-powered; if you forget to leave it on the windowsill to charge every day, no TV for you. Which is good! You can read a book. But not on your Kindle!\n\nBut even that\u2019s not enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe could also start using apps that automatically unsubscribe us from useless newsletters \u2014 which are also surprisingly bad for the environment.\u201d\n\nAt the bottom of the story, the site asks you whether you\u2019d like to sign up for their newsletter. Then there\u2019s a link to a story about awesome $2 hamburgers you can get in Harlem, and an ad for a bespoke travel kit. As if pushing email, meat, and travel weren\u2019t bad enough, Vice has nice graphics, which require more Internet traffic to download, to say nothing of the computer power needed to create them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we have a climate emergency, the Internet should be reduced to bare-bones text pages, and Netflix and its streaming kin should be shut down. Movie theaters too, for that matter. Theater might be permitted, with solar-powered footlights. Any other measures suggest that it is not an emergency at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a small step from thin smoothies to regulating Internet usage. Give them the first, and they have the moral authority to demand the second. But if you don\u2019t need that straw, Leo DiCaprio doesn\u2019t need to make that movie. Every reviewer who writes about his movie, and every media organization that publishes that writing, is complicit. You told people it was good and would be an enjoyable artistic experience?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare you?
