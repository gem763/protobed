It is the leading researcher of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), a degenerative brain disease associated with brain trauma.\n\nIt was the CTE Center\u2019s study that found 99 percent of brains obtained from NFL players had CTE. Nowinksi also wrote the book, \u201c Head Games: Football\u2019s Concussion Crisis,\u201d that was turned into a movie with actor Will Smith.\n\nRob Gronkowski claims he fixed his concussions and CTE.

The expert wrote he appreciates and respects the three-time Super Bowl champion to speak honestly about the issue, but \u201cright now CTE cannot be fixed.\u201d\n\nGronkowski, 31, replied Friday saying it can be.\n\nIt is fixable. I fixed mine. There are plenty of methods in this world that allow the brain to recover from severe damage. That is also why I would allow my kid to play football. https://t.co/9aI1olAdqP \u2014 Rob Gronkowski (@RobGronkowski) September 13, 2019\n\nNowinski reiterated his stance, saying neurodegenerative diseases \u201ceventually win.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nYou are right about brain plasticity, and I am glad you are feeling great today, but neurodegenerative diseases (CTE, Alzheimer's, etc.) cannot be \"fixed\" or cured today. They eventually win. Please come on over to the BU brain bank next week and we can discuss the nuances. https://t.co/FxlzRi1BEU \u2014 Chris Nowinski, Ph.D. (@ChrisNowinski1) September 13, 2019\n\nIs CTE \u2018fixable\u2019?\n\nAs the leading expert in concussions and CTE said twice, no. Concussions are fixable in the short-term in that typically after time the immediate symptoms, such as light sensitivity, go away. But CTE is caused by repetitive head trauma and over time it results in memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, suicidality, parkinsonism, and eventually progressive dementia. As well as former NFL and college players, it has been found in athletes who last played in high school and in the brains of war veterans.\n\nThere\u2019s also no way of knowing at the moment if Gronkowski has CTE, or will have it in the future. Repeated blows to the head cause a build up in the brain of the tau protein, and those changes can begin years or even decades after the last hit, according to the BU CTE Center. The only way to diagnose CTE is after death in a postmortem neuropathological analysis.\n\nResearch is ongoing. In April, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine focused on a BU researcher using PET scans to find a pattern of tau protein build-up in living former NFL players with symptoms. It found \u201csignificantly higher\u201d levels in them than in the control group.\n\n\u201cThis study increases significantly our understanding of CTE and gets us one step closer in diagnosing the disease earlier in life,\u201d study co-author Yorghos Tripodis told the BU School of Public Health. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to design treatments for CTE, but we are not currently there yet.\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, former U.S. women\u2019s national team soccer players pledged their brains to research to launch a landmark study. CTE has not been studied in women\u2019s soccer players until now.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Rob Gronkowski went back and forth with the country's expert in concussions and CTE.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ay5UNgRgIoG4xw.Re2_GkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTcuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aOfMZfyejfovyywMKrwtng--~B/aD0xNjA5O3c9MjI5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/7bc76620-c8d7-11e9-affb-31cc6909ebe5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
