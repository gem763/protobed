REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nMedia companies count on ticket sales in China, which is projected to become the world\u2019s largest movie market next year, to bolster their bottom lines. And some films, such as recent Oscar winner \u201cGreen Book,\u201d rely on Chinese investment to make it to the big screen.\n\nThat, along with China\u2019s limit of 34 imported movies per year, has forced movie and TV studios to shape programming in a way that satisfies Chinese censors without suppressing the creative freedom of producers and writers.\n\n\u201cThey have tried to do it in such a way that they can make as much money as possible by having access to the China market, but not become so embarrassed by the backlash at home,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe creators of irreverent comedy \u201cSouth Park\u201d took aim at that approach, as well as China\u2019s policies on free speech, in an episode released on Oct. 2 called \u201cBand in China.\u201d \u201cSouth Park\u201d episodes were subsequently pulled from Chinese streaming sites.\n\nThe show disappeared around the time China said it would not broadcast U.S. National Basketball Association games following a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive who backed protests in Hong Kong.\n\nNeither reaction should surprise anyone in Hollywood, said Lindsay Conner, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who has represented Chinese companies in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018South Park\u2019 episode was about as deliberate a provocation as one can get,\u201d Conner said. \u201cIt\u2019s what \u2018South Park\u2019 is about. The response of the Chinese censors was entirely predictable.\u201d\n\nPOOH AND XI\n\nChina has banned Western entertainment in the past. In August 2018, the country denied entry to Walt Disney Co\u2019s \u201cChristopher Robin\u201d film, which featured Winnie the Pooh. The government did not give a reason, but Pooh\u2019s appearance has been compared to President Xi Jinping\u2019s, and the character has been used as a symbol of resistance to the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cSouth Park\u201d was running on streaming TV services in China, a market that is less important to Hollywood than the movie business. Movie ticket sales in China reached $9 billion in 2018. Consulting firm PwC projects China will top the United States and Canada as the biggest film market in 2020 with sales reaching $15.5 billion by 2023.\n\nChinese companies also invest an unknown sum in individual movies such as \u201cGreen Book,\u201d which was backed by Alibaba Group\u2019s Alibaba Pictures. Tencent Holdings Ltd, a Chinese social media and gaming firm, is a co-financier of the upcoming \u201cTerminator: Dark Fate,\u201d which will be released by Paramount Pictures. Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc, the same company that distributes \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\n\nEager to get a greenlight from Chinese censors, Hollywood studios take steps to avoid irking the government.\n\nA script for 2015 sci-fi comedy \u201cPixels,\u201d for example, featured a scene where space aliens blew up China\u2019s Great Wall, but the movie released in theaters spared the landmark.\n\nFilmmakers also have recorded scenes in China and added plotlines where Chinese characters are heroes. In the 2015 film \u201cThe Martian,\u201d China\u2019s space agency helps save a astronaut, played by Matt Damon, who becomes stranded on Mars.\n\nWhile Hollywood has long tailored programming to the Chinese market, the NBA incident highlights a relatively new risk. With the prevalence of social media, stars of a film could make comments that offend the government, said Marc Ganis, president of Jiaflix, a company that streams movies in China.\n\n\u201cI assure you the studios are paying attention,\u201d Ganis said.\n\n\u201cThey are also in a no-win position,\u201d Ganis added. \u201cThey can\u2019t tell their talent not to say things because they will get tarred for that. They have to hope their talent thinks before they tweet.\u201d", "description": "China's removal of animated comedy \"South Park\" from online sites just as it dropped U.S. basketball broadcasts highlighted a tension familiar to Hollywood studios - the need to please Chinese authorities in order to reach the country's vast audience.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439212008&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990QT", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
