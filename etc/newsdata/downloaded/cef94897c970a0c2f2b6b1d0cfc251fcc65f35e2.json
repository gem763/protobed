The Russian authorities first investigated the disappearance as a possible murder but then became convinced that Smolenkov was still alive and living abroad.\n\nOn Monday night, the New York Times and Washington Post confirmed a CNN report that a US agent inside the Kremlin had been spirited out to the US after concerns about his safety, but they did not name the spy.\n\nThe US reports said that the agent had worked for US intelligence for more than a decade and reached a senior level with access to Putin himself. According to CNN, he had even provided pictures of documents on Putin\u2019s desk.\n\nBut there were different versions of the motivation for the emergency \u201cexfiltration\u201d. One source told CNN that the decision was driven partly by Donald Trump\u2019s divulging classified information to Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, in an Oval Office meeting on 10 May 2017, a month before the exfiltration.\n\nTrump had fired the FBI director, James Comey, the previous day at a time when the bureau was the midst of an investigation into Russian interference in the 2106 presidential election.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post, however, quoted sources as saying that the agent was persuaded to leave Russia amid increased scrutiny by Kremlin officials after US intelligence agencies revealed what they knew about Russian election interference, and in particular, Putin\u2019s role in it.\n\nPeskov dismissed the US reporting as \u201cpulp fiction\u201d.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman said he could not confirm that Smolenkov was the longtime American agent referred into in the US reports. Speaking on Tuesday, Peskov said Smolenkov had no \u201ccontacts\u201d with Putin, and was removed from his government post in 2016 or 2017.\n\n\u201cSmolenkov worked for the presidential executive office but he was discharged in line with an internal directive several years ago,\u201d Peskov said in Moscow. \u201cI do not know whether he was an agent or not. The only thing I can tell you there was such an employee in the administration. He was dismissed.\u201d\n\nPeskov also downplayed the accounts of an extraordinary operation in 2017 to exfiltrate the US asset from Moscow.\n\n\u201cAll this discussion by American media about who was urgently evacuated, who was saved from whom and so on are in the genre of pulp fiction,\u201d said Peskov. \u201cSo let\u2019s leave it up to them.\u201d\n\nPeskov refused to be drawn on Smolenkov\u2019s current whereabouts. \u201cWe are not engaged in tracing people. I can only say in this case that there really was such an employee of the administration, and that he was fired several years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nSmolenkov is reported to have worked at the US embassy in Washington under the ambassador Yuri Ushakov. He then followed the ambassador back to Moscow in 2008, when Ushakov was appointed Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser. Putin served as prime minister from 2008 until 2012, when he returned to the Kremlin for a third presidential term.\n\nKommersant, a Russian business daily, cited former colleagues as saying that, contrary to Peskov\u2019s denials, Smolenkov did have direct access to Putin. \u201cThis is serious,\u201d an unnamed official said. Another said that it was unlikely Smolenkov had sight of secret material of value to the US intelligence services.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the CIA first tried in late 2016 to extract the source from Moscow. The informant at first refused, citing family concerns \u2013 prompting doubts about his trustworthiness, and unhappiness inside CIA headquarters. The source finally agreed to flee months later, as the story of Russia\u2019s clandestine support for Trump dominated the headline, the paper said.\n\nSmolenkov vanished on 14 June 2017, from his family home in Kargopolskaya Street, in a northern suburb of Moscow, Russian media reported. He flew with his wife Antonina, a civil servant, and their children \u2013 girls aged two and seven, and a 13-year-old son \u2013 to Montenegro. The family did not return and switched off their social media accounts.\n\nWith Smolenkov nowhere to be found, in September 2017 Russian authorities opened a criminal investigation into his suspected murder. Russia\u2019s FSB spy agency eventually dropped the case after concluding that the missing government official was still alive, the Daily Storm reported.\n\nThe source appears to have settled in the US, in a comfortable house on the outskirts of Washington. In June 2018 the Washington Post\u2019s real estate section listed the purchase of a six-bedroom home in Stafford, Virginia, by Antonina Smolenkov and one Oleg \u201cSmokenkov\u201d. The property cost $925,000. The difference in spellings appears to be a mistake.\n\nCNN reported that the difficult decision to remove the US\u2019s Moscow mole was made after President Trump divulged top secret information in May 2017 to Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s veteran foreign minister.\n\nThe White House has rubbished such claims. On Tuesday, Mike Pompeo \u2013 the US secretary of state and former CIA head \u2013 said: \u201cSuffice it to say that the reporting there is factually wrong,\u201d without specifying exactly what he was disputing.\n\nThe source\u2019s removal would have dealt a significant blow to the US\u2019s ability to understand top-level Kremlin decision making. The Russian government \u2013 largely made up of former KGB officers, now in their mid-60s \u2013 is paranoid about western spies.\n\nFormer diplomats say the chaotic nature of Russia in the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin made it a fertile time for recruiting Russian assets. One of those hired by MI6 during this period was Sergei Skripal, who the British say was targeted for murder by two Russian assasins.", "description": "Oleg Smolenkov hadn\u2019t been seen after he went on holiday in 2017, but Russian authorities concluded he had fled abroad", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts", "Julian Borger", "Luke Harding"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18247e48156f0370ddab78042013190340e206f2/0_5_4009_2406/master/4009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22fa0c802467903322c18c0b9bdf5d03", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
