He had no police record but was investigated for domestic violence in 2009.\n\nSources said he had worked in a section of the police service dedicated to collecting information on jihadist radicalisation.\n\nHarpon held a high-level \u201cdefence secrets\u201d security clearance, which authorised him to handle sensitive information of national defence importance and would have subjected him to regular, stringent security checks.\n\n\u2018No nervousness\u2019\n\nOn the morning of his \u201cextremely violent\u201d attack, Harpon bought two knives \u2014 a 33-centimetre long kitchen knife and an oyster knife \u2014 which he kept hidden, Ricard said.\n\nHe showed \u201cabsolutely no signs of nervousness\u201d as he circled back to police headquarters, according to CCTV footage examined by police, the prosecutor said.\n\nThe attack, from his return to the office, the killings and his death by police bullets, lasted seven minutes, Ricard said.\n\nHe first killed a 50-year old police major and a 38-year old guard who worked in the same office as Harpon and were having lunch at their desks.\n\nHe then went to another office on the same floor where he killed a 37-year old administrative worker.\n\nHaving failed to enter another office, which was locked, he went down into the courtyard where he stabbed a 39-year old policewoman who later died of her wounds.\n\nHe then injured two other people, before the trainee policeman killed him with two shots.\n\nShortly before the attack he had exchanged 33 text messages with his wife.\n\nThe messages exclusively concerned religion, and the attacker ended the conversation with \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (\u201cGod is greatest\u201d) and told her to \u201cfollow our beloved prophet Mohammed and meditate on the Koran\u201d, according to the prosecutor.\n\nShe was being held by police on Saturday.\n\nHarpon, who supported the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015, had changed his attire in recent months, shunning \u201call Western clothes in favour of traditional garments to visit the mosque\u201d, Ricard added.\n\nHe also wished to no longer \u201chave certain kinds of contact with women\u201d.\n\n\u2018Storm coming\u2019\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who has described the attack as a \u201cveritable tragedy\u201d, will lead tributes to the victims on Tuesday, the Elysee announced on Saturday.\n\nSources at the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said on Friday the case had been passed to the anti-terrorist prosecutor\u2019s office (PNAT).\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s news conference by the anti-terror prosecutor, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner came under pressure from political opponents who demanded his resignation.\n\nThey also called for an inquiry into how Harpon could have failed to attract the attention of security services in the run-up to the attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to explain how he kept below the radar\u201d of anti-terror units, said one police source. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d the source said.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe meanwhile expressed his \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Castaner.\n\nBut in an interview with weekly JDD to be published Sunday, he also said that procedures for the detection of signs that anti-terror agents may themselves have been radicalised would be probed.\n\nParis\u2019s top policeman Didier Lallement said there was no reason to question security arrangements in police headquarters.\n\nFrench police have been a recurring target of jihadist groups, such as Islamic State, behind a wave of attacks since 2015 \u2014 from large synchronised assaults to isolated knife and gun attacks.\n\nIn June, a parliamentary report on radicalisation within the public services spoke of 30 suspected cases out of the 150,000 police officers and 130,000 gendarmes in France.\n\n(AFP)", "description": "(AFP) -- A staffer at Paris police headquarters who stabbed four colleagues to death in a frenzied attack adhered to \"a radical vision of Islam\", an anti-terror prosecutor said Saturday, amid a gathering political storm over security safeguards.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/paris-police-2-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
