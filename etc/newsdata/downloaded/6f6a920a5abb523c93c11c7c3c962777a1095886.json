If I look at Uber's growth over the next 10 years, it's... going to be defined by India, Africa and the Middle East, more so than the developed markets.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi brushed aside fears the stock price could fall further after the expiration of a lock-up period in November, after which company employees and early investors can sell their shares.\n\nThe chief executive, who was in Delhi to unveil an updated version of Uber's app linking the Delhi Metro public transport system with its services, said he was focused on long-term prospects.\n\nThe revamped app is part of a global campaign to attract more users.\n\nWhile India is one of Uber's biggest markets -- with 12 percent of its global rides -- the firm still lags behind Ola in the nation of over 1.3 billion people.\n\nIt has also struggled to keep up with the two largest online food-delivery players Zomato and Swiggy.\n\nThe company laid off some staff in India as part of global job cuts as it tries to map a route to profitability.\n\nBut chief product officer Manik Gupta told AFP that Uber would double its technology team to 1,000 as proof of its commitment to Asia's third-largest economy.\n\n\"We definitely want to show our commitment to India,\" Gupta said.\n\nUber's third-quarter results will be released in two weeks.", "description": "The head of Uber said Tuesday that the global ride services firm was counting on India, Africa and the Middle East for future growth amid investor fears about mounting losses and a slump in its share price.
