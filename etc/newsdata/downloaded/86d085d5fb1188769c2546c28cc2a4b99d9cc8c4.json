Already taking after dad.'\n\nReady for her babies: The former Olympic ski racer's wife Morgan Beck, 32, shared the picture of her growing baby bump on Instagram, writing that she is carrying 'two rebels'\n\nGoing crazy: The bump update comes just two weeks after Morgan confessed she was 'going crazy' with her pregnancy when she was 36 weeks and two days along\n\nExciting!

The babies are due on November 11.\n\nIn the picture shared two weeks ago was also Morgan's phone case, which showed a picture of her daughter Emeline Grier who died by drowning tragically last year.\n\nThe couple announced they were pregnant with twins in August on both Instagram and when appearing on the Today show.\n\nIn August, Morgan described the babies as a 'miracle' pregnancy, one that she believed her daughter Emeline Grier had 'her hand' in.\n\n'From the day I met my husband, he has always said he wanted identical twin boys born on his birthday,' Morgan wrote on Instagram while sharing several images of her four children posing with balloons spelling out the word 'twins'.\n\n'We are due on the lucky day/angel number of 11/11 which is not far off from @millerbode birthday of 10/12. From the beginning of this pregnancy, we knew Emmy had her hands in this miracle somehow.'\n\nTragic: Emmy drowned in a neighbor's swimming pool in June last year when she was just 19 months old.

How could I love this baby the way I loved Emmy? Was it okay to love this baby the way I loved Emmy? It felt like by loving my son, I was trying to replace her.\n\n'The fear of birthing my son and what that meant .....a monumental step forward....proof that time continued without her when all I wanted was for time to stop. But let me say this....I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.'\n\nDevastating: The news of the couples new twins is bittersweet, though, as the couple continues to grieve the loss of their daughter\n\nShe continued: 'Easton provided us an even closer bond to his sister. The moment I heard his cry, something sparked back alive in my soul. Hope. Love. I\u2019m not sure.\n\n'But in that moment, I knew I was Mom and my kids deserved the world from me. Everything was going to be okay. My joy and grief could coexist. Now, I can actually say with joy and excitement that we are expecting identical twin boys.'\n\nBode and Morgan have three sons, six-year-old Samuel, four-year-old Nash, and 10-month-old Easton, and a daughter Neesyn, 11, from Bode's previous relationship.\n\nThe couple was attending a neighbor's party last June when their daughter, who was just 19 months old at the time, ended up in the pool.\n\nEmeline was rescued from the water but paramedics were unable to revive her, and she later died in hospital.\n\nSince losing her daughter, Morgan has become an advocate for water safety, regularly opening up about the tragic loss in an effort to prevent similar accidents happening for others.", "description": "The former Olympic ski racer's wife Morgan Beck, 32, shared the picture of her growing baby bump on Instagram Monday evening.", "authors": ["Danielle Zoellner For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20328270-0-image-a-8_1572357408181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
