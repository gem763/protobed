If he felt me being shot and killed was the best decision for me then I'm very much, 'Well that's the best decision for me and the show then.'\n\n'I love the show as much as I love Mercedes.\n\nThe husband: Sylver McQueen's (David Tag) motivation could be because Mercedes has been having an affair with Liam and she aborted a baby that could have potentially been his'\n\nThe secret keeper: Joel Dexter (Rory Douglas Speed) has a couple of motives: He finds Mercedes\u2019 confession she ran over Grace and he thinks she has also killed Harry'\n\n'So I wasn't worried. She must've had about seven lives, so surely we've still got a couple to play with?\n\n'Bryan was so excited about this story. Sometimes a big story can be condensed into a week so I wasn't sure what the extent of it would be, but when he said it's going to take up the whole of the autumn I was like, 'Oh right,' because I've not done that for a while.\n\n'I've done a week or two-week story, but to take up a good few months I was like, 'Get me stuck in.' '\n\nThe vengeful lawyer: James Nightingale's (Gregory Finnegan) motive for shooting Mercedes is that he blames her for everything bad that has happened to him and to his ex-boyfriend\n\nThe betrayed friend: Diane Hutchinson's (Alex Fletcher) motive for shooting Mercedes is because Mercedes let her step-son, Harry take the blame for running over Grace\n\nMercedes will be shot in The Loft, and there are seven potential suspects: Grace Black (Tamara Wall), who she recently ran over, her husband Sylver McQueen (David Tag), lover Liam Donovan (Jude Monk McGowan), serial killer Breda McQueen (Moya Brady), secret keeper Joel Dexter (Rory Douglas-Speed), pal Diane Hutchinson (Alex Fletcher), and angry lawyer James Nightingale (Gregory Finnegan).\n\nJennifer admits it was 'about time' Mercedes got her comeuppance after running over Grace, and having an affair with Liam, and she is 'really proud' of the plot.\n\nShe added: 'I thought it was about time - the girl needed some comeuppance.\n\n'Too much has gone on this year so it needed to come to an abrupt end, and a whodunnit is perfect.\n\nThe curious cousin: Goldie McQueen (Chelsea Healey) is trying to keep all of the family together, hoping that Mercedes is OK and she wants to get the bottom of who shot her\n\nThe Frenemy: Grace Black (Tamara Wall) has just found out that it was Mercedes who ran her over and put her in a wheelchair, so she wants to get her revenge\n\n'For me, personally, I've never been prouder of work I've done so much.\n\n'I'm really proud, watching all the guys do their thing. I think it's a great collaboration of amazing actors and it's worth the watch.\n\n'I hope the fans will join in with it in a 'she deserves it, but she's bloody brilliant' type way.\n\n'Because that's how I feel about her, but I'm a little bit biased.'\n\nThe Lover: Liam (Jude Monk McGowan) has had a very off and on intense relationship for the last 6 \u2013 7 months and Mercedes has very definitely decided that it\u2019s over\n\nWhen Jennifer was told about the whodunnit she immediately thought of Liam as the number one suspect.\n\nAsked who came to mind first as the potential aggressor, she added: 'Probably Liam, just because he's a baddie. He's probably got a gun or 10 at home.\n\n'He would just do it anyway.\n\n'She has done a lot wrong to Sylver, but I just don't think he's capable. He's softer.'", "description": "Jennifer Metcalfe put on a sizzling display as she slipped into a red silk gown for a foreboding photoshoot with all seven suspects for her 'Who Shot Mercedes?' storyline on Hollyoaks.", "authors": ["Connie Rusk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20331656-0-image-a-38_1572361585312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
