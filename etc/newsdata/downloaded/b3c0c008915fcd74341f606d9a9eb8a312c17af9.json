Carter said that in his view Trump lost the 2016 election and was put in office by the Russians. Asked if he considered Trump to be illegitimate, Carter said, \u201cBased on what I just said, which I can\u2019t retract.\u201d\n\nThe investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election \u201cin sweeping and systematic fashion\u201d with the goal of helping Trump and harming Clinton. But the report drew no conclusion about whether the interference changed the result, and did not establish a criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign.\n\nClinton compared her election loss to \u201capplying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado. And so I know that he knows that this wasn\u2019t on the level. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever know what happened.\u201d\n\nClinton, who was joined by her daughter, Chelsea, for the interview to promote their new book about women in history, also discussed her support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump. She said there are \u201ca number of grounds\u201d for it but that the latest news about his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son, is \u201cincredibly troubling.\u201d\n\nShe compared Trump\u2019s latest effort to spread negative stories about Biden, who is leading in most polls to be the 2020 Democratic nominee, to what he did to her during their campaign.\n\n\u201cThe most outrageously false things were said about me,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, enough people believed them. So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden. And I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re for the [Democrats] or you\u2019re a Republican, when the president of the United States, who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nClinton also predicted Trump would lose in 2020 because \u201cthere were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again.\u201d\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report.", "description": "Clinton compared her 2016 election loss to \u201capplying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado.\u201d", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EpKQz3hZ1xqVn61reSdpG9L8Htw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B42KM3XAUQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
