The city intends to charge Waste Management for those extra costs, meaning the company's final bill could be even larger.\n\nStill, the general consensus at city hall is that Waste Management had been a solid partner until this past spring.\n\n\"We're not dealing with a negligent company here, we're dealing with a company that has had a great relationship with the City of Ottawa,\" said Coun. Scott Moffatt, who noted Waste Management is not denying any of the problems and is now trying to fix them.\n\nCoun. Allan Hubley, who represents the affected ward of Kanata South, wasn't so forgiving.\n\n\"We need to take a dive into what happened here,\" Hubley said.\n\nOn Monday, Waste Management assured the city that a fire that damaged a garbage truck at Carleton University would not further affect residential pickup.", "description": "Waste Management has been penalized more than $200,000 for failing to live up to its garbage collection contract in Ottawa's west end, city councillors on the environment committee heard Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5208327.1562863041!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/garbage-kanata-delay.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
