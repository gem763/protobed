Osram was down 4.1%. Both were leading declines on the benchmark STOXX 600.\n\nLondon-listed shares of HSBC Holdings Plc fell 1% after a report over the weekend said the banking group was planning to cut up to 10,000 jobs to lower costs.\n\nInvestors will also be looking at developments around the crucial talks between London and Brussels this week on the Brexit withdrawal deal, with a looming make-or-break Brexit summit on Oct. 17 and 18, and the Britain's EU departure set for Oct. 31.
