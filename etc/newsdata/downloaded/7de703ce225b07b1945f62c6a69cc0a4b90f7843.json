They have two 35-year-olds in their starting rotation (Max Scherzer and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez), a 36-year-old on their bench (Howie Kendrick) and, at age 42, the sport\u2019s oldest active player in their bullpen (Fernando Rodney).\n\nThat seems fitting, because the Nationals play a version of the game straight out of another era\u2014and it has made them an unexpected championship contender.\n\nThe Nationals limped into Memorial Day weekend sitting at 19-31, shining a giant spotlight on the departure of superstar Bryce Harper and putting manager Dave Martinez in serious danger of losing his job. But since then they\u2019ve been nearly unstoppable, surging into the first National League wild-card spot by playing about as well as any team in the majors.\n\nThey\u2019ve accomplished this by specializing in so many of the elements of the game that seemingly had been lost to time. They steal bases. They bunt. They use the world \u201cbullpen\u201d only as a noun, not a verb. They\u2019re showing that, contrary to the product on display at most stadiums around the country in 2019, maybe there\u2019s more to baseball than home runs and strikeouts after all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen how the game has evolved, and eventually the game is going to have to come back to what it was,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nLed by Max Scherzer, Washington\u2019s starters have thrown more than 65% of the team\u2019s innings, the most in baseball.

They were fourth in steals, led by shortstop Trea Turner and outfielder V\u00edctor Robles. They were last in strikeouts and seventh in walks, resulting in the NL\u2019s best collective on-base percentage over that span. Their biggest slugger, quiet MVP candidate Anthony Rendon, strikes out in just 13.5% of his plate appearances. The league average is nearly 23%.\n\nIt has turned the Nationals into an offensive juggernaut that defies modern conventional wisdom. In a year where about 45% of all runs scored across the majors are via the home run\u2014an all-time record\u2014the Nationals are merely average at hitting the ball over the fence. They have enough power that it \u201cputs the fear of God in them a little bit,\u201d hitting coach Kevin Long said, but their output doesn\u2019t rely on the long ball, either.\n\n\u201cA runner on first base is a rally in the playoffs,\u201d 30-year-old outfielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cThe beauty of our team is that we can manufacture runs in different ways, not just with the home run.\u201d\n\nWashington Nationals relief pitcher Fernando Rodney, left, exits the bullpen cart.

The days of the starting rotation carrying a team have long passed by, gone the way of stirrups and wool flannel uniforms. Starters have handled less than 59% of the innings across the majors this season, the fewest in MLB history. \u201cBullpenning,\u201d the once-radical strategy of eschewing a traditional starter in favor of a parade of relievers, is now a widespread practice.\n\nNot with the Nationals. They lean on their starters not quite to the extent teams did decades ago, but certainly more than any other organization in 2019. Led by Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin, Washington\u2019s starters have thrown more than 65% of the team\u2019s innings, the most in baseball.\n\nThey have the arms for that. Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young award winner, had thrown over 200 innings in six straight seasons heading into 2019, the only pitcher in baseball who could say that. Strasburg, despite a checkered injury past, has stayed healthy this year and should top 200 innings for the first time since 2014. Corbin has made at least 30 starts for the third consecutive year.\n\nAll told, the Nationals\u2019 starters rank third in the majors in ERA, only behind the NL West-champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\n\u201cEvery team would like their starters to go seven every time,\u201d said Corbin, who left the Arizona Diamondbacks to sign a six-year, $140 million free-agent contract with Washington in December. \u201cA big reason why I came here was to be a part of this rotation.\u201d\n\nNationals shortstop Trea Turner steals second base.

But they know what\u2019s happening up Interstate 95: Though Harper has generally played well in his Philadelphia debut -- he entered Sunday with 31 homers and a career-high 102 RBIs -- the Phillies are on the fringes of the wild-card chase, while the Nationals continue to soar.\n\nOther players have helped replace Harper\u2019s production. Rendon, a free agent this winter, entered Sunday with a MLB-best 118 RBIs and leading the NL with a .331 batting average and 43 doubles. After his sensational rookie campaign as a teenager, 20-year-old Juan Soto has almost been as good as Harper ever was.\n\nHarper loomed large early on, when the Nationals\u2019 season was on the verge of collapse. Then they started winning\u2014and nobody asked about Harper anymore.\n\n\u201cIt was so bad and people had written us off that the pressure was off, and we were just like, \u2018Let\u2019s go play and see what we can do,\u2019\u201d closer Sean Doolittle said. \u201cWe started to play looser. We started to play better team baseball.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals have yet to fix their glaring flaw: The bullpen, which entered Sunday with a whopping 5.92 ERA, the worst in baseball. Their 28 blown saves were tied for the most in the majors. In the playoffs, the Nationals could avoid their struggling relievers by using their extra starting pitchers out of the bullpen, a model the Houston Astros perfected in their run to a championship in 2017.\n\nVictor Robles of the Washington Nationals lays down a sacrifice bunt.

They\u2019ve reached the postseason four times since 2012, only to lose in the first round in each of those seasons.\n\nThis time, they insist they\u2019ve already seen the benefits of fielding a veteran team: A younger group might not have recovered from their miserable start to the season, when their chances looked bleak.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going over any large body of water, and you hit some rough waters early on, some of the young guys want to turn back and give in or give up,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cBut if you have those guys on the boat who have made the trek before, they can say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to have clear skies ahead.\u2019\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts In an era dominated by home runs and strikeouts, can an old-school approach be effective in the postseason?\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "The Washington Nationals are showing that there\u2019s more to the sport than home runs and strikeouts.
