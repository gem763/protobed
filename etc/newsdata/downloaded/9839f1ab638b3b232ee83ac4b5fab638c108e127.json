Running the show gave her the opportunity to use connections she had made over the years as editorial director of Art & Auction and I.D. magazine, among other publications, but it also reflected a reality of the publishing world, and that is galleries were finding it made more economic sense to spend marketing dollars at an art fair rather than on a glossy magazine ad.\n\nFor Bokor, the transition felt like moving from \u201c1-D and suddenly living in the middle of 3-D,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I get to touch the stuff, not just the paper it\u2019s printed on\u2014that is an amazing opportunity for me.\u201d\n\nPenta spoke with Bokor as she was in the midst of planning the fair, which will be Nov. 14-18 at the Armory.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is\u2026 the San Polo sestieri [subdivision] of Venice. It\u2019s the area that starts right behind the Rialto Bridge. The first thing you see are the markets at the Rialto, but what I love is as you sort of wander through, it becomes much more about residential Venice\u2014the street life, the square life, of Venice. Sitting there with an espresso and a book, is probably close to my favorite thing in the world.\n\nWith Venice, you can never separate what\u2019s touristy from what\u2019s real because the city is about that. But I do think there\u2019s something about seeing people who live there shopping in the little squares, and then going home and making their lunch and the kids come out to play after that.\n\nThe one thing in my closet I can\u2019t live without is\u2026 the first Loro Piana cashmere shawl I ever got, which is now 25 years old. Of course, it\u2019s black. I lose things all the time, so the mere fact that I\u2019ve had it for 25 years is nothing short of extraordinary. And it\u2019s Loro Piana, so it\u2019s held up just incredibly well. And it goes everywhere because that\u2019s the thing you take on a plane if you\u2019re going to be freezing and, so it\u2019s as well-traveled as I am.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by\u2026 we\u2019re talking about something entirely inaccessible, and the top of my wishlist would absolutely be a painting by Edward Hopper. What he captured was a kind of isolation, of course, and the solo experience of mankind, whether it was in a diner or Chinese restaurant. These are social lives that we live. I\u2019m always out and about and seeing things, and that\u2019s wonderful, but at the base of everything, there is an aloneness that we all have to face. To me, nobody ever captured that more brilliantly than he.\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 Jill Lepore\u2019s These Truths: A History of the United States. That book would have been timely no matter what. But given that it came out in late 2018, it made [me] think about some of our freedoms\u2014how we got them and how they may be being usurped.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is\u2026 Scrabble. I\u2019m never not playing Scrabble. Since I was 6. My actual academic work was in linguistics, so words, to me, are everything. The challenge of it is amazing. I love the words. I like winning, I don\u2019t much like losing. People may think I\u2019m texting something erudite, but most of the time I\u2019m playing Scrabble.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again\u2026 Earlier this year, over the spring Equinox, I went with my son to Kiruna, Sweden, the home of the Icehotel. The Icehotel is a couple hundred miles into the Arctic circle and it is extraordinary. All but one structure lasts only for a year, and it is done mostly by artists. Everything there is ice, the chandeliers are ice, the bedrooms are absolutely ice. You sleep on reindeer skins in basically a military jumpsuit. It\u2019s a bit touristy, but you still get to see the world in a very different way. Every morning they post the probability of seeing the Northern Lights. And by the Equinox, [the probability is] very low. However, on our last night there, we walked out to green flashes across the sky and the Northern Lights were on full display. Even as I tell you this, it gives me goosebumps because that literally could be a once in a lifetime thing.\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is\u2026 I\u2019m about to renovate our old townhouse, a 1901 limestone. We lived in it for about 20 years. This will be one of the great challenges of my life. It\u2019s a gut renovation, and a certain amount of restoration. I want to keep the architecture. This is a careful-what-you-wish for project. It\u2019s 8,900 square feet, and it has a huge garden.\n\nIf I could have a drink with anybody, anywhere, it would be\u2026 Aaron Sorkin, at a place of his choosing, here in New York. To me, words are everything. His use of words has affected many people, many ways. I love that he has that originality and he took on To Kill a Mockingbird. I would love to have that conversation with him and it would be about words.", "description": "San Polo in Venice, Edward Hopper, Scrabble, and the Northern Lights from the Icehotel in the Arctic Circle", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-122270/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
