In mid-September, a group of global coffee companies announced their plans to launch a blockchain platform for the supply chain of coffee using an IBM-developed app by early 2020.\n\nIn late August, Thailand\u2019s Customs Department revealed it will be using IBM\u2019s Tradelens blockchain solution to track shipping in Thai ports.", "description": "Following Red Hat\u2019s $34 billion acquisition in July, IBM is using the firm\u2019s technology in a new blockchain-based supply chain product", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wMjQ2NmIzNGMwYzIyOGQ1YTI3YTJlZGY5ZTEyYWM4YS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
