More importantly he trusts young players, has encouraged an eye-pleasing and pacey style and has acted with dignity in victory and defeat. He has made England likeable again.\n\nA man many said was \u201ctoo nice\u201d to be a success has become the most popular England manager since Terry Venables guided the national team to the semi-finals of Euro 1996 on home soil.\n\nEngland have scored 19 goals in four Euro 2020 qualifiers and face the Czech Republic on Friday and Bulgaria three days later when few would expect anything other than two more emphatic wins to virtually assure their place in the finals.\n\nA run to the World Cup semi-finals was a welcome over-achievement but the buzz that engendered has been sustained and England\u2019s fans are fully switched back on to the national team.\n\nNATIONAL PRIDE\n\nWhere once it attracted derision and scorn, Southgate\u2019s side has become a source of pride.\n\n\u201cThe fact the team have connected back with our fans is the most pleasing aspect of the last few years,\u201d he said as he prepared his players at St. George\u2019s Park.\n\n\u201cIt was important to me that we played with a style that our supporters enjoy watching. We knew there were some good young players coming through, which we\u2019ve blooded and we\u2019ve been ranked fourth or fifth in the world for the last 12 months because of consistently good performances.\u201d\n\nUnder Southgate the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jadon Sancho and Declan Rice have all been fast-tracked into the first team, while Chelsea\u2019s Mason Mount made his full debut against Bulgaria last month and team mate Tammy Abraham is in line to earn his first senior cap after being called up.\n\nWith the climax of next year\u2019s tournament being staged in England there is genuine belief that Southgate\u2019s men can surpass their performance in Russia last year, but the manager knows that there could still be bumps in the road.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a much bigger emphasis on youth so there\u2019s still a lot for us to do,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cThe challenges never stop. Every month we go back through the games we\u2019ve played and review what could be better and the areas we can improve on to be considered the best team in the world. There\u2019s a lot of work to do in that regard.\n\n\u201cBut we feel we\u2019re still improving. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any regression, we\u2019ve got to make sure we continue that.\u201d", "description": "It is three years to the day that Gareth Southgate took charge of his first England game and few of the 81,000 crowd who watched his side labour to a 2-0 win over Malta at Wembley would have staked too much on him enjoying a long reign.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438452771&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970WF-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
