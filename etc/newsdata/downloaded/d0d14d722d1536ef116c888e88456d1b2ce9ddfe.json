Quite how you do that is a matter of parliamentary procedure and I just don\u2019t know quite what the answer is meantime.\n\nHope, who was deputy president of the supreme court until his retirement as a judge in 2013, said he expected a speedy decision by the nine judges hearing the supreme court case.\n\nThree days are set aside but I rather doubt it will take three days. And I\u2019m sure they will issue a judgement as soon as they possibly can, maybe for reasons given later because like everybody else, they understand the urgency of this. And it really would be a nonsense if they didn\u2019t issue a decision until parliament resumes on 14 October. So they\u2019ll certainly lean over backwards to get a decision out as soon as they possibly can.\n\nIt was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d for Downing Street sources and government ministers to suggest the Scottish judges were politically biased.", "description": "Rolling coverage of the day\u2019s political developments as they happen", "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow", "Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456baffc4d17d11a5722c097d439c2ac7291c8c6/0_142_4675_2804/master/4675.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22e7812bb2411076f21ff0a505aaecc8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
