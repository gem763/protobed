And border watchers say it\u2019s largely because of an agreement Trump struck with Mexico in June. Mexican authorities, backed by the newly formed National Guard, are now cracking down on migrants traversing Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala, monitoring river crossings and stopping buses carrying migrants from Central America through Mexico. At the same time, the U.S. is making tens of thousands of asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their applications are considered.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe decline in border traffic \u2014 if sustained \u2014 could amount to a major victory for Trump as he heads into the 2020 election. Perhaps more important, the experimental measures taken by his administration could reshape immigration enforcement for years to come.\n\n\u201cI think that they are getting exactly what they said they would get, by forcing the hand of Mexico,\u201d said Oscar Chac\u00f3n, executive director of Chicago-based pro-migrant group Alianza Americas. \u201cBut the question is, \u2018Is it sustainable?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Homeland Security Department did not respond to requests for comment. But Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Martha B\u00e1rcena told POLITICO that steps taken since June have produced meaningful results.\n\n\u201cPeople know that if they come into Mexico, they have to respect the Mexican law,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said. She added that migrants planning to seek asylum in the U.S. now understand that it\u2019s \u201cnot as easy as they were told it was going to be.\u201d\n\nTrump praised Mexico\u2019s actions to reduce the migrant flow in a tweet Saturday that quoted Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, saying Mexico was \u201cstepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do.\u201d\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

It will also push for increased aid to Central America and efforts to stop the flow of guns from the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nThe Mexico agreement followed threats from Trump to impose across-the-board escalating tariffs on Mexican goods that would likely have resulted in severe economic costs on both sides of the border. When the agreement was announced, it was widely interpreted as a fig leaf that would allow Trump to back down but wouldn\u2019t likely have much impact on migration.\n\nBut the deal's components appear to have contributed to the steep drop in border arrests, according to interviews with six former officials and advocates both for and against greater levels of immigration, as well as a POLITICO analysis of enforcement data.\n\nBorder arrests soared through the spring as Central American families trekked north in record numbers. The surge in arrivals overwhelmed U.S. border facilities and ignited a political battle over whether Democrats or Republicans shouldered the blame for the sudden influx, which peaked with 133,000 border arrests in May.\n\nThen arrests fell to 95,000 in June and 72,000 in July. The June and July drops fit a seasonal pattern in earlier years, but the August decline did not. Border arrests have typically increased in August during the past decade.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s base is likely to be pleased, advocates for immigrants say the drop in arrests could be bad for asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cWhat the numbers show is that the United States\u2019 threats and bullying of other countries have been effective in getting other countries to increase their enforcement efforts, but that the numbers don\u2019t reflect any real change in the situation of the Northern Triangle countries of Central America,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, a director for Mexico and migrant rights with the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy organization.\n\nImmigrants cross the Mexico-Guatemala border in rafts on October 20, 2018. | John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe deal with Mexico focuses on two main areas: heightened enforcement by Mexican authorities and the expansion of \u201cremain in Mexico,\u201d which is formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols.\n\nMexico\u2019s enforcement appears to have yielded quick results. Mexican immigration authorities arrested nearly 32,000 migrants in June, a three-fold increase over the same month a year earlier.\n\nAfter the deal, Mexico's National Guard established a visible presence along the southern border with Guatemala, including in Ciudad Hidalgo, a small city in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. The city is bounded to the east by the Suchiate River, a popular transit point for migrants arriving from Guatemala.\n\n\"They really have made it harder to cross where people were crossing before,\" said Andrew Selee, president of the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. He called Mexico's actions an \"all-out enforcement effort like we've never seen before.\"\n\nMexico pledged in June to devote 6,000 National Guard troops to counter-migration efforts. The country\u2019s government now says it has 15,000 troops at its northern border and 10,000 at its southern border, although those forces deal with a wider range of issues than immigration-related crimes.\n\nSelee, who visited the Mexico-Guatemala border in July, said the Mexican government has made it more difficult for migrants to travel in large groups.\n\nAs part of that effort, Mexican officials intensified enforcement in Tapachula, a city roughly 45 minutes north of Ciudad Hidalgo, according to Meyer.\n\n\u201cParticularly in the area around the Suchiate River at the Ciudad Hidalgo crossing, it seems like it is almost impossible to cross in a balsa boat as an undocumented migrant and not get detained by a National Guard agent,\u201d she said. \u201cLeaving the Tapachula area has also become more complicated given enforcement at different checkpoints in the highways around the city.\u201d\n\nMexican authorities have increased enforcement at highway checkpoints, according to experts tracking the issue. Specifically, they appear to have intercepted more migrants traveling in buses from Guatemala to the U.S.-Mexico border, a method of transport that increased migrant arrivals through the spring.\n\nTodd Bensman, a senior national security fellow with the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for lower levels of immigration, argues the crackdown on bus transit played a major role in cutting migrant traffic to the U.S. Bensman is based in Austin, Texas, and traveled to Mexico in August to interview migrants traveling northward.\n\n\u201cBefore, you had assembly lines of buses that would fill up down at the Guatemala-Mexico border at different places and drive them in caravans,\u201d Bensman said of the migrant transit route. \u201cThose big buses are now being interdicted at roadblocks and emptied out and turned around.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mexico has restricted access to entry permits that allowed large numbers of Central Americans to enter the country and potentially travel north.\n\nThe second main component to the June deal with Mexico was U.S. expansion of its \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy. At the time of the agreement, the program was operating in a pilot status and was limited to certain ports of entry and Border Patrol sectors. Since the expansion, the U.S. has sent approximately 42,000 non-Mexican migrants to Mexico to await their hearings, according to an official briefed on recent statistics.\n\n\u201cNow if they win or lose, they\u2019re in Mexico, where nobody really wants to be,\u201d said Bensam. \u201cThat\u2019s been a really psychologically effective policy, if the objective of the policy is to reduce the number of Central Americans coming in.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/3684/1155968404_6071991195001_6071990733001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nPro-migrant advocates contend the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program puts asylum seekers in danger and violates international treaties that protect certain people fleeing their home countries. A report released in July by the New York City-based Human Rights First found more than 110 \u201cpublicly reported cases of rape, kidnapping, sexual exploitation, assault, and other violent crimes\u201d against asylum seekers sent to Mexico through the program.\n\n\"Mexico doesn't have infrastructure to receive these people,\" said Astrid Dominguez, the director of the Border Rights Center at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas.\n\nMexico regards \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d as a unilateral move by the U.S. government, as opposed to something it agreed to. Still, the administration of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has cooperated, and accepted the return of non-Mexican migrants, ostensibly for humanitarian reasons.\n\n\u201cMexico says MPP was a unilateral decision. They can claim that, but they\u2019re facilitating it,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cThey\u2019re not opposing it.\u201d\n\nA San Francisco-based federal judge initially blocked \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d nationwide in an April order, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in May. The appeals court allowed the program to proceed on a temporary basis, which paved the way for the border-wide expansion under the agreement with Mexico.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has powered ahead with other moves to restrict access to asylum.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department in July issued a ban on asylum seekers who pass through another country en route to the U.S. The sweeping measure effectively closed off asylum to Central Americans and other migrants traveling through Mexico.\n\nA separate San Francisco-based judge halted the ban nationwide in July. However, the 9th Circuit later limited the scope of the injunction to its jurisdiction in California and Arizona, which allowed the ban to be implemented in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nThe \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy and third-country asylum ban are just two of many moves the Trump administration has made to restrict asylum and discourage illegal immigration.\n\nA regulation issued in August seeks to allow immigration authorities to detain migrant families together for indefinite periods of time. A federal judge\u2019s order related to the 1997Flores settlement agreement currently limits the detention of children with their parents to a maximum of 20 days.\n\nThe regulation will require court approval before it becomes effective, but could provide the Trump administration a powerful tool to discourage migration by Central American families.\n\n\u201cIf that survives legal challenge, then the family unit crisis will end permanently,\u201d said Bensman, the senior fellow with the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s deal with Mexico and other immigration moves may have reduced crossings in the near-term, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will be a lasting trend.\n\nAlan Bersin, a former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, concedes that the Trump administration\u2019s recent moves have driven down illegal crossings.\n\nStill, Bersin blames Trump\u2019s earlier misfires \u2014 such as separating thousands of migrant families last year under the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy \u2014 for squandering resources and exacerbating the migrant crisis in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re finally getting it right,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they're doing it in an unnecessarily cruel way and they should be held to account for having created the problem in the first place.\u201d", "description": "Border arrests are plummeting after Trump crackdown.", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/42/a1a7c55d4e64af8b3b890966206d/20190906-trump-looks-oval-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
