REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nThe MUFG Trade Club, to be introduced this month, will link MUFG clients into a broader network of 13 other banks including Spain\u2019s Santander and South Africa\u2019s Standard Bank, the official said, who declined to be identified, as the information has not been made public yet.\n\nThe move represents an acknowledgment by MUFG Bank that it hasn\u2019t met the needs of Japanese clients looking to expand into Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe where it does not have a strong presence or local partner, the official told Reuters this week.\n\nMUFG Bank is the lending arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, one of the world\u2019s largest banks by assets.\n\n\u201cThere are clients who want to sell their products such as cosmetics, accessories, and Japanese sake, into non-Asian countries,\u201d the official said.\n\nJapan\u2019s big banks have typically followed the lead of their large clients in moving abroad. MUFG has a presence in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including a wide network in Asia.\n\nIt has stakes in PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk, Thailand\u2019s Bank of Ayudhya Pcl, Security Bank Corp of the Philippines, and Vietnam-based VietinBank. The ties reflect Japan\u2019s status as a top exporter to those countries, accounting for $83 billion in exports in 2018, according to IMF trade data.\n\nBy contrast, Japanese companies and banks have lagged behind Chinese rivals in other emerging markets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Standard Bank, Africa\u2019s largest lender by assets, is 20% owned by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\n\nWhile the new service will be provided for free, MUFG is betting it will mean new business if clients need foreign exchange transactions or capital investment.\n\nIt aims to have at least 300 clients registered on the platform, the official said.", "description": "MUFG Bank Ltd plans to roll out an online platform to help clients find business partners in countries outside of Asia where it does not have a strong network, an official with Japan's largest lender said.", "authors": ["Takashi Umekawa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429028945&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0QP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
