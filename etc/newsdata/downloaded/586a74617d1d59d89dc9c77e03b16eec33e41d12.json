If you\u2019re the owner of a Google Pixel (ranging from the OG Pixel to the latest Pixel 3a or Pixel 3a XL variants), you can download and install the new version of the Android OS right now. For everyone else, you\u2019re in for a bit of a wait.\n\nAndroid 10 Has Landed! Here Are The Best New Features Google has finally unveiled the name of its upcoming Android update. While it was tentatively called Android Q and expected to be named after a sweet fruit or dessert, Google announced it was ditching its playful tone and giving it a much more standard tech name. While the news is no fun, it's just a name after all. The thing we're more interested in is its features. Here's what we know about it.

Thankfully, this is a pretty easy process:\n\nPull up Settings Tap on System Tap on Backup Tap the big blue \u201cBack up now\u201d button\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nThis should cover most of your device\u2019s essentials: app data, call history, contacts, device settings, and text messages. If you want to be thorough, you can also use a third-party app like Slight Backup to create a secondary, supplemental backup. If you\u2019re running root, you can also use Titanium Backup to preserve everything on your device, but that feels a bit overkill for a standard system update.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend firing up Google Photos, assuming you use that app/service, to make sure your device\u2019s images and videos are all synchronised to the cloud. Since it\u2019s free, there\u2019s no reason not to use Google\u2019s service to hold your media, especially if you\u2019re a Pixel owner and the company gives you unlimited storage for your full-resolution images and videos.\n\nFinally, if you use your device\u2014and only your device, or an Android authentication app\u2014to verify your login information for any important accounts, make sure you have backup codes for these accounts on standby. Should the update go south and you find yourself unable to access your phone, nor your authenticator app, you\u2019ll still be able to get into your accounts from another device and begin the somewhat-arduous process of setting up 2FA elsewhere.\n\nGive your device a quick speed test before installing Android 10\n\nThis step is optional, but I always enjoy seeing what a new operating system update does to my device\u2019s performance\u2014and if it hamstrings my device in any way, that\u2019s a good reason to consider a reset, some extra troubleshooting, or possibly a phone call or online chat with the manufacturer (once I\u2019ve checked to make sure my warranty is still active).\n\nGrab some benchmarking apps like GeekBench 5, AnTuTu, and GFXBench, and give them a run before you upgrade your device to Android 10. Once you\u2019re all ready to go in the new version of the operating system, run it again; the results should be pretty similar. If they\u2019re significantly worse after compared to before, you might have a problem.\n\nOf course, you can always browse your favourite Android forums to triple-check that other owners of your particular smartphone aren\u2019t encountering any bugs or issues when they leap to Android 10. If so, you might want to hold back on the update until any issues are addressed. That\u2019s especially true for any battery issues other users might encounter. If you\u2019re seeing reports that Android 10 kills your device\u2019s battery life (by something like 25 per cent, let\u2019s say), you also might want to wait on that update.\n\nHow to install Android 10\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to pull the trigger on Android 10, perform an over-the-air update by:\n\nPulling up Settings Tapping on System Tapping on Advanced Tapping on System Update Tapping on the big blue \u201cCheck for update\u201d button.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s how I did it on my Pixel 3a. Your steps might vary slightly for your specific Android device. Nevertheless, it\u2019s not very complicated to install an OS update, and you should be ready to go after a download, installation, and restart.
