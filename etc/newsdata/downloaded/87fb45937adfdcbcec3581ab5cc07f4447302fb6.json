The person was taken from the stadium on a stretcher.\n\nThe incident happened during the first half of Iowa State\u2019s 34-27 loss against Oklahoma State. The stadium was a 61,500 sellout.\n\n\u201cThe police chief is confirming a fall at the stadium,\u201d Angie Hunt, interim director of the Iowa State news service, told the Register on Sunday.\n\nWhen asked for more details, Hunt said: \u201cPolice aren\u2019t commenting beyond confirming someone fell, and that they\u2019re continuing to investigate.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by the Register about the incident, Iowa State University Police Chief Michael Newton declined to comment, saying \"it is currently an open investigation.\"\n\nThis is believed to be the first incident like this since Jack Trice Stadium opened in 1975.", "description": "An unidentified fan fell from Jack Trice Stadium's upper deck to the lower deck during Saturday's Iowa State-Oklahoma State football game", "authors": ["Randy Peterson", "Published P.M.
