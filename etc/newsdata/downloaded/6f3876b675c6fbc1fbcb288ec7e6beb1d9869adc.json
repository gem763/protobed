Clinton has said the decision to reopen the probe badly damaged her campaign.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appears on stage at the Women In The World Summit in New York, U.S, April 12, 2019.

Those 38 people were not identified. None of the emails at issue were marked as classified, according to the investigation.\n\nThe State Department found an additional 497 violations for which no individual was found responsible.\n\n\u201cWhile there were some instances of classified information being inappropriately introduced into an unclassified system in furtherance of expedience, by and large, the individuals interviewed were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations,\u201d the report said.", "description": "A U.S. State Department investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state has found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442728718&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0HA", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
