And although there are some signs of the party breaking with Trump, one important reason why we haven\u2019t seen GOP senators break with Trump en masse is because many are up for reelection \u2014 in total, there are 23 Republican-held seats up in 2020.\n\nAnd in five of these races, Republicans face particularly tough reelection battles. Election forecasters have rated these races as the most competitive Senate contests in the 2020 cycle, and in each race, the partisan lean of their states is less than 10 points more Republican than the country as a whole. In fact, in the case of Maine and Colorado, they actually lean slightly Democratic.1 These senators are especially vulnerable in a general election if Trump\u2019s standing declines, but they\u2019re also in a position where they can\u2019t afford to alienate their party\u2019s base.", "description": "", "authors": ["Geoffrey Skelley", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Primary-Challenges-Might-Keep-These-Republican-Senators-From-Voting-To-Remove-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
