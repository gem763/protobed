It helps a lot and he is a real role model for young players. If we could play every day he would be like this every day \u2013 that is how it is.\n\n\u201cThe team had a lack of experience and a lack of rhythm and the player with the most experience and rhythm was the best player tonight.\n\n\u201cWe were here to win the game, no other reason, so I am so happy we went through, that is cool.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the career spectrum, Elliott put in an accomplished display on his record-breaking Liverpool debut as he twice hit the crossbar.\n\n\u201c16 years old still and this kind of footballer, it is good for us,\u201d added Klopp.\n\n\u201c(He is) a brilliant boy, takes the situation really well, wants to learn and he will always be a special player in moments but his overall game that is really, really good.\n\n\u201cHe was a bit unlucky otherwise he would have scored, he is a good player but they are all good, we have no bad young players and that is why it is important we can give them these matches and try to continue like this.\u201d\n\nLiverpool\u2019s reward is a visit from Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal in the next round \u2013 the Gunners having already been turned over 3-1 in the Premier League meeting at Anfield earlier this season.\n\nMK Dons boss Paul Tisdale was pleased with the effort of his players, who saw several decent chances fall by the wayside \u2013 with Jordan Bowery\u2019s late shot off the post the closest the hosts came to a goal.\n\nAsked how he viewed the evening, Tisdale replied: \u201cOverall pretty good, I was proud of the way they played and I\u2019m disappointed for them that we didn\u2019t score a goal. Whether we deserved to score a goal or not I\u2019m not sure but they deserved a goal.\n\n\u201cThat is football. But I am really proud with the way we played, I regret not getting in at half-time 0-0, it was a position-based performance about keeping it tight.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0played the generation game at MK Dons with Jurgen Klopp praising the old and new as the Reds saw off their hosts to set up a Carabao Cup fourth-round clash against Arsenal.", "authors": ["Mark Mann-Bryans"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/07/liverpool-mk-dons.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
