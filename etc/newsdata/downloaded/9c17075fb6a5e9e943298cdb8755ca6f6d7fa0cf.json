Below is a column supporting president Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal. You can find a counterpoint here, where Blaise Misztal argues it is a mistake.\n\n\n\nOfficial Washington was rocked Sunday night by the Trump administration\u2019s announcement that it was pulling military forces from the Syria-Turkey border. Trump took to Twitter first thing Monday to explain, noting that \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\u201d He then added that \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\u201d\n\nWhile families of these troops likely said, \u201cThank God\u201d and careful observers saw that this was only a redeployment of a small number of forces rather than the withdrawal suggested by Trump\u2019s tweets, the foreign policy establishment went ballistic.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for example, tweeted: \u201cLet us be clear: The president has sided with authoritarian leaders of Turkey and Russia over our loyal allies and America\u2019s own interests. His decision is a sickening betrayal both of the Kurds and his oath of office.\u201d Not to be outdone, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham stated that: \u201cThis impulsive decision by the President has undone all the gains we\u2019ve made, [and] thrown the region into further chaos.\u201d Many other officials and think-tank scholars raged at Trump\u2019s move. (RELATED: Tucker Carlson Rebuts Washington Neo-Cons Agitated By Trump\u2019s Syria Withdraw)\n\nOf course, it would be easier for Americans to believe these folks if it weren\u2019t for the fact that, to use President Trump\u2019s words from the 2016 campaign trail, they have \u201cperfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.\u201d\n\nIn this case, even though it is a small redeployment, Trump is right to pull back those troops. As has been the case repeatedly since the end of the Cold War, the foreign policy elite is wrong. Indeed, we need to go further and withdraw all overt military forces from the country and rethink our entire approach to the Middle East.\n\nAnd the president seems to understand this. He tweeted recently that, \u201cGOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.\u201d While there are other historical foreign policy missteps that would rival our Middle Eastern blunders, Trump understands that what we\u2019ve been doing isn\u2019t working, noting in that same tweet that we have spent trillions in the region and \u201cThousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded.\u201d Of course, the establishment panics every time he wants to reduce ever so slightly America\u2019s military footprint abroad. But we need to go even further. We need to withdraw from not only Syria but Afghanistan as well. This minor pullback should only be the first step. Here is why a fuller withdrawal is in order:\n\nFirst, we are stuck in the middle of a multi-sided fight in which our interests are extremely limited. We went in to destroy ISIS\u2019s territorial caliphate that could provide a base of operations for this violent terrorist organization. We accomplished that goal, and we can safely leave it up to local actors who share our interests to keep ISIS down and out. Buckpassing to those with greater stakes in the outcome and better local knowledge about how to effectively handle threats is a time-honored tradition in international politics. If ISIS poses a threat to American interests in the future, our long-range strike capabilities are more than capable of keeping us safe without a permanent garrison in Syria.\n\nSecond, the Kurdish groups in Syria that we are protecting in the region aren\u2019t exactly ideal partners. Indeed, one has espoused a communist ideology, is an offshoot of a group on the U.S. State Department list of terrorist organizations, and has feuded with other Kurdish groups in Iraq that have also fought against ISIS.\n\nThird, one dangerous consequence of remaining in Syria is that we could end up in a fight with Iranian proxies or Russian forces that could drag the U.S. into a broader war that would be unnecessary and extremely costly. The fact is that both countries have long-standing ties to Syria and thus their footprint in the country is not new. They too have an interest in keeping ISIS down and it is to our advantage to have those countries tied up helping the Syrian government. A broken Syria is no gift to our adversaries.

Our national debt is a growing threat to our future prosperity and security. We\u2019d be wise to focus on it rather than a desolate corner of a ruined country half-way around the world that matters very little to our safety or prosperity. And as our new National Security Strategy emphasizes, great powers such as China should receive more of an attention than fourth-rate powers in the Middle East. Instead, we stay mired in the Middle East, an area of declining strategic importance. The Chinese must be laughing at us: we talk up the threat they pose but focus our attention on minor issues and are unable to extricate ourselves from unwise commitments. Again, Trump gets it instinctually, noting Monday night that: \u201cthe two countries that are most disappointed that we\u2019re leaving are China and Russia because they love that we\u2019re bogged down and just watching and spending tremendous amounts of money instead of continuing to build our forces.\u201d\n\nAnd lastly, this is good policy and good politics. Polling shows that our Middle East wars are not popular. And Trump himself understands he made a campaign promise that he\u2019d be unwise to violate: \u201cI fully understand both sides of it. But I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our \u2014 our soldiers home, and bring them home as rapidly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Syria pullback is a good first step. Let there be many more on the road out of the Middle East.\n\nWilliam Ruger is the Vice President for Research and Policy at the Charles Koch Institute.
