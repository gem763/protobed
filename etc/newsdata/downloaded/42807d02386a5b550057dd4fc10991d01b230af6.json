If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect the dollar to rise.\n\n\"The Fed is treading a fine line at the moment and there's no incentive to get off that and make a strong case one way or another on rates,\" said Neil Mellor, senior currency analyst at BNY Mellon in London.\n\n\"So if there's no equivocal view on Fed policy, there's no equivocal view for the dollar.\"\n\nRISK ASSETS\n\nOptimism that Washington and Beijing would finalise the first-stage of a trade deal next month had boosted risk assets in recent days, but markets have turned wary.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday an interim trade agreement between the United States and China might not be completed in time for signing on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Chile next month, but that does not mean negotiations are falling apart.\n\nThe Chinese yuan inched up marginally as investors awaited the outcome of the Fed meeting and more clarity on how Sino-U.S. trade talks are going.\n\nIn the spot market, offshore spot yuan was last changing hands at 7.0550 per dollar, 0.15% firmer on the day.\n\nSterling meanwhile drew support from hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided with focus now on the December snap election.\n\nThe British pound was last at $1.2891, a tad firmer on the day but below five-month highs above $1.30 hit earlier this month. It was also a fifth of a percent firmer against the euro at 86.20 pence.\n\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Tomo Uetake in TOKYO; Editing by Giles Elgood and Steve Orlofsky)", "description": "By Dhara RanasingheLONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The dollar was largely steady  against other major currencies on Wednesday as investors braced  for a rate cut...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
