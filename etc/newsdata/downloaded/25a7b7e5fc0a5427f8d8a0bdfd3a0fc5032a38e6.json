Mujtaba Azizi, 22, was killed in the Aug. 17 Islamic State bombing on a Kabul wedding hall. (Siobhan O\u2019Grady/The Washington Post)\n\nFatana Elyasi should have been shopping for her wedding dress.\n\nInstead, she was weeping over her fiance\u2019s grave in a cemetery close to her home in western Kabul. It was one of seven in a row her neighbors had dug for each member of her family killed at her cousin\u2019s wedding two nights before.\n\nMujtaba Azizi, 22, was among the 80 people killed when a suicide attacker detonated a powerful explosive inside a crowded wedding hall here on Aug. 17.\n\nThe bride and groom both survived but lost so many close family members that the groom, Mirwais Elmi, told a local television station he \u201cwill never see happiness in my life again.\u201d\n\nThe attack occurred just ahead of the ninth round of peace talks between U.S. and Taliban officials in Qatar, which ended with a draft agreement \u201cin principle.\u201d But it was the local Islamic State affiliate that claimed responsibility for the August bombing, a stark reminder that even as U.S. officials talk peace with one group, extremist violence perpetrated by militants other than the Taliban persists in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe will take revenge for every civilian drop of blood,\u201d President Ashraf Ghani said after the attack.\n\nThe wedding attack upended any remaining sense of security at social gatherings in the Afghan capital. For Fatana, it also reordered the trajectory of her life, implicating her entire extended family in a cycle of violence so unforgiving that she now can\u2019t see a way out.\n\nAt 18, she is as old as the war in Afghanistan, raised in the anxieties that have long permeated everyday life in Kabul, where bombings are commonplace. But until last month, celebrations in the capital city\u2019s colorful wedding halls were one of the few remaining places where she still felt safe.\n\nFor young couples like Fatana and Mujtaba, family weddings also offered a rare chance to spend time together in public.\n\nLike many engagements in Afghanistan, theirs was arranged by their parents. But the two quickly fell into what Fatana described as the \u201cpurest love,\u201d and their wedding was planned for mid-September.\n\n\n\nAmir Mohammad Azizi, 50, holds up a photo of his son, Mujtaba Azizi. (Siobhan O\u2019Grady/The Washington Post)\n\nHe was bright, kind and generous with his younger siblings. She trusted that between his gentle demeanor and steady work as a carpenter, she would be guaranteed a safe and comfortable life. Together, they dreamed of raising two children in the same Kabul neighborhood where they\u2019d grown up.\n\n\u201cI feel like this love I experienced with Mujtaba, no one else has experienced,\u201d Fatana said in an interview. \u201cFrom the day that we got engaged, I could feel that love in my whole body.\u201d\n\nSo when they were both invited to a cousin\u2019s wedding just weeks before their own, they jumped at the rare opportunity to see one another outside the confines of her parents\u2019 home.\n\nFatana recalled that Mujtaba visited her the morning before the ceremony and asked that she wear a gold dress that his family had recently bought her as a gift. She spent the afternoon applying makeup and curling her hair with her sister. Then the young women walked together to the venue, just a stone\u2019s throw from their family home.\n\nAfghan weddings are typically gender-segregated, and on that Saturday evening, dinner had just been served on the women\u2019s side when, on the other side of the partition, Fatana\u2019s older brother Omid noticed a man he didn\u2019t recognize walk in, he recalled later.\n\nThere were hundreds of people on the men\u2019s side. The band kept playing music. Boys and men still danced. But, Omid said, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was off.\n\nThe bride\u2019s teenage brother also became suspicious and trailed the man, who was dressed in white and carrying a computer bag, asking who he knew at the wedding, Omid said.\n\nThen there was a loud bang.\n\n\n\nA suicide bomb ripped through a wedding party on a busy Saturday night at a Dubai City hall in Kabul. (Rafiq Maqbool/AP)\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, everyone scattered. Fatana said she ran through the back kitchen and crossed the partition. The power was out, but she could still make out the carnage. Bodies and dismembered limbs were strewn everywhere she looked.\n\nShe found Mujtaba lying in the street. He was still breathing when she knelt by him and begged him to stay with her. Then the men around them picked him up and piled him into a car with others who had been wounded.\n\nFatana\u2019s father, Abdul Mohammad Elyasi, was one of the few men in their family who didn\u2019t attend the wedding that night. But when he heard the blast, he ran toward the venue to help carry bodies out of the hall.\n\nIn the chaos, he couldn\u2019t find his sons.\n\nThen his phone started ringing \u2014 each call carrying news that drove him further into grief. First he learned that one son was badly wounded, then gone. Then another son. Then nephews. A grandson. A future son-in-law.\n\n\u201cI felt thankful they were born and we raised them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then someone just walked in and killed them and so many others.\u201d\n\nOne at a time, their bodies returned to his modest house, seven in all. Farzam, 5 years old. Haroon, 40. Arash and Kamran, both 13. Abdul Naqib, 16. Abdul Qadeer, 18.\n\nAnd Mujtaba, 22.\n\n\u201cI felt ruined,\u201d Mujtaba\u2019s father, Amir Mohammad Azizi, said. \u201cEveryone liked him, and he liked everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdul Mohammad Elyasi, 55, and Ahmad Sahil, 12, hold a photo of three relatives killed in an Aug. 17 Islamic State bombing on a wedding hall in Kabul.

(Siobhan O'Grady/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than a year earlier, hundreds of friends and relatives had gathered at this same house to celebrate Fatana and Mujtaba\u2019s engagement. She wore a rose-gold dress with a bright pink scarf, Mujtaba a black suit with a matching pink tie.\n\nHer heart swelled when he slipped the ring onto her fourth finger, tying their fates together forever.\n\nNow, so many men were crowded around his body, she hardly had the chance to say goodbye.\n\nThe next day, as the men buried Mujtaba, Fatana\u2019s mind flooded with the promises he\u2019d made her when he was alive. \u201cI\u2019ll make a good life for you,\u201d he had said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\n\nA few nights later, she fell into a deep sleep and dreamed that he had returned. He sat beside her and they chatted closely like they used to when he visited during their long engagement.\n\nThen she jolted awake. It was dark, and Mujtaba was gone. Only her sisters were sleeping beside her.\n\nFariba Housaini contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Taliban tried to wipe out Afghanistan\u2019s film industry.
