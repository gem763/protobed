He\u2019s not scared of anybody. At the moment, he deserves huge credit.\u2019\n\nThe likes of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk have been nominated for the Ballon d\u2019Or but Chelsea hero Drogba also believes Mane deserves the accolade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked for his favourite to win the award, Drogba told Paris Match: \u2018Sadio Mane.\n\n\u2018For the AFCON, the Champions League, and the league championship. What he does in the Premier League, very few players are able to do it.\n\n\u2018It is possible, but it would have been possible [for others to win] well before. There are many players who have represented well the African continent, like Samuel Eto\u2019o.\n\nArsene Wenger believes the Reds star has done enough this year (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018What is a pity is that when we talk about African players, we talk about the continent, we do not speak of a country.\n\n\u2018We will never say \u2018Kylian Mbappe represents the European continent\u2019. It is a small shift [in mentality] that is present.\n\n\u2018But to return to the question, it would be really nice that Sadio, or even Salah and Aubameyang continue to raise their level of play to hope to win this trophy.\u2019", "description": "Didier Drogba has endorsed Arsene Wenger's view that Liverpool forward Sadio Mane should win the 2019 Ballon d'Or.
