Salvatore Di Nolfi/Pool via REUTERS\n\nAlexander Lavrentiev, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s envoy for Syria, was speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi during an official visit there by Putin.\n\nHe made his comments after Turkey ignored new sanctions from the United States to press on with its assault on northern Syria while the Russia-backed Syrian army entered one of the most hotly contested cities, filling a void created by Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt retreat.\n\nWhen asked if there had been an advance agreement between Russia and Turkey about Ankara\u2019s operation, Lavrentiev was cited as saying:\n\n\u201cNo. We had always urged Turkey to show restraint and always considered some kind of military operation on Syrian territory unacceptable.\u201d\n\nLavrentiev\u2019s comments, which suggest growing tensions between Turkey and Russian, came a day after the Kremlin complained that Turkey\u2019s incursion was \u201cnot exactly\u201d compatible with Syrian territorial integrity.\n\n\u201cThe security of the Turkish-Syrian border must be ensured by the deployment of Syrian government troops along its entire length,\u201d said Lavrentiev. \u201cThat\u2019s why we never spoke in favor or supported the idea of Turkish units (being deployed there) let alone the armed Syrian opposition.\u201d\n\nLavrentiev said Turkey\u2019s actions risked upsetting delicate religious sensitivities in northern Syria.\n\nIn particular, he said the area was populated by Kurds, Arabs and Sunnis who would not take kindly to their lands being resettled by people who had never lived there, a reference to Turkey\u2019s plan to house refugees from other parts of Syria there.\n\nLavrentiev confirmed that Russia had brokered an agreement between the Syrian government and Kurdish forces that saw the Kurds cede control of territory to Syrian troops.\n\nThose talks had taken place at Russia\u2019s Hmeimim air base in Syria among other places, he said.", "description": "The Kremlin's envoy for Syria on Tuesday called Turkey's military offensive in northeast Syria \"unacceptable\" and denied Ankara's operation had been cleared by Moscow in advance, Russian news agencies reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441092410&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0XX", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
