All together they number in the thousands.\n\n\"There are so many people who have the right to nominate a candidate that it's not very complicated to be nominated,\" the influential Committee secretary, Olav Njolstad, told AFP.\n\nIn 1935, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was proposed, ironically, by German and French academics mere months before his country invaded Ethiopia.\n\nAs one of the victors of World War II, Russian leader Joseph Stalin was nominated twice, in 1945 and 1948.\n\nOnce the deadline has passed and the nominations are in, only a handful are kept on a shortlist to be reviewed by the Committee and its advisors.\n\n\"Neither Hitler, Stalin nor Mussolini were seriously considered for the Peace Prize,\" historian Geir Lundestad, former secretary of the Committee, told AFP.\n\n\"What surprises me most is that many dictators around the world have refrained from getting themselves nominated.\"\n\nOver the last two decades the number of candidates has skyrocketed and today generally exceed 300, so it isn't too surprising that a few odd names show up.\n\n\"One or two\" nominations distinguished by their peculiarity show up \"at regular intervals\", according to Njolstad.\n\nThe list of candidates is kept confidential for at least 50 years, but a sponsor can publicly announce their pick.\n\nWhether a nomination is odd or not is of course a matter of perspective, but some proposals would certainly make most people do a double-take.\n\nIn 2001, the sport of football represented by the international football federation FIFA was nominated.\n\nThe Swedish lawmaker behind the nomination argued that sports had the \"ability to create positive international contacts\" and contribute to a \"more peaceful world\".\n\nThis wasn't even that novel of an idea, since Jules Rimet, who initiated the first World Cup, had also been nominated in 1956, noted journalist Antoine Jacob, author of \"History of the Nobel Prize\".\n\nPop icon Michael Jackson found himself in the running in 1998.\n\nEven though many of the child sex abuse allegations against the \"King of Pop\" had not surfaced at the time, the artist's message to \"Heal the World\" did not impress the Committee.\n\n\"The Romanian parliamentarians who proposed Michael Jackson considered this nomination to be very serious, but it was not considered by the Committee either,\" said Lundestad.\n\nBut in 2001 Lundestad also said it didn't seem impossible that famous musicians involved in causes, such as Bob Geldof, Bono or Sting could one day receive the award.\n\n\"Artists' names come in regularly, but it's a more recent trend,\" explained Njolstad.\n\nAmong this year's known nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, which will be awarded on October 11, are US President Donald Trump and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nHowever Lundestad insists that one shouldn't get too excited over just a nomination.\n\n\"It's pretty easy to be nominated,\" he said. \"It's much harder to win\".\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Eighty years ago on the brink of the bloodiest conflict in history, Adolf Hitler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, illustrating that literally anyone can be nominated.
