Any reading below 50 indicates worsening conditions.\n\nWall Street had expected a reading of 50.\n\nThe barometer averaged 47.3 in the third quarter, the lowest level since the U.S. exited recession in the middle of 2009.\n\nWhat happened: Production in the Chicago region sank to a 10-year low, but the decline was exaggerated by the strike at GM GM, -1.76%.\n\nEven if the strike is set aside, however, the report showed broad weakness. The backlog of orders and inventories also fell sharply.\n\nBig picture: Eroding business conditions in the Chicago region mirror the nationwide trend in manufacturing. A strong dollar, a slowing global economy and the festering trade dispute between the U.S. and China have curbed demand for goods made in America.\n\nWhat\u2019s kept the economy going is relatively stable if somewhat softer growth in the much larger service side of the U.S. economy: Recreation, health care, software, finance and so forth.\n\nAnalysts and investors are watching closely to see if the slump in manufacturing spreads more deeply into the broader economy\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.72% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.56% rose in Monday trades. The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.48% was little changed at 1.69%.", "description": "A measure of business conditions in the Chicago region contracted for the third time in four months, reflecting ongoing struggles by American manufacturers...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GY796_chicag_ZG_20181119202842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
