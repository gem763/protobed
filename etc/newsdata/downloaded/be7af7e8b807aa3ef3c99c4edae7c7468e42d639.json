The trade represented an $255,143 bullish bet.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nEven traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.\n\nMany of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.\n\nUnfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there\u2019s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively modest size of Tuesday\u2019s iQiyi option trade by institutional standards, it\u2019s unlikely to be institutional hedging.\n\nTrade War Fears Overblown?\n\nDespite a 33% drop in the past six months, the strike price of the calls purchased on Tuesday suggests more than 13.9% upside given their break-even price is $17.87.\n\nThe bullish trade is particularly noteworthy given the latest trade war headlines have been discouraging. On Tuesday, the U.S. expanded its trade blacklist of Chinese companies, and China\u2019s foreign ministry said Americans should \u201cstay tuned\u201d for their retaliation. Bloomberg also reported that the White House is looking into limiting how much U.S. government pension funds invest in Chinese stocks.\n\nBarring a surprise trade deal, the U.S. is set to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods from 25% to 30% starting Oct. 15.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nTuesday\u2019s iQiyi option trade is noteworthy given that the calls purchased don\u2019t expire until March 20, 2020. Prospects of a trade deal in the near-term appear dim given this week\u2019s news, but a lot of diplomatic progress can be made in five month\u2019s time, especially if the economies in China and the U.S. continue to suffer.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
