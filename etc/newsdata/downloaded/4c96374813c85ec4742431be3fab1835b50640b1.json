Over the next few days or weeks, he will almost certainly face the reality that much of the world \u2014 angry at his tweets, tirades, untruths and accusations \u2014 could be disinclined to believe the arguments advanced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others that Iran bears responsibility for the attack.\n\nIf Mr. Trump tries to gather a coalition to impose diplomatic penalties, tighten sanctions to further choke off Iranian oil exports or retaliate with a military or cyberstrike, he may discover that, like President George W. Bush heading into Iraq 16 years ago, he is largely alone.\n\nAlready, intelligence officials are hinting, in background conversations, that the evidence implicating Iran is just too delicate to make public. One theory gaining support among American officials is that the cruise missile and drone attack was launched from southwest Iran or in the waters nearby.", "description": "The president\u2019s tweets, tirades and untruths could undercut the credibility of whatever case he makes about responding to the attacks on Saudi oil fields.", "authors": ["David E.
