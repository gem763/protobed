If the fleece isn\u2019t cut off, it will continue to grow,\" the museum states. \"Based on the length of Chris\u2019s wool, it is estimated he had gone without shearing for at least five years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLittle Oak Sanctuary said that while Chris may have garnered attention for his heavy wool, the animal was \"so much more than this.\"\n\n\"We will remember him for all that he was - someone, not something - here with us, not for us,\" the group said, in part. \"RIP dear Chris.\"", "description": "A sheep in Australia who was discovered to have grown a record-breaking amount of wool has died, his \"heartbroken\" caretakers announced Tuesday.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
