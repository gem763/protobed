Shaw and Matic were absent as they too have travelled to Dubai to take part in warm-weather training.\n\nTuanzebe added to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's injury woes when he withdrew from the starting XI to face Liverpool at Old Trafford with a hip problem.\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\nBut there was some better news as Lingard took part following a hamstring problem, while Anthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were also involved after featuring at the weekend, as was Phil Jones after he made his return to the substitutes' bench.\n\nWith a number of players out, academy full-back Ethan Laird also took part in the session.\n\nTravelling United squad\n\nSergio Romero, Lee Grant, Matej Kovar; Phil Jones, Ethan Laird, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire, Marcos Rojo, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Brandon Williams; Fred, James Garner, Daniel James, Jesse Lingard, Scott McTominay, Juan Mata, Andreas Pereira; Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford.", "description": "Manchester United travel to Serbia ahead of Thursday's Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Eamonn", "James Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707160.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-ECE_14_MAN_UNITED_FLY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
