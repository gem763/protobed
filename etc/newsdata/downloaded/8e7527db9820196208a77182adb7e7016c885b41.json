This subpoena is part of the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump jeopardized national security during the call by pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival.\n\nChairman Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, Eliot Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee released a memo and draft subpoena on Wednesday. They previously requested unsuccessfully that the White House produce these documents in letters on September 9 and September 24.\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, the Committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 the Committees,\" the memo said.\n\nThe subpoena will be issued on Friday, October 4, if the White House does not comply before then.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Democrats of trying to \"bully\" and \"intimidate\" State Department officials by scheduling depositions about their involvement with President Trump's call with the Ukrainian president on short notice.\n\nPompeo confirmed Wednesday that he was on the call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president. That development prompted the chairmen of three committees to warn Pompeo he would be considered a \"fact witness\" and should play no role in dictating investigators' access to witnesses or documents.\n\n\"He should immediately cease intimidating Department witnesses in order to protect himself and the President,\" they said in a statement.", "description": "Mike Pompeo and three House committee chairs are also battling over depositions for State Department officials", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/93a717ee-2836-41ac-9218-509e9bee242d/thumbnail/1200x630/cbdfcde09c237ef317878397cbb87bd6/gettyimages-1171038690.jpg"}
