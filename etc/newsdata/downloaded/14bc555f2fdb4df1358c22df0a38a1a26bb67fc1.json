With the NFL investigating and considering whether to place Brown on paid administrative leave, the Patriots decided Friday to release the seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, 11 days and one game after signing him Sept. 9.\n\nThat decision came amid two sets of deliberations that made it appear inevitable Brown would be taken off the field soon, either by the NFL or the Patriots, in the view of some of those close to the case.\n\nThose people described a league investigation that was progressing, with consideration of the allegations by both women, toward the potential placement of Brown on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. The Patriots, meanwhile, dealt with the controversy and media questioning about the accusations and tried to figure out the right thing to do, in general terms, and what was best for the team.\n\nThe outcome is that the Patriots move on without Brown while he faces an uncertain NFL future, with the league signaling to any interested teams that he could be placed on paid leave via the exempt list if signed.\n\nBrewer: The NFL is complicit in Antonio Brown\u2019s self-sabotage\n\n\u201cWe were appreciative the NFL took this seriously and acted on it immediately,\u201d Lisa Banks, an attorney for one of the women accusing Brown, said by phone Friday evening. \u201cWe have every confidence that the league officials who spoke with Mr. Brown and/or his people made it clear to him he can\u2019t continue this kind of behavior.\u201d\n\nThe process that brought about the end of Brown\u2019s short tenure with the Patriots began on the evening of Sept. 10, the day after the team announced the one-year contact to which Brown had agreed Sept. 7. The deliberations by the league and team were described by several people familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the pending litigation and the ongoing NFL investigation.\n\nThat day, around 9 p.m., NFL representatives were in contact with an attorney for Britney Taylor, a former college classmate who later worked for Brown as a trainer. Taylor had just filed a lawsuit against Brown in Florida accusing him of rape and sexual assault. Taylor was willing to speak to the league\u2019s investigators but could not do so until six days later.\n\nBrown has not been charged with a crime and denied the allegations through his attorney, Darren Heitner, who said that Brown considered the lawsuit \u201ca money grab.\u201d NFL officials realized quickly as they launched their investigation that they would have to consider whether to place Brown on the exempt list, according to a person with knowledge of the case.\n\nAntonio Brown released by New England Patriots amid NFL investigation\n\nThe NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy empowers Commissioner Roger Goodell to use paid leave if a player is charged with a serious crime, such as sexual assault, or if he believes after an investigation that the policy may have been violated. Brown was not charged with a crime, but league officials considered the allegations alarming, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. They also knew the accusations were not substantiated and they took the approach of trying to find out whether the allegations were credible, in their view, and could be corroborated by evidence and by potential witnesses.\n\nThe NFL knew the process would take what one person called \u201ca little time,\u201d but league officials hoped to be in position to make a relatively quick decision on the exempt list. The league was not ready to act before last weekend, however, and Brown made his Patriots debut Sunday in Miami, catching a touchdown pass from Brady.\n\nNFL representatives met for 10 hours Monday with Taylor. Meanwhile, a second accuser emerged when Sports Illustrated published a report of a woman who had been hired by Brown to paint a mural in his home accusing him of inappropriate conduct when she ignored his unwanted sexual advance. According to the woman and her attorneys, the woman received a group text Wednesday that included a phone number she believed to be Brown\u2019s. The texts contained photos of the woman and her children and were considered intimidating by the woman.\n\nAround 6:30 p.m. Thursday, NFL officials received a letter from Banks and her client detailing Brown\u2019s text messages to the woman. NFL officials responded immediately, Banks said, and arranged a phone conversation for Friday morning.\n\nThe NFL \u201cclearly took this seriously,\u201d Banks said. By the time she and her client spoke Friday morning with the NFL, league officials had already reached out to the Patriots and Brown\u2019s representatives to instruct Brown to cease contact with the woman.\n\n\u201cHer goal all along, really, in getting us involved was to make sure the threats and the intimidation from Mr. Brown and his associates stopped,\u201d Banks said. \u201cBeyond that, it\u2019s really up to the NFL and the Patriots to do what they\u2019re going to do. Obviously the Patriots responded [Friday] with what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nThe second accuser\u2019s account bolstered the case for the NFL to act immediately against Brown with the exempt list, given that the personal conduct policy specifically prohibits \u201cstalking, harassment or similar forms of intimidation.\u201d\n\nSome with other NFL teams suspect the Patriots released Brown because they sensed the NFL was about to place him on paid leave. Multiple people close to the case contend otherwise, saying the Patriots acted on their own and were not told by the NFL that Brown being placed on the exempt list was imminent.\n\nThose people describe a Patriots process in which owner Robert Kraft allowed Belichick, before the allegations in the lawsuit surfaced, to make a football decision about signing Brown based on his potential contributions and any drawbacks known at the time. But Kraft also is said to hold Belichick accountable for any roster decisions that ultimately become about more than football and could harm the franchise\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Patriots had internal discussions whether to release Brown when the allegations in the lawsuit surfaced. Alternatively, they could have deactivated him for the Miami game. But with no criminal case and the accusations not substantiated, they deferred to the league\u2019s investigation and let him play that day.\n\nThe texts amounted to evidence that Brown could not control his off-field behavior even while on what amounted to a probationary period with the team. With the allegations mounting and the scale of football benefits vs. reputational costs tipping, the conversations within the organization continued. By the close of business Friday, a consensus was reached with what was described by those familiar with the process as little or no dissent.\n\nBelichick cut short a news conference Friday following a string of questions about Brown. Brown was on the practice field, seemingly readying for Sunday\u2019s game at home against the New York Jets. But a little after 5 p.m., the league sent out its daily transactions to teams over its waiver wire, documenting that Brown had been released. With Brown now a free agent, the NFL\u2019s investigation continues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to continue at the same pace,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the case. The NFL, via a statement released Friday night, signaled to any interested teams that it \u201cmay become appropriate at any time\u201d for Brown to be placed on the exempt list if he signs with a team.\n\n\u201cBoth the league and the teams within are going to have to decide whether he plays again,\u201d Banks said. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to say. My position here was to make sure that my client is protected and that his actions toward my client stopped.\u201d\n\nRead more NFL coverage:\n\nNFL power rankings Week 3: Cowboys, Ravens move up as others suffer QB unrest\n\nBrewer: If Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger can\u2019t stay healthy, good luck to the NFL\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive", "description": "New England\u2019s decision to release the wide receiver 11 days after signing him came while the league\u2019s probe of accusations of rape, sexual assault and intimidation drew closer to possibly taking Brown off the field.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LMD5JQW35EI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
