The tougher stance could narrow the scope of a potential agreement to end the trade war between the world's two largest economies, which is set to escalate with higher tit-for-tat tariffs in the absence of a deal.\n\nChina may be seeking to capitalize on the Trump administration's ongoing challenges, which include a mounting impeachment crisis and growing evidence of a slowing US economy.

Factory orders in Germany fell 0.6% month-on-month in September, outstripping the Reuters consensus forecast of a 0.3% decline.
