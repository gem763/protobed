Drake said in a statement.\n\nThe organization has in most cases prohibited the around 450,000 athletes it represents across the country from profiting financially from enterprises associated with their fame, such as merchandise and bearing their names and video games that rely on their likenesses.\n\nThe board\u2019s verdict comes after an NCAA task force, led by Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith and Big East Conference Commissioner Val Ackerman, was assigned to investigate and provide the board with a report on the feasibility of changing the rules surrounding athletes ability to profit.\n\nThe proposal comes after years of sustained criticism directed at the NCAA in response to its refusal to allow athletes to partake in the billions of dollars in annual profits associated with their on-field product.\n\nThe change has already received blowback from some professional athletes, including former Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow, who played college football for the University of Florida.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at the University of Florida, I think my jersey was one of the top jerseys around the world,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cI didn\u2019t make a dollar from it, but nor did I want to.
