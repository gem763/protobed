That pattern increased the risk of a disappointing jobs report Friday. But the payroll total was inflated by the federal government\u2019s addition of 25,000 temporary workers for the 2020 census. Without those gains, the August number would have been even weaker.\n\nMore broadly, payroll growth has slowed to an average monthly pace of 158,000 this year from 223,000 in 2018, though last year\u2019s figures are expected to be revised down substantially based on a recent preliminary estimate. A low unemployment rate has made it harder for employers to find qualified workers.\n\nAlso, the economy has slowed from its brisk pace last year because of the fading impact of Republican-led tax cuts and spending increases, President Trump\u2019s trade war with China and sluggish economies in other nations. The trade fight has also dampened business confidence and investment and hurt manufacturers.\n\n\"The trend is softening, as firms scale back hiring plans alongside capital spending, in the face of prolonged and deep uncertainty,\" economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote a note to clients.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity, has remained robust, leaving a split-screen economy, with services firms doing well and hiring at a steady pace while factories struggle.\n\nAlthough the economy generally remains on solid footing, the Fed worries that the trade war, along with feeble business investment and industrial output, could tip the U.S. into recession. A new 15% tariff, mostly on consumer goods from China, took effect Sunday.\n\nAs a result of the mounting risks, the Fed lowered its key interest rate last month \u2013 by a quarter percentage point \u2013 for the first time in a decade. Another cut is expected at the Fed\u2019s Sept. 17-18 meeting.\n\nLighter workload: Workers are putting in fewer hours. Is that a sign a recession is coming?\n\nMore pain for retailers: Sears and Kmart corporate workforce is shrinking with around 250 layoffs\n\nWages rise solidly\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose a healthy 11 cents to $28.11, but that nudged down the annual gain from 3.3% to 3.2% simply because of a strong performance in August 2018.\n\nYearly pay increases began topping 3% in the second half of 2018 as employers bid up to attract fewer available workers but haven\u2019t gained further momentum. That has kept inflation subdued, providing the Fed another reason to reduce rates in the months ahead. If pay continues to accelerate, putting stronger upward pressure on prices, that could pose a dilemma for Fed officials.\n\nIndustries that are hiring\n\nProfessional and business services and health care led the job gains with 37,000 each. Financial firms added 15,000; construction, 14,000; and leisure and hospitality, 12,000.\n\nManufacturers added just 3,000 jobs in a sign the trade war and slowing global economy continue to take a toll. Retailers cut 11,000 jobs, partly reflecting a longer-term shift to online shopping.\n\nWorkweek rebounds\n\nThe average workweek rose to 34.4 hours from a two-year low of 34.3 hours in July. The feeble July showing raised concerns because businesses often cut the hours of existing employees before pulling back hiring. The rebound in August eases those worries, but the monthly numbers are volatile and it's worth keeping an eye on the workweek in the months ahead to see if it slips again.\n\nBlack unemployment hits record low\n\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans fell sharply from 6% to 5.5%, the lowest on records dating to 1972. As employers struggle to find workers amid historically low unemployment, they\u2019ve been more willing to hire Americans in disadvantaged groups who traditionally have faced more obstacles in the labor market.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Employers added just 130,000 jobs in August.
