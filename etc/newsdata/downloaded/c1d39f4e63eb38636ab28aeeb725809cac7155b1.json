To that end, Biden\u2019s campaign plans to invest manpower in delegate-rich Super Tuesday states like Texas and North Carolina.\n\nThe move comes even though the Biden campaign announced on Thursday it was launching a six million dollar ad buy in the early primary and caucus states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Most political observers, however, view the ad buy as a way for Biden to remain credible in the early states in order to remain in the race until Super Tuesday when his standing with moderate and black voters across is likely to carry the day.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported on Wednesday, the former vice president has a built-in firewall across the South that is likely to keep his campaign afloat even if he were to lose the first three contests. South Carolina, which according to a recent poll is Biden\u2019s to lose, will play an instrumental role in that strategy since its primary will be the last before Super Tuesday.\n\nA resounding victory in South Carolina would give the former vice president major momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday contests, seven of which will be held in the South. From there the math would work in Biden\u2019s favor. In total, the seven Southern Super Tuesday states will have more than 670 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday \u2014 more than a third of the 1,885 required for a candidate to win the nomination. In contrast, as Politico noted on Thursday, the four early states will only have 155 delegates up for grabs between them.\n\nBiden\u2019s strategy is buoyed by the fact he leads his fellow 2020 competitors in all seven of the Southern Super Tuesday states \u2014 Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee \u2014 handily. Recent polling from Texas and North Carolina alone, two states of the largest states on the ballot with more than 350 delegates combined, indicates Biden dominates his opponents by double digits.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, this will likely be a two-person race coming out of South Carolina, and whomever emerges from Super Tuesday with a significant delegate lead will be extremely difficult to catch,\u201d a senior Biden staffer told Politico.\n\nBiden\u2019s chances are further bolstered by the fact that some congressional districts will have more delegates to award that others, thanks to rules set forth by the Democratic National Committee and local party committees. Given such circumstances, Biden\u2019s team has focused its efforts on garnering endorsements from members of congress and other elected officials representing such districts with an outsize number of delegates. Biden\u2019s team plans to double down on this strategy as it begins expanding its reach into Super Tuesday states.\n\n\u201cThe endorsement slates we\u2019ve rolled out are proof of the time and energy we\u2019ve put into these states to date,\u201d Pete Kavanaugh, the former vice president\u2019s deputy campaign manager of states, told Politico. \u201cNo one has been able to release remotely close to what we have.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear though if such efforts will be enough for Biden to overcome a loss in the first three primary sates. Despite Biden\u2019s campaign claiming \u201chistory\u201d as their \u201cguide\u201d regarding the importance of Super Tuesday, they also seem to be ignoring the broader precedent that no Democrat has lost the first three primary contests and gone one to win the nomination since 1992.", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign is making a heavy investment in the 14 states that are scheduled to hold their primary on Super Tuesday.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/joe-biden-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
