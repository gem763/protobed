But I have a good level of confidence that it will not be seen that way, that the moderates in the Trump districts who eventually support impeachment will be seen as having done so for serious and sober reasons.\u201d\n\nMuch of the Democratic concern about the impact on more vulnerable members is rooted in misperceptions about what happened after the House Republicans impeached Bill Clinton on two counts. As I\u2019ve written before, the GOP did pay a price for that decision. In the November 1998 election, a month after the GOP majority first voted to authorize the impeachment inquiry, Democrats gained five seats in the House. That was the first time a president\u2019s party had won House seats in the sixth year of his term since Andrew Jackson\u2019s administration in 1834.\n\nBut those gains weren\u2019t enough to cost Republicans control of the House. The GOP won a majority of the nationwide popular vote that year. Just 17 seats changed hands between the parties, at the time the smallest shift ever in a midterm election, according to a study by Gary Jacobson, a UC San Diego political scientist who specializes in Congress. With the economy humming, only six incumbents in the two major parties were defeated, and the average margin of victory for incumbents in both parties increased substantially. \u201cThe voters,\u201d Jacobson wrote at the time, \u201cdelivered a ringing endorsement of the political status quo.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Impeaching-Trump-May-Not-Be-Risky-Democrats-Think"], "top_image": ""}
