But the protests have morphed into demands for an overhaul of the entire political system in the crisis-ravaged country.\n\nAfter on Friday laying out a 72-hour deadline for parties to agree to a framework for economic reforms, Mr Hariri held round-the-clock meetings with Lebanon\u2019s various political blocs to discuss proposals for the 2020 budget.\n\nLate on Sunday Mr Hariri appeared to have bought himself some time with the announcement of a package of reforms including a 50 percent reduction in the salaries of current and former officials.\n\nThe reforms also include $3.3 billion in contributions from banks to reduce the deficit in the heavily indebted country, and plans to overhaul the crippled electricity sector. But they will not be confirmed until approved by the cabinet on Monday, and it is unclear whether they will go far enough.", "description": "Lebanon was shaken on Sunday by its largest protests in years as young and old turned out en masse to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and his coalition government.", "authors": ["Joseph Haboush", "Sara Elizabeth Williams", "Liz Truss", "Camilla Tominey", "Nick Timothy", "Iain Duncan Smith", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213613586-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
