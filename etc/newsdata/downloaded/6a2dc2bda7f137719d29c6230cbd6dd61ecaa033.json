Governments too need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\"\n\n190711163712344\n\nMonday's match was temporarily halted by the Croatian referee under a three-step UEFA protocol, but the stoppage did not go far enough for some anti-racism activists who felt the England players should have walked off.\n\nAnti-racism organisation Kick It Out said UEFA's existing sanctions were not fit for purpose and called for Bulgaria to be booted out.\n\n\"There can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If UEFA care at all about tackling discrimination - and if the Equal Game campaign means anything - then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow,\" it said.\n\nUEFA opens disciplinary proceedings\n\nUEFA said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Bulgaria on a number of charges including racist behaviour and the throwing of objects.\n\nEngland were also charged for disruption of the national anthem and an insufficient number of travelling stewards.\n\nMihaylov had previously defended Bulgarian football from accusations of racism and criticised England for what he saw as a \"fixation\" on potential incidents that could raise tension.\n\n190902170153862\n\nHis departure came just hours after a Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) spokesman said Mihaylov would not resign because the state had no right to interfere in football.\n\nA later statement said that Mihaylov's formal resignation would be presented to the Executive Committee on Friday.\n\n\"His position is a consequence of recent tensions; an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union,\" it said.\n\nReuters was not able to reach Mihaylov by telephone on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 20 police officers swept into the (BFU) headquarters on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut the Bulgarian chief prosecutor's spokeswoman said that the operation was part of an investigation conducted by the Specialized Prosecutor's Office, and so not directly related to the racism dispute.\n\n\"It's about crimes against sport,\" Rumyana Arnaudova told Reuters News Agency. \"We're talking about corruption offences, connected to the work of the BFU's referee commission and the appointment of referees on football matches.\n\n\"The investigation is still under way and it's too early to say if there'll be some arrests.\"\n\nMihaylov, captain of the Bulgarian national team that made it to the World Cup semi-finals in 1994, has been heavily criticised by local media and football fans for failing to lead the BFU out of years of corruption and controversy.\n\nBulgaria have failed to qualify for a major tournament since 2004, while Mihaylov's tenure has been marred by allegations of cronyism. He has denied such allegations in the past.\n\nThere have been widespread reports of match-fixing in Bulgaria in recent years but little in the way of progress in holding anyone accountable.", "description": "Borislav Mihaylov steps down after after Bulgarian fans taunt black English players with Nazi salutes and monkey chants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/c06d1cd119384ad6827ab680c8ac4732_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
