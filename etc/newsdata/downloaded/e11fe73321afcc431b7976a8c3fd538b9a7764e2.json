Britain\u2019s class system is unique: it\u2019s simultaneously a source of pride, shame, envy, scorn and ambition and is packed with more nuances than most outsiders can begin to understand. However you feel about it, it\u2019s an institution and is identified with, in some form or another, by the majority of the nation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut what is rarely discussed is the concept of impostor syndrome ultimately hindering black people's impact within British society, because they doubt whether their education, income and career achievements are good enough to assimilate as middle class.\n\nThe UK\u2019s middle-class is the social group between the upper and lower classes, a group defined by their tastes, upbringing, education, occupation, income and lifestyle. There is a difference between the traditional middle class and the new wave of black people with traditional working-class values that have propelled them through their careers to become part of a new black middle class.\n\nDespite the \u201cachievement\u201d of making it to a middle-class status, there are black people who reject it and social class as a whole, or they prefer to identify as working class, versus their current socioeconomic status. This is possibly out of loyalty to their African or Caribbean upbringing and heritage, or impostor syndrome, where despite working hard to succeed, feel like they don\u2019t belong.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There are those that change accents to sound posh, and adopt mockney accents to fit in. This fear of feeling like an impostor leads to a rejection of social class altogether. There's an underlying concept that \"we\" should not be here and therefore find a way to blend in as much as possible.\n\nAfter years of striving to better ourselves and obtain an upward career trajectory, we find ourselves facing a new and unexpected challenge \u2013 resentment from some of our peers as though we don't fit or belong in the middle class.\n\nThere are few visible black role models operating in fields like literature, finance, architecture, media or law \u2013 and those who do exist are still seen as anomalies. Whilst steps are being taken to lower the barrier to entry into these industries, the appeal of these professions within the communities they\u2019re now so keen to welcome is somewhat limited, largely due to the fact that it simply doesn\u2019t seem feasible \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem like something that happens or something that\u2019s meant for them.\n\nWhilst I'm not trying to boost egos or champion a class system that has arguably suppressed and segregated black people historically, this is about celebrating successes within the community that often go unnoticed.\n\nThe wider impact of impostor syndrome and the black middle class on British society is that success within our community only seems to be celebrated when it\u2019s achieved by musicians, entertainers and sportspeople.\n\nThe danger is that ambitious young black people will fail to recognise the value of channelling traditional working-class values towards experiencing upward social mobility which should be a mark of accomplishment and pride, not resentment.\n\nDiana Young is co-founder, managing director and editor of PR and media intelligence tool Fashion and Beauty Insight.
