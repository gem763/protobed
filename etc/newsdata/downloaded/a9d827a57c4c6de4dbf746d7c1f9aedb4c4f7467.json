The $147 million project replaced a much shorter fence made of surplus airstrip landing mats from the Vietnam War.\n\nPENTAGON CANCELS 3 BORDER BARRIER PROJECTS OVER COSTS\n\nThe president said it\u2019s in one of the \u201cmost dangerous areas,\u201d and they\u2019ve built a \u201cdouble wall\u201d \u2013 one barrier was 18 feet, and the other was 30 feet. Before leaving, Trump used a marker to sign the wall.\n\nHe also talked up how the barrier was designed to retain heat as a deterrent. \u201cYou can fry an egg on that wall,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same site last year, Trump saw wall prototypes, which were destroyed to make way for 14 miles of steel bollards currently under construction.\n\nThe president and his administration have said they planned on building between 450 and 500 miles of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile border by the end of 2020, an ambitious undertaking funded by billions of defense dollars that had been earmarked for things such as military base schools, target ranges and maintenance facilities.\n\nTrump has been riding a string of wins on the wall and on immigration. Arrests on the Mexican border arrests plunged well beyond the usual summer dip in August.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court gave Trump a green light to deny asylum to anyone who passed through another country on the way to the U.S. border with Mexico without having sought protection in that third country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department has nixed three border barrier projects in Arizona over costs, according to a court document filed Monday.\n\nThe Pentagon on Aug. 26 authorized the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to undertake the additional projects to build fencing, infrastructure and lighting at the U.S.-Mexico border, the filing said.\n\nFox News' Melissa Leon and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday visited the U.S.-Mexico border in California to take a tour of border wall going up near San Diego.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/d8ad9519-AP19261800771175-e1568847442824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
