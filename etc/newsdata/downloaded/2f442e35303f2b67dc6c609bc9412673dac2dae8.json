[from] the early stages of taking forward the bill [to] then withdrawing the bill yesterday, the central people's government has respected my view and supported me all the way,\" she said.\n\nIt comes days after the release of leaked audio of Ms Lam, in which she implied the Chinese government had earlier rejected her proposal to withdraw the bill and ordered her not to yield to any of the protesters' other demands.\n\nWhy does it matter what Beijing thinks?\n\nHong Kong is a part of China under a One Country Two Systems model, which means it enjoys freedoms not seen on the mainland, including its own legal system and borders. Rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are also protected.\n\nWhen the extradition bill was unveiled in April, it quickly drew criticism. Opponents said it would undermine Hong Kong's legal freedoms and might be used to intimidate or silence critics of Beijing.\n\nWhen the government refused to back down, it triggered mass rallies on the streets. The protests, which have sometimes seen violent clashes between police and demonstrators, have since morphed into a broader anti-government movement calling for fuller democracy in Hong Kong.\n\nThe withdrawal of the bill is one of the five demands put forward by protesters.\n\nIt was suspended and declared \"dead\" by Ms Lam in June - but authorities had previously refused to announce its full withdrawal.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters have accused police of excessive brutality,\n\nAside from the demise of the bill, the protesters' other key demands are an amnesty for arrested protesters, for the protests not to be categorised as riots\", an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and the introduction of universal suffrage.\n\nWhat else has Carrie Lam promised?\n\nAt Thursday's press conference, Ms Lam reiterated the four measures she put forward on Wednesday in a bid to ease tensions:\n\nThese include:\n\nThe withdrawal of the bill\n\nThe appointment of two new members to the territory's Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), tasked with looking into allegations of police brutality\n\nA pledge to start \"direct dialogue\" with members of the community\n\nAn invitation to community leaders, professionals and academics to advise the government in finding \"solutions\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ms Lam announced four steps to help ease tensions - footage courtesy of ICABLE NEWS\n\nShe also addressed concerns over whether the bill would actually be formally withdrawn, saying there would be no \"debate [or] vote\" when parliament resumed.\n\nAsked why it had taken her so long to withdraw the bill, she asked the public not to view the decision in isolation.\n\n\"I have announced a package of four actions... each of those actions require a process of deliberation,\" she said.\n\nHow have protesters responded?\n\nProtesters say the fight will continue until all of their demands are met.\n\n\"Carrie Lam... needs to address ALL five demands,\" pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong had said in a tweet. \"Too little and too late now.\"\n\nBut state media outlet China Daily said in an editorial on Thursday that Hong Kong protesters no longer had an \"excuse to continue violence\" following the announcement.\n\n\"[The withdrawal] could be interpreted as an olive branch,\" said the publication. \"[The decision] to withdraw the bill is a sincere and earnest response to the voice of the community.\"\n\nA guide to the Hong Kong protests", "description": "The Hong Kong leader said the Chinese government had \"respected and supported\" her all the way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/23F2/production/_108620290_gettyimages-1164295794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
