I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTurkey is expected to be high on the agenda when the US Congress returns to session on Tuesday.\n\nThree senior Democratic senators called sanctions \"good and justified\" but also insufficient.\n\nThey said they would ask Republicans to join them in passing a resolution calling on Trump to reverse the pullout of US forces.\n\n\"President Trump should use this moment to step up, do the right thing, and correct course,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer wrote in a joint statement along with Bob Menendez and Jack Reed, the top Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier said she was forging ahead on a Turkey sanctions bill with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a normally loyal Trump ally who has been sharply critical of the pullout.\n\n- Sticking to withdrawal -\n\nTrump confirmed he was pulling all troops out of northeastern Syria -- a position he has favored for months and nearly carried out in December after a previous conversation with Erdogan.\n\nHe said that US troops would remain in the southern Syrian base of Al Tanf. A US official said around 150 Americans were at the base while 1,000 were leaving northeastern Syria.\n\nTrump said that the withdrawn troops will \"redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation\" to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, although he did not specify where.\n\nThe United States maintains thousands of troops in nearby Iraq and on Friday announced reinforcements to Saudi Arabia amid tensions between the oil-producing ally and Iran.\n\nTrump again warned Turkey it was responsible for the safety of civilians and minorities, and eventually the detention of Islamic State extremists held by Kurdish fighters.\n\n\"I have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey's action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\" Trump said.", "description": "US President Donald Trump on Monday authorized sanctions on Turkey's leaders, reimposed steel tariffs and ended talks on a trade deal, seeking to punish the historic ally for its deadly offensive into Syria.
