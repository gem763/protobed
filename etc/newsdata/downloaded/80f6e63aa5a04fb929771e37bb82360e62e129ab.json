Lookouts are stationed to the south-west on Malden Road, while to the north youngsters on bicycles deliver pre-ordered cocaine and heroin.\n\nThis is the home turf of QC Blox, one of the most notorious street gangs of Camden, north London. Named after the layout of the 1960s Queen\u2019s Crescent estate, the gang has 70 members, predominantly of Somali origin, sources say. Well organised and seemingly able to easily entice recruits, it has a ferocious reputation locally. \u201cThey are fearless, even the 15-year-olds. I swear the police are scared,\u201d said resident Abdul Musavir, outside the Baitul Aman mosque.\n\nCamden has become the latest flashpoint of the UK\u2019s violent crime crisis, propelled partly by a buoyant drugs trade and county lines business model. More specifically, renewed friction between QC Blox and the nearby Agar Grove estate posse and to the south, the Camden Marliez, who preside over one of London\u2019s most coveted drugs markets, the borough\u2019s famous Camden Lock, have aggravated tensions.\n\nThey are fearless, even the 15-year-olds. I swear the police are scared Abdul Musavir, resident\n\n\u201cWe have gangs all vying for control of the area I\u2019m afraid; tit-for-tat murders, retribution, defending the honour of their friends,\u201d said Terry Ellis, co-founder of Camden Against Violence (CAV).\n\nEarlier this month Camden witnessed three murders in five days, shocking a capital increasingly inured to deadly drugs violence. It began on 8 September when Shakira Loseke, 22, was fatally stabbed on an estate a few hundred yards south of Queen\u2019s Crescent. An hour later, and a minute\u2019s walk away, Wilson Varela, 24, was killed in a drive-by shooting. His murderers, say sources, believed he was a member of QC Blox but it was a case of mistaken identity. Four days later Assad Yarow, 25, was attacked by a gang using machetes outside nearby Camden tube station, one of London\u2019s busiest areas.\n\nTo trace the roots of the current volatility, investigators have gone back to 20 February last year when the territory of QC Blox was again targeted. Abdikarim Hassan, 17, was murdered at 8.30pm in Kentish Town, and less than two hours later Sadiq Mohamed, 20, was fatally stabbed close to Queen\u2019s Crescent.\n\nThese crimes prompted calls for greater police protection and demands for investment in youth projects and opportunities. But Chandice, who styles herself \u201cQueen of the Crescent\u201d and runs a Jamaican food stall close to Weedington Road, said: \u201cStill the police do nothing, the area feels unsafe, people are scared to go out. I got assaulted on Malden Road a few days ago.\u201d\n\nMohammed, a youth worker for the Queen\u2019s Crescent community centre, said there had been investment in youth projects, but underlying issues, notably why children joined violent gangs in the first place, remained largely unaddressed. For instance, he said, the absence of free school meals during the school holidays could push poor pupils into running errands for gangs. \u201cThere is still a long way to go to identify and address the issues,\u201d said Mohammed.\n\nCAV was formed after last year\u2019s double murder and another co-founder, Queen\u2019s Crescent resident Michelle West, said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly got no better in the 17 months since.\u201d Within the borough there were 7,143 violence-against-a-person offences documented in the year to May 2019, a 60% increase on 2013. There were 379 crimes recorded within half a mile of Queen\u2019s Crescent in July. Between August 2018 and July 2019 more than 4,000 crimes were recorded around the territory of QC Blox.\n\nDestabilising Camden\u2019s traditional gang order is the proliferation of rival county lines gangs. Two miles south of Queen\u2019s Crescent lie King\u2019s Cross and St Pancras railway stations, starting point for the distribution of class A substances north.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A tribute to Assad Yarow, known as \u201cNutz\u201d, who was stabbed to death on 18 September on Camden High Street.

Isaak, not his real name, was involved in a county lines business and recently Khadija had received sightings of him at the station and outside the McDonald\u2019s opposite on Euston Road. Her son was not a member of QC Blox or Camden Marliez, but belonged to one of the myriad smalltime USGs (urban street gangs) dealing drugs. His gang\u2019s size left him vulnerable to attack from bigger rivals.\n\nKhadija showed images on her mobile phone of her son\u2019s T-shirt and jacket dating from 1 September. Although the garments are black, the darkened stains of blood were easily detectable. \u201cHe was beaten up in Grantham [Lincolnshire] by dealers, really badly, serious head injuries and then came back to London,\u201d she said. During the attack, he was robbed of his drugs and now Isaak is in debt to his suppliers.\n\nOn 8 September the teenager was arrested in a flat just over a mile from Camden. This time his supplies of drugs were confiscated by police, placing him in deeper debt. Released on bail, Isaak has since disappeared. The last thing he told his mother was that he was going to get even with the men who attacked him. \u201cHe is trapped. Recently he told me: \u2018No one wants to do this.\u2019 I am extremely worried for his mental wellbeing,\u201d she said. She shows an email she sent to the Metropolitan police explaining her son\u2019s vulnerability and asking if she can see him if he is caught and in custody again. The response from the Met officer is abrupt: \u201cI can\u2019t and won\u2019t agree to such requests. Please refrain from making similar requests.\u201d\n\nBedfordshire, a brief train journey from St Pancras, is popular with Camden\u2019s gangs. A recent drugs market profile by Bedfordshire police articulated why: 34,000 people used illegal drugs in Bedfordshire with the cocaine market alone worth \u00a353.8m a year.\n\nChildren from London, confirmed the force, had been found during drugs raids in Bedford, including a 17-year-old from north London who had been classified as a victim of modern slavery. Last week Bedfordshire police launched the country\u2019s first violence and exploitation reduction unit (Veru) with an emphasis on protecting vulnerable youngsters. Working closely with the Met, the unit is headed by Kimberley Lamb who said her first priority would be looking at pupil referral units and care homes where vulnerable youngsters are targeted by gangs. \u201cWe need to protect excluded children who are being exploited,\u201d she said.\n\nBack in London, Khadija, weary of trying to find her son, began walking home, north beyond King\u2019s Cross. The mother-of-five was soon walking through the various gang fiefdoms. First, the territory of the Somers Town Boys, then the SOC (south of Camden) gang and the RPE (Regent Park Estate), close to where 16-year-old Alex Smith was chased and killed with a machete last month. Nearby is Camden town itself and the lock, visited by 100,000 people each weekend. \u201cThere the trade is so blatant, it\u2019s 24/7 drug tourism. Everyone\u2019s aware of it,\u201d said Camden Against Violence\u2019s Ellis.\n\nA few minutes\u2019 north stands the Sir Robert Peel, a pub on Queen\u2019s Crescent named after the founder of the Metropolitan police. Inside, drinkers said they had developed a system for keeping the peace.\n\nColin, a regular, said: \u201cThe gang don\u2019t come in here, they know this is our place. They\u2019ve got the streets.\u201d", "description": "The area is at the heart of a brutal battle which has left vulnerable teenagers dead and whole communities in fear", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb852b1490bd40503b5e4f2fc23ee022251f233f/0_328_5657_3394/master/5657.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=76f9fb2ab6ff00a91d3ab4033584f556", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
