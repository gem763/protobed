Why would anyone carry credit card balances from consumer purchases \u2014 eating out, holiday gifts, that new couch \u2014 with a double-digit interest rate? It makes no sense financially. Yet, millions of Americans are doing just that.\n\nI use this example to set the stage for what I\u2019m about to say concerning a question I get all the time: Should I pay off my student loans or invest for retirement?\n\nHere\u2019s a question I received during one of my recent weekly online chats.\n\nQ: \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get the debt monkey off my back and am aggressively paying off my debt. In addition to your chat/column, I also follow some personal finance channels on YouTube, and one person said recently that aggressively paying down debt while you\u2019re young can cost \u2018millions\u2019 later because of the lost time in potential retirement contributions you aren\u2019t making. I\u2019m 34 and my only debt is student loans. I\u2019m currently putting enough money and a little extra in the [federal retirement] Thrift Savings Plan to get the match. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on getting out of debt more quickly versus saving for retirement.\u201d\n\nRead: There seems to be no end to the rise in student loan debt\n\nMany financial experts would advise that if the loans have fairly low interest rates, then don\u2019t worry about paying them off early. Instead, they would recommend taking any extra money and investing for retirement.\n\nThe younger you are, the more you gain by putting your money to work in the stock market, even with a conservative return of, say, 6 percent. Logically, this advice makes sense.\n\nBut in my experience, here\u2019s what people often hear when such advice is given: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about those student loans because you\u2019ll get more bang for your buck by investing.\u201d\n\nThey internalize only part of the advice. In their minds, they have been given permission simply to make the minimum payments on their loans, and they feel freed from concerns about carrying the debt for decades.\n\nSo, they buy new cars. They rack up credit card charges by drinking and dining with friends and family. They take vacations.\n\nRather than invest, they use the money that would have been put toward aggressively paying off their student loans to plan a $10,000 wedding. Or worse, they put the cost of the wedding on their credit card.\n\nRead: Married to debt: Couples are taking out loans to pay for their weddings\n\nOr they have kids or buy a home or both. Now, they have child-care costs and a mortgage.\n\nThey never get around to investing the extra funds for retirement because life gets in the way.\n\nLet\u2019s say they do start saving for retirement as a young adult, but they withdraw the money to use it for a down payment on that house or to pay off the credit card debt they\u2019ve accrued.\n\nRead: The average millennial has a net worth of $8,000. That\u2019s far less than previous generations.\n\nAll the while, their student loan balance is growing because they ask the lender to defer payments until they can get themselves financially situated.\n\nTime marches on. Before they know it, they\u2019re getting closer to retirement and have dragged their student loans through adulthood until the balance has ballooned to an alarming amount.\n\nRead: Student debt now affects a staggering number of elderly Americans\n\nThen they say to me: \u201cBut I was told not to worry about the debt because the interest rate wasn\u2019t that high, and my education was an investment.\u201d\n\nCompare these people with the ones who spent their 20s and maybe even their early 30s aggressively attacking their student loans. While doing so, they said \u201cno\u201d to a lot of things that would have derailed their efforts.\n\nRead: Your maid of honor is not made of cash\n\nThey might have moved back home with their parents to devote more of their income to paying off their student loans. Maybe after college, they continued to live with roommates because they could see an end in sight to their debt. They didn\u2019t rack up much credit card debt or have a big wedding. They even waited to buy a home until the loans were paid off. They saved something for retirement, but they were laser-focused on eliminating their debt.\n\nFinally, with the loans gone, they could contribute substantially more to their workplace retirement account, and at a higher rate than many of their peers. Time is still on their side.\n\nThis is why I recommend that people focus intensely \u2014 as soon as they can \u2014 on paying off their student loans before saving for retirement. And, please, invest enough to get whatever company match your employer offers. And if you can pay off your loans early and invest, go for it.\n\nDebt is like an albatross around your neck, said Joe Duarte, a market analyst, money manager and the author of \u201cThe Everything Guide to Investing in Your 20s & 30s.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaying off debt is the priority, because the faster it is paid off, the faster savings and compounding take over,\u201d Duarte said in an interview.\n\nIn his investment guide, Duarte encourages young adults to ask this question: Can I afford to invest?\n\n\u201cThink of debt as a big sack of potatoes that you carry on your back everywhere you go,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy paying down debt and eliminating it altogether, you are taking a big weight off your financial shoulders. Being lighter makes you move faster.\u201d\n\nI call the sack a monkey on your back.\n\nBy the way, remember the \u201cmillions\u201d you could be missing out on by not making extra student loan payments and investing instead?\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not a realistic motivation for most people.\n\nThe average 401(k) account balance was $106,000 for the second quarter of this year, according to Fidelity Investments, the largest administrator of 401(k) plans.\n\nThere are 401(k) millionaires, and this club is growing, but they still represent a tiny minority \u2014 just about 1 percent of all workers who save in workplace retirement plans managed by Fidelity.\n\nRead: The number of workers becoming retirement-plan millionaires hits record highs\n\nAs you work hard to pay off your debt, learning the value of delayed gratification, you may find you can live on less, which helps you find the money to catch up on your retirement savings.\n\nIn the case of the 34-year-old borrower, even if he or she took another five or six years to pay off the student loans, there\u2019s still time to save a lot of money if the goal is to retire in 20 or 25 years from now. Among employees who have been in their 401(k) plan for 10 years straight, the average balance reached $305,900 in the second quarter of this year, according to Fidelity.\n\nFidelity recommends setting a goal to save at least 15 percent of your pretax income each year, a target you may be able to reach if you include your employer\u2019s match. With less debt to service, that\u2019s possible for a lot of folks.\n\n\u201cIncreasing your contribution rate, even by one percent, can make a big difference in your long-term retirement savings,\u201d said Kevin Barry, president of workplace investing at Fidelity. \u201cWhat may seem like a small amount today can have a significant impact on your account balance in 10 or 20 years.\u201d\n\nRead: Is $1 million enough to retire?
