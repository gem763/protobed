Mr. Frey sought to stick the Trump 2020 campaign with a bill for $530,000 for \u201csecurity,\u201d and it took the threat of a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to force the mayor to back down.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign \u2014 and not Minneapolis residents \u2014 should pay for most of the costs of policing the event, it\u2019s obvious that the mayor pulled that exorbitant, extortionate dollar figure out of thin air as a politically motivated provocation, if not to prevent the rally from happening. That was made clear soon after plans for the rally were announced in late September, when Mr. Frey said he couldn\u2019t stop the visit, but added that the president\u2019s \u201cmessage of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d Stop the visit? Why would that thought even occur to Mr. Frey, who as an elected official has sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution, presumably including the right to free speech?\n\n\u201cSomeone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can\u2019t price out Free Speech,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cProbably illegal!\u201d The president cited a September 2009 rally \u2014 at the same Target Center \u2014 staged by President Obama in support of what would become Obamacare, for which the bill for security, including police overtime and street closures, was just $20,000. On Monday night, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the mayor of \u201cabusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign by conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally.\u201d Thus, Mr. Trump\u2019s Minneapolis speech went on as scheduled Thursday night. Remarks by the president\u2019s acting secretary of Homeland Security on Monday at Georgetown University, not so much.\n\nOpen-borders leftist protesters at the Washington, D.C., school had no interest in hearing what Kevin McAleenan had to say at a conference on immigration \u2014 and didn\u2019t want anyone else to hear it, either. They repeatedly interrupted Mr. McAleenan as he sought to begin his remarks to an audience of immigration-policy wonks, lawyers and students at the conference, sponsored by the Migration Policy Institute. The demonstrators criticized the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy toward illegal immigration and cited Mr. McAleenan\u2019s role in it, especially the separation of illegal-immigrant families. Conference organizers and other audience members reportedly pleaded with the demonstrators to let Mr. McAleenan speak, to no avail.\n\n\u201cAs a career law enforcement professional, I\u2019ve dedicated my career to protecting the right to free speech, and all the values we hold dear in America, from all threats,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll go ahead and try one more time.\u201d But disgracefully, the leftist \u201ctolerance for me, but not for thee\u201d crowd was having none of it, and Mr. McAleenan finally gave up and walked off the stage. He and a reasoned discussion of a perplexing public-policy issue were two more casualties of the hecklers\u2019 veto.\n\nThe left\u2019s iron-fisted, censorious impulse at Georgetown mirrors that of the Communist Chinese government, which constantly seeks to quash all criticism of it. Beijing was true to form last week after the Comedy Central cable channel aired an episode of its cartoon series \u201cSouth Park\u201d that ridiculed not only the Chinese Communist regime, but also Hollywood\u2019s servile self-censorship to remain in Beijing\u2019s good graces and continue to profit from marketing its products there. The Hollywood Reporter wrote Monday that China had retaliated by \u201cdeleting virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pages.\u201d To their credit, the cartoon\u2019s creators issued a sarcastic faux apology: \u201c[W]e welcome Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Long live the great Communist Party of China. We good now, China?\u201d\n\nWhat do these three otherwise-unrelated episodes say about the far left, both here and abroad? What it says to us is that they cannot and will not tolerate the very \u201cdiversity\u201d they claim to champion \u2014 at least not where it really matters; namely, diversity of thought and opinions.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
