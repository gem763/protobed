We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama.\u201d\n\nBut recent reports in the press suggest the Trump administration took pains to minimize Trump\u2019s inaccurate assertions, and Trump himself kept the spotlight on a gaffe that might have easily just blown over. And on Wednesday, House Democrats piled on when they announced an investigation into reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had come under pressure by Ross to issue a statement disavowing the NWS Birmingham tweet.\n\nDemocrats on the House Science Committee and its oversight subcommittee on Wednesday demanded the White House and Commerce Department turn over any documents relating to an unattributed Sept. 6 statement put out by NOAA in which the agency chastised NWS Birmingham for speaking \"in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/169/1155968404_6083737993001_6083745742001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThey also asked for information regarding an agency-wide directive put out in the wake of Trump\u2019s tweet urging employees not to contradict the president.\n\nBoth NOAA missives sparked backlash within the science community, which warned of the dangers of politicizing weather forecasts and jeopardizing the credibility of its forecasters.\n\nAnd the president apparently stewed on the subject for almost a week, at one point displaying a map to reporters that had been altered with a Sharpie to show Alabama in the hurricane\u2019s path, tweeting and retweeting numerous outdated maps purported to support his claims.\n\nBut The New York Times reported this week hat top officials within the administration took more concrete steps to back Trump up. On Monday, the paper reported that after initially being rebuffed, Ross threatened firings at NOAA if the agency's acting administrator did not work to fix the perception that NOAA was contradicting Trump. And earlier Wednesday, the Times reported that Mulvaney directed Ross to enact that pressure.\n\n\u201cAs this story unfolds in the press, a number of actions stand out as a troubling politicization of crucial weather information,\u201d the lawmakers wrote, adding that they are \u201cdeeply disturbed by the politicization of NOAA\u2019s weather forecast activities for the purpose of supporting incorrect statements by the president.\u201d\n\nHouse Science Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairwoman Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) gave Ross until Sept. 20 to come up with the information and documents requested, arguing that it is \u201cessential\u201d that the forecasts produced by the federal government \u201cremain free of political influence and suppression.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Recent reports suggest the Trump administration took pains to minimize Trump\u2019s inaccurate assertions on Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/88/8c/16df159c4fbfbd50834a1a356659/190911-trump-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
