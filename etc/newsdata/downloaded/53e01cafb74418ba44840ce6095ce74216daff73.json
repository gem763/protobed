Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), one of the only House Republicans openly willing to consider a vote to impeach President Donald Trump, announced on Saturday that he plans to retire.\n\nDuring a Fox News interview just one day after telling reporters that he wants \u201cto call them as I see it,\u201d \u201cget the facts and do the right thing,\u201d Rooney delivered word of his decision.\n\nAsked by host Leland Vittert whether he needed a third term, Rooney instantly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t really think I do, and don\u2019t really think I want one,\u201d noting that his main concerns were securing funding for the restoration of the Everglades and to pass an offshore drilling ban. While both policies have made progress in the House, neither one is guaranteed to become law.\n\nPressed by Vittert to confirm that he would not seek reelection, Rooney made clear that this is his final term.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done what I came to do, and I want to be a model for term limits,\u201d he said.\n\nRooney also expressed concern over acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s candid admission of a quid pro quo between the Trump administration and Ukraine, a revelation the congressman called shocking.\n\n\u201cI think Mulvaney clarified there is a point there,\u201d Rooney said, referring to the legitimacy of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn an AP interview published Saturday, the congressman said he\u2019s \u201cstill thinking about\u201d whether Trump\u2019s behavior is worthy of impeachment.\n\nIn a Thursday press briefing, Mulvaney said that U.S. military aid was temporarily withheld from Ukraine because of Trump\u2019s concern that it would be improperly spent, in addition to \u201ccorruption that related to the [Democratic National Committee] server.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccorruption\u201d Mulvaney mentioned refers to a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine was responsible for hacking the DNC email server in 2016. American intelligence agencies have determined that Russia was the culprit.\n\nMulvaney has since walked back his comments, claiming there was no quid pro quo, even though, in the press briefing, he said \u201cwe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nFurther discussing his plans to leave Congress, Rooney expressed frustration with Washington\u2019s focus on \u201cthe quest for reelection and raising money and not wanting to offend anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, I think, what the founders had in mind when they risked their fortunes to start our country,\u201d he said, later noting that he\u2019s \u201creally tired of the intense partisanship that seems to stop us from solving the big questions that America needs solved.\u201d\n\nRooney joins a list of more than a dozen GOP House lawmakers who are set to retire at the end of this term.", "description": "Francis Rooney suggested he might be willing to vote for Trump's ouster.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dab4dbf210000231934a73e.jpeg?cache=0bxwcmiqma&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
