He moved to Canada in 1994 and is now professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard University. He has written 13 books, including Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy, which won last year\u2019s Baillie Gifford prize for his haunting account of the nuclear disaster. His latest book, Forgotten Bastards of the Eastern Front, tells the little-known story of Operation Frantic, the only joint US-Soviet operation of the second world war, which saw more than 100 American bombers flying missions from three airbases in Ukraine.\n\nWhat inspired you to tell the story of Operation Frantic now?\n\nI grew up behind the iron curtain. The \u201cgreat patriotic war\u201d, as it is known in Russian, played a huge role in the collective memory and Soviet propaganda. But there was little space allocated to other allies. When I realised there were Americans at airbases in my backyard it was a \u201cwow\u201d moment.\n\nOnce I heard that there were all these volumes of KGB and Smersh [the Red Army\u2019s counter-intelligence agencies] surveillance, I thought: \u201cI\u2019d better take a look!\u201d On the one hand, you look at these documents and are disgusted so much spying was going on. On the other hand, as a historian, you\u2019re delighted that someone was writing those reports.\n\nHow did the airbases come about?\n\nThere was military logic \u2013 but it was more about expectations. The Americans expected a long fight against the Japanese, so they wanted to show Stalin they were \u201cgood allies\u201d to convince him to let them establish airbases in the far east. The Soviets didn\u2019t see much advantage in the airbases militarily, but finally accepted the idea, wanting to charm the British and Americans into opening a second front against the Germans. Once the Americans and British had landed in Normandy, Stalin lost interest. And there was a devastating bombing raid on the bases. Also the eastern front moved fast, so they didn\u2019t have the strategic impact they might have had. But symbolically, they were important \u2013 especially in signalling to the Germans that the allies were united.\n\nHow did the sides view each other?\n\nThe Americans arrived with a great admiration for the Soviet war effort, especially after Stalingrad. This was also a generation shaped by the great depression who knew something was wrong with capitalism; a lot had leftist leanings.\n\nWhen the alliance started to come apart, it wasn\u2019t because of ideology. The clash was really about the principles of freedom and tyranny. The Americans didn\u2019t object to socialism, they objected to Stalinism: the surveillance, the secrecy, the lack of ability to say what you wanted to say, and the lies that come along with that. This was a surprise to me. I had expected cultural misunderstandings to be a problem, but they weren\u2019t really.\n\nOne later wrote: \u201cWhat we witnessed in the Ukraine was the start of the cold war.\u201d And I think he was right. The US Ambassador to Moscow, W Averell Harriman, and the commander of the airbases, Maj Gen Robert L Walsh, became the first and most dedicated \u201ccold warriors\u201d because of what they had seen inside the USSR.\n\nChernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy review \u2013 death of the Soviet dream Read more\n\nHow did the collapse of the USSR change your perspective?\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union followed a decade of profound crisis. There was an economic crisis, but there was also an ideological crisis. There were no true believers left. So when that system fell, there was a sense of relief, initially. But we had no rules; no one watching what we were reading. There was also economic chaos \u2013 salaries weren\u2019t being paid. But even among historians, we felt we might have turned a page. Russia can go democratic; Ukraine can go democratic. It\u2019s the \u201cend of history\u201d with the victory of liberalism! But, as things progressed, it became clear history matters in all the ways you want it not to matter. It\u2019s impossible to turn the page and forget.\n\nIn many ways Russia\u2019s recent past foreshadows what is happening in the west: industrial collapse, inequality, disinformation, authoritarianism. Are there lessons we could learn?\n\nWe are seeing a trend for democratic regimes to become less democratic. Putin was there before Trump, of course, but we also see it in Hungary, Poland \u2013 all over the world. Russia went through a huge crisis: loss of identity, loss of territory, loss of its status as a great power. It found itself in that place sooner than other countries. But there is a lot in Russian history that helped Putin and those around him to make the choices they did. We are all going through the same moment in history, but I don\u2019t think the political DNA in Britain and the US will allow that moment to become more than just a moment. It goes too much against the grain of tradition in those countries. In Russia, it\u2019s really a continuation of how it has usually been.\n\nWhat are you reading at the moment?\n\nMost of what I read relates to my next project. After my book on Chernobyl, I\u2019m interested in all things nuclear, and the climate too. Right now, it\u2019s The Human Planet: How We Created the Anthropocene by Mark Maslin and Simon Lewis.\n\nWhat did you read growing up?\n\nLike many of my generation, I looked to the west, but we could only read books the authorities allowed to be translated. These were books that pointed out problems with western society, so your \u201cangry young men\u201d really did fit the bill. The Day of the Sardine by Sid Chaplin, about a teenager growing up in northern Britain, and Room at the Top by John Braine made a big impact on me. They were published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but they only came to the Soviet Union 15 or 20 years later.\n\nWhat Ukrainian writers would you recommend?\n\nAnything by Andrey Kurkov, especially Death and the Penguin. I always found Nikolai Gogol\u2019s Taras Bulba interesting because I am from the same part of Ukraine. And the Ukrainian poet Lena Kostenko made a tremendous impact. She wrote about pre-Russian empire history. If you don\u2019t like what you see around you, you look to other times and places - and if you go back to a time before there was a proletariat then you can see the world in different terms. I found her poems a way to stay sane.\n\n\u2022 Forgotten Bastards of the Eastern Front by Serhii Plokhy is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).
