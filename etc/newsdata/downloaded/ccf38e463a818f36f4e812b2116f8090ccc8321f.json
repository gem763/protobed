News of a limited deal arrived just hours after Trump confirmed that he would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday.\n\nThe agreement, however, will not end the trade war as it is unlikely to address Trump\u2019s concerns on key points that have dogged trade talks for months such as China\u2019s economic practices and policies that force U.S. firms \u2013 wanting to enter the Chinese market -- to team up with local partners.\n\nBut the limited deal is enough to persuade Trump to halt tariffs on Chinese goods that were set to go into effect on Oct. 15, potentially deescalating trade tensions between the world\u2019s largest two economies.\n\nWith Trump seemingly set to orchestrate the trade talks on Friday, and hopes of a deal running high, U.S. government bonds will likely be in the spotlight again, after Treasury yields surged on Thursday. The Treasury yield moved up to 1.661% Thursday from Wednesday's 1.587%.\n\nThe uptick in bond yields comes even as markets continue to price in a Fed rate cut at the of the month, with the odds of further easing now at about 80%, according to Investing.com\u2019s\n\n2. Consumer Confidence Check\n\nConsumer confidence numbers will be in the spotlight tomorrow, with many the strength of the consumer will likely continue to keep the U.S. economy above water.\n\nThe University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of October consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).\n\nis expected to decline to a reading of 92, according to economists\u2019 forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\nThe is forecast to drop to 81.7.\n\n3. Rig Counts on Tap\n\nThe latest rig count data due Friday may take on added importance for clues on domestic crude production, which rose to record 12.6 million barrels a day last week.\n\nData last week showed the operating in the U.S. fell by 3 to 710.\n\nThe weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.\n\non Thursday settled 1.8% higher at $53.55 a barrel after OPEC suggested the door was open for further production cuts next year, with a decision expected to be made at oil-cartel\u2019s meeting in December.", "description": "Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE4U15K_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
