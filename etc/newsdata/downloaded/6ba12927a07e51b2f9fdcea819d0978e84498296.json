REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nZimbabwe is mired in its worst economic crisis in a decade, with triple-digit inflation, rolling power cuts and shortages of U.S. dollars, basic goods, medicines and fuel - stirring memories of the hyperinflation that forced it to ditch its currency in 2009.\n\nPublic sector doctors went on strike on Tuesday for the second time in less than a year to demand a further salary increase from President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s government.\n\nJunior doctors held a 40-day strike from Dec. 1, crippling public hospitals. It ended without a deal being reached and with doctors threatening further stoppages.\n\nIn a statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday, the cabinet has discussed amendments to the health services bill, which include designating \u201chealth service as an essential service and emergency critical care as essential services that should be provided for at all times\u201d.\n\nThe amendments would also indicate that \u201ca collective job action should be for a well-defined reasonable time, and not for an indefinite period\u201d.\n\nThe head of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA), Peter Magombeyi, said doctors were entitled to full labour rights, like any worker in Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cThey have a right for collective bargaining and to demand better conditions of services. Our health minister\u2019s poor attempts to interfere with these rights should be condemned in strong terms,\u201d Magombeyi told Reuters.\n\nMnangagwa\u2019s government has proposed pay rises for doctors and other public sector workers in an attempt to avert the strikes. The latest pay increase offers would see the lowest paid worker earning 1,023 Zimbabwe dollars ($90.45) a month.\n\nThe doctors accepted a 60% pay increase but said it was not sufficient to avert the strike action. The doctors are looking for another 401% pay hike that they want indexed to the U.S. dollar.\n\nPolice have banned a series of protests called by the opposition in major cities and have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse demonstrators.", "description": "Zimbabwe's cabinet is proposing designating health services as \"essential\" to be provided at all times to try to limit strikes by medical personnel as a work stoppage by public sector doctors over pay entered a second day on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426115493&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830Y6-OZATP"}
