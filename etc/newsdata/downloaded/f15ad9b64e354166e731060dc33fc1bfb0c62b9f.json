REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\n\nThe triple-A-rated country was among the first to introduce negative interest rates in 2012 to keep investors from hoarding its safe-haven currency, which is pegged to the euro. It has since seen mortgage rates fall to record lows and its entire government bond yield curve dip into sub-zero territory.\n\nDanish banks last month offered homebuyers 30-year mortgages at a fixed rate of 0.5%, the cheapest ever in Denmark.\n\nThe central bank, which usually moves monetary policy in lock-step with the ECB, says negative rates have stabilised the economy and supported economic growth in the wake of the financial crisis that hit in 2008.\n\nA majority of economists expect the ECB to cut its deposit rate on Thursday by 10 basis points to -0.5% to stoke euro zone growth and boost inflation.\n\n\u201cWe expect Denmark\u2019s central bank to match the rate cut by ECB one-to-one, but the entire package from ECB could be tough to match,\u201d Sydbank\u2019s chief analyst Soren Kristensen said in a note, referring to other expected easing measures by the euro zone\u2019s central bank.\n\nAs a result, Kristensen expects more investors to place money in Danish bonds, which in turn would strengthen the crown in the next couple of months.\n\nUnlike most central banks, Denmark\u2019s does not adjust rates to control inflation. Instead its sole mandate is keep the crown within 2.25% of the parity rate of 7.46038 crowns to the euro.\n\nThis year has seen the currency hit its weakest levels since early 2015, although it currently trades at around 7.4603, close to the parity rate.\n\nKristensen expects the ECB to cut its key rate by 20 basis points to -0.6%, above the market consensus, and the Danish central bank to follow with a reduction in its key rate to -0.85% from -0.65%, where it has held since January 2016.\n\nThat would set a new record low among developed economies, taking the Danish benchmark below the -0.75% key rate currently in place in Switzerland.\n\nAnalysts at Nordea and Jyske Bank both predict a smaller 10 basis point cut to the Danish deposit rate on Thursday \u2014 to match the Swiss level \u2014 and a further 10 point reduction following ECB\u2019s next meeting in December.\n\nDanske Bank expects the central bank to cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points, but suggests it could then intervene in foreign exchange markets to steady the crown.\n\nThe only way is down: here", "description": "Denmark's central bank could cut its key deposit rate to a record low among developed economies on Thursday if the European Central Bank eases policy earlier in the day via a rate cut and other tools, as expected.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428696177&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A12O", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
