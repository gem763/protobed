But in reality, it is a party that knows nothing but outrage\u201d.", "description": "Erfurt (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 Germany\u2019s far-right AfD hopes for more gains in the ex-communist east on Sunday when voters go to the polls in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/e9fe53_bjoern-hoecke-hardline-nationalist-who-is-local-head-alternative-germany-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
