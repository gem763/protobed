There\u2019s tons of food, time spent with family, and the spirit of giving in the air. A common tradition around many Thanksgiving tables is for loved ones to share what they are most thankful for, and these Thanksgiving bible verses are the perfect way to get you in the thoughtful mindset for the upcoming occasion.\n\nWhether you\u2019re thankful for God\u2019s everlasting love, your dedication to your faith, or the many blessings the Lord has bestowed upon you in this great life, these words of scripture will remind you just how to give thanks this holiday season. If the whole family needs a reminder of what the day is truly about (other than the turkey sitting on the table), try passing around the Bible after dinner and reciting a few spiritual words from God\u2019s book. There\u2019s no better way to give thanks to the Lord, our God.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qxSBtZkGYWFW.adCROVnJQ--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/woman_s_day_132/cc29e3cca3325dd94c9cbdf27a97242e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
