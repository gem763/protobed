At lunchtime, it put out a statement saying the deal \u201cdrives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement\u201d and \u201cwould not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long term interests.\u201d\n\nThere are more opposition MPs than ever before in this parliament who support a negotiated exit agreement with the EU. Getting their support as well as the DUP\u2019s is important if Johnson is to get his deal over the line (he is currently 45 MPs short of a majority). Not only that, the Northern Irish party's backing is the key to unlocking votes from Brexiteer MPs within the Tory Party.\n\nIn recent months, this fact has forced many in Westminster to grapple with some of the hard realities of Northern Irish politics, which they could hitherto ignore. Fundamentally, it\u2019s about identity, said Matthew O\u2019Toole, former No. 10 spokesman on Europe under both David Cameron and Theresa May. \u201cIt was always going to be difficult for the DUP to do this. Fundamentally it is really about being as British as possible\u201d \u2014 and that means no divergence between Northern Ireland and the U.K. mainland.\n\nThe DUP is keen to cut its losses by shoring up its core vote and fighting to retain as many constituencies as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been people overestimating the capacity of the DUP to accept very much differentiation at all between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,\u201d O\u2019Toole added. \u201cThey\u2019ve said themselves they are fundamentally a unionist party: They couldn\u2019t acquiesce voluntarily to anything that even holds up the possibility of divergence, economically, and politically. This deal certainly from their perspective does that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also an electoral calculation. \u201cIf there\u2019s any kind of election coming up they can\u2019t be seen to go along with this,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. The DUP\u2019s voter base is made up largely of people who back its hard-line stance on the union of the United Kingdom. Electorally, the party is on the back foot: In an upcoming election, it is almost certain to lose the liberal university constituency of South Belfast, and is at risk of losing at least two more seats \u2014 including their Westminster leader Nigel Dodds\u2019. The DUP is keen to cut its losses by shoring up its core vote and fighting to retain as many constituencies as possible.\n\nThe DUP may also be taking advantage of its influence while it can. Andrew McQuillan, who works for public affairs company Edelman and closely follows Northern Irish affairs, said the era of its dominance is coming to an end. \u201cThe tectonic plates in Northern Ireland are shifting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s every chance that there will soon be more Catholics than Protestants [in Northern Ireland] and the recent European and council elections have shown that there\u2019s a lot of people who no longer want to box themselves in as nationalists and unionists.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Johnson may have calculated that he will have to face the consequences of going ahead without the DUP \u2014 if his deal falls in parliament, he must ask the EU for an extension. If the EU refuses, MPs face the choice of Johnson's deal or no deal. Should they decide to give the U.K. more time, Johnson is likely to face a confidence vote.\n\nBut in such a scenario, he would head into an election \u2014 whenever it comes \u2014 able to blame everyone but himself for stalling Brexit.\n\nThis insight is from POLITICO's Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU available to Brexit Pro subscribers.
