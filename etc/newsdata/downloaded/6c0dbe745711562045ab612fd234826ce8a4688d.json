Since the beginning of Trump\u2019s tenure, several high-ranking officials have either resigned or were pushed out of the administration: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, chief of staff John Kelly, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, presidential assistant Omarosa Manigault Newman, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sessions, press secretary Sean Spicer and Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci are just a handful.\n\nWhile these departed officials haven\u2019t said whether they were part of the so-called resistance within the administration, some have spoken out against Trump or have been critical of the administration\u2019s decisions since leaving.", "description": "", "authors": ["Huffpost.Com Entry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
