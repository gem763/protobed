But as far as risk-free returns go, that\u2019s about as good as it gets these days.\n\nPity the German savers, who have to pay for their risk-free 10-year return. The country\u2019s benchmark Bund currently yields -0.7%. In Japan, 10-year government bonds yield -0.3%. The situation isn\u2019t much better in peripheral European countries. Even in Italy, where political tumult just created a scare, 10-year government bonds yield just 1% for European investors.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that investors have to settle for such measly yields. Instead, they should avoid investments exposed to the trade war with China, and gravitate toward the standout pocket of strength in the U.S. economy\u2014the consumer.\n\nRead more: This Model Tries to Create a Balanced Dividend-Stock Portfolio. It Isn\u2019t Always Successful.\n\nIn theory, investors who are looking for yield have to buy the bonds of riskier companies with longer maturities. The high-yield bond market\u2019s yield to worst is 5.9%, according to ICE BofAML Indices, while the 30-year Treasury yield recently touched a record low of 1.9%.\n\nNeither is particularly appealing, however. The market\u2019s most reliable recession indicator\u2014an inverted yield curve\u2014is warning of a slowdown ahead, which could cause junk bonds to sell off. And that selloff could be the start of a vicious cycle in which investors\u2019 risk aversion hampers borrowers\u2019 ability to refinance or borrow more, which could further hurt those companies\u2019 financial performance.\n\nLong-dated Treasuries would be a good bet in that situation, and not only because investors tend to flock to them as havens in bad times. Foreign investors have been shut out from much of the market due to the high costs of hedging currency fluctuations. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in September, as expected, the costs of hedging dollar exposure will decline, and could possibly spur on additional flows into U.S. Treasuries. But those same Treasuries could sell off in a \u201cbuy the rumor and sell the news\u201d reaction to rate cuts. It is also possible that global economic growth could heat up and cause long-term Treasuries to sell off.\n\nIncome-seeking investors should look to the U.S. consumer instead. While the U.S. government and American corporations have loaded up on debt, consumers are still in good shape. The U.S. consumer may get hurt during a recession if one occurs, but unlike the last recession, their financial position looks strong compared with companies.\n\nThat makes residential mortgage-backed securities that aren\u2019t insured by government agencies a good place to find a solid yield for only a small amount of additional risk. These securities offer yields of roughly 3% to 5%, and can be found in mutual funds like the Pimco Mortgage Opportunities and Bond fund (ticker: PMZIX) and the Metropolitan West Unconstrained Bond fund (MWCIX).\n\nInvestors should look at stocks for income, as well. The S&P 500 index\u2019s implied dividend yield was 2.1% on Thursday, higher even than 30-year Treasury yields. But they should use the same guiding principles as they would in bonds. That means focusing on consumer-sensitive sectors that aren\u2019t too exposed to global trade or political risk, and are also not highly indebted compared with historical averages. Utilities may be a decent option, but investors may want to avoid the most indebted companies in the consumer-staples sector, such as packaged-foods companies, as well as the politically riskier health-care stocks, like drugmakers.\n\nOr investors may want to look at companies with a domestic consumer-oriented focus, such as real estate investment trusts that own residential buildings. Two choices with strong balance sheets include AvalonBay Communities (AVB) and Equity Residential (EQR). Those REITs have dividend yields of 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively.\n\nThese options do come with some risk in a downturn, of course. But their yields aren\u2019t too bad compared with what\u2019s on offer in Europe.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Scaggs at alexandra.scaggs@barrons.com", "description": "A 10-year yield below 1.5% isn\u2019t exactly a robust retirement income generator.
