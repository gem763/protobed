She keeps a watchful eye over the natural, and not so natural, world and its wildlife; she\u2019s a doting adoptive mother to teenage Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning); and when she\u2019s invited to a fancy dinner at a neighboring kingdom, she works hard to keep her fangs from showing when she smiles. At worst, she\u2019s a complex creature who\u2019s been shaped by her past suffering and who simply does not suffer fools. But then, as a title, Maleficent: Mistress of Indeterminate Motives just doesn\u2019t swing, does it?\n\nPerhaps it doesn\u2019t matter so much that Maleficent is more misunderstood than mal. The pleasures of this sequel to the 2014 revisionist fairytale Maleficent lie mostly in looking, at the psychedelically verdant computer-generated backdrops, at the spun-by-spiders and wrought-by-wizards costumes and especially at Jolie herself, the film\u2019s most regal spectacle.

He\u2019s on his way to propose to her. She says yes. Hooray! But Maleficent is none too pleased. She likes earnest young Philip well enough, but she has little faith in romantic love\u2014her backstory of having been jilted as a young woman is central to the earlier film. And she gets a bad vibe from Philip\u2019s parents, especially his mother, Queen Ingrith (a marvelously calculating Michelle Pfeiffer). Ingrith and her husband, King John (Robert Lindsay), rule the next kingdom over, and Maleficent sees them as potential enemies of the territory she and Aurora guard so fiercely, the moors. But Aurora pleads with her to make a good impression on the future in-laws: Maleficent agrees to go to their castle for dinner, even donning the black veil Aurora urges her to wear, an almost comically futile attempt to disguise the chic but treacherous-looking ram\u2019s horns that stretch skyward from her elegant noggin.\n\nNeedless to say, dinner is a disaster. The hosts accuse Maleficent of putting a spell on King John, and given her track record, it\u2019s not an unreasonable assumption. More stuff happens. Maleficent ends up returning to her roots, discovering the place from which she came, populated by beings who are something like her, though not as powerful. Like her, they\u2019re angry at humankind, though one of these extraordinary winged beings believes there\u2019s a peaceful way forward: This is the wise Conall (played by the always-awesome Chiwetel Ejiofor). He\u2019s the epitome of hippie chic with his swervy horns, ultra-long locs, and feathery, ebony wings.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil, directed by Joachim R\u00f8nning (who, with Espen Sandberg, previously co-directed the 2012 historical adventure Kon-Tiki and the 2017 Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales), hands over several important messages on a blackened silver plate: Be yourself. Learn to understand and accept those who aren\u2019t exactly like you. True love can exist, but don\u2019t compromise. And so forth. Seriously, though? See it for the inventive, elaborate costumes (designed by Ellen Mirojnick), for the tiny\u2014albeit slightly creepy\u2014mushroom people and the miniature fairies wearing dandelion tutus, and for Jolie: Her prosthetic cheekbones are a teasing riff on her everyday ones\u2014they crest to a smooth but sharp edge, like the invention of an obsessive Italian industrial designer. Her poison-green eyes, rimmed with a dark halo, are unnervingly unblinking, yet you can\u2019t turn away. Her little pointy overbite is adorable. It\u2019s as if she\u2019d poured the essence of a purring leopard into her performance. Evil? Not so much. But majestically, joyously feral.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The plot of this Disney sequel is minimally taxing and essentially uninteresting, but Jolie is still majestic as a not-so-evil queen.", "authors": ["Stephanie Zacharek"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/2019_05_09_mmoe_dtlr1_4.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
