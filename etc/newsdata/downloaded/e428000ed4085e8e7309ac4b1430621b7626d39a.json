If not, I keep playing my football.\n\n\u201cMy father, who is my agent, spoke to the club. I am an Arsenal player and I have still got a two years contract.\n\n\u201cThe manager said he sees me the same way he sees every player in the team. That\u2019s why I played today and that\u2019s it. We are going to see what the future holds.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after an open game at the Commerzbank Arena where both sides wasted a plethora of chances and Frankfurt had midfielder Dominik Kohr sent off late on, Emery was full of praise for his young charges.\n\nIt was something of a vindication for the faith he has shown in Arsenal\u2019s academy products since taking the head coach\u2019s job last year and the Spaniard was delighted with both Willock and Saka \u2013 as well as Emile Smith Rowe.\n\n\u201cTheir performance tonight was good and they deserve it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe with his (Saka\u2019s) goal, with his performance, but also in the match taking confidence, finishing really strongly physically.\n\n\u201cAnd also with Emile, after his injury tonight he played for the first time this season and he worked well. Willock also, progressively he was feeling better and with a good performance.\u201d\n\nFrankfurt manager Adi Hutter has had to deal with losing his three attacking talents, Luka Jovic, Ante Rebic and Sebastien Haller over the summer \u2013 the trio having scored 56 of the club\u2019s 90 goals last season.\n\nBut, despite profligacy from new recruits Bas Dost and Andre Silva, the Austrian head coach was pleased with his side\u2019s performance, if not the final result.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bitter defeat for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause the performance does not reflect that result. When it was still 1-0 for Arsenal, we tried to score the equaliser but then conceded another one.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is for us to create chances, I have seen enough of those. A goal can help open some doors, give you a boost, that did not happen today.\u201d", "description": "Shkodran Mustafi insists he will not go to \u201cwar\u201d with Arsenal and remains focused on playing football for the club after a summer move failed to materialise.
