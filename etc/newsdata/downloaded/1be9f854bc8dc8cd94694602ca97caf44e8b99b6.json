The regular season doesn\u2019t start for another coupla weeks. But apparently unanimous number one draft pick/human Mack truck Zion Williamson is treating it like it\u2019s mid-April already, because his first \u201cofficial\u201d NBA minutes were practically destructive.\n\nIt took Zion, almost indisputably the NBA\u2019s most hyped rookie since LeBron James, all of about 3 minutes to put some poor, unsuspecting Atlanta Hawks defender in the dirt.\n\nThe prized New Orleans recruit, a giant behemoth of a man who at just 19 years of age somehow looks like he spent the past 40 years skin-grafted to a barbell, looked about ready to smash the backboard apart like it was the 4th quarter in NBA Jam on a number of occasions. All within a mere matter of minutes.\n\nZION HAS ARRIVED pic.twitter.com/wb7fNg0viy \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 7, 2019\n\nTHINGS ARE HAPPENING pic.twitter.com/AofZxdQp3i \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) October 7, 2019\n\nZion slams it home again ????

Has to be.\n\nThe internet predictably exploded with various all-caps reactions to Williamson\u2019s efforts, which saw him become a college basketball phenom during his time at Duke. But really, this one take sums up the prospect of a fully-unleashed Zion in the grown-ass NBA better than any other.\n\nseriously though, some wannabe hero is gonna step in and try and take a charge when Zion is rolling downhill and they're gonna have to identify him by his dental records \u2014 Russ Bengtson (@russbengtson) October 8, 2019\n\nOld mate fixing to turn some poor depth chart sap into a smoking crater in the ground by Christmas. Holy shit.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s the fucking pre-season.\n\nThe pre- of the season.\n\nHoly shit.", "description": "It took Zion Williamson all of about 3 minutes to announce his very physical arrival in the NBA thanks to a wild first pre-season outing.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/zion-nba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
