Jean-Paul Boetius played the ball in and Onisiwo simply turned around and unleashed a perfectly placed curling shot inside the far corner.\n\nHarit saved the best for last, however, when he took a pass from Jonjoe Kenny, went past a defender and then curled the ball with the outside of his boot inside the far past from about 15 meters (yards) despite a host of defenders in his way.\n\nSchalke moved level with Leipzig at the top of the Bundesliga ahead of the rest of the weekend\u2019s games. Leipzig visits Werder Bremen on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Amine Harit scored a late winner and set up the other goal as Schalke beat Mainz 2-1 Friday for the side's third consecutive Bundesliga win.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
