However, when it comes to protein and saturated fat content, Beyond Meat had a slight advantage. Both options are vegan and gluten free, but Impossible Foods contains genetically modified organisms (GMO) and soy. Beyond Meat burgers contain no GMOs or soy.\n\nThe biggest difference between the burgers comes from their main ingredients. The Beyond Meat burger is made of pea protein isolate (a powder made by extracting protein from yellow peas), while the Impossible Foods burger is made of heme, soy, and potato protein. Heme is an essential molecule that is found naturally in plants and animals \u2014 and what causes the Impossible burger to appear to \u201cbleed\u201d like real meat while it\u2019s being cooked.\n\nOne of the main concerns among consumers of plant-based proteins is the actual health benefits, according a recent Bank of America survey. The firm conducted a survey of 1,400 consumers to gauge overall sentiment of the alternative-meat craze. The survey found that on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being \u201cnot important\u201d and 5 being \u201cmost important,\u201d 56% of respondents said that the ingredient list is most important when making a purchase decision.\n\nBallooning market\n\nDetails on consumer preference are even more critical as the plant-based protein market balloons. Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are the biggest players right now, but companies like Tyson (TSN) and Nestle are also making their way into the game.\n\n(Yahoo Finance/David Foster) More\n\n\n\n\n\nSince going public in May, Beyond Meat has gone nuclear \u2014 not just its stock performance but also its popularity among consumers. The alternative-meat company has been aggressively partnering with restaurant chains like Dunkin\u2019 (DNKN), KFC (YUM), Del Taco (TACO) among a slew of others to grow its presence and market share in the industry.\n\nNevertheless, with shares skyrocketing more than 500% since its IPO, investors and analysts are concerned over Beyond Meat\u2019s valuation. Bullish Wall Street analysts point to the total addressable market of alternative meats. Barclays analyst Benjamin Theurer estimated that Beyond would capture about 4.5% of global market share of alternative meat in the next decade. Theurer initiated coverage of Beyond with an Outperform rating and a $185 price target Thursday. His price target represents a 19% move higher from Thursday\u2019s closing price.", "description": "The fake-meat craze appears to be here to stay, and rivals Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat (BYND) have been going head-to-head to claim dominance in the space.
