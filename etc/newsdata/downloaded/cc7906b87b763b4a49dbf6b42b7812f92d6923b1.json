So when suddenly the president of the United States started labeling impeachment proceedings as insurrectionary, I felt a blast of hot air from the past. Here\u2019s Trump this week:\n\nAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\n....People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nThis instantly became the talking point of the year for many of Trump\u2019s louder fans, as Brian Stelter notes:\n\nOliver Darcy emails: There is one word that has overtaken right-wing media over the last few days: \u201ccoup.\u201d Trump\u2019s media allies have begun referring to the impeachment inquiry as a \u201ccoup\u201d attempt by Democrats and their supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d allies. Rush Limbaugh said on his Monday program that he believes \u201cthere is a coup going on\u201d and a \u201cCold Civil War taking place.\u201d Hugh Hewitt called it a \u201ccoup attempt.\u201d And Fox\u2019s Newt Gingrich bluntly said, \u201cThis is not an impeachment process. This is a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d\n\nI could cite more examples, but the point is clear. The right-wing media machine is already working to delegitimize the impeachment process and make it seem like an anti-democratic process \u2026\n\nThis sounded familiar because it was a popular conservative revisionist history contention with regard to Richard Nixon\u2019s forced resignation 45 years ago. Here\u2019s Pat Buchanan on the 25th anniversary of the Watergate break-in:\n\nUntil I saw an unctuous individual babbling on about how our terrified city feared a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by Richard Nixon in 1974, I had decided not to write on the 25th anniversary of Watergate. But that did it. Watergate was indeed a coup. It was the overthrow of an elected president by a media and political elite he had routed in a 49-state landslide the like of which America had never seen.\n\nThis was a more common feeling on the right than you\u2019d guess from the usual popular recounting, in which a bipartisan league of decency drove Nixon from office. But if Nixon hadn\u2019t been so incredibly clumsy in taping evidence of his own obstruction of justice, and then lying about it incessantly, Republicans might have never turned on him, as Jon Schwarz recalls:\n\nIn reality, the GOP of the time wasn\u2019t that different from the GOP of 2019, and things could easily have gone the other way. Moreover, since then, much of the Republican Party has believed that Nixon was the victim of a monstrous injustice that must never be repeated \u2026\n\n[W]hat would have happened if Republicans had hung tough?\n\nA huge swath of GOP elites thought that they should have. Rather than seeing Nixon as a sinner, they thought he been sinned against. William Simon, Nixon\u2019s treasury secretary, wrote in a 1978 book called \u201cA Time for Truth\u201d that what Nixon had done was \u201ca trivial matter\u201d and his resignation was an \u201cincredible political calamity that had struck the nation.\u201d Alexander Haig, Nixon\u2019s chief of staff and later Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, felt the whole thing was illegitimate because the Democrats had been \u201cout to jail everybody\u201d for partisan gain.\n\nBut dismissing impeachment proceedings as illegitimate and insurrectionary hasn\u2019t purely been a conservative or Republican tendency. Conservative reporter Susan Jones served up an assortment of quotes from congressional Democrats in 1998 \u2014 many of them among Trump\u2019s tormenters today \u2014 describing the impeachment of Bill Clinton as a \u201ccoup.\u201d Here\u2019s one particularly pungent quote from now-Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler:\n\nThe American people are watching, and they will not forget. You may have the votes, you may have the muscle, but you do not have the legitimacy of a national consensus or of a constitutional imperative. This partisan coup d\u2019\u00e9tat will go down in infamy in the history of this Nation.\n\nNow you can make a good argument that the \u201cconstitutional imperative\u201d to restrain an aggressively imperial, out-of-control president like Trump is of a different order than any obligation to keep Bill Clinton from again having sex with an intern or lying about having sex with an intern. But however shabby the pretext for impeaching Clinton might have been \u2014 and despite his vast abuses of power, Nixon\u2019s defenders thought he was railroaded as well \u2014 it\u2019s just a bad idea for anyone to treat impeachment as somehow extraconstitutional. It is precisely the vast power and immunity from normal accountability measure characterizing the modern American presidency that makes impeachment so essential a safeguard. And impeachment is sufficiently difficult to execute (as both the Clinton and now the Trump cases illustrate) that it\u2019s hardly going to become a routine partisan weapon.\n\nOne very common element of \u201ccoup\u201d treatments of impeachment (including Trump\u2019s attacks on House Democrats) is the idea that presidents should only be accountable to the electorate, which makes his or her removal by Congress an effort to \u201creverse\u201d election results or \u201cusurp\u201d democracy. By placing impeachment of an elected president in the Constitution, the founders rather obviously anticipated precisely that sort of reversal. We don\u2019t elect presidents to become autocrats for four years, whether they are reelected comfortably like Nixon and Clinton or placed in the Oval Office in defiance of a popular majority like Trump. If impeachment and removal by Congress are carried out wantonly, Congress will have its own \u201caccountability moment\u201d with the electorate. And again, there\u2019s this problem with the \u201cinsurrection\u201d claim: How can anyone accuse House Democrats of launching a coup when they know for an almost infallible fact that he will not be removed from office by the Senate? If anything, their argument is that the voters who will adjudge Trump\u2019s first term next year need the evidence of his unfitness that only impeachment proceedings can highlight.\n\nYes, partisan defenders of embattled presidents are always going to be anguished at impeachment efforts. But I admit it makes me particularly nervous to hear \u201ccoup\u201d talk by this particular president and his intensely reactionary backers, who aren\u2019t big fans of democracy, either. We do not need Donald Trump fantasizing about an extraconstitutional response to an allegedly extraconstitutional move against him. If there are any responsible people in his circle he still listens to, they should tell him to stop acting as though tanks are circling the White House.", "description": "Donald Trump and his loudest fans are calling impeachment a \u201ccoup.\u201d So, too, did defenders of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton when impeachment proceedings against them were underway.
