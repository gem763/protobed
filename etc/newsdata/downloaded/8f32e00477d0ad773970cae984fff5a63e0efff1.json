The documents shed light on the kingdom\u2019s aggressive sportswashing strategy that included meetings and business calls with the commissioners for Major League Soccer (MLS), the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), as well as officials from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and the Los Angeles Olympic Committee.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s strategic interest in sports and entertainment events dates back to November 2016 when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the kingdom\u2019s General Sports Authority \u2013 the government body responsible for the development of sports in the kingdom \u2013 to set up a Sports Development Fund that bolstered sports activity in the country. The objectives of the fund were to privatize football clubs to increase participation, promote new sports events, and add 40,000 jobs to the economic marketplace as part of Vision 2030, a development proposal that laid out a modern, technocratic future for Saudi Arabia in which the country would be free of its heavy dependence on oil.\n\nGiven that Saudi Arabia has historically opposed Western-influenced sports and entertainment events, these recent developments seemed to represent a significant change in the ultra-conservative Islamic nation\u2019s policies and a pivot away from the kingdom\u2019s longstanding societal limitations.\n\nSince Bin Salman\u2019s policy shift was imposed in 2016, the kingdom has hosted the Race of Champions (ROC) motorsport event, secured a long-term deal with the WWE that includes multiple shows a year, hosted boxing events headlined by stars like Amir Khan, hosted a PGA European Tour golf event, and even secured the rights to host the December rematch between former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr, arguably the biggest boxing pay-per-view of the year.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia\u2019s pivot towards a more liberal society is a welcome change for the conservative kingdom, it also raises important questions about the government\u2019s relatively sudden interest in sports and whether it could be construed as a soft power tactic to help distract from the kingdom\u2019s ongoing human rights abuses and the Saudi-led coalition against Yemen \u2013 a war that killed thousands of Yemeni civilians and has left 14m people at risk of starvation.\n\nMore recently, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sports-centric lobbying offensive has been the result of an urgent need for the kingdom to rebrand itself following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was reportedly killed and dismembered with a bone-saw. Saudi\u2019s attorney general later stated that the murder was premeditated, and the CIA concluded that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nIn light of Saudi\u2019s recent diplomatic controversy, the kingdom has doubled down on its lobbying strategy, which, according to recently released documents, included meetings and business calls with all the leading commissioners and sports bodies in the United States.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority enlisted the services of the Churchill Ripley Group, an international consulting firm \u201cspecializing in growth\u201d that boasts \u201cunique access to Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the Middle East\u201d. The LA-based firm represents the General Sports Authority by working with Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, the daughter of former US ambassador Prince Bandar and the first female president of the Saudi Federation for Community Sports, to help set up meetings in the US with various companies and executives to discuss the development of Saudi\u2019s burgeoning entertainment sector. The Group\u2019s roles and responsibilities, according to the foreign registration documents, also involve negotiating favourable market terms for \u201cGSA funded initiatives,\u201d finding direct investment opportunities, and preparing Princess Reema for her high level meetings. By placing Princess Reema at the helm of this lobbying and media campaign, the Saudi government is attempting to disarm critics who bemoaned the monarchy\u2019s lack of progressive values or limited rights for women.\n\nThe firm\u2019s services, which are done without a formal contract, cost the Saudi government $22,000 a month.\n\nAccording to the foreign registration documentation (filled out by Anna Lewis, the founder and former CEO of the Churchill Ripley firm), Princess Reema had conversations with the likes of Kobe Bryant regarding the \u201cdevelopment of basketball in Saudi Arabia\u201d; Sophie Goldschmidt, the CEO of World Surf League, regarding the \u201cdevelopment of the sport of surfing in Saudi Arabia\u201d; the CEO of Thinkwell regarding the \u201cdevelopment of a sports mall in Saudi Arabia\u201d; Bing and Twitch about advancing esports in the kingdom; the NHL commissioner on developing floor hockey in Saudi; Madison Square Garden regarding the development of \u201cstadium infrastructure\u201d; and many more.\n\nThe documents also revealed that Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority held several press events in 2018, including a public event with the Atlantic Council, the Middle East Policy Council, and another event hosted by the Saudi government for Saudi US CEO forum. Princess Reema was also interviewed by MSNBC, Reuters, NPR, ESPN, and the Washington Post as part of her media campaign to promote sports development in Saudi Arabia. She was also interviewed by CNN about women driving in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt should be noted that the documentation used for this reporting only lists the Churchill Ripley\u2019s strategic consulting proposal, as well as the business calls and meetings that took place between Princess Reema and the various sports entities. They did not include any follow-up information on the fallout of such meetings, or whether they were even successful.\n\nAnd yet, the documents shed light on the Saudi government\u2019s extensive sports lobbying strategy. These examples of sportswashing \u2013 a term coined by Amnesty International in 2018 to describe authoritarian regimes using sports to manipulate their international image and wash away their human rights record \u2013 highlight the lengths the Saudi monarchy is willing to go to in order to rebrand themselves in the wake of recent atrocities. It also emphasizes the scope of Saudi\u2019s ambitions, which include potentially building new stadiums, and investing in esports and less mainstream sports such as field hockey and surfing.\n\nAs of the time of writing, none of the MLS, WSL, Madison Square Garden, or the Bryant Stibel investment group have responded to a request for comment from the Guardian. An NBA spokesperson said: \u201cNBA representatives regularly meet with basketball federations from around the world.\u201d", "description": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s relatively sudden interest in sports can be construed as a soft power tactic to help distract from the kingdom\u2019s ongoing human rights abuses", "authors": ["Karim Zidan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd9ca9f3efe943f64221256dd84629c1f650dff/0_107_3816_2292/master/3816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=343f302794339d0368d11cdf2911a3e8"}
