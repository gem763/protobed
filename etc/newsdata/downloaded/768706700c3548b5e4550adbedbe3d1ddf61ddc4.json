Holders Japan face South Africa, and Wales meet France in the remaining quarters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Irish are a great side, we have come up against them before and they have been on top,\u201d All Blacks captain Kieran Read said. \u201cWe knew the start was important and we did that well by getting points on board early.\n\n\u201cIt was a heck of a test match, really tough out there and we really felt it. It was awesome.\u201d\n\nFor Ireland\u2019s outgoing skipper Rory Best, the game represented a bitter end to his international career. He was magnanimous in defeat, however.\n\n\u201cThe All Blacks were fantastic. We felt we had prepared well and had a game plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just came out of the blocks hard and never let us get off that again. They were just really clinical.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks had not played for almost two weeks since their 71-9 victory over Namibia after their final pool game against Italy was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nThey also had not been challenged since their tournament opener against South Africa four weeks ago and fans were concerned they could be under-prepared for the intensity of a knockout match.\n\nBLISTERING PERFORMANCE\n\nSteve Hansen\u2019s side allayed those fears with a blistering and bruising performance, constantly driving Ireland back at the breakdown and in the tackle and never allowing them to get their close-running game going.\n\nThey also forced the Irish into numerous handling errors, particularly in contact inside their own half.\n\nAfter scrumhalf Smith scored his first try in the 14th minute following a sustained buildup, the All Blacks seized on two Johnny Sexton errors to put the game beyond doubt.\n\nThe Irish flyhalf failed to find touch for an attacking lineout, with his opposite number Richie Mo\u2019unga brilliantly keeping the ball in play and the All Blacks then broke into Ireland\u2019s half, Smith grabbing his second from close range three minutes later.\n\nSexton then dropped the ball on halfway in a tackle and Mo\u2019unga kicked it ahead with Beauden Barrett winning the race to give the All Blacks a 22-0 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just 22 points, it was all the ball we gave them and missed the penalties which would have given us field advantage,\u201d said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose six-year tenure with the side ended with the loss.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cIt meant we were chasing our tail and they had so much ball in our half in the first half, which was tough going.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks kept their foot on the gas in the second half, pinning Ireland inside their own territory and controlling possession with hooker Codie Taylor, replacement flanker Matt Todd, winger George Bridge and replacement Jordie Barrett also crossing.\n\nWith just over 10 minutes to go, centre Robbie Henshaw gave Ireland a face-saving try immediately after he had squandered an even better opportunity while referee Nigel Owens also awarded them a penalty try and sinbinned Todd for a professional foul.", "description": "New Zealand sent out an emphatic message that they will not relinquish their Rugby World Cup title lightly as they outclassed Ireland 46-14 in their last eight-clash on Saturday and set up a semi-final clash with England.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442656342&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0AE", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
