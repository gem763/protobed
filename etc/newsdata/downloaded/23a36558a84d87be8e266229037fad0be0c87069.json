Replays showed Rudolph\u2019s eyes rolling back as he lost consciousness, and his limbs flopped as he hit the Heinz Field turf.\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSeveral Steelers appeared to be trying to shake Rudolph awake, and JuJu Smith-Schuster was spotted sobbing on the field.\n\nShortly afterward, Rudolph was on his feet, talking to paramedics and his teammates with his facemask removed. He appeared to say \u201cI\u2019m good, I\u2019m good,\u201d as he was escorted off the field.\n\nIn a grim coda, the Steelers\u2019 cart broke down on the field, meaning Rudolph had to walk off the field on his own. It was an absurd scene given the NFL\u2019s resources and professed commitment to player safety.\n\nAccording to Gerry Dulac of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the cart failed due to operator error. The NFL has already launched an investigation.\n\nRudolph was ruled out of the game shortly afterward with a concussion:\n\n#Steelers QB Mason Rudolph will not return to today\u2019s game after being diagnosed with a concussion. \u2014 Burt Lauten (@SteelersPRBurt) October 6, 2019\n\nBefore the end of the game, Rudolph was taken to a nearby hospital for further evaluation. According to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, he has since been released from the hospital and is now resting at home.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarl Thomas on his hit that knocked Mason Rudolph out of the game: \"I didn\u2019t try to intentionally hurt him.

I hit the strike zone like we talked about, I didn\u2019t go high. I didn\u2019t try to intentionally hurt him. I\u2019m worried about him. I heard he\u2019s at the hospital. My prayers go out to him and his family.\u201d\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph was knocked unconscious and hospitalized after taking a rough hit during their game against the Ravens on Sunday.
