Now the same US Congress that brought you the Squad has spawned a new Democratic girl gang. This one consists of five white congresswomen who call themselves the Badasses. The women reportedly adopted the name because they all used to be in the military or the CIA. (Nothing screams badass like signing up to an institution that is notorious for waterboarding people.)\n\nThere has been little about the Badasses in the news because, until recently, the centrist lawmakers didn\u2019t do anything particularly newsworthy. That changed last Monday when, along with two other moderate Democrats, they published an opinion piece in the Washington Post calling for Donald Trump to be impeached over allegations he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the former vice-president Joe Biden. Less than 24 hours after the piece was published, Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThere are numerous reasons that the inquiry has finally been ordered but, according to CNN, it was the Badasses wot won it. On Saturday, CNN published a glowing profile of the women, calling them \u201cleaders on impeachment\u201d and declaring that their article \u201cchanged the dynamic for House Democrats, and indeed the course of history\u201d.\n\nExcuse me? I think the entity changing the course of history here is CNN. And by \u201cchanging\u201d I mean \u201cshamelessly whitewashing\u201d. I don\u2019t know what kind of fantasy world you have to be living in to call the Badasses \u201cleaders on impeachment\u201d when it took them until last week to decide Trump should face consequences for his actions. The real leaders here are the brown and black politicians who have spent years demanding impeachment. In May 2017, Al Green became the first congressional Democrat to call for impeachment, citing obstruction of justice, after Trump fired the FBI director James Comey. At that time, few Democrats backed the idea, but Green kept pushing, slowly gathering support.\n\nMaxine Waters, another black member of Congress, has also been tirelessly calling for Trump to face real consequences. In March she lamented that many of her colleagues \u201cwhisper the president should be impeached, but have not supported my call for impeachment. Only a few of us dare to continue to urge both Dems and Repubs to impeach this dangerous president.\u201d\n\nAmong the few who dared to publicly support Waters were members of the Squad. Indeed, the moment Rashida Tlaib was sworn into Congress she announced: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna impeach the motherfucker!\u201d She got a lot of flak for that \u201cuncivil\u201d comment. Remember: it\u2019s fine for the US president to boast about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d (that\u2019s locker-room talk!), but when other people use foul language it crosses a line.\n\nIt may be true that it didn\u2019t become politically expedient to call for impeachment until this Ukraine scandal. However, I highly doubt that Pelosi would have issued the order had it not been for a small number of brave politicians ensuring impeachment was a constant topic of conversation. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Saturday, Waters and Tlaib \u201cendured the brunt of gaslighting and vitriol for being among the first to recognise [White House] corruption and publicly advocate for impeachment, making it easier for the rest of us. People think that\u2019s easy. It\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez is right. Standing up for your principles and calling for the most powerful man in the world to be impeached when your own party doesn\u2019t support those calls isn\u2019t easy. What is easy is standing by as others get abused for advocating impeachment and then, once the idea has been mainstreamed, jumping on the bandwagon. And there\u2019s nothing badass about that.", "description": "CNN has called five white congresswomen the \u2018leaders on impeachment\u2019 \u2013 erasing the black and brown voices that blazed the trail", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d672163450ceb256a14f15a1b0c28f6ad94321/0_116_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0cf49ff32b632e4d78b0883458cc190a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
