This is what sparked the FBI inquiry led by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn May this year, after Mr Trump sooled Mr Barr onto the Mueller inquiry and mentioned he wanted Australia's help, Australia's ambassador to the US Joe Hockey told Mr Barr via letter that Australia would co-operate with his inquiry where \"relevant''.\n\nLoading\n\nUnder pressure to explain what, if any, co-operation was being given, Mr Morrison told Sky News on Wednesday that \"government officials\" were liaising with the US but ultimately, Australia would not hand over cables or anything else that was against its national interest.\n\n\"That would be a very unusual thing to do, that would be very uncommon,'' he said.\n\n\"No information should be shared that is contrary to the Australian national interest and none will be.''\n\nAsked what he would do if Mr Barr wanted to speak with Mr Downer, now a private citizen, Mr Morrison said \"we would co-operate with that request''.\n\nHe played down the import of Mr Trump's phone call to him about two weeks before he travelled to Washington, saying Mr Trump was only asking for a point of contact for Mr Barr to begin his inquiries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the government had already pledged to co-operate via Mr Hockey's letter in May, Mr Morrison said it was unremarkable that he also told Mr Trump Australia would help.\n\nHe refused to say which department was liaising with Mr Barr, and he rejected suggestions Australia was being co-opted by Mr Trump to help him settle a domestic political dispute.\n\n\"That's a matter for US politics, that's not a matter for the Prime Minister of Australia,\" he said of Mr Trump's war against the Mueller inquiry.\n\nMr Morrison said the matter was not raised during official talks while he was in Washington late last month.\n\nMr Downer, a leading conservative, has found himself the target of right-wing conspiracy theorists in the US who claim he was part of a leftist plot aligned with Ms Clinton to derail Mr Trump's tilt at the White House.\n\nMr Papadopolous is particularly vocal and claimed on Twitter last Thursday that he had a recording of his 2016 conversation with Mr Downer and was prepared to release a transcript.\n\nMr Morrison did not know if there was a recording or not.", "description": "Scott Morrison has ruled out handing the Americans classified diplomatic cables to help it torpedo the Mueller probe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8d3ca67d69c47d58f1d104494ccb6298c0335579", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
