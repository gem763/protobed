It analyzed pedestrian traffic as well as credit card spending and consumption patterns.\n\nAs recently as 2013, the dull office towers of Gwanghwamun ranked a distant 20th. But the district has soared to the top thanks in part to the huge rallies that started in downtown Seoul in late 2016 as well as other year-end events in Gwanghwamun Plaza.\n\nBut it also said more and more towers are going up, which increases the numbers of people who spend long stretches of their time there.", "description": "Gwanghwamun Tops Commercial Districts in Korea", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2018/01/04/2018010401435_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-04"}
