He needs to come before Congress and explain himself,\" Warner said.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n- Roots of the Russia investigation -\n\nThe criminal inquiry has grown out of an initial internal DoJ probe led by federal prosecutor John Durham into the beginnings of the 2016 investigation into whether members of Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow's sweeping effort to influence the election.\n\nEarlier this year Mueller concluded the investigation with a report showing dozens of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians, and demonstrating that the campaign actively sought dirt on Clinton from Moscow.\n\nMueller ruled that those activities did not rise to the level of a criminal conspiracy.\n\nMarcy Wheeler, an independent journalist who has studied deeply the Russia investigation, said Durham could be honing in on procedural errors or leaks in the early days of the Russia probe.\n\nThose could involve former campaign aide George Papadopoulos and former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn, both of whom pleaded guilty in the Mueller investigation to lying to investigators.\n\nBoth are also now seeking to reverse their convictions, alleging malfeasance by the Obama DoJ and FBI.\n\n\"There may be real crimes he's investigating, or reconsidering past charging decisions, especially leaks,\" Wheeler wrote Friday.\n\n\"But at least thus far, Durham has spent six months without corroborating the main conspiracy theories about the investigation.\"\n\n- Impeachment gaining strength -\n\nThe investigation comes as the impeachment probe in Congress gains momentum and could see formal impeachment articles presented before the end of the year.\n\nIn closed-door interviews 10 witnesses -- including White House, State Department and Defense Department officials -- have supported a whistleblower's allegations that between April and September Trump sought to force Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to open corruption investigations into Trump's possible 2020 rival Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine assisted the Democrats in 2016.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Democrats accused President Donald Trump on Friday of using the US Justice Department as a political tool after it opened a criminal probe into its own handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
