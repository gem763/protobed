James Martin, one of America\u2019s most prominent Catholic priests, is a best-selling author, film consultant to Hollywood producers and a prolific tweeter with a digital pulpit that reaches more than 250,000 followers. Father Martin is also a hero to many L.G.B.T. Catholics for challenging church leaders to recognize the full humanity of gay people. His advocacy has made him a target of vicious online campaigns from far-right Catholic groups. Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia last month warned that Father Martin \u201cdoes not speak with authority on behalf of the church.\u201d\n\nBut this week, Father Martin\u2019s ministry received an endorsement from the most authoritative of church offices. Pope Francis met with the priest, a Jesuit like the pope, during a private, half-hour conversation in the pope\u2019s library, a place often reserved for discussions with heads of state and diplomats. In a tweet, Father Martin said he shared with Francis \u201cthe joys and hopes, and the griefs and anxieties, of L.G.B.T. Catholics and L.G.B.T. people worldwide.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt Pope Francis wanted the meeting advertised. Damian Thompson, associate editor of The Spectator, a London-based conservative magazine, tweeted that the pope\u2019s meeting was \u201cintended to taunt the U.S. conservatives that he demonizes.\u201d\n\nDespite that hyperventilating, Pope Francis has made it clear that he is not afraid of the small but increasingly vocal chorus of American critics who consider his pastoral efforts to reach out to L.G.B.T. people and divorced Catholics as near heretical breaks from church tradition. In September, a reporter asked Pope Francis about his right-wing critics in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor that Americans are attacking me,\u201d the pope told Nicholas Sen\u00e8ze, a French journalist who presented the pope with his new book, \u201cHow America Wanted to Change the Pope,\u201d which chronicles efforts by conservatives in the United States to undermine the pope.", "description": "His papacy has been a consistent rebuke to American culture-war Christianity in politics.", "authors": ["John Gehring"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/opinion/04Gehring1/04Gehring1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
