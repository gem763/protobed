I\u2019m sure he wanted to get his brain bashed in. All part of his plan! \ud83e\udd21 \u2014 Mark Dice (@MarkDice) September 3, 2019\n\nIn the same way Sharon Tate managed to make Charles Manson look bad. \u2014 Maximillion Awesome (@Longjocks) September 3, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting perspective on this story \u2013 yikes \u2014 Becko (@beckodotcom) September 3, 2019\n\nMight want to re-think the wording of that tweet bruh.\n\nBecause right now it seems like you're down playing the horrific and life threatening beating he received from those domestic terrorists. \u2014 OtherBarry (@OtherBarryM8) September 3, 2019\n\nYeah, because it's so deceptive to \"demonize\" people who wear masks, travel in packs, and beat people up because they treat political rhetoric with which they disagree as if it is physical violence. Funny how that was easy to demonize when the KKK did the same thing decades ago. \u2014 (((L.N. Smithee))) (@LNSmithee) September 3, 2019\n\nWoke 2019: Rolling Stone defends an angry mob of white guys who put an Asian journalist in the hospital. Because\u2026down with white supremacy or whatnot. \u2014 Rachel \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RaychelTania) September 3, 2019\n\nThere are several, factual inaccuracies in this piece of \"journalism\". \u2014 ckferrache (@ckferrache) September 3, 2019\n\nWhen has Rolling Stone ever gotten anything wrong? But, come on, check this out:\n\nQuote from the article: \"In the ever-expanding right-wing media ecosystem, there is plenty of room for trolls with a knack for video-editing software.\" \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 C\u1d1c\u0280\u1d1b \u1d1b\u029c\u1d07 L\u026a\u0299\u1d07\u0280\u1d1b\u1d00\u0280\u026a\u1d00\u0274 (@checkmatestate) September 3, 2019\n\nYeah, and he used CGI to insert that object thrown at his head, and the cement or whatever was poured over his head.\n\nAny time I've ever seen people say Ngo is a con artist, that he faked the attack, or that he has a history of violence himself they can never back it up. I ask for examples and they just scream at me about how the burden of proof doesn't lie with them after making those claims. \u2014 LindTaylorWuzHere (@LindWuz) September 3, 2019\n\nThis is just revolting. \u2014 Nicholas (@nickxcast) September 3, 2019\n\nIt shouldn't be so hard for media to be honest, but here we are. \u2014 pirkster (@pirkster_jax) September 3, 2019\n\nThey should be demonized \u2014 Susan K (@SusanK21) September 3, 2019\n\nNine Antifa thugs were arrested in Boston over the weekend for assaulting police officers.

So radical left anti first amendment attacks Andy, attacks police, puts him in the hospital to further his agenda? You\u2019re a joke. Stick to music. Journalism is not your strong suit. \u2014 Kambree Kawahine Koa (@KamVTV) September 3, 2019\n\nGreat \"journalism\" \u2013 hacks. \u2014 Rosebud \ud83c\udf39 (@Rosebudd40) September 3, 2019\n\nAh yes, brilliant plan! He got his head bashed in in an attempt to demonize that peaceful group. He sure got lucky they lost their heads for that quick second. #deleteyouraccount \u2014 Anne (@anne_lh3) September 3, 2019\n\nI miss the days when Rolling Stone would just set up an entire frat as rapists, instead of arguing that an Asian man is \"demonizing antifa\".\n\nNeat trick that\u2026 demonizing the guys setting Starbucks on fire, covering their faces, and literally BEATING HIM UP. \u2014 John Abbott (@johnabbottnet) September 3, 2019\n\nI wonder who the editors are for todays mens magazines like GQ, Rolling Stone, etc. They are all far left, and hate anyone who dares be right of centre, or even centre right for that matter. They have become stale, boring, and monolithic, the 2020's hopefully ditch the woke sh*t \u2014 Veneration (@depthhidden) September 3, 2019\n\nBy getting attacked by violent extremist scum in Portland? Yeah, I'm sure Andy loved getting concussed. What a shit take from a shit writer. \"Journalist\" isn't the right word for this smear merchant. \u2014 FHS Badger (@FHSBadger) September 3, 2019\n\nRatio in action \u2014 Danillo (@Danillaco) September 3, 2019\n\nIf this story were done involving a non conservative journalist and a right wing group, all hell would break loose. Rolling Stone would issue an apology but still face boycotts and public shaming. We've hit a new low, folks. \u2014 Tired of the political fighting (@tired_fighting) September 3, 2019\n\nI guess the Boston Bomber is more your speed. \u2014 ariel jones \ud83d\udd4a (@arieljones411) September 3, 2019\n\nOuch. True, but ouch.\n\nSo Andy\u2019s skirt was too short and he was asking for it? \u2014 ShredderGirl (@ShredderBabe) September 3, 2019\n\nHoly shit what happened to Rolling Stone!? \u2014 NecroDoomMonkey (@necrodoommonkey) September 3, 2019\n\nHeaven forfend people demonize extremists! Forget left and right. The real fight is between good people and extremists. You've picked the wrong side. \u2014 Christopher (@widnesiac) September 3, 2019\n\nDon't mind me.. just watching @RollingStone dig it's own grave. \u2014 nickvmeel (@nickvmeel) September 3, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "All Andy Ngo had to do to \"demonize\" antifa was to try to capture them on video doing their thing.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/portland-antifa-protest-ngo.jpg"}
