Other back-door contacts with Russians became the subject of a two-year investigation of the Trump campaign and foreign interference in the election.\n\nNow, Trump is pushing a largely discredited story about Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his position as a director of a Ukrainian energy company. Trump has meanwhile acknowledged discussing Joe Biden\u2019s anti-corruption activities in Ukraine with that country\u2019s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running the same playbook essentially,\u201d said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth University professor who studies political scandals. \u201cThis is the same pattern repeating itself.\u201d\n\nBut 2020 is not 2016. And Biden is not Clinton. Here\u2019s how the two cases differ:\n\nThe Allegation\n\nTrump\u2019s allegation, unsupported by evidence, is that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general in 2016 in order to stop an investigation of Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.\n\nBiden, as vice president, did demand that Ukraine oust its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, for corruption. And he later said he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees from Ukraine unless its leaders dismissed Shokin. The Ukrainian parliament wound up voting to remove the prosecutor.\n\nBut Shokin\u2019s top deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, told Bloomberg News that the investigation into Burisma Holdings had been dormant for more than a year before Biden addressed corruption issues with Ukraine\u2018s president. The European Union and Ukraine\u2019s creditors also sought Shokin\u2019s dismissal.\n\n\u201cThe elements of scandal are much weaker on the Hunter Biden side than they were with Clinton,\u201d Nyhan said. \u201cAnd comparably the evidence is much stronger on the Trump side.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s anti-corruption message to Ukraine in 2016 was consistent with Barack Obama\u2019s national security policy and had been vetted by National Security Council staffers, said a former Obama administration official who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. The concern wasn\u2019t that Shokin was too aggressive in pursing political corruption \u2014 it was that he wasn\u2019t aggressive enough.\n\nThose concerns were shared by other Western leaders, said former Obama National Security Council spokesman Ned Price. \u201cIt was something very much a live issue around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Tuesday that the allegations were being floated by the \"same people who invented the Russian hoax and wasted tens of millions of dollars over the last two years to come up with absolutely nothing.\"\n\nThe Rules\n\nClinton broke the rules, if not the law, by keeping classified information on a home email server. The FBI decided not to bring criminal charges against the former secretary of state. But the arrangement did violate federal records laws and State Department policies, an inspector general report said.\n\nThere\u2019s no comparable investigation into Biden, and there\u2019s no allegation that he violated Ukrainian or U.S. law. While ethics experts questioned the appearance of Hunter Biden\u2019s arrangement at the time, ethics rules do not apply to the grown offspring of U.S. officials, and there\u2019s no legal requirement for the president or vice president to recuse themselves from subjects where family members also have an interest.\n\nThe Image\n\nFairly or unfairly, Clinton developed a reputation over 25 years in public life as being opaque about her projects. During the Whitewater land-deal controversy, subpoenaed billing records from her law firm were discovered in the White House residence with her fingerprints on them -- after she said they were missing.\n\nBiden has no similar baggage. His public image has been caricatured as being gaffe-prone, uncomfortably touchy and given to long, rambling anecdotes. He dropped out of the 1988 Democratic presidential primary after being accused of plagiarism, but has never faced an ethics scandal.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It feels like deja vu: Donald Trump brands a Democratic rival as corrupt even as he\u2019s accused of enlisting the help of a foreign country to help push the story.In 2016, it was Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server to conduct State Department business \u2014 and her decision to delete", "authors": ["Gregory Korte", "Justin Sink"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q97a09TcQAix70QY0p1q0g--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f9e0e9614c087b96a1736b3bc993ae55", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
