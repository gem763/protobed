Jim Jordan (R-OH) heavily criticized Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for his lack of transparency in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\nJordan, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told Fox News Schiff, along with Reps. Elliot Engel and Elijah Cummings, releasing only some of the text messages between U.S. diplomats after former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker's testified to Congress, without releasing the full transcript, shows how shady the Democrats are handling the inquiry.\n\n\"We're going to continue to try to get the facts and figure out more about what took place with this whole complaint and when it started and continue to tell the American people the truth,\" Jordan said on Wednesday, saying Volker's nine-hour testimony proves Trump did not engage in quid-pro-quo with Ukrainian military aid.\n\n\"There were 67 pages of text messages. Adam Schiff took a few of those text messages and released them. Release them all, release them all, and more importantly release the entire transcript,\" he continued. \"We're talking about impeaching the President of the United States thirteen months before an election based on an anonymous whistleblower with no firsthand knowledge who has a bias against the President.\"\n\nJordan said if Trump was able to release the transcript of his phone call with Ukraine, then Schiff should release the transcript of Volker's testimony.\n\n\"This is an act of desperation by the Democrats. They know that Volker\u2019s testimony was a huge flop. They're running scared,\" a congressional aide with direct knowledge of Volker's testimony told Townhall.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/09/2019 14:33:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/282/8f9cc7d8-3be4-4fa9-8583-98c38bba3aea.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
