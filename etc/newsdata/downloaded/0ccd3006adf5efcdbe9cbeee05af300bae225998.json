Had this been enacted prior to the World Cup final, when both England and New Zealand scored 15 runs in the Super Over after earlier scoring 241 in their full 50 overs, then there would have been another Super Over.\n\nAlthough the ICC has changed the rules for future ICC events - ruling that group matches will be adjudged a tie if the Super Over is tied, but that there will be another Super Over if the Super Over is tied in knockout games - the new rules will be glimpsed very rarely.", "description": "England would not have won the 2019 Cricket World Cup under the International Cricket Council\u2019s new tiebreak rules for knockout matches.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Michael Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000203796692-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpYXgImHvDk4V15T1DyRqQvAN63ALzd3l6ruZlbyd-JQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
