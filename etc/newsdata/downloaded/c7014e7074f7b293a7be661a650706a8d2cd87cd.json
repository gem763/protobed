Why? They didn't trust her with the details of the operation.\n\n\u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before. There\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s no country in the world that leaks like we do. And Washington is a leaking machine. And I told my people we will not notify them until our great people are out. Not just in, but out. I don\u2019t want to have them greeted with firepower like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Trump announced after the raid, confirming al-Baghdadi was dead.\n\nThis didn't sit well with Pelosi or her fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region. Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington,\u201d she released in a statement.\n\nBut former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is calling Pelosi out on her outrage and said during an interview with Fox and Friends this week that it is standard practice not to inform the Speaker, or other politicians, of sensitive military operations.\n\nThe idea that politicians need to be briefed on a military operation while young men &women are risking their lives is ridiculous. When I was Speaker, there were operations I wasn't briefed on until over. Pelosi knows this, but couldn't resist an opportunity to attack Pres.

That request has been granted.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:53:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/302/c2dbe4ad-e53f-4dfc-af1e-7fd76dfb2368.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
