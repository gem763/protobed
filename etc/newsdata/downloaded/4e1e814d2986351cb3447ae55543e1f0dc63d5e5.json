A Psychology Today post from 2014 cites an interview with Conron in which he decries \u201cbackyard breeders\u201d that have \u201cjumped on the bandwagon\u201d he started. The breeder makes the same laments in a 2016 blog post, writing of the \u201cmania\u201d that followed labradoodles\u2019 rise to prominence.\n\n\u201cNew breeds began to flood the market: groodles, spoodles, caboodles and snoodles,\u201d he says.\n\nThe breeder says he coined \u201cLabradoodle\u201d in the 1980s while searching for the perfect guide dog for a woman who wrote him from Hawaii, saying she needed an animal that did not shed given her husband\u2019s allergies.\n\nA breeding manager at the time for the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia, Conron initially thought of giving her a poodle, because of the breed\u2019s minimal shedding. But more than 30 poodle tryouts later, the ABC reported, Conron decided the dog simply was not cut out to assist a blind person.\n\nIt took him three years from the woman\u2019s letter to concoct a solution: a hybrid that would combine the Labrador\u2019s knack for guide-dog skills \u2014 an \u201caffable, controllable nature,\u201d he says \u2014 with the poodle\u2019s convenient curls. Nine weeks later, he had three puppies, according to the ABC.\n\nOne of the pups, named Sultan, was set to go to Hawaii. But the other two languished unwanted with Conron, the breeder recalled, until he got the idea to rebrand them, from a \u201ccrossbreed\u201d to a new kind of nonallergenic dog with the quirky name \u201clabradoodle.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you get onto the media and tell them that we\u2019ve bred a special breed?\u201d Conron recalled telling public-relations staff at the Royal Guide Dogs Association in his interview with the ABC.\n\nThe ploy worked. Calls poured in asking after a \u201cwonder dog,\u201d Conron said.\n\nThe labradoodle set off an intense interest in so-called \u201cdesigner dogs,\u201d which started to fetch prices beyond those of their purebred parents and over the decades have attracted the attention of famous figures such as Miley Cyrus and former president Barack Obama.\n\nThe hype over hybrids has set off some squabbling in the dog world, as purebred enthusiast breeders accused their designer dog counterparts of chasing profits rather than canine perfection.\n\n\u201cA breeder of a purebred dog is really a kind of artist,\u201d David Frei, a former co-host of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, told Bloomberg News. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a work of art that shows all the best traits of a particular breed.\u201d\n\nDesigner breeders are \u201clooking for the moneymaking venture,\u201d another critic told Bloomberg.\n\nConron says he, too, quickly grew wary that some unscrupulous people were breeding labradoodles, goldendoodles, schnoodles and more without taking the proper precautions to avoid unhealthy pups.\n\nThose concerns are valid, Arizona labradoodle breeder Cheryl Quitoriano told The Post, pointing as an example to the perils of \u201cdouble merles\u201d \u2014 dogs bred from two parents with marbled coats that have a high risk of hearing problems.\n\n\u201cSo many people don\u2019t know this type of stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get people who are just uneducated, breeding things together.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not a labradoodle-specific problem, Quitoriano added. She said she has no idea why Conron would say most Labradoodles are \u201ccrazy\u201d or have a \u201chereditary problem,\u201d as he\u2019s told media outlets. She said breeders have been somewhat baffled by Conron\u2019s comments over the years.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an awesome breed,\u201d she said. \u201cI will say that until the cows come home.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also in high demand, said Al Gordy, treasurer and former president of the Australian Labradoodle Association of America. Some 70,000 labradoodles around the world are registered with the ALAA, he said.\n\nAssociations like the ALAA help ensure dogs are bred with health testing, he said.\n\n\u201cThe breed is a passion for all of us,\u201d said Gordy.\n\nThen there\u2019s Conlon, who as of 2016 owned two Labradors but zero labradoodles in his retirement. He writes that his \u201cfirst\u201d passion is not dogs at all, but horses.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Trump administration weakened Endangered Species Act rules.
