Not a promotion. No catches. Period,\" founder and Chairman Charles Schwab said in a news release. \"Price should never be a barrier to investing for anyone, whether an experienced investor or someone just starting on the investing path.\"\n\nOptions traders, who currently pay an additional 65 cents per contract on top of the $4.95, will continue to pay that fee.\n\nFor comparison's sake, E*TRADE (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) currently charge a standard $6.95 for stock, ETF and options trades (plus an additional 75 cents per options contract) made online. Both do offer commission-free trading on some exchange-traded funds.\n\nSchwab, which has no minimum account size to open a brokerage account, says the new pricing scheme will apply to any current web or mobile client, without requiring a new deposit or creating a new account.\n\nWhile investors who stand to benefit from Schwab's changes may have been celebrating on Tuesday morning, investors in SCHW and other online brokerage companies headed toward the exits. Schwab's stock dipped 9% soon after the open, while AMTD dropped 21% and ETFC declined nearly 18%.\n\nSEE ALSO: The 45 Cheapest Index Funds in the ETF Universe\n\nEDITOR'S PICKS\n\n\n\nCopyright 2019 The Kiplinger Washington Editors", "description": "Schwab's commissions to vanish Oct. 7; online broker stocks dive in response", "authors": ["Kyle Woodley", "Senior Investing Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WQxifXKMSZuYoVMoRrsHMg--~B/aD04NDI7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/kiplinger.com/f80380e42c26cf0726cf5bcb0baf7489", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
