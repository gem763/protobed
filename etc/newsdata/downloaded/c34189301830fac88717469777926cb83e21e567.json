So we sent someone to cover the \u2018hurricane.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe had some little card things out \u2014 says how to be prepared. That\u2019s about all we had,\u201d a cashier at the Ship & Store on Dauphin Island said on a cloudless Saturday afternoon. \u201cDo you need your receipt?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s always calmest in the center of a storm, sometimes even political ones. The rest of the United States is basically the eyewall: an ever-widening vortex of outrage and bureaucratic retaliations whirling around Trump\u2019s false weather reports.\n\nHis first, in a Sept. 1 tweet, warned that Alabama was one of the states that \u201cwill most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by the hurricane \u2014 which by then was swerving away from the state. The tweet caused Alabamians to call the National Weather Service en masse, which caused the agency\u2019s Birmingham office to rebut Trump and late-night comedians to write jokes. This in turn caused the White House to double down \u2014 disseminating outdated or doctored weather forecasts in an attempt to prove Trump correct, culminating Friday when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publicly chastised its own forecasters for telling Alabamians they were safe.\n\nAnd yet they were safe, and they knew it.\n\n\u201cNone of us were really worried about it,\u201d said Frankie Austin, 22, a heavy lifter at a marine supply company in Mobile. \u201cI don\u2019t really usually keep up with Trump\u2019s thoughts, or his, you know, quotes he be tweeting. All we got was a 30 percent chance of rain, and the rest of the weekend was just sunny.\u201d\n\nOn a residential street fronting Mobile Bay, the only apparent sign of damage Saturday was a fallen tree in front of Elizabeth Van Antwerp\u2019s house. Sitting on her porch with her partner, she explained that termites felled it. There had been no sign of any storm on Bayfront Road.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even buy extra groceries,\u201d Van Antwerp said. \u201cIt was gorgeous weather, absolutely beautiful.\u201d\n\nShe has lived here since 2004, when Hurricane Ivan took half her neighbor\u2019s roof off. The next year, Hurricane Katrina flooded Van Antwerp\u2019s house from the front door to the back, and a subsequent storm washed away her fishing pier. So she knows a thing or two about Alabama weather.\n\n\u201cI would say the president is not a meteorologist, would be the nicest way to say it,\u201d Van Antwerp said.\n\n\u201cThat . . . idiot,\u201d added her partner, Anthony Miller, with an expletive. \u201cPardon my French.\u201d\n\nSeveral sailing clubs flank the coast between Mobile and the beach towns on Alabama\u2019s southernmost shores. Their memberships comprise a mix of Trump supporters and Trump loathers, and few of the sailors inside wished to be quoted in a newspaper about something as politically charged as a weather forecast.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about it at all,\u201d said a man inside Buccaneer Yacht Club. \u201cI have the ability to, you know, look at the weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were actually worried,\u201d countered Noel Miller, 51, as he pulled up a seat at the bar. \u201cWe really appreciate that it was a concern.\u201d\n\nMiller used to have a Star Class two-man racing boat, until Hurricane Katrina washed it out into the bay. Now he has a Finn named Liberty, which he fretted over late last month as Dorian bore down on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe were all making plans for our boats,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything can come into the Gulf at that point. I think [Trump] understated the seriousness of it.\u201d\n\nThat said, the Liberty is fine.\n\nTo be fair to the president, he never said Dorian threatened Mobile County specifically, as opposed to any other part of Alabama. But a week into Trump\u2019s false prediction, it\u2019s impossible to discern exactly what he did have in mind.\n\nHe said Wednesday that Alabama initially faced a 95 percent chance of a direct hit. On Saturday, he claimed he never said any such thing. He said at one point that Dorian may get \u201ca little piece\u201d of Alabama and, on another occasion, showed off a hurricane forecast map that had been altered with a Sharpie to enclose the state\u2019s southeastern corner \u2014 including towns about 100 miles inland, which are typically hurricane-free.\n\nHistorically, it is Mobile County and surrounding coastal areas that get the worst of Alabama\u2019s storms. Dauphin Island, connected to the mainland by a disconcertingly long bridge, was hit so hard by Hurricane Georges in 1998 that entire houses went skidding across the sand like errant beach umbrellas.\n\nOn Saturday, the Dauphin Island public beach and all its houses lay safe beneath the sun. Offshore oil rigs sat unmolested along a blue horizon, and tourists splashed in the Gulf while Dorian terrorized distant latitudes, after leaving wreckage in the Carolinas and devastation in the Bahamas.\n\nMichael Watts Jr. had been planning a family trip to the island for weeks for his 33rd birthday. He ended up leaving his 3-year-old daughter at home in Atlanta, he said, because of Trump\u2019s insistence on a chance of hurricane.\n\n\u201cAfter that I found out the Weather Channel said there\u2019s not going to be anything out here,\u201d Watts said as he and his fiancee walked back from a stretch of immaculate sand. \u201cI was p-----. [My daughter] would have loved to see this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is chief of command, so you have to obey him,\u201d Watts reflected on the White House weatherman. \u201cBut to hell with it. He doesn\u2019t pay my bills.\u201d\n\nNOAA staff warned in Sept. 1 directive against contradicting Trump\n\nTracking Hurricane Dorian", "description": "Trees stand. Grocery stores are fully stocked.
