(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nRemember when Ryan Reynolds thought it\u2019d be cute to troll everyone with a fake leak of Detective Pikachu before the movie came out earlier this year? Warner Bros. would apparently like to make up for that.\n\nWarner Bros. has uploaded the first 10 minutes of Detective Pikachu for all those folks out there who\u2019ve yet to see the movie \u2014 and anyone who wants to recapture the wonder of seeing a boatload of Pok\u00e9mon bustling around in a big, live-action city. But the real star of the extended clip is Mewtwo, who factors rather largely into the mystery at the centre of the film that only the talking Pikachu (Ryan Reynolds) and his new best buddy Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) can solve.\n\nWith a sequel to Detective Pikachu on the way, Warner Bros. has got to be thinking about how it\u2019s going to top the first film\u2019s surprisingly solid action sequences, beyond simply throwing more cool Pok\u00e9mon into the mix and letting them mix it up on the battlefield the way we\u2019ve become used to seeing in the animated series.\n\nThen again, you know what? Perhaps that\u2019s exactly what the studio should do.", "description": "Remember when Ryan Reynolds thought it\u2019d be cute to troll everyone with a fake leak of Detective Pikachu before the movie came out earlier this year?
