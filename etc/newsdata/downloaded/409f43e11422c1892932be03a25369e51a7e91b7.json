Shutterstock\n\nIt's not alone in battling these conditions. On Tuesday morning, Bega Cheese delivered a profit warning due to drought pushing up milk costs and demand in export markets sagging.\n\nBut having downgraded profits in January and May, Costa now says it will deliver lease-adjusted EBITDA of $98 million in calendar 2019 \u2013 well under consensus for $137.9 million and \u2013 and $150 million in 2020. But this is predicated on a \u201cmodest improvement of dry weather and drought conditions\u201d. That seems a big caveat.\n\nBut Debney emphasised that hat as Australia\u2019s largest grower and packer of fresh fruit and vegetables, Costa is best placed to withstand the tumult going through the industry.\n\nIn some categories, Debney said, smaller producers are likely to be operating at a loss or close to it. In others, such as blueberries, farms are being put on the sale block, or converted back into hobby farms.\n\nThe suggestion was that Costa\u2019s competitive advantage should be enhanced if it can ride this out, and wait for the inevitable consolidation.\n\nDebney might be right.
