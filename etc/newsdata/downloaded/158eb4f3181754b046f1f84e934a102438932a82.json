An email seeking comment was sent to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokeswoman.\n\nBailey says if requirements change, or Canadian law enforcement becomes available, the state can consider returning service to Prince Rupert.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The state of Alaska says it's ending ferry service to and from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, effective Oct. 1, citing an inability to comply with U.S. security requirements.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
