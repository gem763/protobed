Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help, in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nWhat types of clothes would you suggest to a man (well) over 50 who wants to update his casual wardrobe?\n\nFunnily enough, I just had a long discussion about this with a friend\u2019s dad when we ran into each other in Istanbul. Over an ice-cold bottle of Uluda\u011f Premium Sparkling Natural Mineral Water, he explained that he never felt truly comfortable shopping, and therefore his default setting was ultracasual. I told him, as I will now tell you, stick to classics, make sure it all fits well, and swag out baby! Age ain\u2019t nothing but a number.\n\nRRL Slim Fit Selvedge Jean Start with a pair of simple RRL five-pocket slim-fit selvedge jeans. Ralph Lauren might be the best-dressed man (well) over 50. You cannot go wrong, and with proper care, they will last forever. $295 at Ralph Lauren Buy\n\nSid Mashburn Cashball Traveler's Trench This navy Sid Mashburn trench coat is filled with the leftover cashmere fuzz (!!!) collected while making sweaters. A proper trench that can also keep you warm? Brilliant and chic! If you like the look of it, Sid Mashburn also makes a less expensive nylon version that looks just as sharp. $795 at Sid Mashburn Buy\n\nJ. Crew Everyday Cashmere Crewneck Sweater Since the rest of your look is pretty understated, why not give it a little FLAVOR with this J.Crew cashmere sweater in a great shade of pink. If the pink is too much flavor for your taste, it comes in 13 other colors, too. $118 at J. Crew Buy\n\nChurch's McFarlane Boot Men of a certain age often make errors with footwear when trying to seem young and hip. Some might advise Converse Chuck Taylors to complete this outfit; NOT I. I still have PTSD from when every rich older guy with a young girlfriend and a David Yurman bracelet was wearing those John Varvatos washed canvas laceless Converse. Yikes. A man of your stature should wear a pair of proper shoes. These Church\u2019s brogue boots are elegant but outfitted with a big-boy shitkicker commando sole. Suitable for all occasions. $670 at Zappos Buy\n\nOliver Peoples Grey Sheldrake Sunglasses Top it off with a tonal gray pair of sunglasses from Oliver Peoples. Perfect for leaving that power lunch at La Scala. No one will ask for your AARP Card, I promise. $405 at SSENSE Buy\n\nA handful of my friends and relatives are turning 30 over the next few months. I need to get gifts for each and want them to be slightly more special than your normal knick-knack or bottle of Veuve. Any ideas?\n\nBaccarat Harmonie Tumbler, Set of 2 I hope your friends and relatives have good taste! I agree a $60 bottle of Veuve isn\u2019t unique. But if the birthday girl/boy loves the sauce, get them a proper vessel to enjoy it from. A set of two Baccarat Clear crystal Harmonie tumblers will make any spirit taste better. $370 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nRaawii Str\u00f8m Large Bowl Something for the home is always nice. This sculptural Str\u00f8m Bowl from Raawii comes in a myriad of colors (I am partial to coral blush and vibrant orange) that would make anyone happy. $105 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\niittala Aalto Vase, Large In that same vein, you cannot go wrong with a clear Aalto Vase. Introduced in 1937 at the World\u2019s Fair, the wild shape is iconic and looks great in most settings. $200 at Amazon Buy $200 at Macy's Buy\n\nMark Leckey, Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, at Tate Britain, 2019 It\u2019s always nice to receive a print or exhibition poster from an artist you like. I would love it if someone gave me this \u201cMark Leckey, Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore\u201d limited-edition signed print from Leckey\u2019s current exhibition at the Tate Britain. Anyway, pick something appropriate, send it to Framebridge, and make someone so happy that they forget they are turning 30. [New Found Glory voice:] \u201cCause it\u2019s all downhill from here\u2026\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: The price below has been converted from British pounds.] $322 at Tate Britain Buy\n\nWhat do you look for in a winter scarf? I\u2019m interested in something simple but cozy.\n\nCashmere, baby. I only want luxe fabrics touching my sensitive neck. But, a scarf is also an excellent opportunity to get a little funky, an easy way to play with prints and colors. Let\u2019s \u2026 explore.\n\nBurberry Fringed Checked Cashmere Scarf My No. 1 suggestion has got to be the classic Burberry check. A timeless scarf that will instantly give you that \u201970s and \u201980s \u201cSloane Ranger\u201d style. I owned one of these during my party days and left it in a booth at some disgusting bar below 14th Street. It might be time to buy another one. $430 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nMissoni Space-Dyed Cashmere and Wool Blend Scarf Let\u2019s go to Mars! Missoni added its signature space-dyed stripes to this simple navy cashmere-and-wool blend. Just the right amount of pop. $470 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nBarbour Fringed Tartan Scarf If you want to keep it preppy, classic, and affordable, cop this tartan merino-cashmere blend from Barbour. Maybe it will help you attract that horse girl you have been lusting after. $80 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
