(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday that President Trump ordered the State Department and Pentagon to withhold military aid to Ukraine in part to pressure the country to investigate interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about,\u201d said Mulvaney during a press conference.\n\nWhen a reporter pointed out that Mulvaney was describing a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in withholding the military aid package, Mulvaney responded, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were holding up money at the same for the Northern Triangle Countries [Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador]\u2026so that they would change their policies on immigration,\u201d Mulvaney continued.\n\nHowever, Mulvaney denied that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine specifically to pressure the country to conduct investigations into Joe Biden.\n\nPresident Trump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into whether he did in fact use military aid to pressure Ukraine to look into corruption allegations against Biden. In July, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, over a week after he halted the transfer of $391 million earmarked by Congress for Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani allege that Biden was involved in a conflict of interest while heading Ukraine policy as vice president.\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company which had been under investigation by then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Victor Shokin. In 2016, Joe Biden, at the behest of U.S. and European Union officials, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin, who was himself accused of corruption.", "description": "The acting White House chief of staff said Trump ordered the State Department and Pentagon to withhold military aid in part to pressure Ukraine.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
