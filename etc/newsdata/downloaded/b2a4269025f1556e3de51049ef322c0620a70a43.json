She is just fuming that I 'didn't get Jamie recruiting' for her like she asked me to...\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nNow Danielle has lashed out again for \"pathetic\" Becky singling her out, telling New magazine: \"I obviously hit a nerve. Attack is the best form of defence by the looks of it.\"\n\nShe went on: \"I've had my own run-ins with Becky and she hasn't been very nice about me. I'm not going to disclose why we fell out, but Becky knows what she did. It was like she had a vendetta against me.\"\n\nDanielle, who was previously married to footballer Jamie O'Hara, claimed Becky had DMed her when she was still unknown and asked to hang out together.\n\n\"I thought she wanted to be friends - and then later I felt she turned against me. So when Coleen posted her message, I couldn't wait to add my rat comment. For me, it was karma,\" she said.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nTurning her attention to the Wagatha Christie drama gripping the nation, Danielle lambasted the source of the fake Rooney stories as either \"massively desperate or horrible\".\n\n\"Coleen's not interested in being famous, she just wants to be happy and live a drama-free life. I think Becky seems to be constantly looking for fame - but I don't think she's quite achieved the levels of it she thought she would!\" she went on.\n\n\"Even in the lower leagues there's rivalry between [the WAGs]. It's all about who's got the biggest house, the best handbag... It's a really competitive world. But not all of them are like that. Coleen is a prime example of someone who's so lovely, down-to-earth and family-orientated.\"\n\nDanielle added that whoever was ratting out her friend should come clean, insisting: \"If Becky didn't do it, as she says, someone is responsible for hurting Coleen and they should bite the bullet and own up.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt comes after Becky admitted she shunned other WAGs in a recent unearthed interview.\n\nSpeaking to Closer magazine, the wife of Jamie Vardy blasted the women who belong to the \"very fake world\" of WAGgery.\n\n\"When you're forced into friendships, or forced to become friends with someone because your husband pays for the same team, it's weird,\" said Becky.\n\n\"I don't buy into fake friends. I won't be friends with someone because their husband or boyfriend plays for the same team. I'm lucky to have the friends I have, I've got a close circle and I trust them implicitly.\"", "description": "Former WAG Danielle Lloyd weighed in on the Wagatha Christie affair after Becky Vardy accused her of making up their previous 'run-ins'", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555980.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-10-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
