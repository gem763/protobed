I am aware that not all grandparents are saints, so there can be a good reason why a child is being excluded. But not in these numbers.\n\n'The experience of many of the children who ring Childline is that grandparents are a place of safety and security if things are going badly wrong in the parental life.'\n\nDame Esther added: 'Estrangement from their grandchildren has been described to me by grandparents as a living bereavement and by grandchildren as a real loss. I've heard, for example, of a grandson who was even prevented from saying goodbye to his grandmother when she was dying.'\n\nDiana Dunk, 73, from Oxfordshire, said she had not seen her three grandsons for almost four years due to strained relations with her daughter-in-law.\n\nHeartbreaking: Grandparents say its a real struggle to be apart from their loved ones after their in-laws have stopped contact\n\nMs Dunk described how she had been excluded from the children's birthdays, Christmases and family holidays.\n\nEven pleas to attend one grandson's cricket matches had been turned down.\n\n'I never thought that I would not have a natural relationship with my grandchildren,' Ms Dunk said. 'When you have grandchildren, it's an unconditional love. It's a very special relationship and when it's taken away, it's just a travesty for the grandparent and the grandchild.\n\n'It breaks your heart \u2013 you feel very isolated and alone. Unless people have been through it, they don't understand.'", "description": "One in seven British grandparents are being stopped from seeing their grandchildren, new findings show.
