That will bring a range of bug fixes for problems that still exist in iOS 13, as well as the features that have been held back.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The software update option will be in there, and clicking the relevant buttons will make your iPhone start downloading and installing iOS 13.\n\nIn the past, this process has been fairly slow in the minutes after the update goes live. That means that it can be easier just to wait for a few hours, at which point the interest will have calmed down and the downloads will have sped up.\n\nWith last year's iOS 12, Apple introduced the option for auto-updates. So, if that's turned on, the phone will offer you the option to schedule the download to happen overnight, which could be a good way to avoid the long wait that the update requires.\n\nThe watchOS update should arrive at the same time. That is done by opening up the \"Watch\" app and clicking \"general\", where the software update option can be found.", "description": "Apple is about to release iOS 13, the latest major update to the iPhone operating system.
