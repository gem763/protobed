Sign up here.\n\nThe repo market has calmed down, but the Federal Reserve is gearing up its safeguards seemingly to prevent turmoil from resurfacing on Monday.\n\nLast week\u2019s craziness was not the first time in recent memory that U.S. money markets have shown signs of stress. It\u2019s tended to happen around quarter-end, most notably in late December.\n\nThe third quarter ends Monday. So, for the past two days, the New York Fed has run $100 billion overnight repo operations -- bigger than the $75 billion daily liquidity injections that began early last week -- plus separate 14-day operations. Neither of Friday\u2019s actions were fully subscribed and short-term lending rates are well below the peak seen last week, a sign order has been restored for now.\n\nBut on Monday, that larger $100 billion size will be repeated and the overnight operation will run from 7:45 a.m. to 8 a.m. New York time, earlier than prior morning actions. Both signal the Fed is getting ready in case rates spike again.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some volatility,\u201d said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. \u201cThe Fed has provided enough liquidity for now, but there are some large Treasury settlements so you\u2019ll have large pressures.\u201d\n\nShe was referring to the fact that two-, five- and seven-year Treasuries that were auctioned this week by the U.S. government are settling -- or being issued -- on Monday. That will push collateral into the market at a time when investors are still clamoring for cash, potentially getting the repo market\u2019s supply and demand out of whack again.\n\nIt looks like rates will increase some Monday. The quarter-end rate for repurchase agreements is being quoted at about 2.87% Friday afternoon, according to Scott Skyrm, executive vice president at broker-dealer Curvature Securities. While that\u2019s down from 3.25% earlier in the day, it\u2019s above the current general collateral repo rate of 1.80%, according to ICAP data. Skyrm sees it opening on Monday at around 2.50% before moving lower throughout the morning, he wrote in a report.\n\nThe overnight repo rate soared to a record high of 10% last week amid a funding crunch that drew scrutiny to the size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and fueled calls for the central bank to start injecting liquidity.\n\nThe central bank responded to the funding pressures, which appeared to be building around quarter-end, with three term operations this week and a daily schedule of overnight actions through Oct. 10.\n\nAs of now, it appears that the New York Fed \u201cwas able to satiate primary dealer demand for term funding at these rate levels,\u201d Jon Hill, a strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. \u201cThe question then becomes how much of the reserve infusion will be able to permeate through markets and reach other participants.\u201d\n\nHe said that while there may still be upward pressure on short-term rates on Monday, it may be more muted than some fear.\n\n(Updates rates and their outlook in 7th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Debarati Roy\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The repo market has calmed down, but the Federal Reserve is gearing up its safeguards seemingly to prevent turmoil from resurfacing on Monday.Last week\u2019s craziness was not the first time", "authors": ["Alexandra Harris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
