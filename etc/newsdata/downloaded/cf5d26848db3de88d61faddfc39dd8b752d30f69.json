This happened five times in an hour before I casually concluded that I must have appeared on some sort of Nazi forum somewhere. I decided against informing my friends and family, turned over and went to sleep. In 2019, given the state of our political discourse, this just seemed an inevitable thing to have happened and not worth the undue worry.\n\nBut the weeks went by and, every so often, I\u2019d be confronted with that collage yet again. It all seemed quite unreal, like a game of Whac-a-Mole, in which I had to block far-right racists on social media as quickly as I could.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

\u201cAnti-Semitic trolls are creating an online list of Jewish people who are critical of white nationalism,\" it stated. So my suspicions were correct. I had been put out of my misery and entered into an entirely new kind of despair. By virtue of condemning the racism of the far right, I had myself been added to a list of Jews viewed as enemies. From a historical point of view, this didn't look good.\n\nThe article explained that the list had started on 4chan in July but moved to the Telegram chat service after failing to meet even their desperately low standards of user conduct. That's like being kicked out of a Wild West frontier town for being too lawless.\n\nI was left shocked, not just that I was named on the list, but that the realisation had so little impact when I first suspected as much. We have reached a point in history where subtlety and nuance are all but extinct; subtext is now simply text.\n\nThe comedian Bill Burr used to have a routine about how prejudice is depicted in the movies in unrealistic and exaggerated ways. \u201cReal racism is quiet. It\u2019s subtle,\" he went on to say. \"People look around first. They make sure the coast is clear. There are disclaimers\u2026\" That material isn\u2019t much more than a decade old, yet it feels as dated as a vaudeville act. Today's racism is loud \u2013 and it\u2019s not going away anytime soon.\n\nErnest Hemingway wrote that bankruptcy occurred in two ways, \"Gradually, then suddenly\". It feels as though we reached have this point in time in the same way. We have seen the rise of the far right on both sides of the Atlantic, and we have convinced ourselves that the horror stories from the last century will never be repeated. But a mantra of \u201cnever again\u201d won\u2019t be enough to stop those who disagree with the premise.\n\nMy mother\u2019s father spent his teenage years inside a succession of concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau, for no other reason than that he was Jewish. He is now a great grandfather three times over and will turn 90 in January. These days he shares his testimony in schools in a bid to teach future generations about the dangers of hatred and where it can lead.\n\nHere's where it leads: his grandson recently received confirmation that he was on a list of Jews being compiled by Nazis.\n\nSo now it seems worth mentioning, but not to my grandfather.", "description": "The first time I suspected I was on a list of Jews being compiled by neo-Nazis it hardly seemed worth mentioning.
