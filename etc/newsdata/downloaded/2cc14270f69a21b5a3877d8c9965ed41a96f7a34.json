Some, like the new American Scream Halloween Selfie Museum, proved to be more entertaining than disturbing. Others, like Fright Fest, were scream-worthy enough to cause day-after hoarseness. Here\u2019s how they rank, from mildest to scary-as-yell.\n\n5. American Scream Halloween Selfie Museum\n\nAll your selfie ghouls \u2014 er, goals \u2014 can come true at this interactive art installation next to Lord & Taylor in Tysons Corner Center. Guests have 45 minutes to explore 31 scenes, most straight out of such horror flicks as \u201cThe Shining\u201d and \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d \u2014 one for each day of October, co-creator Jon Libbesmeier says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe sets, arranged like museum exhibits throughout the 4,200-square-foot space, are intricate and, naturally, ideal for selfies: Slip on a clown mask and pose with a single red balloon, a la Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIt.\u201d Clutch a serrated lollipop like the one used as a murder weapon in the 2007 film \u201cTrick \u2018r Treat.\u201d Stick your head inside Croczilla\u2019s jaws and smile wide, or slip into church with a demonic nun.\n\nThere are no scare actors but plenty of evil scarecrows, rotten pumpkins and giant teddy bears spilling their guts (literally). Scary-good puns, too: Sit down with a box of Killogg\u2019s Cereal Killer, and spoon-feed fingers to a bloody zombie who looks like he\u2019d prefer a heart to a hearty breakfast.\n\nIn a \u201crated R\u201d room at the back of the museum, become part of an autopsy scene or sidle up to \u201cDoctor Duck Lips,\u201d a botched plastic surgery patient. And finally, turn to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: a coffin. About 20 percent of visitors lie down in it, Libbesmeier estimates, an experience that\u2019s unsettling and, one hopes, won\u2019t soon be repeated. Whatever you choose, the museum is an Instagrammer\u2019s delight \u2014 with photo ops to die for.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOpen Thursdays through Sundays through Oct. 20; open daily Oct. 24-Nov. 3. 7952 Tysons Corner Center, Tysons, Va. american-scream.com. $18 online; $20 at the door. Appropriate for most ages.\n\n4. Fields of Fear\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201ccrybaby\u201d exit halfway through each of Fields of Fear\u2019s scariest attractions. But by that point, a pale witch has already popped out of what appeared to be a solid wall \u2014 purring how glad she is to see you and brushing her long, bony fingers across your shoulders. And you\u2019ve already walked through cobwebs, sprung into the air over unexpected, loud noises, and recoiled at the mysterious blasts of air nipping your ankles.\n\nCox Farms\u2019s annual haunted extravaganza is \u201chigh startle, low gore,\u201d says Lucas Cox, who runs the Centreville event with his sister. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s looking for blood and guts, we are not the place. It\u2019s about the surprise.\u201d\n\nNearly 100 actors make Fields of Fear a multisensory adventure. When visitors arrive, they\u2019re given timed-entry passes to three attractions: the Dark Side Hayride, Cornightmare and The Forest: Back 40. Cox\u2019s wife has refused to walk through the latter two mazes for the past six years. And indeed, during the half-mile, candlelit trek through the forest, two high school students seized a stranger\u2019s hand, thrusting her into the danger zone: the front of the single-file line.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlan to spend a few hours at the farm; in addition to the haunted activities, there\u2019s a terrific view of the stars, multiple bonfires, a dance floor and a giant six-lane slide. Toast the season with apple cider, kettle corn and cinnamon-roasted almonds. It\u2019s the ultimate fall party, which summarizes Fields of Fear well: The tween-heavy experience is fun-scary, not scary-scary. You\u2019ll be startled, and you\u2019ll jump, but you\u2019ll probably be grinning, too \u2014 and the guy chasing you with a chain saw just might smile back.\n\nOpen Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 2; also open Oct. 13. 15621 Braddock Rd., Centreville, Va. fieldsoffear.coxfarms.com. $15-$35. Not recommended for children younger than 12; guardian required for children younger than 14.\n\n3. Laurel's House of Horror\n\nIn a nondescript strip mall in Laurel, a glowing marquee announces that this is the right place: \u201cLaurel\u2019s House of Horror,\u201d a once-abandoned movie theater now occupied by the macabre.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaryland\u2019s largest indoor haunted house makes smart use of its unique setting: Visitors spend 20 to 30 minutes wandering through six theaters that have been transformed into a butcher\u2019s shop, church, graveyard and creepy dollhouse. Because the floors are slanted, there\u2019s a constant sense of change in elevation which makes for a disorienting experience.\n\nOn opening night, a meat merchant eyed up passersby, determining if they fit her ominous needs: \u201cYou\u2019re too malnourished,\u201d she told a portly man. A woman with a pixie cut had \u201chair too long,\u201d and a petite girl was too tall.\n\nThere\u2019s crawling involved in one theater, and at another point, the only way out is to shimmy through clouds of green fog so thick that it\u2019s impossible to see below the waist. It\u2019s like being dropped in a sensory deprivation tank, with maniacal laughing \u2014 origin unknown \u2014 that ricochets throughout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the haunt is the sole theater that acknowledges its past life: A black-and-white film crackles on the screen, final credits rolling until \u201cThe End\u201d pulses in chunky white letters. On a Friday evening in late September \u2014 prime time for moviegoing \u2014 only dust filled the worn maroon seats. Business here must really be dead.\n\nOpen Friday through Sunday and select Thursdays through Nov. 2. 935 Fairlawn Ave., Laurel, Md. laurelhaunt.com . $25. Most visitors are age 10 and older.\n\n2. Six Flags America Fright Fest\n\nOn the second weekend of its annual Fright Fest celebration, Six Flags America in Prince George\u2019s County hosted a 30-hour coffin challenge for couples: Lie side-by-side in a double-wide coffin for nearly two days; win a prize. Clearly, this is a place that thinks outside the (rectangular, permanent) box.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring Fright Fest, the amusement park comes alive with scores of the undead, who slide through plumes of fog to catch passersby unaware and then stalk them. The thrill rides remain open until closing time \u2014 and if there was any question, plummeting 20 stories on the park\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d coaster is way scarier in the dark.\n\nBut the six haunted houses are the most horrifying part of the experience, and that\u2019s a compliment. While Fright Fest lacks the charm of more homegrown operations, its production quality is impeccable: Expect a dizzying use of strobe lights and theatrical sound effects in houses such as \u201cTotal Damnation,\u201d \u201cVoodoo Curse\u201d and \u201cTwisted Fairy Tales,\u201d a 3-D maze that steals the show.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, the monsters inside each themed house weren\u2019t content to lurk in the corner \u2014 or satisfied with eliciting just one scream. A zombie with a green face, fluorescent under the black light, crawled desperately after one guest, chains scraping the floor as he pleaded for help. And a bludgeoned ghost abandoned his post, pursuing another visitor until she reached the exit \u2014 puffing hot breath on her neck from a distance of no greater than an inch. It\u2019s challenging to navigate a maze in the pitch dark with that kind of company. No wonder they call the theme park a scream park this time of year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOpen Saturdays and Sundays, and select Thursdays and Fridays through Nov. 3. 13710 Central Ave., Bowie,Md. sixflags.com. Starting at $42.99 (extra fees for haunted attractions). Not recommended for children younger than 13.\n\n1. Field of Screams Maryland\n\nThe body count at this 40-acre compound in Olney is \u2014 well, good luck keeping track. It\u2019s easier to quantify the blood: Creative director Michael Lado ordered gallons for this year\u2019s event, opting for the translucent kind that always appears wet. It\u2019s smeared across victims\u2019 limbs, splattered on walls and put to fine use elsewhere.\n\nAt Field of Screams, fresh meat \u2014 that is, visitors \u2014 can tour the Slaughter Factory, a haunted house in which convincingly realistic dead pigs dangle from the ceiling and brush passersby\u2019s shoulders. In the catacombs, where 550 skulls line the walls, a trickling sound hints a fountain nearby. Turns out that something is dripping, but it isn\u2019t water.\n\nMost people come for the two haunted trails. Each one takes about 35 minutes to explore and leads to stations like a serial killer\u2019s lair and ransacked campground. Mid-trail on a recent weekend evening, a trio of laughing clowns welcomed a skeptical guest to the Big Top with sweet promises: \u201cWant some cotton candy?\u201d one clown tempted, offering a handful of thick cobwebs that covered a skeleton. \u201cStay for a while. We\u2019re nicer than we smell.\u201d\n\nThe trails are physically demanding: There\u2019s extremely low visibility \u2014 prepare to navigate confusing hallways in a blackout dark cabin \u2014 and earsplitting noises. Chained doors rattle violently, as puffs of breath graze your neck, delivered by . . . who? There are better things on which to focus, like squeezing through a blood-soaked crawl space and getting across the floor that\u2019s dropping out beneath you.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose who emerge can celebrate at one of the ground\u2019s bonfires \u2014 being frightened burns calories, so indulge in fried Twinkies or funnel cake. Try your hand at ax throwing or the \u201cCarnival Town\u201d games, one of which involves tossing squishy silicone brains into a roving zombie\u2019s open skull. If you miss \u2014 and you probably will \u2014 it\u2019s no big deal. What\u2019s one more brain on the floor?", "description": "A haunted house in an abandoned multiplex, fields of fear and screams, and \u2026 a selfie museum?", "authors": ["Angela Haupt", "Freelance Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9tSSbYckx7ua5QhJQeucbTISmR4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I7EXB7HEMEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
