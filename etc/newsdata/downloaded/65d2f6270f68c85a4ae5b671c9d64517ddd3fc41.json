Luck hasn\u2019t been a lady for Las Vegas Sands stock (ticker: LVS) lately. The shares are up just 7.4% year to date, compared to a nearly 19% gain for the S&P 500 and a 21% climb for the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY). Other gaming stocks, including Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM), and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) are also trailing the broader market, but have managed to notch double-digit gains in 2019.\n\nLas Vegas Sands has been hurt by the trade war between the U.S. and China (and what it could mean for the latter\u2019s economy) as well as the Hong Kong protests. While the Chinese gambling hub of Macau has somewhat recovered from last year\u2019s doldrums, and analysts are split on whether or not there will be better days ahead, Las Vegas Sands has also struggled with uneven earnings this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. On Friday, Las Vegas Sands stock got a boost on news that the company will be added to the S&P 500 index on Oct. 3, replacing Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR). Las Vegas Sands stock is up 6% to $59.21 this morning.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nNektar, a biopharmaceutical firm, was once one of the index\u2019s best performers. However that\u2019s changed this year, as Nektar has been one of the worst-performing stocks through the end of last month, plunging most recently in August, when a poor earnings report and manufacturing issues caused the shares to fall 37%.\n\nNektar will be replacing Sotheby\u2019s (BID) in the S&P 400, as the latter is being acquired, with the deal expected to close on Oct. 3.\n\nLooking ahead. It\u2019s not unusual for a company\u2019s stock to get a boost when added to a major index. Inclusion in the S&P 500 can trigger purchases by passive index products as well as institutional investors, who may be benchmarked to specific indexes. Investors may also see inclusion as a bullish sign for a company\u2019s future earnings potential.\n\nHowever, gains aren\u2019t always in the bag. Walgreens Boots Alliance stock (WBA) was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average last summer. Shares are down 20% so far this year, and off 25% in the latest 12 months, another victim of the curse of the Dow (although Barron\u2019s noted at the time that it was a bad move). Walgreens replaced General Electric (GE) after the embattled conglomerate was booted from that index (of which it was an original member). GE stock has lost 16% in the latest 12 months, but it\u2019s up 25% year to date.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Las Vegas Sands stock is climbing on Friday, on news that the casino operator will join the S&P 500, replacing Nektar Therapeutics.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-99811/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
