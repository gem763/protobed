Nearly all of those products were Juul or Juul-compatible pods and pod caps, according to the note.\n\nThe note described that almost all Juul or Juul-compatible pods and caps were found at schools with predominantly middle- and upper-income student populations.\n\nOverall, the note indicated that 64% of pod caps were from mint-flavored and other menthol-flavored pods.\n\nThe researchers conducted additional scans at one school in an upper-income area three months after e-cigarette maker Juul announced it was stopping retail sales of flavor products , except Cool Mint and Classic Menthol. Those additional scans yielded 172 mint, 20 mango and four fruit pod caps, as well as three yellow caps, which could have been banana or mango flavors, according to the note.\n\nJUST WATCHED Expert testifies Juul founders used big tobacco tactics Replay More Videos ...

Use of any flavored e-cigarette went up among those young users between 2017 and 2018, rising from 60.9% to 67.8%, and menthol use increased from 42.3% to 51.2%, according to the survey.\n\nSeveral states have taken action to prohibit the sale of certain flavored e-cigarette products, in an effort to curb teen vaping, and the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to finalize a policy in the coming weeks that would clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, Trump administration officials have said.\n\nThe findings in the note are limited to only those high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, and more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge in other parts of the United States.\n\n\"Further research and actions at national, state, and community levels are needed to inform policymaking to reduce youth access to and use of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, and cannabis products. Youth use of flavored tobacco products, including mint and all other mentholated flavors, is of particular concern,\" Mock and Hendlin wrote in the report.\n\n\"Likewise, measures are needed to eliminate environmental contamination from e-cigarette, combustible tobacco product, and cannabis product waste in and around schools,\" they wrote. \"Schools can engage students in garbology projects to identify existing and new use of these products and to raise awareness about their hazardous health and environmental impacts.\"\n\nDr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University in New York, said that she was not surprised by the amount of waste related to both e-cigarette and traditional tobacco products the researchers found at high schools in the Bay Area.\n\n\"We know we have an ongoing vaping epidemic in teens and we know that teens who vape are more likely to use other tobacco products in the future,\" Bracho-Sanchez said in an email on Thursday.\n\n\"I applaud these researchers for quantifying the extent of the issue in this way since self-reporting surveys have limitations and the sleek, small nature of some of these devices also means they often go unperceived by both teachers and parents,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she also was not surprised that high schools in lower-income neighborhoods had greater amounts of waste from traditional combustion cigarette products -- \"not only are they more affordable, we know that kids in these neighborhoods are specifically targeted by advertisers,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe report comes at a time when the United States continues to face an outbreak of lung injuries associated with e-cigarette use or vaping . The specific chemical exposure causing these lung injuries remains unknown, according to the CDC.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there were 1,299 lung injury cases associated with e-cigarette products in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands, according to the CDC. Alaska is the only state without a reported case. About 80% of patients are under 35 years old, and they range in age from 13 to 75 years. States have reported 27 vaping-related deaths.\n\n\n\nThe CDC, US Food and Drug Administration, state and local health departments and other clinical and public health partners are investigating the multistate outbreak.", "description": "Researchers in California have \"systematically scanned the student parking lots and exterior school perimeter areas\" to collect e-cigarette waste on the ground, according to a new CDC report.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191010141057-vaping-high-school-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
