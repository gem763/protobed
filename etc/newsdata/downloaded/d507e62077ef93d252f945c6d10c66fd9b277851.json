Get that fucking p***' as she jumped on a police officer.\n\nThe 34-year-old was this week jailed for 18 months after she admitted assaulting two police officers and racially aggravated public order offence.\n\nProsecutor Claire Holmes told the court the 'outrageous' scenes erupted at 9.30am on September 11 after a window of the family's grey Audi was smashed while Bailiffs were attempting to repossess the vehicle.\n\nThe prosecutor said that the officer was concerned that one of the bites had broken the skin and she 'didn't know what she could have contracted'.\n\nJohnson already had a suspended sentence hanging over her when she launched the attack\n\nMiss Holmes said: 'In the footage you can hear her saying \"fucking p***\" and the word \"p***\" being used to describe officer Hussain. The officer is heard in the footage saying \"she bit me, she bit me\".\n\n'A second officer, an officer Waller, said she begins to help the defendant Johnson to her feet and cover up her modesty with the dressing gown.\n\n'However, as she led the defendant to the van, she calls her 'an ugly cow' and then proceeded to spit in her face.'\n\nJohnson had received a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, on January 23 this year.\n\nShe had attacked a family in a residential street in Hill, punching a 13-year-old girl before raining punches down on the girl's mother in April 2018.\n\nShe has now been jailed for 18 months, of which she will serve nine behind bars\n\nJailing her for 18 months, Judge Bury said: 'You could not simply stand by and allow these public enforcers do their job and take away the car which you couldn't pay for... what you did in attacking the officer was completely outrageous, you totally lost control.\n\n'When PC Hussain tried to do her job, you called her a \"fucking p***\" and then when she restrained you, you bit her which she describes as \"clamping down\".\n\n'It is the court's duty to protect emergency service workers so they can carry out their work. PC Waller helped you and was courteous towards you, but when you were led to the van you spat in her face.\n\n'This is simply outrageous behaviour. For the previous offence which took place in August last year, you were very lucky not to go to prison.\n\n'The previous judge took pity on you and suspended the sentence for what was a particularly unpleasant and nasty assault. That's not being a role model at all.\n\n'I have taken into account everything and immediate custody today is inevitable, however, I take a merciful course.\n\n'I activate the suspended sentence of 12 months and I add six months consecutively for each of the three new charges, to run concurrent to the original offence.'\n\nBefore she was taken away to start her sentence, Johnson shouted to her daughters: 'Love you.'", "description": "Gemma Johnson launched a vile tirade at the officer after a row erupted when bailiffs were trying to remove the family's Audi A3 from outside their home in Hull, East Yorkshire.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19582746-0-image-a-19_1570789564082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
