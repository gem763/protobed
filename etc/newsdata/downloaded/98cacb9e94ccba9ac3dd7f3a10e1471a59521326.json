It\u2019s Fed Day and Suddenly a Rate Cut Is in Doubt\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision on interest rates tomorrow and what looked like a foregone conclusion at the start of the month has turned into a dead heat.\n\nThere is now just a 53% chance that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 1.75% to 2%, according to Investing.com\u2019s .\n\nChances had been well above 90% for most of the time after the Fed\u2019s last cut.\n\nA few things changed in the landscape, such as a slight thaw in trade relations between the U.S. and China, a sharp rebound in Treasury yields, upbeat economic data and a move back to risk assets by investors.\n\nThat would usually be enough to for the FOMC to keep rates on hold. But now there\u2019s political pressure on the rate-setting committee and especially Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for negative rates from the Fed, who are \u201cboneheads\u201d according to the president, so that the U.S. can refinance its debt obligations (something easier tweeted than done).\n\nThe FOMC statement arrives at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT), and Powell will hold his press conference at 2:30 PM ET.\n\n2. Housing Starts, Permits for August on the Calendar\n\nAhead of the Fed the market will get some more insight into the state of the U.S. housing market.\n\nThe Commerce Department will report numbers on August and at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).\n\nHousing starts are predicted to show 4.5% rise to an annual rate of 1.25 million, according to economists\u2019 forecast compiled by Investing.com.\n\nBuilding permits, an indication of future demand, are seen ticking down slightly to an annual rate of 1.31 million.\n\nShares of home builders have been strong in 2019, along with companies that support residential housing, including Home Depot Inc (NYSE: ), Lowe\u2019s Companies (NYSE: ) and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: ).\n\n3. Inventories on Tap After Oil Volatility\n\nAfter the Saudi oil attacks, which led to a more-than-14% jump and 5% tumble in crude prices back to back, we have the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s weekly report.\n\nThe last three reports in this series have been spectacular for their crude draws totaling nearly 22 million barrels in all, as well as weekly crude exports at a steady clip of 3 million barrels.\n\nAt 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), the EIA will issue its assessment of U.S. for the week ended Sept 13.\n\nAnalysts are predicting a drawdown of about 800,000 barrels for oil.\n\nLast week, the EIA reported a crude drawdown of 6.9 million barrels, a drop of 680,000 and a build of 2.7 million.", "description": "Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBAT0DL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
