Nobel Prize goes to 3 who tackled cosmic query", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 They are two of the most fundamental questions not just of science, but of humanity: How did we get here? And are we alone?\n\nA Canadian-American cosmologist and two Swiss scientists split this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for not quite answering those universal questions, but getting closer to the cosmic truths.\n\nCanadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University, won for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology, about what happened soon after the Big Bang that eventually led to the formation of galaxies and the universe as we know it.\n\nSwiss star-gazers Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva, were honored for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a sun-like star.\n\nA day of deep astrophysics and talk of extraterrestrial life also included pop humor, with the Nobel Prize committee quoting from the theme song of the American TV sitcom, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d whose protagonists, Sheldon and Amy, won a physics Nobel in the series finale, and a giggling Peebles referring to singer Bob Dylan.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel laureates in physics have painted a picture of the universe far stranger and more wonderful than we ever could have imagined,\u201d said Ulf Danielsson of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in announcing the laureates. \u201cOur view of our place in the universe will never be the same again.\u201d\n\nPeebles\u2019 work is a deeply theoretical look back in time and space at how the universe came to its current form, mostly filled with dark matter and dark energy we can\u2019t even see. It\u2019s probably the first Nobel for purely theoretical cosmology, instead of something observed, noted CalTech physicist Sean Carroll.\n\nPeebles, hailed as one of the most influential cosmologists of his time, who realized the importance of the cosmic radiation background born of the Big Bang, will collect one half of the 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award.\n\n\u201cMuch of it will go to charity,\u201d Peebles told colleagues at a Princeton news conference. Then after a pause, he changed that to \u201cSome of it will go to charity. Some of it will go to our children.\u201d\n\nMayor, who is an astrophysicist, and Queloz, an astronomer who is also at the University of Cambridge in Britain, will share the other half. Their finding of the first planet outside our solar system circling a star like our own made astronomers look harder for life elsewhere in the universe.\n\n\u201cMaybe we can discover some form of life. We don\u2019t know what kind of form,\u201d Mayor said Tuesday as he arrived in Madrid for a scientific speaking engagement. He said scientists \u201care absolutely certain that a lot of these planets have good conditions for life.\u201d\n\nMayor and Queloz started a revolution in astronomy when they discovered 51 Pegasi B, a gaseous ball comparable with Jupiter, in 1995 \u2014 a time when, as Mayor recalled, \u201cno one knew whether exoplanets existed or not.\u201d\n\nThat was \u201cthe first step in our search for, \u2018Are we alone?'\u201d said astronomer Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University.\n\nMore than 4,000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way, and scientists think one out of every four or five stars have planets. \u201cWe have 200 billion stars out there in our galaxy alone, so I like our chances,\u201d Kaltenegger said.\n\nQueloz was meeting Tuesday with other academics interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University interrupted to tell him the big news: He had won the Nobel. He thought it was joke at first.\n\n\u201cI could barely breathe,\u201d Queloz told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s beyond usual emotions. My hand was shaking for a long time. I\u2019m trying to digest it.\u201d\n\nGeoff Marcy, who headed one of the teams that rivaled Mayor and Queloz, praised their work. In the 1990s \u201cwe were all trying to carry a search for planets without ever thinking we would succeed,\u201d Marcy said. \u201cNone of us imagined even finding one, never mind the thousands we found.\u201d\n\nMarcy, who left the University of California Berkeley after accusations of sexual harassment, said he didn\u2019t know if he would have shared in the prize if it weren\u2019t for the scandal.\n\nSwedish academy member Mats Larsson said this year\u2019s was \u201cone of the easiest physics prizes for a long time to explain.\u201d\n\nThat can\u2019t quite be said for Peebles\u2019 theoretical work.\n\n\u201cJim Peebles absolutely was one of the leaders in trying to understand how did we get here, the nature of cosmology, the nature of the universe at large,\u201d said astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, director of Harvard University\u2019s Origins of Life Initiative.\n\nPeebles\u2019 work, which began in the mid-1960s, set the stage for a \u201ctransformation\u201d of cosmology over the last half-century, using theoretical tools and calculations that helped interpret traces from the infancy of the universe, the Nobel committee said.\n\nA clearly delighted Peebles giggled repeatedly during a phone interview with AP, recalling how he answered a 5:30 a.m. phone call from Stockholm thinking that \u201cit\u2019s either something very wonderful or it\u2019s something horrible.\u201d\n\nThe astrophysicist, who said his life had suddenly turned topsy-turvy, will make sure he picks up his prize.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved Bob Dylan,\u201d he said, referring to the singer-songwriter who won the literature prize in 2016 but refused to participate in the Nobel ceremony. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive him for not showing up to the scene of (his) Nobel prize.\u201d\n\nAnd in a case of life imitating art, Tuesday\u2019s Nobel Prize announcement included the opening lyrics of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d theme song: \u201cOur whole universe was in a hot, dense state, then nearly 14 billion years ago, expansion started.\u201d\n\nThe sitcom was a \u201cfantastic achievement\u201d that brought the \u201cworld of science to laptops and living rooms around the world,\u201d said Goran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. So referencing its theme song seemed fitting, he said.\n\nThe cash prize comes with a gold medal and a diploma that are received at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel in 1896, together with the winners of five other Nobel prizes. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway, on the same day.\n\nOn Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body\u2019s cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anemia, cancer and other diseases.\n\nNobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Chemistry will be announced Wednesday, two Literature Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, and the Peace Prize comes Friday. This year will see two Literature Prizes handed out because the one last year was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy.\n\n___\n\nKeyton reported from Stockholm.
