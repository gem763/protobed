We know Diablo 4 is on the way \u2014 eventually \u2014 but a News Corp business journal overnight has decided to casually remind everyone that an Overwatch sequel is in the works too.\n\nThe mention was included towards the end of a trader feature posted on Barron's, a financial traders publication owned by News Corp. The article, which did the rounds again today on the Reuters global news wire, argued that the interest in World of Warcraft: Classic was a strong indication that Activision-Blizzard has turned the corner.

Jason reported earlier this year that Blizzard has been working on a sequel to their hit hero shooter, which has been described by some Blizzard sources to Left 4 Dead with a heavy PvE element. The next Overwatch game might also be called something different, but whatever it is, the current expectation is that it, along with the future of Diablo, will be the tentpole announcement at Blizzcon \u2014 provided nothing changes at the last minute.\n\nSources: Blizzard Cancels StarCraft First-Person Shooter To Focus On Diablo 4 And Overwatch 2 Blizzard has canceled a StarCraft first-person shooter that had been in development for the past two years, according to three people familiar with goings-on at the studio. The main reason, Blizzard told staff, was to put more resources into the Diablo and Overwatch franchises.
