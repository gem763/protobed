In some cases, that might look like a prorated bonus adjusted for their performance, while in others, it may be a larger sum, one of the people said.\n\nSolomon and Waldron have been holding dozens of conversations with partners and division heads as they prepare to set the firm's strategic agenda. An investor presentation to unveil that plan is scheduled for early next year. Solomon wants to ensure that partners are around for the next two to three years to execute on his plan. Some partners have been told to accelerate their decision if they were thinking about retiring during that period.\n\nThe approach is different than in years past, when partners may have chosen or been allowed to stick around because of the compensation they would lose by leaving earlier, one of the people said. Solomon also isn't trying as hard to change the minds of some partners who in years past may have talked about leaving and been lured back, one of the people said.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs' newest partners include a star trader who made a $300 million profit and a banker spearheading a crypto push\n\nGoldman has about 450 partners, down from roughly 500 at the beginning of the year, when a new class of 69 officially joined the club. The CEO has been pushing to refocus the partnership on revenue producers and make it more exclusive after years when, he believes, it ballooned under his predecessor Lloyd Blankfein.\n\nJake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman, said the approach to payouts stopped short of a formal policy change.\n\n\"There's no change in policy,\" he said. \"Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nAccelerating departures\n\nSolomon and Waldron are attempting to entice dozens of partners to choose retirement without igniting a full-blown power struggle. Being a Goldman Sachs partner brings both career and social prestige, a roughly $1 million base salary, and a bonus at least several times that amount.\n\nMany of the exiting partners are considered to be close to ex-CEO Blankfein or former president Harvey Schwartz, who came up through the firm's securities division. Schwartz lost out to Solomon in the race to be Blankfein's successor. Nearly all of Solomon's promotions have come from the investment-banking side of the firm, which he once led.\n\nRead more: Marty Chavez is retiring from Goldman Sachs. We chatted with him about the bank's tech transformation, why now is the right time for him to step down, and what he's planning next.\n\nThe approach also carries the benefit of accelerating departures. Goldman pays annual bonuses in February, and employees leaving beforehand would typically forgo the entire sum. As a result, partners looking to retire months earlier would have hung on to get their money.\n\nEarlier exits give the CEO a better understanding about the makeup of his management team than if he were to wait for the anticipated rash of departures after bonus time. He doesn't want to present his plan in January only to be surprised by unanticipated exits the following month.\n\nExits already picking up\n\nAlready, this year has been marked by a number of midyear exits and others that will take effect on December 31.\n\nThe pace of partner exits has picked up in the past two weeks, with securities division cohead Marty Chavez and equities cochief Jeff Nedelman resigning last week. Elisha Wiesel, the cochief information officer, and Dane Holmes, the head of human resources, announced their exits this week.\n\nOther partners who have left this year include equities cochief Brian Levine and fixed-income leader Justin Gmelich. Both were feted with marching bands on the trading floor.\n\nRead more: Another Goldman Sachs partner is out.
