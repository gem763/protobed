REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group (BX.N) said on Tuesday it would launch a tender offer for Japan\u2019s Unizo Holdings (3258.T) at 5,000 yen a share, doubling down on its $1.6 billion offer after the proposal was rebuffed by the hotel chain.\n\nThe possible bid from one of the world\u2019s largest buyout funds marks another twist in the fight for the once-obscure hotelier, now seen as a test case for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push for greater transparency and corporate disclosure.\n\nUnizo last week said it had rejected a buyout proposal from Blackstone as well as one from a \u201clocally renowned\u201d fund that it didn\u2019t identify. Prior to that, Unizo withdrew support for a white-knight bid from SoftBank-backed (9984.T) Fortress Investment Group. It had earlier been a target for travel agent H.I.S. Co (9603.T) in a failed hostile bid.\n\nUnizo frustrated some investors by welcoming Fortress\u2019s bid and then back-tracking.\n\nBlackstone said in a statement it would offer 5,000 yen a share for Unizo, valuing the hotel chain at around 171.1 billion yen ($1.6 billion). That represents a slight premium to Unizo\u2019s closing price of 4,700 yen and a sharp premium to Fortress\u2019s proposal of 4,000 yen.\n\nLast week, Unizo\u2019s top shareholder, Elliot Management, ended weeks of public silence to ask Unizo\u2019s board to address its concerns about disclosure.\n\nBlackstone said it would consider \u201cany possible options\u201d including initiating the bid if Unizo would not agree with its proposals by Oct. 23.\n\nBlackstone has opposed Unizo\u2019s plan to create a scheme where Unizo employees could exercise control over a new owner\u2019s ability to later exit.", "description": "Private equity firm Blackstone Group said on Tuesday it would launch a tender offer for Japan's Unizo Holdings <3258.T> at 5,000 yen a share, doubling down on its $1.6 billion offer after the proposal was rebuffed by the hotel chain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441020881&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0F5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
