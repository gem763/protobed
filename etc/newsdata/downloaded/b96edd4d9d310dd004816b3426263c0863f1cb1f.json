The team have gone 35-49-1 overall under Gruden, whose brother, Jon, coaches the Oakland Raiders.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Washington owner Dan Snyder called to the team\u2019s facility for a 5am meeting and was fired. A source told the Associated Press that offensive line coach Bill Callahan would replace Gruden on an interim basis. Callahan has coached the Raiders in the NFL and Nebraska in college football.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSnyder and team president Bruce Allen informed Gruden he was fired a day after a 33-7 loss to the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cThrough the first five games of the 2019 season, the team has clearly not performed up to expectations, and we all share in that responsibility,\u201d read a team statement. \u201cMoving forward we are committed to doing all that we can collectively as an organization to turn things around and give our fans and alumni a team they can be proud of in 2019 and beyond.\u201d\n\nRelated: Incredibly, the putrid Dolphins are not the most dismal team in the NFL\n\nAfter the loss to New England, Gruden was asked if he knew where he stood with the team. \u201cNobody\u2019s told me anything, and I don\u2019t have a concern. I\u2019ll just wait and see,\u201d said Gruden, whose contract ran through next season. \u201c[If] my key works on Monday, keep working.\u201d\n\nThis season alone has seen star left tackle Trent Williams hold out, a shuffle at quarterback after Dwayne Haskins was taken No15 overall in the draft, a series of injuries up and down the roster and, perhaps most upsetting to team leadership, the sight of away fans making up an increasingly large proportion of the seats at home games.\n\nStory continues\n\nWashington have rarely been competitive this season, ranking 30th out of 32 NFL clubs in both scoring, averaging 14.6 points, and defense, allowing 30.2 points per game. The only club that ranks worse than Washington in both categories are the Miami Dolphins, who are 0-4 and had a bye this week will host Washington next Sunday.\n\nCornerback Quinton Dunbar wrote on Instagram that he owes Gruden \u201cfor life\u201d for helping him by switching him from wide receiver after college and added: \u201cSorry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you.\u201d\n\nDespite never before being a head coach in the NFL, and despite never winning more than nine games in a season, Gruden managed to stick around longer than anyone else who\u2019s held that job during Snyder\u2019s unsuccessful two-decade stint as team owner.\n\nGruden\u2019s teams finished with winning records just twice: 9-7 in 2015, then 8-7-1 in 2016 and he took Washington to one playoff game, a loss. The team went 7-9 in each of the past two seasons, leading to speculation about whether he would be back.\n\n", "description": "* Team had lost all five games so far this season  * Gruden reached playoffs just once in five full seasons as coachJay Gruden finished with a 35-49-1 record as Washington coach.
