This action constricts the export of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to entities that have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in China\u2019s campaign targeting Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).\n\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said the move showed that the U.S. \u201ccannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations,\u201d he said.\n\n\"I begged them to kill me.\" Uighur woman testifies before Congress on torture in Chinese concentration camps China must be stopped#MuslimGenocide pic.twitter.com/BaSvZbMIVM \u2014 Unmatched Wisdom of Poso \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) December 5, 2018\n\nIn recent years, China has detained millions of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in what Beijing has falsely claimed are \u201cvoluntary de-radicalization camps\u201d and \u201cvocational training centers.\u201d\n\nAccording to countless witness testimonies and human rights investigations, the centers more closely resemble internment camps, where detainees are indoctrinated in support of the Chinese communist state and coerced into disavowing their allegiance to Islam. This week, female victims told the Washington Post how authorities used rape, forced abortions, and the harvesting of organs, crimes they described as amounting to \u201cgenocide.\u201d\n\n'I was shackled and beaten' \u2013 Gulbahar is a Uighur Muslim and says she was held in a camp in China's Xinjiang region.

We\u2019ve come this far. We\u2019re doing well,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Tuesday. \u201cCan something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows? But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The U.S. announced sanctions against 28 Chinese entities involved in human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1148084967-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
