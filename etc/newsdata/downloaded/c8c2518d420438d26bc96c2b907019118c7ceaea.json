By the committee\u2019s own admission, \u201cmuch of this Volume's analysis is derived from\u201d the work of two Technical Advisory Groups (TAG), which produced two public reports back in December 2018, to the same kind of fawning press coverage the report is receiving now.\n\nNEW: The Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections involved using social media content to mostly target African-Americans, a new Senate committee report concludes.https://t.co/7BRUmiG18T \u2014 NPR (@NPR) October 8, 2019\n\nNot surprisingly, the report\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d are being cited as conclusive proof that Democrats were right and President Donald Trump was wrong about 2016, Russia, Ukraine and the US presidential election.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee unveiled a sweeping new bipartisan report showing Russian efforts to boost Trump's White House bid on social media during the 2016 U.S. electionhttps://t.co/TUjUhBdMnc \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) October 8, 2019\n\nThe only trouble with that is that the committee provides no actual evidence for any of its claims \u2013 only assertions. For example, their description of the Internet Research Agency \u2013 the \u201cRussian troll farm\u201d \u2013 is basically copied over from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of a dozen of its alleged members. Yet a federal judge presiding over the case ruled back in May that allegations cannot be treated as established evidence or conclusion, coming close to finding Mueller\u2019s prosecutors in contempt.\n\nAnother document presented as evidence is the January 2017 \u201cIntelligence Community Assessment,\u201d the disingenuously named work of a small group of people, hand-picked by the Obama administration\u2019s DNI and chiefs of the CIA, FBI and NSA \u2013 all of whom, except for the NSA, have since been implicated in what seems to be a campaign to spy on Trump, delegitimize his presidency, and have him impeached.\n\nThe Senate report also quotes testimonies from Obama aides such as Ben Rhodes \u2013 helpfully redacted of course \u2013 Gen. Philip Breedlove, the NATO commander who tried to set off a war with Russia; professional \u201cRussian bot\u201d hunters like Clint Watts and Thomas Rid; and NATO's \u201cStrategic Communications Center of Excellence.\u201d\n\nThe best part, however, has to be the reliance on New Knowledge, presented as \u201ca cybersecurity company dedicated to protecting the public sphere from disinformation attacks.\u201d In reality, New Knowledge was exposed by the New York Times as the outfit that actually ran bots and disinformation operations during the 2017 Alabama special election for the US Senate, targeting Republican candidate Roy Moore on behalf of Democrats \u2013 while blaming Russia!\n\nAlso on rt.com The only \u2018Russian bots\u2019 to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat-linked \u2018experts\u2019\n\nIn an internal memo, New Knowledge executives boasted how they \u201corchestrated an elaborate 'false flag' operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet.\u201d\n\nThe other TAG, led by British academics and researchers, found that the activity of \u2018Russian trolls\u2019 increased after the election \u2013 by 238 percent on Instagram, 59 percent on Facebook, 52 percent on Twitter, and 84 percent on YouTube. So it was influencing elections\u2026 retroactively?\n\nLeft unsaid was that the absolute quantity of \"Russian\" posts was minuscule, a proverbial drop in the bucket compared to the billions of social media posts generated and consumed by the US electorate during the campaign.\n\nAlso on rt.com Worst meddler ever? 'Russian' Facebook ads 'trolling US election' went completely unseen\n\nThese are the people who \u201csignificantly informed the Committee's understanding of Russia's social media-predicated attack against our democracy,\u201d as this week\u2019s report puts it.\n\nEver since Hillary Clinton blamed \u201cRussian hackers\u201d for the revelations of corruption within the DNC in July 2016, the Washington establishment has been eager to blame Moscow for all the ills of the US political system, real or imagined. The Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report seems to be nothing more than an attempt to reheat the long-cold corpse of a conspiracy that should have been buried with the Mueller Report and allowed to rest in peace.\n\nLike this story?
