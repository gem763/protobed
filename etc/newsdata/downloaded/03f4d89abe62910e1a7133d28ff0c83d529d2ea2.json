Murders this year are set to be at a record high.\n\nThe scenes in Sinaloa follow the massacre of more than a dozen police in western Mexico earlier this week, and the killing of 14 suspected gangsters by the army a day later.\n\n'El Chapo' Guzman led the Sinaloa cartel for decades, escaping from prison twice before being arrested and extradited to the United States. He was found guilty in a U.S. court in February of smuggling tons of drugs and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nHe is believed to have about 12 children including Ovidio. The U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an indictment against Ovidio and another of the brothers in February, charging them with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana in the United States.\n\nThe indictment gave Ovidio's age as 28, and said he had been involved in trafficking conspiracies since he was a teenager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel, Clarence Fernandez and Lincoln Feast)", "description": "Heavily armed cartel fighters surrounded security forces and made them free one of drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman's sons, whose brief apprehension triggered intense gunbattles across the city of Culiacan.
