When Hee-Chan Hwang scored Salzburg\u2019s first goal, the electronic board at Anfield declared the score was 3-3. It was a mechanical error, but it was not the only system that malfunctioned.\n\nNot on a chastening night for Liverpool\u2019s defence. For the fifth time in Jurgen Klopp\u2019s reign, they won 4-3. For only the second since February 2018, however, they conceded three at Anfield; remarkably, they gave up a 3-0 lead, even if Mohamed Salah salvaged victory. This felt a throwback to the days before Virgil van Dijk joined, to the kind of anarchic entertainment he seemed to have consigned to the past.\n\nExcept it was Van Dijk on his backside, sliding in the wrong direction when Hwang Hee-Chan darted away from him to score Salzburg\u2019s first goal, Uefa\u2019s reigning player of the year reduced to the ranks of a mere mortal by the fearless Austrian champions. In 22 minutes, they scored three goals, as many as Liverpool conceded in the final 10 home games of last season.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Liverpool rely on their full-backs for attacking width, but the sight of opponents getting in behind Trent Alexander-Arnold is increasingly regular. Salzburg\u2019s second goal, scored by Takumi Minamino, stemmed from the terrific Hwang finding space on Liverpool\u2019s right flank. When Dominik Szoboszlai ought to have equalised, Liverpool\u2019s right-sided combination were in the wrong again.\n\nIf reputations are elevated in absentia, then Joel Matip\u2019s went up. Joe Gomez had a difficult evening, losing Erling Haaland for Salzburg\u2019s third goal; arguably, he has had a difficult start to the season since struggling to cope with Teemu Pukki\u2019s movement on the opening night. Van Dijk only came across to try and tackle Hwang because the South Korean had eluded Gomez.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was Matip, as much as anyone, who helped them hold on amid a Chelsea onslaught at Stamford Bridge. An understudy has become an understated talisman.\n\nKlopp felt some problems lay further forward. Liverpool are used to overwhelming opponents. They felt swamped themselves at the start of the second half by like-minded rivals who share their enthusiasm for pace and pressing. Klopp replaced both of his No 8s in a matter of minutes, removing first Jordan Henderson and then Gini Wijnaldum. \u201cWe lost control of the game,\u201d Klopp said. James Milner came on, tasked with restoring order. It was a job for a Yorkshireman; to bring common sense to the madness.\n\nKlopp suggested Liverpool were confused after Salzburg\u2019s mid-game switch to adopt a midfield diamond. \u201cWe changed for some reason the approach a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cSome were in a controlling mode, some in an attacking mode and other positions were too hectic. They changed the system and that is allowed. We opened the door and they were running through the door. But all the goals they scored: first goal, we lost the ball easy.\u201d\n\nNormally Liverpool hassle opponents into mistakes. If this was a taste of their own medicine, carelessness was not confined to the outfield players. Adrian almost gave a goal away. He has acquitted himself well while Alisson has been sidelined, with some brilliant saves, but he is fortunate his errors have not been costly.\n\nHe probably has one game left of his spell as a first choice. It comes against another side with a capacity for potent counter-attacking. Klopp spotted a spy from the Leicester camp, with Christian Fuchs at Anfield as a pundit for Austrian television, and said Liverpool need to afford Adrian more cover. \u201cI am sure Brendan Rodgers thinks if we protect [defend] like tonight then Jamie Vardy will run five times alone with the goalkeeper,\u201d he stated.\n\nDefending, he argued, \u201cis usually a strength of ours but tonight we did not show that strength.\u201d Perhaps, though, it has not really been a forte this season. Liverpool\u2019s only clean sheets are against Burnley, MK Dons and Sheffield United and the Blades fashioned fine chances.\n\nThe focus has been on the flaws in the Manchester City defence, shorn of first-choice centre-backs, but Liverpool\u2019s requires fine-tuning. They are not calibrated as well as last year, lacking the same frugality. The highlight of the defenders\u2019 night came when Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson combined for Liverpool\u2019s second goal. Much of what followed was more problematic.\n\n\u201cI was already shouting in the first half that we have to use our structure again,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cBut it is easier said than done.\u201d", "description": "It was not a mistake, it transpired, as much as an accurate prediction.
