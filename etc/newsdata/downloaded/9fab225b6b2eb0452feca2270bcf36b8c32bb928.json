I asked the Government to outline the steps they are taking to address the scourge of racism in football.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s words on this matter leave a bad taste in the mouth, given he refuses to apologise for his own \u00adracist comments \u2013 he even defended them just earlier this year.\n\nThe Government must get their own house in order, otherwise, how can anyone believe the Prime Minister is calling out racism with any sincerity? His words are empty.\n\nOn the pitch, sportsmen and women need to know they have allies up and down the country.\n\n(Image: James Fearn/PPAUK)\n\nWe must all publicly back our players when they take the brave \u00adposition to walk off the pitch together in solidarity.\n\nWithout a doubt, in Westminster, they have an ally in me.\n\nI would 100 per cent support any player or team if they decided to walk off the pitch in protest.\n\nWe owe it to our society to make a stand.", "description": "Racism is still rearing its ugly head at games across the world and the pressure on players such as Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham is immense", "authors": ["Dr Rosena Allin-Khan", "Image", "Collect Unknown", "James Fearn Ppauk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729284.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kier_5083JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
