Democrats eventually stormed out of the meeting, accusing Trump of having called the speaker a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d\n\n\u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d he tweeted with the photo.\n\nBut Pelosi soon made it her Twitter banner, and it was quickly hailed by some in the media as a win for the speaker.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s Nancy Pelosi \u2018meltdown\u2019 tweet was the perfect self-own.

According to Brewer, the president had objected to her portrayal of him as dismissive and patronizing in her book, \"Scorpions for Breakfast.\"\n\nThe cameras caught her waving her finger at Obama, something for which she received a flood of criticism. A New York Times op-ed, for instance, accused Brewer of treating the president \u201cas if he were some errand boy and not the commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon on Friday published a video called \"A Tale of Two Fingers,\" contrasting the treatment of Brewer and Pelosi, showing anchors and commentating praising the \"iconic\" photo of Pelosi \"standing in a room full of men,\" before contrasting that with media voices complaining about Brewer's \"incredibly disrespectful\" treatment of Obama.\n\n\u201cI was vilified as rude and racist.
