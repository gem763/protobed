Almost 200 MPH winds.\u201d\n\nEarlier he told a meeting of the federal emergency response agency (FEMA) at its headquarters: \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what\u2019s coming at us. All we know is it\u2019s possibly the biggest. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some Category 4s \u2013 you don\u2019t even see them that much. But a Category 5 \u2026 that\u2019s the ultimate, and that\u2019s what we have unfortunately,\u201d\n\nAs emergency responders in the Bahamas said they were preparing to assess the damage once the storm had passed, officials in the US warned residents along a large swathe of the south-eastern seaboard to be alert.\n\nWhile forecasters believe Dorian will no longer directly strike Florida, it is expected to turn sharply and move towards the US coast, staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday. It is then likely to move towards the Carolinas.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre on Sunday night said Dorian continued to batter Great Abaco. \u201cThe western eyewall is approaching eastern Grand Bahama Island. This is a life threatening situation,\u201d it added.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
