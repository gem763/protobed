Doug Jones was gifted his seat on the Hill. His Republican opponent during the 2017 special election was marred by sexual misconduct allegations involving girls who were underaged at the time. Roy Moore was a trainwreck\u2014and he could torpedo GOP chances of retaking the seat in 2020 because he\u2019s running again. Pass the whiskey bottle. This is an insanely winnable seat that could be held by Democrats if Moore muddies the waters. Jones was lucky in that the Alabama GOP in some odd turn of events, couldn\u2019t get a sentient being to run for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 former seat.\n\nNow, there have been reports that Sessions could be running again. Politico reported that while the GOP field is crowded, the former attorney general has over $2 million in the bank already from his prior campaign account, name recognition, and no sexual misconduct nonsense. Oh, and did I mention that Alabama is deep red Republican\u2014who would have a solid candidate to run against Jones should he emerge victorious in the primary. Please for all that is holy, Jeff\u2014run for your old seat. But he has precious little time in making a decision (via Politico):\n\nJeff Sessions is making calls in Alabama, and will decide soon whether to enter the Republican primary to take back his old Senate seat from Democratic Sen. Doug Jones.\n\n\n\nBut he won't have the support of a critical name: President Trump. https://t.co/eBewWwDMQD \u2014 Axios (@axios) October 29, 2019\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions is strongly considering jumping into the race for his old Senate seat in Alabama, according to multiple Republican sources familiar with the matter. [\u2026] Sessions, 72, must decide within days whether to run: Candidates have until Nov. 8 to qualify for the ballot. [\u2026] Five Republicans are already in the race: Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court judge who lost the special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Sessions has some high-profile allies pushing him to run for his old seat, including the conservative Club for Growth. [\u2026] Sessions would immediately have the money to compete in the primary. He still has $2.5 million in his campaign account, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission filing. Only Byrne has more money in the bank, with slightly over $2.5 million cash on hand. Tuberville is next closest with $1.5 million. Republicans view Alabama as their best opportunity to pick up a Senate seat in 2020 as they seek to retain their majority. Recent polling has shown Tuberville with a lead among the GOP field, though the race remains wide open. The primary is in early March, and if no candidate tops 50 percent, the top two finishers compete in a runoff at the end of March.\n\nThe publication added that Sessions was often the face of lambasting by President Trump that could damage his chances, though the president knows the GOP has to win as many down-ticket seats as possible in 2020. This is Alabama. Whoever wins the primary that isn\u2019t Roy Moore will probably get some help from Trump.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:56:56PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/6d6ed743-a3d9-4dbb-a70a-bf36e8555e93.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
