This amino acid helps promote the production of serotonin, known as the \u2018happiness hormone,'\u201d Radio Rebelde claimed. \u201cIt regulates mood and if one has low levels of it, this translates into a bad mood, depression, and irritability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith two banana peels a day for three consecutive days, you will raise serotonin levels up the 16 percent,\u201d Cuban state media alleged.\n\nThe article appears to be an attempt to help Cubans find alternatives to basic food and medicine goods that have now all but disappeared from the island. Cuba\u2019s communist economy is, by its nature, parasitic, and collapsed after the Soviet Union fell, recovering only when late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez attached the might of Venezuela, then the wealthiest nation in Latin America, to Havana\u2019s repressive regime. Two decades later, socialism has turned Venezuela into an economic disaster even more acute than Cuba, leaving the island with no way of generating funds while maintaining the lavish lifestyles of the Castro family and their hangers-on.\n\nAs, in all communist states, the wealthy never make any sacrifices to their lifestyle for the greater good, the economic crisis trickled down immediately to the people.\n\nThe food shortages are, by now, old news. In late 2018, Cubans began experiencing shortages in bread, eggs, chicken, and other basic food goods. \u201cPresident\u201d Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, the second-in-command to dictator Ra\u00fal Castro, blamed \u201cthe Trump administration\u201d and the decades-old unenforced embargo on trade with America for the shortages while acknowledging that Cuban wheat production had collapsed. Cuban officials blamed a lack of replacement parts for the nation\u2019s most vital flour mills for those shortages, then blaming capitalist countries for not selling the parts to them. Cuban dissident groups documented long food lines as early in the decade as 2016, however, challenging the idea that the election of President Trump caused the government to create food shortages.\n\nBy May of this year, the government began rationing food, following a speech in April in which Castro warned the country to prepare for the \u201cworst case\u201d economy.\n\nCubans turned the Soviet-style ration lines into an online selfie \u201cchallenge.\u201d\n\nRegime officials attempted to mitigate public discontent by claiming on state television that the people enjoyed having their food rationed. Cuban Interior Commerce Minister Betsy D\u00edaz Vel\u00e1zquez said on television in May that the rations were necessary because some individuals were \u201choarding\u201d food, and that \u201cthere are a variety of different opinions, most consider these [rations] good and even insist on us continuing to ration products.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban regime has since begun rationing soap and household detergents and has almost completely run out of basic medicines, mirroring the humanitarian disaster in Venezuela. According to a report in the Diario de Cuba newspaper this week, the most commonly missing medications from pharmacies include those for chronic diseases \u2013 such as asthma and heart conditions \u2013 as every patient who needs them needs them for life.\n\nCuba has begun arresting individuals who have communicable diseases like dengue to prevent their spread.\n\nThe most recent good to face significant shortages in Cuba is gasoline. Cubans have been forced to wait on hours-long lines in their dilapidated old cars for gasoline rations throughout the summer, the situation worsening following sanctions imposed on the Venezuelan oil industry in September for subsidizing human rights abuses against the Venezuelan people. Reports suggested this week, following Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s visit to Havana, that the Cuban regime is seeking Russian help to escort Venezuelan oil into the island illegally.\n\nMedvedev said publicly Russia was committed to helping Cuba develop its energy resources in the long-term, but said nothing about helping oil reach Cuba today.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Radio Rebelde, the website of a state-sponsored radio station in Cuba, published an article urging Cubans to eat banana and plantain peels.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-464113686-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
