Lack of respect, disloyalty & dishonesty are amongst those things.\n\n\"I know people will come with the 'I told you so', 'you should've listened' (maybe it's true) & more than likely snigger/laugh at my situation.\n\n\"The reality is my mum raised me to be a strong woman and always give the benefit of the doubt and let people prove themselves to you. Which is what I did.\n\n\"I went into this with a genuine heart & real intention to make it work. The love was as real as the hurt is now. But...I will continue to grow and love myself first.\n\n\"If it doesn't feel right, it's not right.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nIt was reported yesterday that Jourdan had decided to give her model beau the boot after accusing him of chatting with other girls while out on the town.\n\nA source told The Sun : \"Jourdan and Danny have had a few ups and downs since leaving the show but they had been getting on great recently and Jourdan was so happy.\n\n\"Things changed in the last few weeks though and Danny started acting distant and started going on more nights out.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"Jourdan started to hear rumours he was speaking to other girls behind her back. She confronted him about it but he just laughed it off.\"\n\nJust a week after the pair were dumped from the Love Island villa, they revealed they'd made the step of meeting each other's families.\n\nThey shacked up together in September, with Jourdan admitting that she felt \"proud, scared, nervous and excited\" about their relationship.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe news broke recently that third place-winning couple Ovie Soko and India Reynolds had called it quits, though by the sounds of it their split was a much more friendly affair.\n\nThey actually got together quite late in the villa, after Danny's intense romances with both Yewande Biala and Arabella Chi.\n\nFans were left fuming during Yewande's confrontation with Danny, after his head was turned by blonde bombshell Arabella.\n\nThe new couple appeared to smirk at Yewande as she spoke, but Danny and Arabella didn't last all that long either.\n\nArabella's now loved up with 2018 islander and X Factor Celebrity hopeful Wes Nelson .", "description": "Jourdan shared a lengthy post on Instagram updating fans on how she's doing following her split from Danny", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram", "Getty Images", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755718.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_jourdan-and-danny-split.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
