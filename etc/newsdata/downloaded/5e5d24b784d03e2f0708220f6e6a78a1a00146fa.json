Crash investigators in the two disasters \u2014 a Lion Air flight that went down in Indonesia, killing all 189 aboard in October, and an Ethiopian Airlines jet that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing the 157 people on board in March \u2014 implicated a flight-control software Boeing added to the jetliners.\n\nSome pilots complained they didn't even know the system existed until after the first crash. Boeing is now scrambling to provide a software update to regulators, which grounded the jets after the second crash. The Federal Aviation Administration has said it has no set time frame to allow the planes to fly again.\n\nPasztor will will report to the new Aerospace Safety Committee of the company's board and Boeing's chief engineer and oversee Boeing employees who work with the FAA to certify airplanes. Lawmakers have criticized the FAA's delegation of some certification functions to Boeing.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is scheduled to testify in front of a House panel on Oct. 30, his first appearance before lawmakers since the crashes.\n\n\"At this defining moment, Boeing must take an expanded leadership role with a heightened focus on safety \u2014 and reach even higher,\" Muilenburg said in a release.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Boeing is adopting a series of organizational changes aimed at improving safety after two 737 Max crashes killed 346 people.", "authors": ["Leslie Josephs"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105869616-gettyimages-1132062499.jpg?v=1569861782", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
