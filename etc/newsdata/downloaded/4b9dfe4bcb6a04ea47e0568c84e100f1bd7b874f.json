Matthew Sobocinski, USA TODAY\n\nIt isn't the burnt orange couch at Central Perk, but Jennifer Aniston is spilling (as former waitress Rachel Green may have) on a recent \"Friends\" reunion and the risk of a reboot.\n\nThe \"Morning Show\" actress said on Monday's \"Howard Stern Show\" that the \"whole gang\" gathered Saturday at Courteney Cox's home for dinner.\n\n\u201c(David) Schwimmer was in town, and we all happened to have a window of time, so we all got together,\" she said. \"Oh my God, we laughed so hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one in that crew annoyed you?\u201d Stern asked of the cast that also included Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry.\n\n\u201cNot one,\u201d Aniston confirmed, describing the experience as \u201clightning in a bottle.\u201d\n\n\"We all miss it every day,\u201d she said of the comedy whose finale aired in 2004 after 10 seasons. \"I would be nothing without it.\"\n\nBrad Pitt 'flubbed' his first line on 'Friends' with then-wife Jennifer Aniston\n\nJennifer Aniston opens up about days she 'wants to just cry,' doesn't 'want to be seen'\n\nThough Aniston said \"not much,\" would be required for her to reprise her role of Rachel, she worries revisiting the series would disparage it.\n\n\"I honestly think we would love it,\" she told Stern. \"I really think there is an idea that if there is a reboot of the show, it won\u2019t be even close to as good as what it was, so, why do it?\u201d\n\n\"It would ruin it,\" the radio host assessed.\n\n\"It would ruin it,\" Aniston echoed.\n\n\"And the legacy is everything, right?\" Stern asked.\n\n\"Mhmm,\" his guest agreed.\n\nWhile at the Tribeca TV Festival Friday last month, the series' co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane squashed any hopes for a reboot or reunion show.\n\n\"The reason we won't do a reunion is this is a show about that time in your life when your friends are your family and once you start having a family, that changes. So it wouldn't be what's at the heart of the show anymore,\" Kauffman said. \"The other reason is, it's not going to beat what we did.\"\n\n\"We really feel like we did the show we wanted to do and we got it right,\" Crane said. \"If you visited those characters now, it would just have a different DNA, and chances are, it wouldn't be as good a show. Why go back to the well?\"\n\n'Friends' creators insist there will never be a reboot, reveal how NBC slut-shamed Monica\n\nJennifer Aniston responds to Dolly Parton\u2019s threesome bombshell: \u2018My mouth just dropped\u2019\n\nContributing: Patrick Ryan\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/08/friends-jennifer-aniston-talks-reboot-potential-on-howard-stern/3905992002/", "description": "Jennifer Aniston is spilling (as former waitress Rachel Green may have) on a recent \"Friends\" reunion and the risk of a reboot.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
