So where do the bakers of The Great Canadian Baking Show go when they get a craving that can't be filled from their own kitchen?\n\nLiam\n\nMy favourite bakery is the Modern Bakeshop. They have amazing brownies.\n\n(Modern Bakeshop, 212 Mackenzie Ave., Revelstoke, B.C.)\n\nMary Lou\n\nGeorgestown Bakery. They do make really good sourdough breads and hearth type breads.\n\n(Georgestown Bakery, 60 Hayward Ave., St. John's, N.L.)\n\nAndrea\n\nI haven't gone to very many, because I do all my baking myself, but there's a really good cafe called Mudsharks, and they are absolutely delicious there.\n\n(Mudsharks Coffee Bar, 244D 4th St., Courtenay, B.C.)\n\nJodi\n\nThe Green Spot. They're the inspiration behind my cinnamon buns. I no longer have to buy them, because I make my own, but they have cheesecake I've never been able to replicate.\n\n(Green Spot Caf\u00e9, 1812 Hamilton St., Regina, Sask.)\n\nColin\n\nI think my favourite bakery in Toronto is Nad\u00e8ge. They make amazing macaron, beautiful little pastries. It's very elevated, very chic. It's very Toronto.\n\n(Nad\u00e8ge Patisserie, 780 Queen St. W., Toronto, Ont. and four other locations across Toronto)\n\nBetty\n\nBeaucoup Bakery. They make very good French pastries.\n\n(Beaucoup Bakery and Caf\u00e9, 2150 Fir St., Vancouver, B.C.)\n\nJay\n\nMy favourite bakery in my hometown isn't actually in my hometown, it's in the next town over. It's called the Wakefield Bakery, and they make some of the best scones and the best nut tarts out there.\n\n(Wakefield Bakery, 813 Chemin Riverside, Wakefield, Que.)\n\nChris\n\nFifty percent of the reason I moved to Edmonton in the first place was the Duchess Bake Shop, so I think they take the cake for my favourite bakery in Edmonton.\n\n(Duchess Bake Shop, 10718 124 St., Edmonton, Alta.)\n\nNataliia\n\nDuchess Bake Shop is my favourite bakery.\n\nJasmine\n\nMy favourite bakery is Ginger's Cupcakes. I know the owner through my mum. It's a great place, they just opened a second location, they have great goods.\n\n(Ginger's Cupcakes and Desserts, 10220 Yonge St., Richmond Hill, Ont. and 14 Wellington St. E., Aurora, Ont.)", "description": "The bakers of Season 3 tell us their favourite hometown bake shop", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5250668.1565992718!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/green-spot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
