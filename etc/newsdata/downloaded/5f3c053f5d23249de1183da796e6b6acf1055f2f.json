Barr.\n\nSuperintendent Johnson boycotted the event, saying he couldn\u2019t abide the president\u2019s \u201cvalues\u201d and that he opposes the administration\u2019s immigration policies. The president noted the top cop\u2019s absence shortly after taking the podium, amid thunderous applause and cheers from police chiefs across the country.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very insulting statement after all I\u2019ve done for the police, and I\u2019ve done more than any other president\u2019s ever done for the police,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the superintendent. \u201cHere\u2019s a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs, most respected people in the country, in his hometown, and with the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd you know why? It\u2019s because he\u2019s not doing his job.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, 565 people were murdered in Chicago,\u201d the president said. \u201cSince Eddie Johnson has been police chief, more than 1,500 people have been murdered in Chicago and 13,067 people have been shot.\u201d\n\nNoting that Chicago purports to have some of the nation\u2019s \u201ctoughest gun laws,\u201d the president said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to be working too well, does it?\u201d\n\nThe audience interrupted the president several times with loud applause. IACP President Paul Cell called Mr. Trump \u201cthe strongest supporter of law enforcement that this profession has ever seen.\u201d\n\nOfficer Thomas Thompson of Lubbock, Texas, among the candidates nominated for the association\u2019s police officer of the year award, told Mr. Trump, \u201cMr. President, thank you for your support of law enforcement, especially in this day and age. That\u2019s no small thing. It matters.\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Johnson said the president\u2019s attack confirmed for him that he is \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot denounced the president\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that @realDonaldTrump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago,\u201d the mayor tweeted. \u201cLuckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone \u2014 no matter how high the office \u2014 denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\n\nShe said of the president, \u201cRather than belittle Chicago\u2019s communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate. President Trump knows as much about policing as he does running a fair and transparent government. I stand by the Superintendent for living up to the values of this great city and its residents.\u201d\n\nIt was Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit to the Windy City since his inauguration. He has repeatedly criticized the Democratic bastion as a national embarassment for its high levels of crime and gun violence.\n\nOn Monday, the president called Chicago the \u201cworst sanctuary city in America,\u201d saying the city \u201cprotects criminals at a level few could even imagine\u201d \u2014 1,162 illegal immigrants last year alone who were shielded from federal immigration detainers.\n\n\u201cPeople like Johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago, and those are his values and frankly those values to me are a disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI want Eddie Johnson to change his values, and change them fast.\u201d\n\nWith his risk of impeachment rising, the president also turned to actor Jussie Smollett of Chicago, who was accused last winter of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself and blaming it on Trump supporters. Mr. Smollett was indicted on multiple charges of disorderly conduct, which have since been dropped.\n\n\u201cThen you have the case of this wise guy Jussie Smollett, who beat up \u2026 himself,\u201d the president said to uproarious laughter from the police chiefs. \u201cAnd he said MAGA country did it. That\u2019s a hate crime and a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam. Smollett is still trying to get away with it.\u201d\n\nThe trip also served to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign coffers for reelection. He attended big-money fundraiser at his Trump Hotel & Tower in Chicago, raking in an estimated $4 million from about 250 guests.\n\nAbout 3,000 demonstrators gathered near Trump Tower to protest the president\u2019s visit, holding signs, blowing whistles and calling for his impeachment.\n\nAmid the protesters, a man wearing a red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d hat walked in support of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why the president should be treated like a criminal, especially here in a classic middle-American city,\u201d the unidentified man told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nSince he campaigned for the presidency in 2016, Mr. Trump has enjoyed strong support from law-enforcement officials, many of whom clashed with the Obama administration over its perceived support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Police morale reached a low point in Mr. Obama\u2019s final year in office, as police officers in several cities were killed in targeted attacks by activists.\n\nMr. Trump reminds police frequently that he has their backs, and he did so again Monday in Chicago.\n\n\u201cUnder this administration, we are once again standing up for law enforcement, we\u2019re condemning anti-police bias in all forms, and we\u2019re giving you the support, resources, and the respect \u2014 and we have tremendous respect for you \u2014 the respect that you deserve,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will keep our streets secure, our cities guarded and our loved ones safe. We will fight violent crime, uphold the peace, enforce the law and with God as our witness, we will proudly serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States.\n\n\u201cTo all the terrific officers here today, thank you for your unwavering courage, your unbreakable devotion. Today and every day I vow to stand proudly, loyally and faithfully with the men and women in blue,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Barr will announce a new crackdown on violent crime \u2014 the president suggested calling it \u201cThe Surge\u201d \u2014 within two weeks targeting gangs and drug traffickers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing something that\u2019s very dramatic,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to see tremendous results very quickly.\u201d\n\nThe president also signed an executive order to establish a new Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, to provide recommendations to address challenges that burden law enforcement, including homelessness and mental illness. He said the commission \u201cwill study best practices to recruit, retrain, hire, train, and provide for the health, safety, and the wellbeing of law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to take care of our law enforcement officers,\u201d the president said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
