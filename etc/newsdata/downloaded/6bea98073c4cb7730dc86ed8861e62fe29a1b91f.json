(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)\n\nJust because Randy Moss\u2019 career as a player is over doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t still have some fun.\n\nThe Hall of Fame wide receiver gave a shout-out to one of the sillier moments of his career during ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown,\u201d calling back to Joe Buck\u2019s infamous \u201cdisgusting act\u201d comment against him in 2005.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDuring the show\u2019s \u201cC\u2019Mon Man!\u201d segment, Joe Burrow\u2019s pantsing on national television against Mississippi State was a natural inclusion. Moss\u2019 analysis of the moment: \u201cWhat a disgusting act!\u201d\n\nRandy Moss yelling \u201cWHAT A DISGUSTING ACT\u201d \ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/HShXZj3WNt \u2014 Adam Stites (@AdamStites_) October 22, 2019\n\nMoss\u2019 co-hosts lost it in response.\n\nFor the NFL fans out there not familiar with the old days of Randy Moss humiliating cornerbacks, the joke was a reference to a particularly silly moment in which Moss scored a long touchdown against the Green Bay Packers in a 2005 NFC wild card game and celebrated by simulating a mooning of the Green Bay crowd.\n\nThe celebration was a reference to Packers fans\u2019 tradition of mooning opposing teams\u2019 buses, but Buck wasn\u2019t amused.\n\n\u201cThat is a disgusting act by Randy Moss and it\u2019s unfortunate that we had that on our air live. That is disgusting by Randy Moss,\u201d Buck said without an ounce of humor. The NFL wasn\u2019t amused either, fining Moss $10,000 for the fake mooning.\n\nMoss and Buck have since buried the hatchet, with an amicable discussion of the incident on the air when the two were co-workers at Fox. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean Moss still can\u2019t have his fun though.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Joe Buck once chastised Randy Moss for a fake mooning of a Packers crowd.
