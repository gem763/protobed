He said he had invited Fernandez to the presidential palace on Monday morning to discuss an orderly transition, which is seen as essential for Argentina\u2019s shaky economy and markets.\n\nRaucous crowds cheered at Fernandez\u2019s election headquarters but the mood was far more muted across the city at Macri\u2019s election party, even though his \u201cTogether for Change\u201d coalition performed much more strongly than many polls had expected.\n\n\u201cThis resounding victory in the first round is a very clear expression of the Argentine people,\u201d said Felipe Sol\u00e1, one of Fernandez\u2019s closest advisers with the \u201cFront for All\u201d party.\n\nA candidate needs 45% of the vote, or 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, to avoid a second round.\n\nFernandez had been the heavy favorite since winning a landslide victory in primaries in August. He extended that lead in pre-election opinion polls.\n\n\u201cAlberto has won it and I am super happy. We spent four very hard years,\u201d Paola Fiore, a 35-year-old public employee, told Reuters at Fernandez\u2019s election base. \u201cThe excitement and expectations we have are because we know that a government that thinks about the people is back.\u201d\n\nThe vote will have far-reaching implications. Argentina is one of the world\u2019s top grain exporters, is stirring the energy world with its huge Vaca Muerta shale field and is on the cusp of restructuring talks with creditors over $100 billion in debt.\n\n\u2018TWO OPPOSING VIEWS\u2019\n\nPolling stations closed at 6 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Sunday. Soon afterward, Argentine media quickly started to call the election in Fernandez\u2019s favor, although with few details about the size of his lead.\n\n\u201cI voted for Fernandez because I see people just very unhappy in the street and I want a country with a better economy and more social support,\u201d Carlos Berenguer, 71, said outside a polling station in the district of Palermo in Buenos Aires.\n\nMacri supporter Jos\u00e9 Luis Salom\u00f3n, the mayor of farming town Saladillo, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s in play in this election are simply two opposing views of the country.\u201d\n\nFernandez, a relative unknown outside Argentine political circles until this year, held a 20-point lead in most opinion polls after thumping Macri in the August primary. Markets had been rattled after the primary as investors feared a populist political shift.\n\nSupporters of presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez react, in Buenos Aires, Argentina October 27, 2019.

NO ARCHIVES\n\nThe primary result - and the market crash that followed - sharply altered the dynamic of the race, pushing the country further into economic crisis and making Macri the underdog in an election that most had thought would be a closely fought battle.\n\n\u201cWe are in an enormous crisis and as a result, we all have to be very responsible for what\u2019s coming. It will be an effort from all of us,\u201d Fernandez said as he cast his vote in a Buenos Aires polling station earlier on Sunday.\n\n\u2018FOUR COMPLEX YEARS\u2019\n\nThe economy has taken center stage, with Argentina in the grip of recession for most of the past year, the outlook for growth darkening, annual inflation over 50%, job numbers down and poverty up sharply.\n\nOther voters said, however, they feared a return of the Peronist left, which they blamed for leaving an already broken economy when Macri came to power in 2015. Supporters of the president said Macri needed more time to sort things out.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s been four complex years, I have hope Macri can fix it,\u201d said Pablo Nicol\u00e1s, 36, an accountant, as he voted on Sunday. He said he did not trust Fernandez\u2019s running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\nMacri won backers with plans to reform Argentina\u2019s notoriously closed economy with trade deals and a successful push to lure foreign investment into energy projects and infrastructure.\n\nHis reform plans were badly hit in 2018 when a currency and debt crisis forced him to strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund for an eventual $57 billion to help Argentina to pay its bills.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nFern\u00e1ndez will now take over Macri\u2019s mantle - as well as negotiations with creditors, including the IMF, about restructuring more than $100 billion in sovereign debt amid fears the country could face a damaging default.\n\nMost investors were already pricing in a Peronist opposition win, although a big victory could lead to renewed volatility in markets, which have been constrained by recently imposed capital controls.", "description": "Argentina's Peronists swept back into power on Sunday, ousting conservative president Mauricio Macri in an election result that shifts Latin America's No. 3 economy firmly back toward the left after it was battered by economic crisis.", "authors": ["Nicol\u00e1s Misculin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445646665&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0V8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
