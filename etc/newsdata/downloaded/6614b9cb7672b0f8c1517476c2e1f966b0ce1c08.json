The storm lingered over the islands after making landfall three times that day, triggering severe flooding and threatening parts of the country with the prospect of up to 30 inches of rain.\n\nOne image, taken before noon Monday by Finnish company Iceye, shows areas including the Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport hit by flooding. The airport, the country's northernmost air transportation hub, was under several feet of water Monday and remained closed Tuesday.\n\nIceye outlined the coastline in yellow and the roads in white using data from OpenStreetMap to give a better understanding of the flooding.\n\nThese images taken Wednesday and around noon local time on Monday shows vast areas of Grand Bahama Island hit with flooding.\n\nSOURCE Iceye and OpenStreetMap\n\nTracking Dorian: Where is Hurricane Dorian located now? The storm is slowly rolling toward Florida\n\nThe historic storm pummeled the Bahamas for more than 36 hours, leaving at least five people dead and an estimated 13,000 homes destroyed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dorian diminished to a Category 2 and wind speeds lessened slightly to 110 mph, with higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm slowly turned north, inching toward Florida, and the center of the storm began pulling away from the battered islands at 6 mph, according to the hurricane center.\n\nAn image taken by Iceye on Tuesday showed the storm surge appearing to recede in the Abaco Islands, a group of islands including Great Abaco, Little Abaco and dozens of small barrier cays in the northern Bahamas.\n\nIf Dorian remains on this track, it will move \"dangerously close\" to Florida's east coast and the Georgia coast through Wednesday night and loom over the coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina late Thursday through Friday morning, according to the hurricane center.\n\nGet the latest: Historic hurricane Dorian growing, lurching toward USA; Bahamas devastated\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Janine Zeitlin, USA TODAY.
