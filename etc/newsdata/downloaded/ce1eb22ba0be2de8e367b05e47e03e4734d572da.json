As it heads up the coast, lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen!\" he tweeted.\n\n\"On the other hand, the Bahamas have been devastated,\" he wrote.\n\nDorian, which has dumped as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain on the Bahamas, was downgraded Tuesday morning to a Category 2 hurricane on the five-level wind scale.\n\nBut it remained an extremely dangerous storm as it moved along the Florida coast.\n\nA state of emergency has been declared up and down the east coast for millions of US residents potentially in the path of the storm.\n\nThe Pentagon said 5,000 members of the National Guard and 2,700 active-duty troops were ready to help out if needed.\n\n- 'Some have lost everything' -\n\nAt 7:00 pm (2300 GMT), Dorian was packing maximum sustained winds of 110 miles (175 kilometers) per hour, the NHC said.\n\nIt said Dorian was expected to turn toward the north on Wednesday evening.\n\nThis will be \"followed by a turn toward the north-northeast Thursday morning. On this track, the core of Hurricane Dorian will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast and the Georgia coast tonight through Wednesday night,\" it said.\n\nYasmin Rigby, a resident of Freeport in the Bahamas, told AFP that \"most of the island is still flooded\" and it was \"still raining with gusty winds.\"\n\n\"I am still getting calls from people calling for help,\" Rigby said. \"I cannot move from my apartment. Thankfully we have sufficient supplies.\"\n\nIn Coconut Grove, Florida, which has a sizeable population from the Bahamas, residents were collecting supplies for hurricane victims.\n\n\"We are looking for cases of water, canned food, can openers, flashlights, baby formula, diapers, mosquito repellent, small generators,\" said Nathaniel Robinson, the pastor of the Greater St Paul AME church.\n\nRobinson said seven seaplanes were on standby to deliver the supplies \"when the weather permits.\"\n\n\"Hopefully tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nRobinson said some church members have family who were \"devastated by the storm.\"\n\n\"Some have lost everything they own,\" he said. \"Their homes, any forms of transportation, businesses. They have absolutely nothing.\"\n\nHenry Gomez, who was visiting Florida from New York, was among those dropping off supplies. \"I feel bad for the Bahamas, what they're going through right now,\" Gomez said. \"We all have to chip in and help.\"", "description": "Weakening slightly but still packing a powerful punch, Hurricane Dorian churned along the southeastern coast of the United States on Tuesday after delivering a devastating blow to the Bahamas.
