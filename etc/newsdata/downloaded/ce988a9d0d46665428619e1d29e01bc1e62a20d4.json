It was not immediately clear why the stock surged in the extended session but two block trades totaling roughly 1.2 million shares crossed at 5:09 p.m. Eastern time at a price of $8.40 a share. If Cronos shares hold on to the gains, the late Wednesday move will be the second largest in the company's history and the largest since the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

CTST, -4.35% TRST, -3.85% have notched double-digit gains because an exchange traded fund has re-balanced its portfolio after significant changes to the market price. Cronos Group stock closed up roughly 1% to $8.40 during the regular session.", "description": "Shares of Cronos Group Inc. rampaged in the extended session Wednesday, gaining as much as 41.5% as of 6:22 p.m. Eastern time on heavy volume, before...", "authors": ["Max A.
