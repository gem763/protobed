Lawmaker Pressed for Ambassador\u2019s Ouster, Diplomat Will Say", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Robert Livingston, the former Republican congressman turned lobbyist, repeatedly told a foreign service officer assigned to the White House that the American ambassador to Ukraine should be fired because of her association with Democrats, the officer plans to tell impeachment investigators on Wednesday.\n\nThe officer, Catherine M. Croft, will testify that she \u201cdocumented\u201d multiple calls from Mr. Livingston about the ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, while she was working at the National Security Council from mid-2017 to mid-2018. She plans to say she informed two other officials \u2014 Fiona Hill, then the senior director for Europe and Russia at the council, and George P. Kent, a Ukraine expert at the State Department \u2014 about them at the time.\n\n\u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d she will say, referring to the billionaire liberal philanthropist, according to a copy of Ms. Croft\u2019s opening statement reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cIt was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d\n\nThe testimony shifts forward by several months a timeline of known attacks on Ms. Yovanovitch by conservatives questioning, without evidence, her loyalty to President Trump. It is not clear if Mr. Livingston\u2019s work, or those financing it, were in any way connected to efforts by two Americans with business interests in Ukraine who wanted her gone and, later, by Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Nor did Ms. Croft have anything to say about who else Mr. Livingston spoke with.", "description": "Robert Livingston, the former congressman turned lobbyist, repeatedly contacted a White House official to criticize Marie L.
