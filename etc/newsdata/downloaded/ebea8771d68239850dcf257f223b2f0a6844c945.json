That poll will determine the course of the country\u2019s departure from the European Union \u2014 or might even cancel it altogether.\n\nThe bill passed in Parliament on Tuesday against the backdrop of a charged political atmosphere, which had created some fear that last-minute wrangling over details could derail it at the eleventh hour.\n\nAccording to Britain\u2019s pollsters, Johnson has a commanding lead among the public, but the vagaries of the electoral system mean it will be touch-and-go for him to secure a majority. If he does, it could finally mean a decisive end to three years of political turmoil over Brexit.\n\nJohnson was elected leader of the Conservative Party in July on a pledge to ensure a rapid exit from the EU on Oct. 31, even at the risk of economic disruption. He failed in that pledge after a rebellion by some Conservative MPs led to Parliament\u2019s saying \u201cno\u201d to the notion of Brexit at any price, and Johnson promptly sacked all of them, erasing his majority.\n\nThe EU then agreed to extend the deadline to Jan. 31, paving the way for a U.K. election to resolve the gridlock in Parliament. Much will hinge upon the result, which could be very close.\n\nThe country is still largely split down the middle on Brexit, along the lines of the 2016 referendum, which produced a 52-48 majority for leaving. Most pollsters say that ratio has now reversed, but the country is finely balanced.\n\nYet even a small majority for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives would mean Brexit will happen fast \u2014 almost certainly by Jan. 31 \u2014 and entirely on the terms of 2016\u2019s victorious \u201cLeave\u201d campaign, of which Johnson was a leader and whose staffers now hold key posts in his administration. Johnson has purged pro-EU rebels from his party \u2014 including one who was the U.K.\u2019s finance minister until July.\n\nSo if he wins, his party will be united behind his vision of Brexit: the greatest possible orderly separation of economic ties between Britain and its largest trading partner.\n\nIn the short term, markets UKX, -0.34% Z00, +0.18% and the pound GBPUSD, -0.0155% will welcome a deal \u2014 any deal. That is because it secures a much-needed \u201ctransition period,\u201d a two-year hiatus in which businesses will retain access to EU markets on the same basis as today. It removes the risk of the crash-out \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit that markets have spent three years fretting over.\n\nSo once the transition is definitely secured, the pound and U.K. assets can be expected to bounce. Azad Zangana, a senior economist at U.K. fund manager Schroders, said that \u201ca smooth Brexit with a transition period removes a great deal of downside risk for the U.K. economy. We would expect business investment to rebound.\u201d\n\nBut few expect the divorce to be positive for the U.K. economy in the long term. It could be particularly bad news for the manufacturing sector, which has developed close ties with Europe.\n\nOliver Blackbourn, who manages money for Janus Henderson in London, pointed out that the country still faces years\u2019 worth of negotiations with the EU over a future trade treaty. \u201cContinued uncertainty about the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU is likely to weigh on growth.\u201d\n\nBut is Johnson certain to win, and pass his deal? There is an unusual amount of uncertainty in the pollsters\u2019 predictions, as the companies themselves are the first to admit. Brexit has shattered the U.K.\u2019s established two-party system.\n\nA new force has arisen on the right, the simply named Brexit Party, which campaigns on the premise that even Johnson\u2019s plans are too EU-friendly. Conversely, Britain\u2019s longstanding third-placed Liberal Democrats have doubled down on their traditional pro-European stance, promising to immediately revoke the U.K.\u2019s exit notice and ignore the 2016 referendum result.\n\nBoth have looked competitive in some recent polls, though the Lib Dems\u2019 more established presence is more likely to translate into seats in Parliament. But the Brexit Party could eat into the Conservatives\u2019 vote and could deny them victories \u2014 unless Johnson agrees a pact with them, as anti-EU campaigners want.\n\nMeanwhile the Liberal Democrats are likely to poach some of Labour\u2019s votes, splitting the allegiance of the \u201cRemain\u201d half of the country. But complicating the picture, there have been in previous elections far more competitive Lib Dem\u2013Conservative face-offs than Lib Dem\u2013Labour ones. A whole swath of seats in the West of England fit this bill. So a Lib Dem revival could also hurt Johnson.\n\nIn some seats, pundits are expecting full-blown four-way dogfights. In Scotland, which accounts for 59 members of the U.K.\u2019s 650-strong House of Commons, the established parties are all on the run before the Scottish National Party, which pundits predict may even extend its commanding lead this time.\n\nWith that backdrop, translating Johnson\u2019s steady lead in U.K. national polls into a result on the ground is a fool\u2019s game. One can easily tell the pollsters who care about the integrity of their profession: They are the ones saying \u201cwe simply don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo if Johnson does fall short of his majority \u2014 what then?\n\nFew expect Labour to outright win this election, though nothing is impossible. If it does, or if it can form a coalition with either \u2014 or both \u2014 Lib Dems and SNP, then the U.K. is heading for either a softer form of Brexit or its complete cancellation.\n\nLabour\u2019s policy is to negotiate a \u201cbetter\u201d deal with the EU and then put it to a public referendum to confirm it \u2014 in which voters could also chose to abandon Brexit entirely. Labour\u2019s leader has said he would remain neutral in such a vote, and do whatever he is told.\n\nA more plausible outcome of December\u2019s vote is a Parliament in which Johnson has no majority, but the Conservatives are the largest party and form a minority administration.\n\nIf that is the outcome, the U.K. is essentially back to Square One on Brexit. Johnson will be a prime minister who has bet the house on a clean break with Europe, who has reshaped his party in that image, but who once again cannot get it through Parliament. If he tried to reverse course for a softer, \u201ccompromise\u201d Brexit, the party he has created will eat him alive \u2014 just as it did his predecessor.\n\nIt really all does come down to that majority.", "description": "Polls show Britain\u2019s leader ahead of his rivals for a December election that will determine the fate of the country\u2019s attempt to leave the EU.
