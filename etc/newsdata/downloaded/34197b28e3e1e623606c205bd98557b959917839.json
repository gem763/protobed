It\u2019s working to adapt its corporate software, used by almost all of the world\u2019s 100 most valuable brands, to the web and is taking on younger rivals in cloud-based computing.\n\nThere\u2019s also been an exodus of company veterans, which as of 12:44 a.m. Friday in Walldorf, included CEO Bill McDermott.\n\nAnalysts have called the late-night news a surprise; McDermott\u2019s contract doesn\u2019t run out until 2021. He also unveiled a major restructuring plan in April and was expected to brief investors on the company\u2019s strategy next month.\n\nBut, as he said on a conference call after the announcement, \u201cTen years is a long time to be CEO.\u201d\n\nMcDermott, 58, had been with the company since 2002 when he joined as head of its North American business. At the time, he was that unit\u2019s fourth head in three years as SAP struggled to compete with rivals like Oracle Corp., and grappled with a drop in sales of software licenses. Problems with its products were blamed for delayed shipments of Whirlpool Corp.\u2019s appliances and even Hershey\u2019s Halloween chocolates.\n\nIn the role, he recruited a new management team, changed the way the sales department targeted customers, and ultimately boosted sales growth. When CEO Leo Apotheker unexpectedly resigned in 2010, McDermott and product-development head Jim Snabe were picked to replace him as co-CEOs. Snabe -- currently chairman of Siemens AG -- stepped down and took a spot on the board in 2014, and McDermott became sole head of the company.\n\nWith nearly 100,000 employees and a sprawling business that generated about $27 billion in revenue last year, driving change has sometimes been controversial. Since 2011, McDermott spent $26 billion on six major cloud acquisitions, and was the main advocate for the $8 billion acquisition of Qualtrics International Inc., the company\u2019s largest-ever deal.\n\nAnalysts criticized the purchase as too expensive. In November, Qualtrics said it expected revenue for 2018 to exceed $400 million, a figure that wouldn\u2019t move the needle much for SAP. McDermott defended the deal, believing that combining SAP\u2019s sales force and a trove of operational data with Qualtrics\u2019s customer experience feedback would accelerate growth.\n\nMore recently, the company attracted the interest of activists at Elliott Management Corp., which revealed its 1.2 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) stake when SAP announced a change in strategy in April. SAP had been vague at the time, saying it planned \u201cnew initiatives to accelerate operational excellence and value creation\u201d with a focus on \u201ctuck-in\u201d acquisitions.\n\nSAP underwent a management shakeup in the weeks preceding the April announcement. The president of its cloud business, 27-year SAP veteran Robert Enslin, had announced his departure earlier that month. It was later revealed he\u2019d left for Google. A day earlier, Chief Technology Officer Bjoern Goerke, another cloud expert based in the U.S., penned a blog post saying he was leaving the company he joined as a student in 1988. Board member Bernd Leukert, a seasoned IT executive, left SAP in February.\n\nPersonally, McDermott also had to weather a near-fatal accident in 2015 that cost him an eye when he fell down some stairs while carrying a water glass and nearly bled to death.\n\nHis replacements are a mix of old and new guard at SAP. Christian Klein, 39, spent the past 20 years at SAP, after joining as a student in 1999. Jennifer Morgan, 48, arrived in 2004 and was the first American woman on the company\u2019s executive board. Morgan has been seen as McDermott\u2019s protege, rising relatively quickly through the ranks, and most recently served as the president of the all-important cloud group.\n\nTogether, Klein and Morgan will have to find a way to compete with younger companies like Salesforce.com Inc. and Workday Inc. while encumbered by a traditional enterprise software business.\n\nCloud is the company\u2019s clear growth engine, with revenue increasing about 32% last year to about 5 billion euros. Sales from its largest business, which helps clients set up and implement SAP\u2019s software, grew less than 1% in 2019.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- SAP SE is sticking to its new plan of keeping the company youthful, and top management isn\u2019t being spared.The storied German software giant, Europe\u2019s biggest tech company by market value, has spent the past few years attempting to reinvent itself.
