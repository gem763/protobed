In his view, success for SMEs is reliant upon building world-class teams, and harnessing technology to collaborate with top professionals \u2013 no matter where they may be located.\n\nTo drive collaboration, in real time, he asserts that SMEs must harness cloud computing in the form of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) (see sidebar).\n\n\u201cWith cloud computing, SMEs are able to leverage best-of-breed technology, using an accessible, subscription-based model,\u201d adds de Nysschen. \u201cThis allows them to compete with businesses that have huge balance sheets and access to capital.\u201d\n\nTransforming the finance department\n\nA clear example of how the cloud is empowering SMEs can be found in the growing role of cloud-based accounting software. New, virtual accounting platforms are enabling business owners to collaborate and work with accountants \u2018in the cloud\u2019 by accessing the same set of accounting records \u2013 in real time \u2013 and sharing information more freely with each other.\n\nThis means that instead of capturing data manually, the cloud offers integrated solutions whereby, for example, bank transactions feed directly into the system \u2013 removing errors and saving time. Naturally, this frees up accountants and financial managers to provide more analysis and advisory around growth opportunities for SMEs.\n\nColin Timmis, country manager at Xero South Africa, which provides online, cloud-based accounting software, also points out that cloud-based accounting is creating new opportunities for SMEs through data. This is because digital platforms, whereby data is stored on one, common server, make it easier to integrate accounting with other functions \u2013 and with other key SME role players.\n\n\u201cAt Xero, for example, we\u2019ve announced new agreements with three South African digital lenders: Bridgement, Retail Capital, and Lulalend,\u201d notes Timmis in Xero\u2019s 2019 State of South African Small Business report. \u201cInitiatives like these will improve businesses\u2019 access to funding \u2013 and make the accounting function more versatile and multidimensional.\u201d\n\nChange on the horizon\n\nThe 2019 Xero report, conducted in partnership with IT consultancy World Wide Worx, found that only 22% of local SMEs are using cloud accounting tools \u2013 with 23% of all respondents still doing their books manually.\n\nThis should begin to change soon, however, as overall tech savvy increases and the technology itself becomes more accessible. Arthur Goldstuck, managing director of World Wide Worx, says that SMEs will probably leapfrog from basic, paper-based accounting to cloud platforms in the next 24 months \u2013 largely because of new data centres coming online in South Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft launched enterprise-grade data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) says it will open an infrastructure region in SA in the first half of 2020. According to experts, the new data centres will provide African businesses with far greater availability to cloud services, at a lower cost.\n\n\u201cPrevious to the South African data centres coming online, local businesses were forced to connect to data centres in Europe and North America \u2013 which put them at a disadvantage to global competitors with decreased latency and higher costs,\u201d says Goldstuck of World Wide Worx.\n\nTraining is key\n\nAlthough the increasing availability of cloud platforms (coupled with better connectivity in the form of fibre and impending 5G rollouts) will certainly give SMEs a boost, it ultimately falls on business owners to drive technology adoption.\n\nXero\u2019s Timmis explains that a major barrier to technological adoption today is training.\n\n\u201cWhile this wasn\u2019t reflected in our survey, it\u2019s fair to say that most employees are not hired for their cloud computing skills,\u201d he says.\n\nThe 2019 survey found that 67% of businesses don\u2019t intend to allocate budget for training employees around \u2018using their essential technologies\u2019.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an argument that these tools should be intuitive or self explanatory, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that a new invoicing software or CRM system will have a learning curve \u2013 however deep or shallow,\u201d notes Timmis.\n\n\u201cPutting processes in place for training employees can be costly in the short term but will pay dividends in the long term as teams upskill themselves with little supervision or additional expense. The financial impact of training an existing team is usually lower than the price of interviewing, hiring and on-boarding new staff.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Xero report warns that when employees are expected to self-teach and figure it out as they go, they run the risk of \u201clearning to work around the technology rather than with it\u201d.\n\nTimmis points to platforms such as live and online courses, webinars, and events to train employees and to help them become more comfortable using cloud-based tools.\n\nA critical shift\n\nAccording to several studies and research papers, SMEs in South Africa provide about 61% of the country\u2019s employment.\n\nWhile many fear that new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence will threaten local jobs, it is more likely that the strategic adoption of cloud computing and other digital platforms will in fact create jobs through enabling sustainable business growth.\n\nAs the 2019 Xero/World Wide Worx report aptly concludes: \u201cIf small businesses seize the opportunity, they won\u2019t just transform their fortunes, they\u2019ll transform those of the entire country.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in the 29 August edition of finweek.
