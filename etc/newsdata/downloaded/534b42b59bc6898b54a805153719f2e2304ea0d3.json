[Photo/IC]\n\nWashington has tried to justify its trade war against China as a noble crusade to better improve the latter's business practices and business environment. But it has been unable to pull the wool over people's eyes, since it is clear that its tariffs are simply intended to blow China's doors open for a smash-and-grab.\n\nWhile its geligniting of trade has failed in that larcenous endeavor, it has served Washington's purported purpose since it has accelerated the upgrading of China's economy and the accompanying improvement of its business environment that was already under way.\n\nIn the World Bank Group's Doing Business 2020 study, an annual project evaluating countries' business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, China for a second year found itself among the top 10 countries where the business climate has improved the most.\n\nThe country's position on the report's \"Ease of Doing Business Ranking\", as a result, moved up to 31 \u2014 from 46th the previous year. This is the first time the country has made it into the top 40.\n\nAmid the unfolding trade tit-for-tat between China and the United States, particularly the gloomy Chinese business environment Washington officials keep pedaling to the rest of the world, the World Bank report came in sharp contrast.\n\nAlthough the study is preoccupied with business environments for countries' domestic private sectors, it does lend credit to Beijing's claim of making every effort to make doing business easier.\n\nChina implemented reforms in eight of the 10 areas the study monitors, said the report. Obtaining a company seal, construction permits, electricity connection, paying taxes, exporting and importing, and commercial litigation have all been made easier in the last year, it found, and protections for minority investors and creditors in insolvency cases have been enhanced.\n\nAlthough the report does not encompass everything it takes for creating a fine business climate, especially when players and factors from beyond the private sector or overseas entities are taken into account, it is generally consistent with what people see.\n\nThe pro-business measures introduced lately have been more targeted than before. And, aside from pledges of better IPR protection and a ban on forced technology transfers, the government has gone the extra mile to address foreign investor concerns about operating in China.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang, for one, has reiterated on many occasions the country's continuous commitment to opening-up, and repeatedly invited foreign companies to come and enjoy the government's new offers, because the improved business-friendly policy framework is not rhetorical.\n\nThe World Bank's report is evidence of that.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db19c57a310cf3e97a2d4f6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
