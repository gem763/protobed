This won't end well | Rebecca Solnit", "language": "en", "text": "Do Americans still have a government? I do not know. What I do know is that President Trump and the upper echelons of the executive branch are at war with the legislative branch, the rule of law, the constitution, federal civil servants and the American people. It\u2019s a conflict that pulls in many directions, and if the president threatened civil war the other day as something that could happen if he doesn\u2019t get his way, we can regard the ordinary state of things as a low-intensity civil war or a slo-mo coup that\u2019s been going on from the beginning. Tuesday\u2019s White House refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry only escalates their defiance and their chaos.\n\nThe chaos takes so many forms. Innumerable stories have made it clear that even the president\u2019s own aides and cabinet members treat him like a captive bear or a person having a psychotic breakdown \u2013 like someone unstable who must be kept from harming himself and others. They have done that by heaping on the flattery, and by warping and limiting the information he receives, and often by doing their best to prevent his directives from being realized.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported on a March meeting about the border. According to aides, Trump \u201csuggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down\u201d. When he was told that wasn\u2019t allowed, he ordered that the border be closed. That set off a \u201cfrenzied week of presidential rages, round-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time. By the end of the week, the seat-of-the-pants president had backed off his threat but had retaliated with the beginning of a purge of the aides who had tried to contain him.\u201d\n\nPassivity and disengagement got us here; political engagement will get us out\n\nThis is the kind of story we\u2019ve become used to \u2013 outrages and viciousness and inanity and all \u2013 but it\u2019s worth reading another way, as a story about a bear lashing out at whatever\u2019s around him and gobbling up the scraps they feed him while he is still chained to the wall. When we refer to the \u201cpresident\u201d we really mean whatever ad hoc group of people with proximity is manipulating him, lying to him, or preventing him from knowing or doing something. They sometimes prevent harm or illegality. But this is only half of the administrative \u201cteam.\u201d The other half consists of those serving his personal agenda, and in this respect the federal government has become a subsidiary of Trump Incorporated.\n\nWilliam Barr is supposed to be this nation\u2019s attorney general, whose job the Judiciary Act of 1789 defined as \u201cto give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the United States.\u201d But Barr has been bouncing all over the globe pushing the president\u2019s self-serving conspiracy theories and smears of rival candidates, a stunning violation of his role.\n\nMike Pompeo, the secretary of state, took an oath to \u201csupport and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d and has since become one of those enemies in service of others. He was on the July phone call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and discredit the story of the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. The leverage for this request seems to have been the hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid \u2013 taxpayer dollars \u2013 withheld by President Trump at the time.\n\nThe Guardian reported a few days ago that Pompeo \u201cdismissed summonses from Democratic committee chairmen in the House of Representatives for five current and former state department officials to testify on the president\u2019s attempts to push Ukraine to dig up dirt on his leading political rival.\u201d And Tuesday, Pompeo\u2019s State Department blocked former ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who\u2019s implicated in the Ukrainian shakedown, from testifying to Congress, a clear and open obstruction of justice.\n\nThe phrase \u201cparty over country\u201d has been used to describe Republicans for years, but at this point it\u2019s more or less puppet over country, because the loyalty is to Trump\u2019s corrupt, delusional, floundering endeavors to keep himself in power and out of trouble with the law. Trump\u2019s own loyalties are to himself, his profits, and his next political campaign\u2014and perhaps to Vladimir Putin, before whom he grovels regularly, and whose agenda he has served even with this undermining of our relationship with Ukraine and the search for evidence to exonerate Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nJudge rejects Trump's 'repugnant' immunity claim in tax-return ruling Read more\n\nAnother unsurprising detail emerged in a recent New York Times story: \u201cIn Ukraine, where officials are wary of offending President Trump, four meandering cases that involve Mr Manafort, Mr Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, have been effectively frozen by Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor. The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid, and keenly aware of Mr Trump\u2019s distaste for\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u201cinto possible collusion between Russia and his campaign.\u201d\n\nSo at the top there\u2019s corruption. But down below there\u2019s dismantling and disarray. The Trump administration\u2019s has a habit of firing or sidelining federal employees whose work is politically inconvenient. In 2017, Joel Clement, formerly head of policy analysis at the interior department, wrote about being taken away from his work on the impact of climate change on Native Alaskans and reassigned to \u201can unrelated job in the accounting office that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies.\u201d There are numerous stories like his, of employees doing valuable work told to move across the country to keep their jobs, a maneuver that at best burdens them or renders them ineffectual, but often drives them out of their positions. The country is hemmorhaging people who provide oversight and keep key systems working.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission normally has six members and needs four to have a quorum; it is currently at three with no sign of a new appointment in sight. \u201cWithout the quorum,\u201d the New York Times reports, \u201cthe FEC can\u2019t investigate complaints, issue opinions, or fine violators.\u201d I didn\u2019t formerly think of myself as a big fan of rule of law, since those laws have always been applied harshly to the most vulnerable and most marginalized and were often written to embed racism, misogyny, and homophobia into law. But we now face something worse: the corruption and decay of rule of law in the service of billionaires and misogynistic white supremacists, a system in which the most powerful gain power and shed accountability.\n\nWe are entering a period of immense danger in which this self-serving president\u2019s stupidity and ruthlessness could lead to almost anything\u2014and I wrote that sentence before the feckless decision about Syria and Turkey. Congress will have to stand strong against whatever he unleashes. The fact that we may also have to rely on a supreme court with two appointments made by this illegitimate president is also alarming.\n\nBut we must not lose hope. In addition to the three branches of government, there is an unofficial fourth \u2013 civil society \u2013 which must exert itself. The will of the people is both what is at stake when a government becomes unaccountable and the force that can protect our embattled public interest. Passivity and disengagement got us here; political engagement will get us out.", "description": "At the top there\u2019s corruption, down below there\u2019s dismantling and disarray.
