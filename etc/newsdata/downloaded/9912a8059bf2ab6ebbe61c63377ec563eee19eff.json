It's expected to strike Grand Bahama, the northernmost island in the archipelago, late Sunday or early Monday before it nears the US coast, forecasters say.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center called the weather event in the Abaco Islands \"life-threatening,\" with reports of 220 mph wind gusts and a storm surge of 18 to 23 feet above normal tide levels.\n\nPelican Beach Villas, also in the Abaco Islands, told CNN via email that they currently have no guests on site and are closed for the storm. \"Pelican Beach Villas is right in the water's edge, so we could not accommodate any guests,\" wrote General Manager Alan Hamilton.\n\nDorian may hit the Southeast coast\n\nFlorida may be spared the worst of the storm after all, although the Sunshine State still faces dangerous conditions in the coming days. Even if the storm doesn't make landfall in Florida, its proximity to the coast could cause substantial damage.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina are now on high alert for possible landfall later in the week.\n\nHurricane Dorian's shifting path means abrupt changes for people traveling this holiday weekend. While the forecast looks better than anticipated in some places, in others, it has led to both immediate emergency evacuations and increased caution.\n\n\"High surf and very dangerous rip currents are expected all along the East Coast from Florida up through the Carolinas through the weekend,\" said CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen.\n\nCumberland Island National Seashore, on the largest barrier island off the Georgia coast, closed to the public on Saturday. Fort Frederica National Monument, located on nearby St. Simons Island, also closed on Saturday, according to a National Park Service press release.\n\nThe National Park Service noted a high risk for dangerous rip currents along Cumberland Island National Seashore beaches.\n\nBoth parks will remain closed until after the storm passes and the areas are deemed safe.\n\nRelated content 9 of the best US Labor Day events for 2019\n\nFlights and trains are being canceled\n\nAs of Sunday morning, airlines had canceled over 335 Sunday flights to/from/within the United States and about 609 flights on Monday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com\n\nAirlines have been issuing waivers for several days to travelers headed for destinations in the storm's projected path.\n\nDestinations in Georgia and the Carolinas have joined airline advisories as the storm progresses northward.\n\nOrlando International Airport said it would remain open on Monday in light of the storm's shifting path. It initially announced it would cease operation at 2 a.m. Monday local time.\n\nCruise ships are changing itineraries\n\nThe storm's proximity to the Bahamas has prompted cruise lines to modify some of their itineraries by shortening or lengthening cruises and rerouting to different ports of call.\n\nAubrey Manzo Dunn, a spokeswoman at Cruise Critic, says 45 cruise sailings have been affected across seven lines: Carnival, Disney, Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line and MSC.\n\nBased on double occupancy, these cruise changes could impact nearly 135K travelers, Dunn estimates.\n\nOn its website, Carnival Cruise Line listed a series of sailings that it is monitoring or modifying out of Port Canaveral, Port of Miami, Jacksonville, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa in Florida and in Charleston, South Carolina.
