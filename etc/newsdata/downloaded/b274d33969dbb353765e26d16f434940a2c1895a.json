Department officials indicated that the redactions were necessary because Porter had \u201cdirect conversations with the President.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/03/35/b1564ddf403da1d5341ee73a23d4/19914-mueller-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
