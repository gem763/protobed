Sign up here.\n\nWASHINGTON / KIEV \u2014 President Trump\u2019s willingness to withhold crucial military aid while pressing Ukraine to launch politically helpful investigations into his rivals startled Kiev.\n\nBut his abrupt abandonment of America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria unleashed its anxieties. Now they\u2019re wondering if they might be next.\n\n\u201cThat situation tells Ukraine that our country can rely only on itself,\u201d Commander Vyacheslav \u201cEagle Owl\u201d Vlasenko, a stony-faced leader of Ukrainian forces in the war-torn Donbas region, told Vice News.\n\n\u201cThat situation tells Ukraine that our country can rely only on itself\u201d\n\nFor Ukraine, where soldiers are still fighting Russia-backed separatists in the east, Trump\u2019s Syria pullback is doubly alarming: It not only reveals Trump\u2019s willingness to turn his back on American allies on a whim but also directly benefits Kiev\u2019s chief military threat, Russia.\n\nThe U.S. remains Ukraine\u2019s most important source of international assistance in its brutal five-year war with Russia-backed separatists, a conflict that has already killed some 13,000 people. Between April 2014 and June of this year, Washington provided Kiev with some $1.5 billion in aid that included lethal arms, defensive materiel, and hands-on training. A volte-face in support for Ukraine could dramatically alter the course of the war.\n\n\u201cWhoever did this once might very well do it again,\u201d said Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen just such an attitude from Trump in negotiations with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\u201d\n\nFickle friends\n\nTrump angered even his most stalwart defenders in Congress by ordering U.S. troops to pull out of northern Syria, clearing the way for Turkish troops to launch an offensive against the Kurds that immediately raised fears of ethnic cleansing against a key U.S. ally.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine we are witnessing a two-track credibility loss in Trump\u2019s America\u201d\n\nThe impulsive decision, which came shortly after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, presented Trump at his most erratic, dramatically reordering U.S. foreign policy overnight with a flurry of falsehoods and little apparent regard for the fate of a foreign partner who lost over 10,000 lives fighting beside US troops in their war on ISIS.\n\nREAD: This Could Be Trump\u2019s Next Disaster in Syria\n\nUkrainians were already on edge over Trump\u2019s apparent readiness to play politics with their $391 million in foreign aid, in a scandal that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, center, listens to a serviceman as he visits the war-hit Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\n\nThe combined effect has hammered America\u2019s reputation as a reliable ally in Ukraine, said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center think tank in Kiev.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine we are witnessing a two-track credibility loss in Trump\u2019s America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first wakeup call was when Trump withheld military assistance for Ukraine. The second is the signal he\u2019s sending with his attitude toward the Kurds.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his office by putting a hold on the aid while pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelekensky to announce investigations of Trump\u2019s 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden and the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nREAD: Team Trump Is Withholding Bill Taylor's Detailed Ukraine Notes From Congress\n\nAnother win for Russia\n\nFew countries appeared to benefit more from Trump's sudden reversal in Syria than Russia, which gladly rushed in to fill the void created by America's withdrawal.\n\nFollowing the U.S. pullback, Russia and Turkey agreed to share control over northeastern Syria in a power-sharing deal that could reshape the political landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n\nAnd Trump signaled that was pretty much just fine with him.\n\n\u201cIf Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that\u2019s really up to them,\u201d Trump said earlier this month.\n\nThe apparent win for Russia in Syria brings the Kurdish example even closer to home, Ukrainians told VICE News.\n\nAnton Myronovych, a Ukrainian soldier from the western city of Lviv who participated in Rapid Trident military exercises with American armed forces, said the Syria fallout heightened his suspicion of Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin.\n\n\u201cThat really shook them\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States acted as a guarantor of the security of my country and one of the main constraints on the path of Russian expansion,\u201d he said. \"Of course, such an unstable policy worries me.\u201d\n\nREAD: Bill Taylor\u2019s Testimony Paints a 'Damning' Picture of Trump's Ukraine Quid Pro Quo\n\nAmbassador Daniel Fried, a career U.S. diplomat, recalled fielding question after question about the Kurdish fiasco during his trip to Ukraine this month.\n\n\u201cThat really shook them,\u201d Fried told VICE News. \u201cMany Ukrainian students and former fighters told me: What about the Kurds? Might you betray us in a similar fashion? I got that from a lot of people.\u201d\n\nFried, the former U.S. ambassador to Poland, noted that central and eastern European countries have decades of experience carefully reading the balance of power between Washington and Moscow.\n\n\u201cAmerican presidents doing deals with Moscow over their heads is something they know about in that part of the world,\u201d Fried said.\n\nAs Ukraine\u2019s political and military leaders watch the White House for further abrupt policy shifts or Trump\u2019s next explosive tweet, some are already openly discussing the need to be prepared.\n\nThe lesson from Trump\u2019s reversal on the Kurds for Ukraine should be increased self-reliance, said Hanna Hopko, a former lawmaker who served as the head of the committee on foreign affairs in the Ukrainian parliament.\n\n\"We have to analyze this case because one day Ukraine could be in the same place as the Kurds,\" she said. \"This is why we have to be ready to defend our territory ourselves, and not rely on anybody else, because one day, we could find that we have been betrayed by one of our strategic partners.\"\n\nCover: President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the InterContinental Barclay New York hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019, in New York.
