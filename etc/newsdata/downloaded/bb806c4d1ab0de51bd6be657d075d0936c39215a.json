REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - \u201cAbominable\u201d towered over the box office this weekend as Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 animated adventure debuted to $20.85 million in North America and $29.7 million worldwide.\n\nThe PG movie benefited as one of the few offerings at multiplexes catering to family crowds and marked the best opening of the year for an original animated film.\n\nJill Culton wrote and directed \u201cAbominable,\u201d becoming the first female to independently make an animated film for a major studio. Universal\u2019s DreamWorks co-produced the movie with China\u2019s Pearl Studios. With a softer $8.8 million start at the international box office, the two companies will rely on Chinese audiences to turn out in force (where it debuts on Tuesday) to help justify its $75 million budget.\n\n\u201cAbominable\u201d follows a young girl named Yi (voiced by Marvel\u2019s \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d actress Chloe Bennet) who embarks on an epic journey to reunite a yeti named Everest with his family.\n\nAs awards season kicks off, Roadside Attractions\u2019 \u201cJudy\u201d hit a high note at the specialty box office. The Renee Zellweger-led Judy Garland biopic amassed $3 million, enough to crack the top 10 despite opening on just 461 screens. The movie, which is already generating Oscar buzz for Zellweger\u2019s transformation into the troubled star, appealed mostly to older females. Among inaugural crowds, 60% were women and nearly 80% were over the age of 35.\n\nThough \u201cAbominable\u201d was the only new nationwide offering this weekend, a number of holdovers enjoyed solid receipts. Last weekend\u2019s box office champion, Focus Features\u2019 \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d slid to second place on domestic charts. The big-screen adaptation of the popular British TV series collected $14.5 million from 3,390 theaters, declining 53% from its inaugural outing. After two weeks of release, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d has earned $58.5 million in North America.\n\nIn third place, STX\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d declined just 32% in its third frame, added another $11.47 million to its domestic haul. The $20 million film \u2014 directed by Lorene Scafaria and starring Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu \u2014 has generated a strong $80 million at the domestic box office and $95.4 million globally.\n\nIn a race that\u2019s currently too close to call, Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cAd Astra\u201d will battle it out for fourth and fifth rankings on box office charts. Based on Sunday\u2019s estimates, both films pocketed roughly $10 million over the three-day frame. \u201cIt: Chapter Two,\u201d now in its fourth weekend of release, has made $193 million in North America. Brad Pitt\u2019s \u201cAd Astra\u201d has picked up $34 million at the domestic box office.\n\nIn box office milestones, Universal\u2019s \u201cGood Boys\u201d crossed $100 million in global ticket sales, becoming the first original R-rated comedy to surpass that benchmark since last February\u2019s \u201cGame Night.\u201d", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - \"Abominable\" towered over the box office this weekend as Universal and DreamWorks' animated adventure debuted to $20.85 million in North America and $29.7 million worldwide.", "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435224116&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0KK-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
