This guardsman was then grabbed by Cruise-Taylor by the nipples, who twisted them.\n\n'That guardsman said Cruise-Taylor regularly punched him and other recruits in the stomach,' said the judge, although the blows were 'not particularly hard'.\n\n'However, none of the recruits required medical treatment,' the judge noted.\n\nThe judge said Cruise-Taylor had complained that he also suffered 'bullying and victimisation' while in the ranks.\n\nA psychiatrist who assessed him said Cruise-Taylor believed that army bullying had triggered a 'depressive illness'.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge presents a shamrock to Irish Wolfhound 'Domhnall' (Mascot of the Irish Guards) as she attends the annual St Patrick's Day Parade in London on March 17, 2017\n\nThe soldier's legal team urged the Appeal Court to substitute a suspended sentence and reinstate him as a lance sergeant.\n\nBut Lord Justice Davis, who was sitting with two other judges, refused to interfere with the punishment.\n\n'It is to be borne in mind that, taken overall, this was a bad case of bullying,' he said.\n\n'A number of young recruits were involved while in training, and what happened over a considerable period of time.\n\n'It cannot be said that what occurred here was isolated offending. Given the circumstances, reduction in rank was almost inevitable.\n\n'No lance sergeant can possibly behave in the way he behaved - taking advantage of his rank and status with regard to raw recruits.'\n\nCruise-Taylor has since recovered from his depression and is now rebuilding his military career, the judge added.", "description": "Lance Sergeant Liam Cruise-Taylor, from Shrewsbury in Shropshire, was violent towards seven young recruits in the Irish Guards, part of the household division.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/08/19527908-0-image-a-5_1570693037205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
