Fans have clamored for the rookie first-round pick, considering the team is 1-7 and not in contention for a playoff spot. Interim head coach Bill Callahan has been adamant that the team is still trying to win and said Haskins wasn\u2019t ready to be the No. 1. If he starts Sunday and performs well, or Keenum\u2019s head injury lingers, however, Haskins could have the opportunity to earn the job full-time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKeenum was officially limited in practice.\n\nHaskins has faced plenty of criticism in his short time in the league, and been a frequent subject of national media attention. But while he continues to struggle with parts of the presnap operation and there have been concerns about how quickly he has picked up the playbook, many have been quick to point out that he is still only eight games into his career after having started only one season at Ohio State. The 22-year-old acknowledged that he\u2019s made some changes recently, though he didn\u2019t share the details.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has nothing to do with this week, I just think it\u2019s a change in me,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cA lot of stuff [caused the change]. A lot of stuff. I\u2019m just excited to keep working.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHaskins has thrown for 140 yards with four interceptions and no touchdowns with a 54.5 completion percentage in his two appearances so far. The rest of the offense knows they need to chip in and help the youngster, and right tackle Morgan Moses specifically pointed to the run game. If they can run the ball and stay in good down-and-distance situations, he said, then life will be easier for Haskins. Moses said the rookie can gain more confidence from more first-team reps and live game action. It\u2019s experience \u201cyou can\u2019t buy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLeft tackle Donald Penn said Haskins had a strong workout Wednesday taking grasp of the huddle and command of the offense.\n\n\u201cGrasp it, get in your book, don\u2019t be scared to be a leader,\u201d Penn said he told Haskins. \u201cIf you see something you don\u2019t like in the huddle, speak up. Guys are going to respect that a lot more than waiting for one of us to do it. I told him to take control. Know his reads. Be laid back and lean on us if he needs anything. He\u2019s picking it up pretty well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRunning backs Adrian Peterson (ankle) and Chris Thompson (toe) did not practice Wednesday, along with safeties Montae Nicholson (ankle) and Deshazor Everett (ankle). Cornerback Quinton Dunbar (hamstring), Keenum, tight end Vernon Davis (concussion), linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring), guard Wes Martin (chest) and safety Jeremy Reaves (concussion) were limited. Cornerback Josh Norman (thigh/hand) was a full participant.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "The Redskins' rookie quarterback Case Keenum took the majority of the team's first-team reps in practice.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TtHMHTeVTHnNPkZzPY5Ix4LnCas=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VVWYLCGSKUI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
