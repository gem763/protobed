In the lead up to this tour it weighed heavily on my heart to see the countless violations against women, and I wanted to spend my time on the ground learning about the situation at hand.\n\n\n\nOne of the guests, Sophia Williams-De Bruyn was just 18 years old when in 1956 she led 20,000 women to march on the Union Buildings in Pretoria in protest of apartheid pass laws. She is the last living leader of the march, and today, a symbol of those who fight for fundamental human rights \u2014 For her it is simple \u2014 she fights for what is right.\n\n\n\nIssues of gender inequality affect women throughout the world, independent of race, color, creed, or socioeconomic background. In the last week I\u2019ve met with women from all walks of life \u2014 religious leaders such as the first female rabbi in Capetown, grassroots leaders in Nyanga at Mbokodo, community activists, parliamentarians, and so many more.\n\n\n\nIn sitting down with these forward thinkers, it was abundantly clear \u2014 it is not enough to simply hope for a better future; the only way forward is 'hope in action.' I\u2019m eager to spend the next few days in South Africa continuing to learn, listen and absorb the resilience and optimism I\u2019ve felt here.\" -Her Royal Highness, The Duchess of Sussex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYES.
