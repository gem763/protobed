REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\nA bitter Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing growth in China have heightened the risks of a global recession, darkening the outlook for Japan\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s third-largest.\n\nExports in September slumped 5.2% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, dragged down by car and airplane parts to the United States and semiconductor production equipment to South Korea.\n\nThe fall was larger than a 4.0% drop expected by economists and marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016.\n\nIn volume terms, exports fell 2.3% in the year to September, the second consecutive month of declines.\n\nThe extended fall in exports comes after the government lowered its assessment of the economy on Friday, raising a warning flag over weakness in exports.\n\nThat, among other factors, has triggered calls from some Japanese policymakers the government is ready to take fiscal measures if extra economic support was needed.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility that there will be another fall in exports hereafter,\u201d said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.\n\n\u201cThough overall conditions are currently stable, it would become a factor for monetary easing if it did affect Japan\u2019s economy as a whole.\u201d\n\nMarkets are rife with speculation the Bank of Japan could ease at its Oct. 30-31 meeting, after it said at its rate review last month it would take a more thorough look at whether rising overseas risks could derail Japan\u2019s fragile economic recovery.\n\nThe BOJ will \u201ccertainly\u201d reduce short- to medium-term interest rates if it needed to ease monetary policy, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nBy region, exports to China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner, slipped 6.7% year-on-year in September, down for the seventh month as shipments of auto parts declined, offsetting a rise in those of electronic chips for semiconductors.\n\nExports to Asia - which account for more than half of Japan\u2019s overall exports - dropped 7.8% in the year to September, falling for the 11th month, hurt by a 18.7% slide in semiconductor manufacturing parts, especially those to South Korea, which has been in a trade dispute with Japan.\n\nJapan\u2019s exports to the United States fell 7.9% in the year to September, weighed down by reduced shipments of cars over 3000cc and aircraft motors and parts.\n\nImports from the United States slipped 11.6% in September, causing Japan\u2019s trade surplus with the world\u2019s top economy to narrow by 3.5% from a year earlier to 564.1 billion yen ($5.2 billion), the trade data showed.\n\nWashington and Tokyo signed a limited trade deal last month that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products while further reducing the threat of higher U.S. car duties.\n\nJapan\u2019s overall imports dropped 1.5% year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 2.8% decrease.\n\nIn volume terms, imports gained 6.8% which analysts said was largely because of front-load demand before a nationwide sales tax hike to 10% from 8% which kicked in at the start of this month.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, imports are going to decline as consumption will be hurt\u201d by the tax hike, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.\n\n\u201cThe trade deficit is likely going to be reduced over the coming months.\u201d\n\nThe trade balance came to a deficit of 123.0 billion yen, versus a 54.0 billion yen surplus seen by economists.", "description": "Japan's exports contracted for a 10th straight month in September, adding to speculation the central bank could ease monetary policy as soon as next week to support an economy hit by a slowdown in global demand.", "authors": ["Daniel Leussink", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443165233&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K013", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
