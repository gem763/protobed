And anytime you have a business that has the kind of market size of trillions of dollars in terms of transportation and food and global commerce, it makes sense for a company to invest.\"\n\nUber UBER lost $5.2 billion in the three months ending in June, its largest quarterly loss ever . Stock-based compensation related to its initial public offering accounted for $3.9 billion, but the remaining $1.3 billion in losses were still 50% higher than the year before.\n\nUber's stock has fallen roughly 30% since going public in May.
