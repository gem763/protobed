Intel, however, said it would allow the public to examine the data.\n\nAn Intel spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. The company didn\u2019t say when the data would be released, and the commission may not require businesses to file the data after this year, as Bloomberg notes.\n\nThe move sets Intel apart from other major tech companies, which have sometimes broadly released demographic statistics but haven\u2019t released pay data in such detail. Companies like Google and Facebook regularly publish diversity statistics, but the data from Intel could provide a deeper look at race and gender gaps in the tech industry.\n\nThe data will likely be welcome by transparency advocates, but the announcement also comes as Intel deals with accusations that its female, black, and Hispanic employees faced pay discrimination in some states. In an announcement this week, the Department of Labor said Intel had agreed to pay $5 million to settle the accusations. Of that money, $3.5 million will go to back pay, and the rest will be used to adjust pay for engineers.", "description": "Intel will voluntarily publish detailed pay data with information on race and gender, the company said today.
