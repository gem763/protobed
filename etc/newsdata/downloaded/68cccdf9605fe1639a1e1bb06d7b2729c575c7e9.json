Photo: Pool/Getty Images\n\nOn October 3, during a White House lawn press gaggle, Donald Trump told reporters that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had no problem with his phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cHe said, \u2018That was the most innocent phone call that I\u2019ve read\u2019,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell denied that. Not only did the Kentucky Republican not praise the phone call, but he\u2019s never even spoken to Trump it, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had any conversations on that subject,\u201d McConnell told reporters. Asked if that meant Trump was lying, McConnell said, \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him. I don\u2019t recall any conversations with the president about that.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent fabrication of McConnell\u2019s quote is part of an increasingly common pattern in which he passes along praise from a third party that\u2019s impossible to source and then gets called on it, typically by reporters and occasionally by the person who supposedly uttered the compliment. It\u2019s a departure from Trump\u2019s long-held habit of inventing quotes and attributing them to unnamed \u201canonymous validators,\u201d or making up quotes that purportedly came from his political opponents. And it comes at what would seem to be a bad time for this type of dishonesty, as he and the rest of the GOP accuse Adam Schiff of making up quotes himself.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s not the only Republican senator that Trump seems to have falsely quoted regarding his call with Zelensky. Earlier this month, he said he heard Florida senator Rick Scott make a comment very similar to the one he later attributed to McConnell. \u201cThat was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?\u201d Trump said Scott said. But there\u2019s no evidence Scott said the call was \u201cperfect,\u201d and that\u2019s not a surprise. Trump is the only person who talks that way.\n\nAlso this month, Trump tweeted a quote that he said came from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, whom he first called Mark Esperanto. \u201cThe ceasefire is holding up very nicely,\u201d Trump tweeted, quoting Esper. \u201cThere are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.\u201d\n\nTwo journalists who were traveling abroad with Esper at the time reported that the secretary had said nothing of the sort. The Times, in an attempt to figure out where the quote came from, determined that \u201cit might have been a recounting \u2014 if not an entirely faithful one \u2014 of public comments.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more. Back in June, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy was the victim of a fabricated Trump quote. According to a Trump tweet, McCarthy said, \u201cHouse Republicans support the President on Tariffs with Mexico all the way, & that makes any measure the President takes on the Border totally Veto proof. Why wouldn\u2019t you as Republicans support him when that will allow our President to make a better deal.\u201d\n\nWhen Politico asked McCarthy\u2019s office about the quote, his staff pointed reporters to an interview on Fox News in which McCarthy didn\u2019t say what Trump claimed.\n\nAt this point in the Trump presidency, it\u2019s no longer remarkable that he\u2019s making up quotes. But it is notable that he has to make up quotes from allies, the type of people that he was previously able to rely on for actual, verifiable praise. It\u2019s also notable that Trump continues fabricating quotes out of thin air while he and much of the GOP accuses Schiff of doing the same, even if that\u2019s not what Schiff did.", "description": "Mitch McConnell contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that the senator praised his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
