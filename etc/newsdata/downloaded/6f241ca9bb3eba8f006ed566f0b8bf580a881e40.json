This is not who we are as a nation.\u201d \u2014 Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles mayor now running for governor, referring in a tweet Sunday to photos showing young-looking immigrants in steel cages\u2026 THE FACTS: The photos, taken by The Associated Press, were from 2014, during the Obama administration, but were presented by liberal activists as if they showed the effects of Trump\u2019s immigration policy now. Villaraigosa, Favreau and some others deleted their tweets when the mistake was pointed out. They had linked to a June 2014 online story by The Arizona Republic titled \u201cFirst peek: Immigrant children flood detention center.\u201d The story featured photos taken by AP\u2019s Ross D. Franklin at a center run by the Customs and Border Protection Agency in Nogales, Arizona. One photo shows two unidentified female detainees sleeping in a holding cell. The caption refers to U.S. efforts to process 47,000 unaccompanied children at the Nogales center and another one in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nRemember last year when lefties spent a few angry hours one afternoon posting photos of young immigrant kids lying face-down behind a chain-link fence, looking to all the world as if they\u2019d been housed in a large kennel? That effort quickly petered out after outlets like the AP reminded them that the photos were taken in 2014. How Biden\u2019s team could have missed that episode and sent him out onto Colbert\u2019s show to insist that the Obama administration never put kids in cages, knowing that Republicans are already paying close attention to Democratic hypocrisy on this issue, is mind-boggling. It makes you wonder if he botched what he was supposed to say: He would have been on firm ground if he\u2019d said \u201cat least our administration didn\u2019t separate immigrant families.\u201d It was unaccompanied minors who ended up kenneled by the Obama team, not kids who arrived here with an adult.\n\nHe walked right into another gaffe, this one much more substantive than the usual \u201cBiden forgets the name of the guy whom he ran with in 2008\u201d stuff. Why?\n\nNext thing you know, he\u2019ll be telling people that he opposed the Iraq war from the beginning.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have a well-earned rep for goofy, harmless gaffes. It\u2019s another if you serially distort your own record. @JoeBiden is in danger of creating a more damaging meme.https://t.co/ThCVCz4Fjb \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) September 6, 2019\n\nHe absolutely did not oppose the war from the beginning and it\u2019s freakishly stupid for him to insist that he did. Democrats proved three years ago that they\u2019re willing to forgive a would-be nominee who voted for war in Iraq. The issue has less salience in this year\u2019s race than it did in 2016 or, of course, 2008. All Biden had to do was follow Hillary\u2019s lead \u2014 \u201cI was misled by Bush about Saddam\u2019s WMD, I\u2019m deeply sorry, I\u2019d do it differently if I could do it again.\u201d The one sure way to put Iraq back on Democratic voters\u2019 radar is to try to whitewash history on it. Which is exactly what he did a few days ago in an interview with NPR.\n\nAgain, why? Does he honestly not remember the positions that he and, later, the Obama administration took on certain major policies? That\u2019s more alarming than the idea of Biden simply lying to try to cover his tracks.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, enjoy Adams\u2019s long list of media outlets that failed to fact-check Biden on locking up migrant children in their write-ups of his Colbert interview. I\u2019m giving you the whole clip here because it\u2019s fun watching Colbert grapple with the awkward role he\u2019s in with Biden as a guest. He doesn\u2019t want to hit him hard lest he damage the party\u2019s most likely nominee (for now, at least) but he also has to come after him to placate the progressives in his audience who want Biden cleared aside for Bernie or Elizabeth Warren. Usually a big-name Democrat on Colbert\u2019s show is a pure ally. Not quite here, and it shows.", "description": "What?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jb-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
