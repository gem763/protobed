They know that and it will be one of the challenges for them.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wonderful\u2019 Kolise \u2013\n\nTurning to Kolisi, Erasmus said: \u201cHe played a full 80 minutes (against Italy) and was wonderful. I think it was his best game since he has been back from injury.\n\n\u201cThe plan was always just to get him to the World Cup, to make sure the knee holds up.\n\n\u201cAfter that, we wanted to get him to play a full 80 minutes. He can do that now and his form is back to where it was, so to take him off the pitch would be like starting the process all over again. The more game-time he gets the better.\u201d\n\nDamian Willemse will start at fullback for the Springboks just days after arriving as an injury replacement for Jesse Kriel.\n\nNew Zealand top Pool B with 14 points from three games, while South Africa and Italy have 10 each.\n\nBoth Canada and Namibia have yet to claim a point.\n\nCanada have made six changes to the side overwhelmed by the All Blacks, including a brand new front row that sees props Hubert Buydens and Jake Ilnicki packing down either side of hooker Andrew Quattrin.\n\nKyle Baillie comes into the second row, with Andrew Coe starting at fullback and Phil Mack at scrum-half.\n\nVeteran wing DTH van der Merwe will make a Canadian record 15th World Cup appearance when he faces his native South Africa for the first time in 15-a-side rugby.\n\nAnd the Tier Two country are well aware of what they are up against.\n\n\u201cFor any Tier One nation, playing the All Blacks and the Springboks in one week is a challenge,\u201d said Canada assistant coach Huw Wiltshire.\n\n\u201cWe are hugely respectful of the South African team. They and the All Blacks are probably the two best sides at the minute in the tournament,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cTwo things you can\u2019t defend against in rugby are speed and power, and both those countries have got it across their teams, across the park and across their whole squads.\u201d\n\nThe two previous meetings between Canada and South Africa include their infamous 1995 World Cup clash that became known as the \u2018Battle of Boet Erasmus\u2019.\n\nCanada\u2019s Gareth Rees and Rod Snow, as well as South Africa\u2019s James Dalton, were sent off following a mass brawl before the Springboks won 20-0 on the way to lifting the Webb Ellis Cup.", "description": "Kobe (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus wants no let-up from his side as they look to book their place in the Rugby World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/3bef76_south-africa-head-coach-rassie-erasmus-has-demanded-intensity-his-changed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
