Eyal was in a pop band from a young age, Samira\u2019s been on the West End, Zara\u2019s got a studio in her house, I was going to pursue a musical career had this not come along and now we\u2019ve all formed together.\u2019\n\nPrior to Love Island, Wes was an Electrical and Nuclear Systems Design Engineer, and had no (known) professional singing experience.\n\nSamira Mighty\n\nSamira also appeared in 2018\u2019s Love Island, before quitting halfway through to be reunited with her former partner on the show, Frankie Foster.\n\nTheir romance was short-lived however, and they split a few weeks later after Frankie was spotted cheating on Samira.\n\nPrior to Love Island, she performed in several West End shows including Mamma Mia! and Dreamgirls.\n\nSamira comes from a performing background (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nSamira also featured as Debutante in the 2017 live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nSince leaving Love Island, she\u2019s been lying relatively low, but has spoken openly about struggling to handle the fame she gained after leaving the show.\n\nShe told Cosmopolitan magazine at the time: \u2018On my down days, I lay in bed until 3pm thinking: \u2018What am I doing? I hate my life. I miss having a routine.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZara McDermott\n\n22-year-old Zara joined Wes and Samira in the villa for the 2018 Love Island series.\n\nZara spent ten days in the villa, where she coupled up with then Adam Collard.\n\nThey broke up seven months later, with Zara calling Made in Chelsea star Sam Thompson her boyfriend these days.\n\nZara and Sam have been dating for four months (Picture: Ana M Wiggins / Splash News)\n\nFormer government advisor Zara has no formal performing experience but has previously spoken about her love of singing.\n\nIn a series of Instagram posts earlier this year she wrote: \u2018I usually try not to let things get to me but right now feel really upset. I put up a video of me singing last night. I\u2019ve only done that a few times in my life because I have a fear of singing in public which stemmed from when I was bullied at school.\n\n\u2018I am trying so hard every day to overcome my fear of singing to people as I love singing and taught myself the piano from the age of 11. I sang in the villa and all my friends in there gave me so much confidence.\u2019\n\nEyal Booker\n\n24-year-old Eyal joined the others for the fourth season of Love Island, where he failed to find love after initially partnering with Hayley Hughes.\n\nAfter leaving Love Island, Eyal joined the 2018 series of Celebs Go Dating and has appeared on MTV Cribs, as well as on several modelling campaigns.\n\nPrior to entering the villa, Eyal was no stranger to the stage, having been a member of a pop band, EverYoung, which formed in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir single You Got Me entered the UK Indie Chart at number 30.\n\nEyal also attended the prestigious Sylvia Young Theatre school and made an appearance on Zara Larson\u2019s Lush Life video.\n\nMORE: The X Factor: Celebrity divides viewers as Simon Cowell\u2019s revamped show kicks off\n\nMORE: X Factor: Celebrity viewers in tears over Martin Bashir\u2019s emotional tribute to late brother", "description": "The members of the Love Island supergroup first hit our screens in 2018.
