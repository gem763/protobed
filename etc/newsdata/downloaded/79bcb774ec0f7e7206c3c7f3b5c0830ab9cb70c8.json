The inspector general found that Mr. O\u2019Rourke also had the appearance of bias in handling certain complaints due to his \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d with a supervisor, Peter Shelby, with whom he played golf and attended social functions.\n\nFrom July 2017 to November 2017, the report found, the office received four complaints from four different people about Mr. Shelby, who then worked as the VA\u2019s assistant secretary for human resources and administration. The allegations included retaliation, harassment, discrimination, and creating a hostile work environment.\n\nMr. Shelby \u201chad influence over matters of importance to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u201d and his successor, Kirk Nicholas, according to the report.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke appeared to speed up one investigation to a favorable conclusion for his friend, while the whistleblower became the subject of an investigation, the report said. On two other occasions, Mr. O\u2019Rourke allegedly retaliated against whistleblowers, downgrading their jobs.\n\nThe report includes an account from a whistleblower who worked in the whistleblower\u2019s office and filed a complaint accusing a senior VA official of interfering in a disciplinary matter. Mr. O\u2019Rourke learned of the complaint and, within a matter of days, downgraded the whistleblower\u2019s responsibilities and tried to block the employee from leaving the whistleblower\u2019s office to another job within the VA, the report said.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke also \u201cissued a proposed removal action\u201d that the whistleblower was believed to be calculated and time to prevent the employee from starting a new job. The whistleblower remains working for the VA and has a case pending before the Office of Special Counsel.\n\nAfter rising to the post of acting secretary of the VA, Mr. O\u2019Rourke left the department in 2018 and now serves as executive director of the Florida Republican Party.\n\nThe VA has for years been notorious for a culture of whistleblower retaliation. But some managers also believe the agency has wrongly cultivated an atmosphere in which some federal workers essentially become full-time whistleblowers instead of carrying out their regular duties.\n\nMr. Nicholas told the inspector general\u2019s investigators that, from his perspective, some VA employees treat the whistleblower title as \u201ca position description for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve joined Whistleblowers of America,\u201d Mr. Nicholas said in the report. \u201cThey\u2019re in the papers. They can\u2019t seem to let go of it.\u201d\n\nHe characterized these employees as people who have \u201cquit working or they decided that their new job was to go find more stuff to whistleblow on \u2026 and weren\u2019t performing what they had been hired to do.\u201d\n\nAnother former manager in the whistleblower\u2019s office told the inspector general, \u201c[u]nfortunately, some [of] our whistleblowers become career \u2014 a legacy of whistleblowers. They believe that\u2019s their only job.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s office had a budget of $17.3 million in fiscal 2018.\n\nIn its response to the investigation, the VA concurred with all recommendations and said the employees in the whistleblowers\u2019 office are receiving more training. The agency also said the new head of the office will do more to protect whistleblowers\u2019 identities.\n\nIn a statement, the VA said the report \u201clargely focuses on [the office\u2019s] operations under previous leaders who no longer work at VA.\u201d\n\nIt said under the leadership of Assistant Secretary for Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Tamara Bonzanto, the office \u201cindependently identified many of the issues the IG highlighted\u201d and already resolved 10 recommendations. Among them are directly investigating all whistleblower retaliation allegations, increasing the number of investigators to speed up probes, and improving communications with whistleblowers about the status of their cases.\n\nThe VA said that since the enactment of the 2017 law authorizing the whistleblower and accountability office, the agency has fired more than 8,630 people.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
