It's the option just above the basic $1,300 13-inch MacBook Pro that comes with 128 GB of storage.\n\nWhen you look at it that way, it's kind of nuts that an iPhone can cost as much as a laptop.\n\nIt's not the first time that an iPhone demanded as much as a laptop, and other smartphones with the maxed-out specs can get pretty close. Samsung's maxed-out Galaxy Note 10 Plus with 5G costs $1,400, for example.\n\nRead more: The new $700 iPhone 11 is almost identical to the $600 iPhone XR, but there are 10 important differences between them.\n\nLuckily, the maxed-out iPhone 11 Pro Max isn't your only option. The cheapest iPhone Apple currently sells is the good old iPhone 8 starting at $450. There's also the excellent and popular iPhone XR, which now starts at $600, and the iPhone 11 going for $700.\n\nStill, even the cheapest iPhone 11 Pro costs $1,000, and the cheapest iPhone 11 Pro Max costs $1,100. For that money, you can get yourself a pretty great MacBook Air that will serve most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of your computer needs.\n\nAt the end of the day, how much value you place on smartphones and laptops and how much you spend on either depends on how you use them and what you use them for. If all you do on a laptop is browse the web, then you arguably don't need a $1,500 laptop. By the same token, if you use an iPhone to run a few apps and take the occasional photo, you arguably don't need a $1,450 iPhone 11 Pro Max.", "description": "Believe it or not, you can get a pretty nice 13-inch MacBook Pro for just $50 more than a maxed-out iPhone 11 Pro Max.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7957f42e22af069b53cfb4-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
