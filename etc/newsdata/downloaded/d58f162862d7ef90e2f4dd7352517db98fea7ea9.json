There\u2019s a rumor going \u2019round & \u2019round & \u2019round What d\u2019you say we make it true? We make it true,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOh, we make it true Well I can shut \u2019em down, tell \u2019em all they\u2019re crazy I can do whatever you want me to do, baby Or you could lay one on me right now We could really give them something to talk about \ud83c\udfa1\ud83c\udfa1\ud83c\udfa1.\u201d\n\nLindsie and Campbell have been married for almost eight years. The couple decided to elope for their January 2012 wedding, which created waves among the Chrisley family, particularly with Lindsie\u2019s father Todd Chrisley.\n\nMore than four years after the pair tied the knot, Lindsie exclusively announced in a statement to PEOPLE in August 2016 that she and Campbell were divorcing. But two years later, in January 2018, Radar reported that the couple, who shares 6-year-old son Jackson, had reconciled.\n\nRELATED: Todd Chrisley Claims Estranged Daughter Lindsie Cheated on Husband with 2 Bachelor Stars\n\nLast November, Lindsie shared a smiling photo of herself and Campbell to Instagram, admitting in the post that \u201clove isn\u2019t always going to be perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fairytale or a storybook & it doesn\u2019t always come easy. Love is overcoming obstacles, facing challenges, fighting to be together, holding on & not letting go. It\u2019s a short word, easy to spell, difficult to define & impossible to live without,\u201d she continued. \u201cLove is accepting all the complexities & simplicities. Love is work, but most of all, love is realizing that every hour, every minute, every second was worth it because you did it together \u2022 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc6a.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Lindsie Chrisley Says Family\u2019s Tax Evasion Scandal & Cheating Claims Have \u2018Literally Wrecked My Life\u2019\n\nLindsie\u2019s apparent denial of any rumors about her marriage comes amid a difficult time for the mother of one, who has long been at odds with her famous family.\n\nIn August, the tension made headlines after she accused Todd, 50, of attempted extortion after he and wife Julie Chrisley were indicted by a federal grand jury on Aug. 13 for tax evasion and other financial crimes, which the couple denied.\n\nLindsie alleged in a Georgia police report, obtained by TMZ in August, that Todd and her brother Chase Chrisley harassed and threatened her over an alleged sex tape. She said in the report, which was filed on July 16, that her two family members \u201cwanted her to lie about an incident and if she refused to do so, they were going to release the sex tape involving her.\u201d\n\nChase denied his sister\u2019s claims in a statement to PEOPLE at the time, saying \u201cI love my sister and I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s doing this to our family. Not only am I heartbroken over these false allegations by my sister \u2014 and they are totally false \u2014 but so are my parents and the rest of our family.\u201d\n\nTodd also denied his daughter\u2019s claims, but in his denial alleged that Lindise had \u201cextramarital relationships with Robby Hayes and Josh Murray,\u201d who are both alums of The Bachelorette.\n\n\u201cSadly, for reasons we can only guess at, she ran to the sheriff\u2019s office to accuse her brother of buying a sex tape of her and Robby, which was a complete lie, and now she\u2019s telling more lies about me,\u201d Todd added. \u201cAlthough our hearts are broken, Lindsie is our daughter and we will always love her.\u201d\n\nTodd Chrisley and Lindsie Chrisley | Frederick M.
