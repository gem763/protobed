Further up the structure, on the 101st floor, also will be a 10,000-square-foot bar, restaurant and event space.\n\nWhen open, Edge will be taller than the open-air observation decks at the Empire State Building, (at 1,050 feet above street level) and Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center (850 feet) in New York City.\n\n'Edge invites visitors to walk out into the sky and embrace unobstructed, panoramic views of New York City like never before,' according to Jason Horkin, executive director of Hudson Yards Experiences.\n\nThe One World Trade Center observatory is listed at 1,368 feet above the street level, but is fully enclosed within the building.\n\nVisitors can even climb outdoor 'skyline steps' from the 100th to 101st floor beginning March 11, 2020, when the complex opens\n\nThe city skyline is seen through a glass wall of the Edge sky deck, advertised as the Western Hemisphere's highest outdoor observation deck\n\n'Edge invites visitors to walk out into the sky and embrace unobstructed, panoramic views of New York City like never before,' according to Jason Horkin, executive director of Hudson Yards Experiences\n\nNew Yorkers walk below Edge observation deck at 30 Hudson Yards in Manhattan on Thursday\n\nThe image above shows the view of Midtown Manhattan to the right and the Hudson River and New Jersey to the left\n\nThe Hudson Yards is the largest privately built real estate project ever in the US, constructed over 28 acres of a working rail yard on the west side of Manhattan.\n\nThe finished complex costing $28billion will include more than 100 retail shops and restaurants, a cultural and performing arts venue and a public square and gardens.\n\nConstructing the deck was a tremendous feat of engineering.\n\n\u2018The hardest part about building the observation deck, which sounds exceedingly obvious, is there\u2019s nothing underneath it,\u2019 said John Kelly, the vice president of Related Companies, the real estate development firm which built Hudson Yards.\n\nThe image above shows the view of Lower Manhattan. The observatory at One World Trade Center is 1,368 feet above the street level, but it is enclosed within the building - unlike Edge\n\nMembers of the news media take pictures and video footage from the Edge as the top of the Empire State Building peers out in the background\n\nThe image above shows New York's skyline. Midtown Manhattan is seen on the left while Brooklyn and Queens are seen on the horizon\n\nConstructing the deck was a tremendous feat of engineering which entailed building 15 separate modules the size of small yachts in Italy and then shipping it 4,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean\n\nWhen assembled, the pieces comprising the deck weigh a combined total of 765,000 pounds - or 383 tons\n\n\u2018We had all of this work to do at an elevation of 1,131 ft, so it led to us deciding to build this like a big jigsaw puzzle and assemble 15 modules the size of small yachts off site.\u2019\n\nKelly told Fast Company that the modules of the deck were built in Italy and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhen assembled, the pieces weigh a combined total of 765,000 pounds - or 383 tons.\n\n\u2018We all stepped back and we looked at an observation deck that was upside down and sitting on solid ground and said to ourselves, \u201cHow are we going to take that apart and put it up in New York?\u201d\u2019\n\nThe deck made a 4,283-mile journey across the ocean from Italy.\n\nBut the engineers found that the long ocean trek was the easy part. The most challenging aspect was the final 10-mile leg in which the deck needed to be moved from the Port of New Jersey to Manhattan\u2019s West Side.\n\nTo get the modules across the Hudson River and on to the West Side Highway, Kelly said that officials needed to remove street signs and traffic lights in order to accommodate their sheer size.\n\nWorkers clean the glass floor of the Edge observation deck at 30 Hudson Yards in New York City on Thursday\n\nThe image above shows there's still some work to be done at the entrance to the observation deck before it opens to the public in March\n\nThe deck is attached to one of six skyscrapers that were built in the Hudson Yards complex, which also includes a vertical shopping mall and a cultural center\n\nThe image above taken from the deck shows buses entering the leaving Port Authority Bus Terminal on Manhattan's West Side on Thursday\n\nOnce at the site, the personnel on the ground had months to prepare for their arrival.\n\nEach module had two cranes simultaneously work to put them into place.\n\nThe deck is attached to one of six skyscrapers that were built in the Hudson Yards complex, which also includes a vertical shopping mall and a cultural center.\n\nThe development has reimagined a neighborhood once dominated by rundown industrial buildings and auto repair shops as an architectural landmark.\n\nThe scale and ambition of the 28-acre project along the Hudson River are impressive, said Patrice Derrington, director of the Center for Urban Real Estate at Columbia University.\n\n'This is how urban folk choose to live: a defined neighborhood that represents their values and aspirations, set in amongst others of a different identity,' Derrington said.\n\n'Hudson Yards is creating a neighborhood - a mix of buildings for work, sleep and play. The heart of a new \"village\" has been created,' she said.\n\nDevelopers Related Companies and Oxford Properties said the project, which is more than half finished, includes 100 stores, 25 restaurants and a planned 4,000 residential units, in addition to 10.4 million sq feet (about one million sq meters) of office space.\n\nTenants include luxury retailers Neiman Marcus, gourmet markets and world-class chefs such as Thomas Keller.\n\nThis being New York, the project is not without its critics, who have called it too glitzy, too commercial and too much a slap in the face to the city\u2019s lower-income residents.\n\nThe highly anticipated Hudson Yards development opened on Friday to the public after 10 years of construction. It'll house luxury commercial and residential units and has 100 shops and restaurants. The mall centers around the stunning sculpture 'The Vessel' pictured above\n\nA view from the top of 'Vessel' reveals the massive and sprawling commercial development bustling with life\n\n'Hudson Yards glorifies a kind of surface spectacle \u2014 as if the peak ambitions of city life were consuming luxury goods and enjoying a smooth, seductive, mindless materialism,' said Michael Kimmelman, architecture critic of the New York Times.\n\nOf the residential, about one-tenth is affordable housing, Related spokesperson Jessica Scaperotti told Reuters.\n\nTalks on the project began in the early 2000s soon after the collapse of a plan to develop the site with a stadium that would help anchor New York City\u2019s failed bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nFramed by 30th and 34th Streets on the south and north and 10th and 12th Avenues on the east and west, Hudson Yards claimed one of the last large parcels of build-able space available in Manhattan above rail yards that remain active below.\n\nThe lynchpin of the development was an extension of the number 7 subway linking the neighborhood to Times Square and Grand Central Terminal.\n\nOpening four years ago, the line connects Hudson Yards with the city\u2019s mass transit system.\n\n'Because of the number 7 subway, the entire West Side today has become connected to the rest of the city, both the physical infrastructure and the economic life,' said Mitchell Moss, professor of urban planning at New York University.\n\nHudson Yards also serves as an entry point to the High Line elevated park, one of the city\u2019s most popular attractions.\n\nAt the center of the development stands an interactive artwork called the Vessel, a honeycombed spiral staircase.\n\nThe Shed, a 200,000-sq-foot structure with a retractable outer shell, has been designed to be a year-round performing arts and exhibition space.", "description": "The 7,500sq-ft-deck, surrounded by tall glass panels, is anchored on two sides of a skyscraper at 30 Hudson Yards in New York City.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20152370-0-image-a-9_1571954294100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
