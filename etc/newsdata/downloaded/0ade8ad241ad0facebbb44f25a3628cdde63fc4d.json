In the latest on Tuesday, just two months after also taking the job as defense minister, she sprang a proposal for an internationally-monitored security zone in northern Syria with little warning. Allies in the coalition, which includes Social Democrats, complained they were informed late or not at all.\n\n\u201cI find it somewhat unusual \u2013 and I don\u2019t think it should become the way the cabinet works,\u201d Social Democratic caucus leader Rolf Muetzenich told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday. \u201cI do think that Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer should learn a little from the discussion that she\u2019s confronted in the past few hours.\u201d\n\nThe political storm that surrounded Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s rushed roll-out comes after she stumbled for months in her role as Merkel\u2019s heir apparent, committing a string of gaffes and failing to communicate. That assessment was buttressed as many party colleagues were caught unawares by the plans of AKK, as she is also known.\n\nIf nothing else, the volley drove a wedge between the CDU and its junior coalition partner just as the Social Democrats approach a sensitive decision on whether to remain in the 17-month old government.\n\nDim View\n\nFor now, her party is closing ranks behind her. Merkel, who earlier this year took a dim view of the new CDU leader\u2019s performance, backed her defense minister in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers in Berlin, according to two people present. A similar security-zone proposal was raised in 2016 during the siege of Aleppo, Merkel said. AKK even drew a round of applause.\n\nThat sense of unity only went so far. Earlier in the day, officials in Merkel\u2019s coalition were scrambling to figure out what was being announced.\n\nSyria was discussed at length at a Sunday evening meeting of coalition leaders, including the CDU, their Bavarian allies in the Christian Social Union and the Social Democrats. But AKK made no mention of such a plan at the time, CSU caucus leader Alexander Dobrindt said. He himself learned of the initiative only Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cWe would like to know what Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s ideas look like concretely, because we\u2019re getting a lot of questions from abroad on what the German position is,\u201d Niels Annen, Germany\u2019s deputy foreign minister and a Social Democrat, told ZDF. \u201cWe need to answer that.\u201d\n\nAnnen also said prospects for any such plan would hinge on the deal struck Tuesday by Russia and Turkey to secure a buffer zone in northern Syria, involving a coordinated effort with Syrian forces to remove Kurdish fighters from the border area.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer is battling to reverse an increasing sense of disappointment among the party faithful 10 months after she was elected its chief in a tight vote. Complaints range from a leadership vacuum AKK has left to an inability to implement or communicate fresh ideas, according to at least three people familiar with the thinking within the party.\n\nThe fresh approach of 57-year-old AKK hasn\u2019t been a boon to the CDU\u2019s public backing. The party has 27% support, down five points from the week she was elected in December of last year, according to an Oct. 19 Forsa poll. Separately, Bild newspaper last week carried a headline showing a \u201chorror\u201d poll for AKK, who came last in a list of top German politicians.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer would have to forge a unified position among coalition partners to gain any traction, according to a German government official. Judging by the Social Democrats\u2019 response, that\u2019s unlikely to happen before the NATO defense ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, when she intends to present her proposal.\n\nGermany Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, a Social Democrat, complained that he was informed via text message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe much in SMS diplomacy,\u201d Maas told local media. \u201cThat can quickly turn into SOS-Diplomacy.\u201d\n\nMuetzenich, the usually soft-spoken SPD caucus leader who has opposed German participation in military interventions, was more withering, asking how such a security zone could win United Nations approval after failing to do so for years.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s designated successor is causing trouble in Berlin with her efforts to assert authority.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has been undermined by a series of errors since she was chosen to follow Merkel as leader of the Christian Democratic Union last year.
