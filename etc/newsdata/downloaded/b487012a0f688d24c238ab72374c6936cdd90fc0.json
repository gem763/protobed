The government would almost certainly get more for a monopoly asset than it would for one exposed to competition.\n\nOn current projections, by the time the network is completed next year, $51 billion will have been invested in it, $49 billion of which will have come from the federal coffers.\n\nMr Fletcher did not address these concerns in his speech, insisting competition would be \"a positive force\" and adding that investment in competing fixed line, particularly fibre, networks would \"be important in providing choice for end users\".\n\nHe condemned what he called the \"sheer wastefulness\" of Labor's decision to build the entire network from scratch rather than outsource it to private companies, a policy he said would have been cheaper. He said the decision had \"crushed infrastructure-owning competitors by overbuilding networks, and made it near impossible for emerging infrastructure providers to compete\".\n\n\"[T]he decisions originally made to support a monopoly broadband network have had significant consequences for market structure and competition,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said as the government works towards privatisation of the NBN, it was \"important that we have in place a regulatory framework which supports competition\".\n\nOptus has already launched a 5G fixed wireless alternative to the NBN, and other telcos including Vocus, Vodafone and TPG have expressed an interest in doing the same.\n\nIn July, Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said competition would be good for consumers and that it didn't matter if that resulted in a write-down.\n\n\"With the NBN, the investment has already been made, so the issue now is how do we make the best use of the NBN. I'm not saying whether that requires a write-down \u2013 I don\u2019t know all the details \u2013 but if the best way to use the NBN was in a way that it did not recover all you\u2019d spent on it, then I would answer, who cares? You\u2019ve spent the money,\" he said.", "description": "Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has encouraged mobile players to develop 5G alternatives to the NBN, saying competition would force the NBN to improve its products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2411%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78bf78afac612023c035db1d0a51de902701318c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
