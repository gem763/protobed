The hurricane damaged an estimated 13,000 houses and killed at least five people.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the storm is expected to turn north, approach the coast of Florida, and travel along the US East Coast.\n\nDorian is expected to bring hurricane-force winds, along the East Coast from Florida to North Carolina. It could raise water levels up to 7 feet and dump up to 15 inches of rain, causing \"life-threatening\" flash floods as far north as Virginia, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\nA woman seeks cover from wind on September 2, 2019 in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), recently revised its forecast for this year's Atlantic hurricane season \u2014 it now projects a 45% chance that this year will see above-average activity. That could mean five to nine hurricanes in the Atlantic, with two to four of those expected storms becoming major hurricanes (defined as Category 3 or above, with winds greater than 110 miles per hour).\n\nOn average, the Atlantic sees six hurricanes during a season, with three of them developing into major hurricanes. Hurricane season peaks August through October and ends on November 30.\n\nRead More: Hurricane categories tell only part of the story \u2014 here's the real damage storms like Dorian can do\n\nScientists can't definitely say whether Hurricane Dorian or other individual storms this year are directly caused by climate change, but warming overall makes hurricanes more devastating than they would otherwise be.\n\nThat's because higher water temperatures lead to sea-level rise, which increases the risk of flooding during high tides and in the event of storms surges. Warmer air also holds more atmospheric water vapor, which enables tropical storms to strengthen and unleash more precipitation.\n\nHere's what to know about why storms are getting so much stronger, wetter, and slower.\n\nHow a hurricane forms\n\nHurricanes are vast, low-pressure tropical cyclones with wind speeds over 74 mph.\n\nIn the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane season generally runs from June through November, with storm activity peaking around September 10. The storms form over warm ocean water near the equator, when sea surface temperature is at least 80 degrees, according to the NHC.\n\nAs warm moisture rises, it releases energy, forming thunderstorms. As more thunderstorms are created, the winds spiral upward and outward, creating a vortex. Clouds then form in the upper atmosphere as the warm air condenses.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nAs the winds churn, an area of low pressure forms over the the ocean's surface. At this point, hurricanes need low wind shear \u2014 or a lack of prevailing wind \u2014 to form the cyclonic shape associated with a hurricane.\n\nOnce the wind speed hits 74 mph, the storm is considered a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Hurricane Dorian began as a tropical storm in the Atlantic and was upgraded to a hurricane once its winds reached 75 mph on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nHurricanes are moving more slowly and dropping more rain\n\nHurricanes use warm water as fuel, so once a hurricane moves over colder water or dry land, it usually weakens and dissipates.\n\nHowever, because climate change is causing ocean and air temperatures to climb \u2014 last year was the hottest on record for the planet's oceans \u2014 hurricanes are getting wetter and more sluggish. Over the past 70 years or so, the speed of hurricanes and tropical storms has slowed about 10% on average, according to a 2018 study.\n\nOver land in the North Atlantic and Western North Pacific specifically, storms are moving 20% to 30% more slowly, the study showed.\n\nHouston residents navigate streets in boats due to flooding during Hurricane Harvey. David J. Phillip/AP\n\nA slower pace of movement gives a storm more time to lash an area with powerful winds and dump rain, which can exacerbate flood problems. So its effects can wind up feeling more intense.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 was a prime example of this: After it made landfall, Harvey weakened to a tropical storm, then stalled for days. That allowed the storm to dump unprecedented amounts of rain on the Houston area \u2014 scientist Tom Di Liberto described it as the \"storm that refused to leave.\"\n\nClimate scientist Michael Mann previously wrote on Facebook that Hurricane Harvey \u2014 which flooded Houston, killed more than 100 people, and caused $125 billion in damages \u2014 \"was almost certainly more intense than it would have been in the absence of human-caused warming, which means stronger winds, more wind damage, and a larger storm surge.\"\n\nSt. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Office inmate workers move free sandbags for residents in Chalmette, Louisiana, July 11, 2019 ahead of Hurricane Barry. Associated Press\n\nTo make matters worse, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, so a 10% slowdown in a storm's pace could double the amount of rainfall and flooding that an area experiences. The peak rain rates of storms have increased by 30% over the past 60 years \u2014 that means up to 4 inches of water can fall in an hour.\n\n\"Precipitation responds to global warming by increasing,\" Angeline Pendergrass, a project scientist at University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, said last year.\n\nStorms are also getting stronger\n\nA hurricane as seen from space. Flickr/NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center\n\nAs ocean temperatures continue to increase, we're also likely to see more severe hurricanes because a storm's wind speed is influenced by the temperature of the water below. A 1-degree Fahrenheit rise in ocean temperature can increase a storm's wind speed by 15 to 20 miles per hour, according to Yale Climate Connections.\n\n\"With warmer oceans caused by global warming, we can expect the strongest storms to get stronger,\" James Elzner, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University, told Yale.\n\nThat can also mean that storms are able to intensify and develop into powerful hurricanes in a shorter time span.\n\nPanicked dogs, left behind by an owner who fled rising flood waters due to Hurricane Florence, are rescued by volunteer Ryan Nichols of Longview, Texas, in Leland, North Carolina, September 16, 2018. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\nGenerally, a strong storm brings a storm surge: an abnormal rise of water above the predicted tide level. This wall of water can flood coastal communities \u2014 if a storm's winds are blowing directly toward the shore and the tide is high, storm surges can force water levels to rise as rapidly as a few feet per minute.\n\nHigher sea levels, of course, lead to more destructive storm surges during a hurricane. Such surges are likely to become a more regular threat, since even if we were to cut emissions dramatically starting today, some sea-level rise is inevitable. The planet's oceans absorb 93% of the extra heat that greenhouse gases trap in the atmosphere, and water (like most things) expands when it's heated.\n\nKevin Loria and Jeremy Berke contributed to an earlier version of this story.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas and is turning towards the US East Coast.
