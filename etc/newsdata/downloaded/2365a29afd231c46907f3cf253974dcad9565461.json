My message to PM Boris Johnson: We remain open but still unconvinced.\"\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead Brexit spokesman, said it would be \"almost impossible\" to get the deal as it stood through the Strasbourg legislature, which has a role in approving it.\n\nSpeaking to his own Parliament, Mr Johnson declined to describe his offer as final, suggesting there was still room to negotiate. This steps back from previous Downing Street briefings to the media that the deal was \"take it or leave it\".\n\nThe question is how much derogation from his plan there can be before he starts to alienate his Brexiteer backbench and his crucial Northern Irish allies, the Democratic Unionist Party. At the moment, they are offering cautious support.\n\n\u201cWe now glimpse the possibility of a tolerable deal,\u201d leading eurosceptic Conservative MP Steve Baker told Mr Johnson during the parliamentary debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johnson said he'd had constructive telephone calls with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\nBut time is short: in theory, the deal needs to be nailed down at an EU leaders' summit on October 17 and 18. On October 19, Mr Johnson is legally obliged \u2013 by a law MPs passed against his will last month \u2013 to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if a deal is not in prospect.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs that if the EU would not compromise as Britain had now done, the country would leave the bloc with no Brexit deal on October 31.\n\nBut speculation is growing that he might alternatively request the extension and then fight an election in which he blames the Brexit delay on opposition parties.\n\nTwo concerns\n\nThe European side has two main concerns with Mr Johnson's proposal. One is that by keeping Northern Ireland in Britain's customs territory, there will have to be customs inspections \u2013 and that might mean border posts, reopening old political wounds.\n\nMr Johnson insists it's possible to have a decentralised customs system that avoids this: \"The proposals we are putting forward do not involve physical infrastructure at or near the border \u2013 or indeed at any other place,\" he said. But scepticism abounds.\n\nThe second issue is the plan to keep Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the EU. The Irish are worried about giving the Northern Irish Assembly \u2013 which has been suspended for more than three years after a political standoff between the province's two main parties \u2013 a periodic say over whether to continue aligning with the EU or switch to Britain. Again, this could keep the sectarian issues burning brightly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We cannot support any proposal that suggests one party, or indeed a minority, in Northern Ireland make the decisions for the majority. That would not be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement and it is not something we could possibly support as part of final deal,\" Mr Coveney said.\n\nThe EU reportedly has given Britain a week to amend its proposals. Some analysts suggest the bloc might try to run down the clock, forcing a Brexit delay that could lead to a second referendum.\n\nMr Corbyn, meanwhile, objects to the possibility that British and EU rules might diverge. Mrs May promised to maintain EU standards on workers' rights and the environment, but Mr Johnson appears to have dropped this.\n\n\u201cDeal or no deal, this government\u2019s agenda is clear. They want a Trump-deal Brexit that would crash our economy and rip away the standards that put a floor under people\u2019s rights at work, that protect our environment and protect our consumers,\" Mr Corbyn said.", "description": "EU leaders express doubt and opposition MPs display outright hostility, but the British PM says he wants to keep talking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2206%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f7a6c8b609bb816568e906057a26ccd09fe9ae2a", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
