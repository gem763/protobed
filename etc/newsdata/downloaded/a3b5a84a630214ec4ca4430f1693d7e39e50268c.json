We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's interactions with Ukraine has heated up over the last several weeks, bringing with it a mountain of backlash from the president and his supporters.\n\nHouse Democrats have heard testimony from diplomats and officials involved in Trump's mission to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into domestic political rivals, and the withholding of $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAn anonymous whistleblower complaint alleged the Trump administration was pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump acknowledged asking for an investigation into the Bidens. He also asked Zelensky to look into the origins of 2016 election interference, which he has claimed, without evidence, involves Ukraine.\n\nHere is how both sides defend their views on impeachment:\n\nWhat the inquiry has turned up so far\n\nDemocrats' case for impeachment\n\nHouse Democrats, who overwhelmingly favor impeachment, argue that Trump's conduct with Ukraine was intended for personal political gain, at the detriment of the best interests of the country.\n\n\"In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint. Democratic lawmakers have said testimony supports the claims made by the whistleblower.\n\nDemocrats have honed in on a phrase Trump used in his phone call with Zelensky: \"I would like you to do us a favor though.\" He went on to ask the Ukrainian leader to look into the details of the hacking of the Democratic National Committee prior to the 2016 election that was linked back to Russia.\n\nAnd, last week the White House seemed to acknowledge, then later denied again, that the delay in military aid previously approved by Congress was, in part, tied to the theory that Ukraine was involved in the hacking of the server. Democrats' claims there was a quid pro quo were revitalized.\n\nTheir theory is supported, they say, by the text messages between U.S. diplomats and testimony heard over the last several days. On Tuesday, Taylor testified he was \"alarmed\" by the linking of aid to investigations of Biden.\n\nTaylor's testimony: Key takeaways from Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor's 'explosive' opening statement\n\nThe case against impeachment\n\nTrump and his political allies maintain that there he did nothing wrong, calling the impeachment probe a \"witch hunt\" and a \"lynching\" as Democrats persist with their investigation of potential wrongdoing.\n\nKey arguments coming from the Trump camp revolve around the way Democrats are operating their proceedings.\n\nNancy Pelosi: No need for House to hold formal vote on impeachment inquiry already under way\n\nSo far, testimony has taken place behind closed doors. The Constitution allows Congress to determine appropriate protocol during an impeachment, but Republicans accuse Democrats of \"secrecy.\"\n\n\"The Democrats Scam goes on and on! They Do Nothing!\" Trump said in a tweet, sharing a House Republican's complaint about the closed-door testimony.\n\nIt\u2019s simple. The American people deserve transparency, yet House Democrats continue to ram through their impeachment investigation in secret and behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are the Democrats hiding about the impeachment inquiry?\u201d pic.twitter.com/nSka8kFIHT \u2014 House Republicans (@HouseGOP) October 23, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans who are not on the committees conducting private sessions disrupted a deposition in protest.\n\nTrump says that he should be able to cross examine witnesses, as well as identify and question the anonymous whistleblower. He says Democrats are violating his due process rights.\n\n\u201cThis is a partisan inquiry,\u201d Trump campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News. \u201cThis is serious, it\u2019s overturning an election. And we can\u2019t read transcripts, and we can\u2019t present evidence and we can\u2019t have an attorney present.\u201d\n\nTrump has also argued that he has a duty to ask other countries to help the U.S. investigate potential corruption, and that he never suggested a quid pro quo. He says his conversation with Zelensky was \"a perfect call.\"\n\nTrump called Taylor a \"Never Trumper\" after the diplomat testified that Trump allies told Ukraine there was a link between military aid and an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nQuid pro quo?: How the Trump White House's messaging changed on whether there was a Ukraine quid pro quo\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Nicholas Wu\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/23/trump-impeachment-why-democrats-want-and-why-republicans-reject/4071612002/", "description": "Democrats say Donald Trump abused his power as president, but Republicans are protesting how the impeachment inquiry is being conducted.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published P.M.
