(AP) - Clemson forward Aamir Simms didn\u2019t enjoy what he saw during the summer with the Tigers.\n\nSimms, a 6-foot-8 junior, was accustomed to seeing older teammates like Donte Grantham, Elijah Thomas, Marcquise Reed and Shelton Mitchell make crisp passes, dig in on defense and finish plays strongly. Instead, Clemson\u2019s roster was filled with newcomers who weren\u2019t quite getting it in Simms\u2019 eyes.\n\nSimms stayed patient and helped lead the young Tigers to a 6-0 run at the World University Games in Italy in July, when Clemson represented the United States.\n\n\u201cI see now, as an older player, how easily you can get frustrated watching a younger guy kind of mess up continuously,\u201d Simms said. \u201cIt\u2019s like something I\u2019ve learned since I\u2019ve been here is to have composure and be poised in certain situation.\u201d\n\nThat will be essential this season for Simms, Clemson\u2019s lone returning starter following the departures of Thomas, Reed, Mitchell and David Skara, all seniors who helped the Tigers make the NCAA Tournament\u2019s Sweet 16 and two NIT appearances the past three seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Simms now to step forward and lead as Clemson\u2019s most experienced player.\n\n\u201cYou have to approach situations differently with each kind of guy on the team, especially with young guys because we have a really good mix of young to old,\u201d Simms said.\n\nClemson has little choice but to get all the newcomers up to speed in a hurry. The nine new players include four freshman and four transfers, including former Texas and Alabama forward Tevin Mack.\n\nThe 6-6 Mack was recruited by Clemson coach Brad Brownell as a Columbia, South Carolina, prospect who played for Shaka Smart with the Longhorns before spending last year with Avery Johnson, who agreed to leave the Crimson Tide after last season. Mack joins Clemson as a graduate transfer.\n\nAlso eligible to play immediately is grad transfer guard Curran Scott, whose 41 3-pointers led Tulsa last season.\n\n\u201cI like this team,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference sometimes when half your roster in new. The new guys come in with this youthful exuberance and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nClemson was picked 11th in the ACC\u2019s annual preseason poll.\n\nMISSING PIECES\n\nThe Tigers were hit with significant injuries to a pair of veterans they expected to play big roles in 2019-20. Jonathan Baehre, a 6-10 transfer from UNC Asheville, and 6-4 junior guard Clyde Trapp both suffered torn ACLs in the spring and there\u2019s no timetable for their return, although Brownell says both are ahead of schedule in their recoveries and could see action this season.\n\nNCAA WAIT\n\nClemson is also waiting to hear from the NCAA if two undergraduate transfers - Khavon Moore of Texas Tech and Nick Honor of Fordham - will get the OK to play immediately. The school has applied for waivers for both players. Moore played just two minutes for the Red Raiders due to injury. Honor led the Rams with 15.3 points a game.\n\nWORLD CHAMPS\n\nBrownell was as surprised as anyone that his team full of new faces came together so quickly to capture gold at the World University Games. \u201cEverybody played and everybody played unselfishly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been really fun to coach because they\u2019re excited to be coached every day.\u201d\n\nNEW ASSISTANT\n\nClemson added assistant Anthony Goins this offseason after not renewing the contract of longtime staffer Steve Smith, who was heard on a federal wiretap at the college basketball corruption trial last spring. Smith was due to have his contract renewed before his name came up in the trial for discussing Clemson\u2019s national championship football program. Smith was not charged by federal prosecutors.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nClemson, like most of the ACC, begins league play with its opener on Nov. 5 against Virginia Tech, which advanced to the NCAA\u2019s Sweet 16 last season. The Tigers\u2019 most difficult stretch comes when they play at North Carolina on Jan. 11 trying to break their 0-59 mark in Chapel Hill. Three days later, Clemson returns home to play Duke.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Clemson forward Aamir Simms didn't enjoy what he saw during the summer with the Tigers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pete Iacobelli"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/acc_media_day_basketball_83625_c0-200-4800-3000_s1200x700.jpg?be02a3e95bf7d82084e600722760380ca065441f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
