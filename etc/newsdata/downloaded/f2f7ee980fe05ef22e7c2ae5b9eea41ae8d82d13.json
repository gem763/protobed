Idlib is the last one.\n\nThe Astana process gradually eclipsed an earlier UN-sponsored negotiations framework known as the Geneva process, which had put more emphasis on political transition but failed to curb violence that has already killed more than 350,000 people.\n\n- Russia takes charge -\n\nIn late 2016, Russia, Iran and Turkey take over the Syrian peace process, sidelining the United States. They impose a ceasefire between the army and rebels.\n\nIn January 2017, they launch talks in Astana, bringing rebel and regime representatives to the capital of Kazakhstan, a Russian ally in central Asia.\n\nAt the January 23-24 talks, the three sponsors agree to bolster the fragile truce.\n\nHowever, the final declaration is not signed by the rebels, led by Mohammad Alloush, or the regime, led by Bashar Jaafari, and negotiators do not hold face-to-face talks.\n\nIn February, Astana talks between regime and rebel delegations end without a major breakthrough. Several more rounds of talks are held but fail to yield significant results.\n\n- 'De-escalation zones' -\n\nIn May 2017, Russia, Iran and Turkey adopt in Astana a Russian plan for four \"de-escalation zones\" across Syria to shore up local ceasefires.\n\nAccording to the text, \"security zones\" will be created around them, with checkpoints and monitoring centres to be jointly staffed by troops from the guarantor countries.\n\nGovernment troops and rebel fighters must stop using all kinds of weaponry, including aircraft.\n\n- Only Idlib remains -\n\nHowever, since the start of this year, government forces backed by Russia and allied militia have reconquered three of the zones, largely through heavy bombardments that ended with rebel surrenders.\n\nEastern Ghouta, a rebel stronghold outside the capital, was retaken in April after a two-month offensive. The regime then retook parts of the southern provinces of Daraa and Quneitra.\n\nOf the four de-escalation zones, only the northwestern province of Idlib remains. The last rebel stronghold, it has been the destination for thousands of rebel fighters and civilians evacuated from other areas.\n\n- Many summits, little progress -\n\nThe summit in Tehran on Friday between Iran's Hassan Rouhani, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan will be the third between the sponsors of the Astana peace process.\n\nPutin hosted his counterparts in November 2017 and at a peace congress in January 2018 in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, which resulted only in good intentions.\n\nIn April 2018, Putin, Rouhani and Erdogan met in Ankara, where they agreed to pool forces to achieve a \"lasting ceasefire\" in Syria.\n\n\u00a9 2018 AFP", "description": "Syria: the Astana peace process", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.france24.com/meta_og_twcards/F24_TW.png", "published_at": "2018-09-05"}
