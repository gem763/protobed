To that end, he says that the cars will soon be able to stream video from Netflix and YouTube.\n\nTesla has already unveiled games that drivers can play on the displays: in June, Bethesda studios announced at E3 that drivers would be able to play Fallout Shelter. Tesla has also released Cuphead and some classic Atari games, like Tempest, Pole Position, and Missile Command. On Friday, the company revealed that drivers would be able to play chess in the Tesla Arcade.\n\nThe games only work while the car is parked, and players can use the steering wheel as a controller. The same is the case here, although Musk notes that when regulators approve self-driving, Tesla will allow passengers to stream video while the car is in motion. Musk didn\u2019t unveil a timeline for the feature to roll out.\n\nAbility to stream YouTube & Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats & surround sound audio. \u2014 e^ (@elonmusk) July 27, 2019\n\nThe desire to allow drivers and passengers to watch video isn\u2019t a total surprise \u2014 Musk noted at E3 that the ability to watch YouTube was coming. Up until this point, the display doesn\u2019t support HTML5, so such a feature isn\u2019t possible in the cars right now, although one owner found a way around that.\n\nThe ability to catch up on your Netflix queue or to play a video game in the car holds some appeal for anyone who\u2019s been stuck waiting in a car for a kid\u2019s practice or stuck on a long car ride with them. (There\u2019s a reason why some minivans come with TV screens.) And when cars can eventually drive themselves, passengers will want something to do while riding to their destination.\n\nBut there are huge concerns that would come with any such feature. Test vehicles are required to have a driver behind the wheel to take over in case something goes wrong, and even as self-driving technology improves, it\u2019s hard to imagine that going away completely. There\u2019s also been one high-profile incident in which TV was a problem: a fatal crash in 2017 between an Uber self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian, in which the car\u2019s test driver was watching The Voice on Hulu.", "description": "Elon Musk has long touted the potential that the in-car displays found in Teslas have for drivers: they can not only provide information, but entertainment as well.
