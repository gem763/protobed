In other words, broadly speaking the wealthier areas were found to have more fibre- and citrus-rich diets.\n\nCaffeine intake was also found to be greatest among higher socioeconomic groups, specifically in areas designated as high rent, which was backed with other studies which found espresso and ground coffee drinks were most frequently consumed by those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. The report\u2019s authors suggest that this is both a factor of having the financial ability to fork out for a daily coffee or two and a culture of coffee consumption among wealthier Australians.\n\nOn the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum, in particular the drugs tramadol (an opioid-based pain killer), atenolol (blood pressure medicine) and pregabalin (anti-seizure medicine) were most highly associated with poorer communities \u2013 however the latter two were also shown to be more present among older populations, which can also tend to be lower income. Other forms of painkillers, medicines and antidepressants were found to be linked to areas of greater disadvantage, but not to the same extent.\n\nChoi says comparing rich and poor catchment areas directly can be startling. \u201cJust looking at the figures we can see \u2013 with one community compared to another \u2013 a several-fold difference in the markers of fibre,\u201d he says.\n\nThe researchers hope to repeat the survey at the next census, that way providing insight into whether any changes may be underway that other research methods may not yet have uncovered, or may need to be used to investigate further.\n\nFor instance, in this study antiobiotic use is fairly uniformly distributed across different socioeconomic groups, indicating the government-subsidised health care system is doing its job; should this distribution start to shift in future surveys, it may prompt further research into whether and why certain groups may be accessing such medicines less", "description": "Fibre, caffeine, drugs: a study of wastewater from across Australia finds key differences in how rich and poor communities consume.", "authors": ["Celina Ribeiro"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/br/p07rbrzr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
