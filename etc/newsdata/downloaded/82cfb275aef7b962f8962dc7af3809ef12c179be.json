We have formal and informal structures in place to avoid such issues.\"\n\nPwC declined to comment.\n\nImprove guidance\n\nASIC also said the boards setting accounting standards needed to improve the quality of guidance.\n\n\"We continue to encourage the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and the AUASB to improve the guidance in the standards,\" the regulator said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Areas suggested for improvement include financial instrument valuation, sampling, setting materiality, substantive analytical procedures, management experts and use of the auditor\u2019s own experts, internal controls, service organisations, and substantive testing where risk is low and there is controls reliance.\"\n\nAUASB chairman Roger Simnett said the board created standards that were of high quality and that it worked closely with ASIC and other standard-setting institutions to improve the quality of audits in Australia.\n\n\"The AUASB is committed to collaborate with ASIC in a number of areas to improve audit quality ... Earlier this year we engaged with ASIC and the major audit firms in a process to better understand the root causes of findings that have arisen from ASIC\u2019s Audit Inspection Process and develop local guidance or rollout new global standards that address these findings and support the consistent application of auditing standards,\" Professor Simnett said.\n\n\"Locally the standards issued by the AUASB are developed under a robust standard-setting process in the public interest, and are of high quality. The AUASB amends the ISAs when there is a compelling reason to do so, including if this would have a positive impact on audit quality in Australia.\"\n\nHe said the body was currently updating its guidance \"in relation to Auditors use of the work of a management expert and have included in our 2019-20 work plan a project to develop additional guidance for auditors on the audit of revenue.\"", "description": "The corporate regulator has raised concerns about 'potential conflicts' in the separate purchases of insolvency firms by PwC and KPMG.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9954%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_386/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/39f899b50c1ae87108696ad86fa4acc589596877", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
