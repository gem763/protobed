The very suggestion that the male-centric, centuries-old church could do that has thrown traditionalists into a tizzy, and it\u2019s not a change Pope Francis is currently willing to contemplate.\n\nThere is interest, however, in giving lay women official \u201cministries\u201d, whether that be performing marriages or preaching.\n\n\u201cTwo thirds of the indigenous communities without priests are guided by women,\u201d says Bishop Erwin Krautler, an Austrian missionary who has lived in Brazil for three decades.\n\nWhile personally he sees \u201cno reason why women cannot be ordained priests\u201d, he thinks the debate should be focused now on female deacons \u2014 a potentially invaluable resource in far-flung corners of the world.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Extremely important\u2019 \u2013\n\nMale deacons, who can be single or married, are able to baptise, witness marriages, perform funerals and preach homilies.\n\nThey cannot say Mass, give the Eucharist, or absolve people after confession, which only priests can do.\n\nPope Francis in 2016 set up a study group to examine the role of such deacons at the beginning of Christianity, but in May he said the panel was extremely divided on the issue and still had a lot of ground to cover.\n\nIn the meantime, a week ahead of the bishops\u2019 assembly on the Amazon, Francis suggested that lay men and women could be given a formal Bible reading \u201cministry\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe presence of women in the Amazonian forest is extremely important,\u201d says Sister Alba Teresa Cediel Castillo.\n\nShe is one of 35 female so-called \u201cauditors\u201d invited to the assembly so the bishops can hear their testimony firsthand.\n\n\u201cThere are very few priests. The geographical distances are immense, many priests are constantly on the move,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the Vatican\u2019s Osservatore Romano newspaper, there are areas with just one priest per 25,000 square kilometres, and others where just 45 priests have to serve 1,100 villages.\n\n\u2013 Translating the Gospel \u2013\n\nSister Alba says she does \u201ceverything a woman can do, starting with the baptism of children when the priest is not present\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can also celebrate a marriage and hear confessions,\u201d said the nun, whose congregation is present in six of the nine Amazonian countries.\n\nThe question is how and to what extent lay women can also play such roles.\n\nIn some areas, local churches have taken the matter into their own hands.\n\nBishop Wilmar Santin, who has spent nine years living with the Munduruku indigenous people \u2014 a community of 11,000 people in a 175,000 square kilometre diocese in Brazil \u2014 has been creative in compensating for empty pulpits.\n\nHe has created 48 \u201cministers of the Word\u201d, including nine women, who speak the Gospel in their local indigenous language, as well as \u201cministers of baptism and marriage\u201d.\n\nLike many, he now hopes the spotlight on the issue at the assembly will result in concrete guidelines from Rome.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Deep in the Amazonian forest, young couples looking to wed or baptise children often turn to Sister Alba, who fills in where", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/43755c_pope-francis-attends-special-assembly-synod-bishops-pan-amazon-region-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
