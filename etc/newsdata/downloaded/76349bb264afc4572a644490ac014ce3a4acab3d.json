Gavin Newsom has indicated he will sign AB 5, a bill passed out of both houses of the state legislature that will put in place more stringent criteria for who can qualify as a contractor rather than an employee.\n\nThe bill\u2019s advocates say they intend to make it harder for employers in the state to use the so-called gig-economy model made famous by services like Uber and Lyft to provide workers with protections a normal employee would receive like minimum wage and health benefits.\n\nMr. West said they should be able to work around the restrictions, and hinted that the rideshare company may take the state to court.\n\n\u201cWe expect we will continue to respond to claims of misclassification in arbitration and in court as necessary, just as we do now, but we will also continue to advocate for the independence and choice that drivers tell us again and again in surveys, polls, focus groups, and personal conversations that they value most,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. West added Uber, Lyft and meal-delivery service DoorDash would advocate for a state bill allowing their contractors \u201cthe flexible access to on-demand work they enjoy today.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that the gig-based platforms\u2019 labor costs would rise 30% should they be forced to classify their drivers as employees.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
