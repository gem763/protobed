Trump went after Johnson at length -- going so far as to suggest he should be replaced while describing the city as more dangerous than Afghanistan -- before diving into his prepared remarks.\n\n\u201cPeople like Johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThose are his values, and frankly, those values to me are a disgrace.\u201d\n\nSECOND MAN CONVICTED IN REVENGE MURDER OF 9-YEAR-OLD CHICAGO BOY\n\nChicago is a sanctuary city where local authorities do not cooperate with federal immigration officials, denying information that would help them deport people living in the U.S. illegally.

These are recidivist criminals, many violent. Many have been here illegally and deported previously, yet they [Chicago officials] do nothing to help get them off the street,\u201d he said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "Following President Trump\u2019s criticisms of Chicago\u2019s\u00a0sanctuary city\u00a0policy, Acting ICE Director Matthew Albence backed the president on Tuesday, saying that immigration is, \u201cunfortunately,\u201d an issue where\u00a0politics is continually being placed over public safety.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-11.42.26-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
