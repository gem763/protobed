Here\u2019s what\u2019s new and how it compares to the company\u2019s now-defunct plans:\n\nAT&T Unlimited Starter : Replacing the AT&T Unlimited &More plan as AT&T\u2019s cheapest plan, Unlimited Starter costs just $65 per month for a single line or $35 per month for four lines. It\u2019s AT&T\u2019s most basic \u201cunlimited\u201d service. You\u2019ll get unlimited calls, texts, and data, with the catch that AT&T can throttle you whenever it decides that the network is too congested. Unlike the other plans, there\u2019s no guaranteed pool of data before deprioritizing starts. You\u2019re also limited to SD-quality video, and there\u2019s no option to share your internet by using your phone as a mobile hot spot. You do get unlimited data in Canada and Mexico, though. Unlike the old plan, there\u2019s no longer any free AT&T WatchTV live TV service included.\n\n: Replacing the AT&T Unlimited &More plan as AT&T\u2019s cheapest plan, Unlimited Starter costs just $65 per month for a single line or $35 per month for four lines.

AT&T Unlimited Extra : At $75 per month for a single line or $40 per line for four lines, Unlimited Extra sits near the price point of the old Unlimited &More plan (which cost $70 per month for a single line and $40 per month for four lines). But its perks are more akin to AT&T\u2019s more premium unlimited options. There\u2019s now a 50GB pool of guaranteed high-speed data before AT&T will deprioritize your internet and up to 15GB of LTE data for mobile hot spots per line. Video is still limited to SD, and there\u2019s no free HBO or AT&T WatchTV included.\n\n: At $75 per month for a single line or $40 per line for four lines, Unlimited Extra sits near the price point of the old Unlimited &More plan (which cost $70 per month for a single line and $40 per month for four lines).

AT&T Unlimited Elite: AT&T\u2019s priciest plan, which starts at $85 per month for a single line or as low as $50 per month on a family plan of four. It\u2019s most similar to the previous Unlimited &More Premium plan (which cost $80 for a single line or $48 per line on a family plan of four). It offers some improvements over the old plan: there\u2019s now 30GB of mobile hot spot data per line instead of 15GB, and it has a 100GB cap before AT&T will start deprioritizing your data (compared to 22GB before). But there are a few downsides, too: instead of allowing customers to choose between a variety of entertainment options (like Spotify Premium Showtime, Starz, or Cinemax), the new Unlimited Elite plan only offers a free subscription to HBO. Like the other plans, there\u2019s no longer a free AT&T WatchTV service.\n\nAT&T is also quick to note that any of its US customers who also subscribe to HBO \u2014 whether that be through a paid subscription or as a free perk of a current (or \u201cfuture\u201d) unlimited plan \u2014 will also get access to the upcoming HBO Max service (which usually costs $14.99 per month) when it launches in May 2020.\n\nThe new AT&T Unlimited Starter and AT&T Unlimited Extra plans are set to launch on November 3rd, while the AT&T Unlimited Elite is listed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d", "description": "AT&T is announcing an overhaul of its unlimited plans, replacing the two plans it previously offered with a trio of new plans: Unlimited Starter, Unlimited Extra, and Unlimited Elite, which offer more data but less free TV than the old offers.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzojXk4f9MzzwbyRZinGMcHL7Pg=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10690893/acastro_180322_1777_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
