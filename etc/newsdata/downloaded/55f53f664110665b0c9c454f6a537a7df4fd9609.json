A spokesperson for the AFP said: \u201cAny questions regarding this matter should be directed to Indonesian authorities.\u201d\n\nKoman said in a statement that there was a \u201csurprisingly wide [Indonesian] government campaign to pressure me into silence\u201d, including police intimidation of her family in Jakarta and threats to revoke her Indonesian passport and block her bank accounts.\n\n\u201cFor years, the Indonesian government has allocated more time and energy to waging a propaganda war than it has to investigating and ending human rights abuses in West Papua,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we are seeing a clear example of \u2018shoot the messenger\u2019 in the state\u2019s effort to persecute those, including me, who draw attention to abuses it is unwilling or unable to address.\u201d\n\nThe Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d system \u2013 ostensibly used to \u201cseek the location and arrest of wanted persons wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence\u201d \u2013 is regularly abused by authoritarian governments to pursue dissidents or political opponents who have left the country\u2019s territory.\n\nFour Australians to be deported for allegedly taking part in West Papua rally Read more\n\nGlobally, there are about 58,000 current valid red notices, of which only about 7,000 are public.\n\nArticle 3 of Interpol\u2019s constitution forbids Interpol from undertaking \u201cany intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character\u201d.\n\nIndonesia issued a red notice for West Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda in 2011 but was forced to rescind it in 2012 after it was found to be politically motivated, and without genuine criminal basis.\n\nAustralia has detained at least one person on the basis of a flawed red notice.\n\nEgypt issued a red notice for its national Sayed Abdellatif, who arrived in Australia by boat as an asylum seeker in 2012.\n\nA Guardian investigation revealed that several charges listed against his name had never been brought against him at his trial-in-absentia and that other convictions were based on evidence obtained \u201cunder severe torture\u201d. The Australian government had known for 18 months the red notice was invalid but had not acted to release him.\n\nAbdellatif\u2019s family members received visas and were released into the community. But he remains in high security at Sydney\u2019s Villawood detention centre after more than seven years, despite recommendations from the United Nations human rights council that he be released and compensated for his \u201cclearly disproportionate \u2026 deprivation of liberty\u201d.\n\nFair Trials took up Abdellatif\u2019s case, campaigning for the red notice to be withdrawn, and it was finally removed in 2018.\n\nOn Monday, a group of UN human rights experts issued a statement calling on Indonesia to protect the rights of Koman and others reporting on the West Papua protests.\n\n\u201cWe call for immediate measures to ensure the protection of freedom of expression and address acts of harassment, intimidation, interference, undue restriction and threats against those reporting on the protests,\u201d the experts said.", "description": "Dfat says Interpol red notice for arrest of Veronica Koman is a matter for Australian federal police", "authors": ["Marni Cordell", "Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8804241e34c61426e1fc40602fc2bd34863d1649/0_35_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1573fb188c0fbf978182640d0c79f3f9", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
