Generic is perfectly fine. This isn\u2019t me being a dirtbag \u2014 baking queen Stella Parks is also a big fan of the cheap stuff for baking, and you know she knows what\u2019s up.\n\nIn fact, trying to get all fancy with baking butter can mess you up if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nCooking butter can be salted or unsalted, depending on your preference. (Some people avoid salted butter due to its sometimes higher and unpredictable water content, but these cookies make a strong case for the salted stuff.) Since cooking butter is for cooking \u2014 obviously \u2014 there\u2019s no need to worry about nuanced flavour profiles, as the more subtle flavours will most likely be overpowered by whatever you\u2019re cooking or baking.\n\nCooking butter should be stored in the fridge or freezer, depending on how much you buy at one time.\n\nSnacking butter is a whole different story. Snacking butter is stored at room temperature, preferably in a French butter keeper so that it is always soft, spreadable and rindless.\n\nSnacking butter is for spreading on extremely good bread, breakfast radishes and crackers. This kind of butter is enjoyed almost like cheese \u2014 un-chilled and in generous amounts. It doesn\u2019t need a delivery system, though societal norms might say otherwise.\n\nSnacking butter is ideally cultured, then slowly churned for a higher fat content and creamier, tangier flavour. Irish butter is also a good choice. Though it is usually uncultured, it has a higher fat content and cheerful yellow hue thanks to milk from (usually) grass-fed cows.\n\nIf keeping two types of butter around seems a little rich for your blood, consider this: instead of compromising, and buying a middle-of-the-road butter that\u2019s serviceable, but not great, in both roles, you\u2019re buying two distinct products with two distinct functions.\n\nJust buy the cheapest grocery store butter you can find for cooking, then reward your frugalness with fancy butter. I\u2019m no finance expert, but this seems reasonable to me.", "description": "A functioning kitchen is a kitchen that is well stocked, and a well-stocked kitchen has two types of butter \u2014 cooking butter, and snacking butter....", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zvq8bm0dnhdcjmpobvwz.jpg"}
