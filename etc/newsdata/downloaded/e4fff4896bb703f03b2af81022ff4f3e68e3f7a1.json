Through the whole show and the experience, the one thing that has been really challenging is the fact that I was supposed to enjoy it.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018And when I enjoy it, I make mistakes. And when I make mistakes, I get punished in the scoring.\u2019\n\nDavid was awarded 16 points for his performance on Saturday (Picture: Guy Levy/BBC)\n\nDavid was awarded just 16 out of 40 for his jive on Saturday and fumed at presenter Claudia Winkleman when the cameras panned to his mum after he performed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We also have to mention that your mum is in the audience,\u2019 the hostess pointed out during the live show.\n\nHowever, David didn\u2019t appreciate Claudia drawing attention to his mum and made it clear that she doesn\u2019t like being in the spotlight.\n\n\u2018Yeah, my mum doesn\u2019t like cameras and she\u2019s on the camera, thanks for that,\u2019 David replied. \u2018Hi mum.\u2019\n\nThis year\u2019s Strictly is in full swing and it\u2019s each celebrity out for themselves so far, with professionals Aljaz Skorjanec and Janette Manrara admitting they can\u2019t call who\u2019s going to win.\n\nSpeaking on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Janette said: \u2018What I like about this series is we can\u2019t call it. Every week we can\u2019t call who it is that\u2019s going to be in that dance off or what will happen.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s quite an interesting one because you always kind of see frontrunners and you kind of know what\u2019s going on, but this year literally it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game and I love that.\u2019\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 6.35pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
