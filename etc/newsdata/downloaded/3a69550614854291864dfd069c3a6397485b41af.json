You've jerked him about ten times in the chest piece, you mad man.'\n\nThe footage emerged after an investigation which occurred in Hastings, East Sussex, in early hours of November 11, last year.\n\nDetective Constable Rob Mitchell-Davis said: 'This was a vicious assault against a man who lost several pints of blood after being stabbed multiple times.\n\n'He is extremely fortunate to be alive, given the seriousness of the offence and the severity of the injuries he sustained.'\n\nThe victim was taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital's trauma centre, where he underwent emergency surgery.\n\nThree suspects involved ran from the scene, but were identified and arrested the following day.\n\nReece Lefevre demonstrates how he stabbed his 34-year-old victim up to ten times\n\nLefevre, of Hastings, admitted committing grievous bodily harm and possession of a knife in public, and was sentenced to ten years' in a young offender institution\n\nLefevre, of Hastings, admitted committing grievous bodily harm and possession of a knife in public, and was sentenced to ten years' in a young offender institution.\n\nJones, of Netherfield, East Sussex, was found guilty of GBH and jailed for 12 years.\n\nBoth defendants were sentenced following the conclusion of a trial at Lewes Crown Court on Friday, September 27.\n\nA third defendant - a 19-year-old man from Hastings - was found not guilty of GBH and will face no further action.\n\nDC Mitchell-Davis added: 'It appears this started as a verbal altercation between the three defendants and the victim, before it escalated into a much more serious incident.\n\n'Lefevre and Jones made off from the scene without hesitation, leaving the victim fighting for his life.\n\n'Our enquiries led to the discovery of a video Jones posted on Snapchat in the aftermath of the attack, and we were able to use this as evidence in court to secure their convictions.\n\n'The behaviour they display in this video is quite appalling, and demonstrates their total disregard for the welfare of their victim.\n\n'Jones' sentence is reflected in his denial of his involvement throughout the case.'", "description": "Reece Lefevre, 20, bragged about stabbing the 34-year-old in an attack so brutal it left footprints on the victim's skull, while Tyler Jones, 26, cruelly laughed and filmed the aftermath.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784554-0-image-a-20_1571226451185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
