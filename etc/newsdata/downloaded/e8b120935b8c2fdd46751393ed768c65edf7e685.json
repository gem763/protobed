Her daughter reportedly didn\u2019t know about the scheme.\n\nMs. Huffman will be the first of 34 parents who were charged in the scandal to be sentenced, some of who paid upwards of $500,000 to help propel their children into elite schools.\n\nOne of those cases is \u201cFuller House\u201d star Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli, who are accused of shelling out half a million dollars for their two daughters to be admitted to University of Southern California as members of the crew team, although neither participated in the sport they were recruited for.\n\nMs. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli have declined their right to separate attorneys and are scheduled to appear in court Oct. 2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
