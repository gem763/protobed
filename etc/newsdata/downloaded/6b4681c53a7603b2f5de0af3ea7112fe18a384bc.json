Washington!!!\"\n\nI\u2019m gathered here with dozens of my congressional colleagues underground in the basement of the Capitol.\n\n\n\nIf behind those doors they intend to overturn the results of an American presidential election, we want to know what\u2019s going on. #StopTheSchiffShow pic.twitter.com/c9Ks9VneYt \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 23, 2019 @RepMattGaetz\n\nGerard Butler Matt adds that he thinks their mission was accomplished for now. He says they demonstrated the Prez deserves due process, and Dems should provide transparency.\n\nAs for Trump, Gaetz says he hasn't spoken to him yet about the stunt he pulled with fellow Republicans, but he expects a strong reaction from the Oval. He went beyond gushing when we asked about his and Trump's relationship.\n\nWe asked if he's planning more demonstrations, and if he's willing to get arrested. Gaetz didn't flinch and, in fact, made a laughing reference to his 2008 DUI bust.\n\nOne thing he was NOT down to joke about ... comparing his sit-in protest to the so-called Brooks Brothers riot during Florida's 2000 election recount.", "description": "Matt Gaetz says the scene at the impeachment hearing was just like \"300.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/33/16by9/2019/10/23/335c279bd83049e691f1624b1d5338b3_xl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
