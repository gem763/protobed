It had been attempted, but nobody would pay for the thing that would have brought back the Dwarfers for the first time since Series 8's explosive cliffhanger. But now after a few extra series popped onto Dave, it looks like a movie is on the way.\n\nThe only thing is it's a TV movie, and not one you're likely to be able to see with a bucket of overpriced popcorn and a drink the size of Rimmer's left nostril.\n\nIt's a two hour special that's due to air some time next year.

Dave has also commissioned three hour-long 'retrospectives' that look back at the show's entire run, complete with interviews, and unseen clips. So in other words the kind of stuff that's already out as DVD special features.\n\nRed Dwarf co-creator Doug Naylor said:\n\n\"I'm absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity of making more Red Dwarf. UKTV has been a never-ending source of support and encouragement since we first started working together 10 years ago. Can't wait to start shooting a format that I don't think has ever been done before.
