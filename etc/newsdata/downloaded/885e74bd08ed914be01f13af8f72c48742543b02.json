Chris the sheep has passed away,' the Little Oak Sanctuary in New South Wales said in a Facebook post.\n\nChris was spotted in 2015 by a bushwalker on the northern outskirts of Canberra, Australia's capital, and experts feared he would not survive because of the sheer weight of his coat.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAn Australian merino sheep named Chris (pictured in 2015, before he was shorn) who made headlines for the record-breaking weight of his fleece has died aged 10\n\nThe sanctuary taking care of Chris the sheep revealed the animal (pictured with a sanctuary worker in 2016) was found dead on Tuesday morning by his minders having died of old age\n\nFour-time national shearing champion Ian Elkins was brought in to remove 41.1kg of wool from Chris (shearing pictured) - the most ever taken from a sheep in a single shearing\n\nHe was struggling to walk under the weight of his wool, which had not be shorn in more than five years and had reached the size of a small car.\n\nFour-time national shearing champion Ian Elkins was brought in to remove 41.1kg of wool from Chris - the most ever taken from a sheep in a single shearing.\n\nThe wool removed - worth about $413.60 (\u00a3220) at current prices - made him the unofficial carrier of the world's heaviest fleece.\n\nChris (pictured in 2015) was struggling to walk under the weight of his wool, which had not be shorn in more than five years\n\nLittle Oak Sanctuary vice president and co-founder Kate Luke said: 'He's been really happy and healthy recently.

But after having his wool shorn, Ms Van Denge said he went from standoff-ish to wanting cuddles. 'He's a new man in many ways, he's actually moving really well, he's already eating, he actually came up to us for a cuddle,' Ms Van Dange told the ABC at the time. Merino sheep are bred for shearing and need to have their fleeces removed regularly Little Oak Sanctuary co-founder Kate Luke said Chris became the sheep who was always at the front of the pack. 'Gradually he became more confident and up the front of the group, he would always go for head scratches,' Ms Luke told The Canberra Times. 'He was a sanctuary favourite and he had a deep baritone noise and was always one of the first to arrive for food.'\n\nChris (pictured in 2015) was spotted by a bushwalker on the northern outskirts of Canberra\n\n'Chris was coming up to 10 years, and generally sheep can live up to 12 years old. We found him on Tuesday morning when he didn't show up to get breakfast.\n\n'He was a sanctuary favourite and he had a deep baritone noise and was always one of the first to arrive for food.'\n\nChris' fleece dethroned that of New Zealand sheep Big Ben, who was found carrying nearly 29kg of wool in 2014.\n\nAn RSPCA ACT collection at the National Museum of Australia has shown off the fleece shorn (pictured) from Chris the Sheep\n\nThe Australian merino's fleece was later put on show in the National Museum of Australia's Old New Land gallery.\n\nMr Elkins had to do the shearing in two layers and needed four helpers to do the job.\n\nHe began shearing at about 9am and took about 45 minutes to finish the first pass.\n\nThe average fleece weighs 5kg and takes just three minutes to shear.\n\nChampion shearer Ian Elkins (pictured with Chris' wool in 2015) had to do the shearing in two layers and needed four helpers to do the job\n\nMr Elkins began shearing about 9am (shearing process pictured) and took about 45 minutes to finish the first pass\n\nThe champion shearer said at the time he estimated he cut seven years' worth of growth - double the sheep's body weight.\n\n'I wouldn't say it is high quality, but you wouldn't expect it to be after so long in the bush,' Mr Elkins said of the fleece.\n\n'It's amazing it has survived all these years out in the wild,' he said.\n\nRSPCA volunteers pictured carrying Chris after he was found in 2015 by a bushwalker\n\nWhen Chris (pictured in 2015) was first brought in, then-RSPCA ACT boss Tammy Ven Denge said he was shy but after having his wool shorn, she said he had gone from standoff-ish to wanting cuddles\n\nA children's book was even written about Chris, with proceeds going toward the RSPCA.\n\nChris' discovery also led to offers rolling in from people offering to adopt him - with the number of requests made to ACT RSPCA running into the hundreds.\n\nThe RSPCA said there have been a number of cases where sheep have lost their flock and lived in the wild.\n\nA children's book was even written about Chris, with proceeds going toward the RSPCA (pictured in 2015 with an RSPCA care assistant)\n\nOne of those cases was New Zealander Shrek with a 27kg fleece - a fellow rogue sheep who evaded the shearing shed for years.\n\nIn September 2014, a sheep named Shaun was discovered living in the Tasmanian bush after going missing for at least six years.\n\nAnother Tasmanian sheep called Cecil had its fleece weigh in at 38kg in June 2017 after getting itself lost in bushland.", "description": "The New South Wales sanctuary taking care of Chris the sheep revealed the animal, which was discovered in 2015, was found dead on Tuesday morning by his minders having died of old age.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028588-0-image-a-2_1571736869712.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
