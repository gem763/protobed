But when she became the creative director, she knew she wanted to make the company sustainable \u2014 to be an example of how to turn a contemporary brand into an ethical one. And during her tenure, she has successfully put ecofriendliness at the heart of the brand without sacrificing style. Gwenyth Paltrow is a fan, which isn\u2019t surprising considering that Mother of Pearl specializes in classic pieces with fun details (pearls on almost everything). We spoke with Amy about tiny bags and having a sense of humor about fashion.\n\nHow do you thank someone for a gift? Another gift.\n\nWhat would you never wear? Leather trousers for many reasons.\n\nWhat\u2019s your dream vacation? Berber Lodge, Morocco.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a good book on your coffee table right now? I currently have a first edition copy of Bruce Davidson\u2019s Subway on my table that I bought for my husband for his birthday.\n\nLast show you binge-watched? Big Little Lies.\n\nSecret to hosting a good party? Relaxed environment, great food, great music, and my favorite people.\n\nWhat is a trend that you like right now? Sustainability, but hopefully it will become a cool classic that doesn\u2019t fade.\n\nOne you don\u2019t understand? Bags so tiny you can\u2019t fit anything in. Just use your pockets instead.\n\nFavorite museum/gallery? The Barbican in London.\n\nShoes you wear most often?A fancy flat. I have a pair from Mother of Pearl which are black mules with a pearl strap. I am a casual dresser so I like a fun shoe. Once a man came up to me in the street and told me my shoes were so ugly he needed a painkiller to look at them, I laughed so much I made him say it again to camera for my Instagram.\n\nCan you share three photos that define your style, and a brief explanation of why?\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Amy Powney\n\nOversize sleeves are my go-to, as I like to wear causal silhouettes and big sleeves give them a lift.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Amy Powney\n\nRoxy (the dog) is my favorite accessory ever.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Amy Powney\n\nThis is my go-to summer outfit: an easy, throw-on summer dress that isn\u2019t boring.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite\u2026\n\nPajamas? My old white shirts\n\nCandle? Very simple beeswax ones\n\nScent? No 29 Le Labo\n\nRestaurant? Perilla in Newington Green, London\n\nSocks? Men\u2019s silk ribbed socks\n\nT-shirt?
