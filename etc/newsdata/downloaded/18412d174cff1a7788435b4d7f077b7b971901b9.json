Joe's Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\"\n\nSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nMr. Trump also tweeted a controversial 30 second campaign video attacking Biden. Facebook has rejected the Biden campaign's request to remove the ad on the grounds that it contains false information, saying that the company does not fact check politicians. CNN has refused to air the ad.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was spurred by a whistleblower complaint about Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when he requested Zelensky to investigate Biden's role in pushing out former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Mr. Trump has promoted the conspiracy theory that Biden wanted Shokin ousted because Shokin was investigating a gas firm with ties to Hunter Biden. However, there is no evidence to support this theory.\n\nMr. Trump also called on China to investigate the Bidens while speaking to reporters last week.\n\nBo Erickson contributed to this report", "description": "This is the first time that Biden has explicitly called for President Trump's impeachment", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/03/7f28a89d-bd53-4aae-a268-1969516605bf/thumbnail/1200x630g2/3fc77e5ba42682b2a3aed185b83b17fa/joe-biden-reno-nevada.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
