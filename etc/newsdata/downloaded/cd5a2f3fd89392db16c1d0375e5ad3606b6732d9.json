She previously used a Facebook post to say: 'My support and defence of LGBT+ rights and equality is consistent and longstanding.\n\n'Whilst I am not surprised, given the smears I have already been subjected to since standing for selection in the Mayoral race, I am saddened at attempts to misportray my record of solidarity.'", "description": "The party's LGBT and women's organisations have complained after Salma Yaqoob, the former leader of the Respect Party, made the cut ahead of the 2020 election for the devolved role.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/14/19992040-0-image-a-15_1571664912661.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
