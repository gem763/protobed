However, three days ago, government papers submitted to a Scottish court revealed that Johnson will send a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay if no deal is agreed by 19 October.\n\nPreviously, Johnson said shortly before the bill was passed in early September that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU for another Brexit extension and has referred to the binding act of parliament as the \u201cSurrender Bill,\u201d a phrase that has drawn widespread criticism.\n\nJohnson is bound by law, under the Benn Act, to request a deal if one is not agreed by 19 October. However, it is up to the EU to decide if it thinks a deal is possible and also whether an extension is worth it. If it doesn\u2019t think either will happen, it is highly likely that there will be a no-deal Brexit.\n\nREAD MORE: France: EU won't approve Brexit delay amid major no-deal prep underway\n\nOn 8 September, France declared that it, as well as the EU, will not allow Britain to have an extension beyond the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\nIn an interview with Europe 1 radio, France\u2019s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying. The British must tell us what they want. We are not going to do (extend) this every three months.\u201d\n\nBritain was originally meant to leave the EU on 29 March this year, but former prime minister Theresa May secured an extension with the bloc to try and push her Brexit deal through parliament. That extension was until 31 October this year.\n\nThe pound against the US dollar (GBPUSD=X) is slightly down on Monday morning at $1.2313 as investors await the decision to come later this week:", "description": "We'll have a better forecast of whether it's likely to be a no-deal Brexit by the end of the week.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wBHd1ybWHjghjDivcZbsNg--~B/aD01MTI1O3c9NjgyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/61bb4e10-e8c4-11e9-bdfb-a966d7dc2249", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
