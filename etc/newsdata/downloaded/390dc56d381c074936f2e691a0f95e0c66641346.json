And if you have three, you have a samba party.\u201d\n\n'In Neymar\u2019s case, United think it would be him pouring the caipirinhas.'\n\nIt is no secret that the forward enjoys a lavish lifestyle. He is regularly seen out and about at various high-profile events with his celebrity friends.\n\nNeymar's Instagram feed is full of snaps at nightclubs with the likes of Lewis Hamilton and musicians Rihanna and Drake. He also takes in events with current team-mates, like Kylian Mbappe, as well as former colleagues.\n\nHis party lifestyle is also causing trouble at other clubs, with Barcelona midfielder Arthur Melo in trouble with the Spanish giants after he enjoyed a night out with Neymar last month.\n\nNeymar sits between his father and friend Jo Amancio during a PSG match in August 2017\n\nNeymar poses for a picture with Canadian rap superstar Drake in September 2018\n\nNeymar shared an Instagram post with Arthur Melo and Leo Baptistao in Barcelona last month\n\nThe Brazil striker hobbled into one nightclub in Sao Paulo while using crutches due to an injury\n\nNeymar operates in a-list celebrity circles and can be seen here with Lewis Hamilton in 2017\n\nOn the same night Neymar and the F1 world champion sat down for a drink with Rita Ora\n\nRegularly snapped on nights out with famous faces, Neymar poses for a picture with Rihanna\n\nArthur also had to apologise last season after he was the only Barcelona player to attend the former Blaugrana man's birthday party in Paris just 48 hours before the club's Copa del Rey clash against Real Madrid.\n\nDoubts also arose about his father, Neymar Snr, who operates as his son's agent and handles all negotiations with regards to transfers. He is considered to be 'money-obsessed' by United officials, according to the report.\n\nIt is also believed Neymar 'does not dedicate himself in the way of (Lionel) Messi or (Cristiano) Ronaldo' and it was those details that led to United not making an offer.\n\nHis injury history probably counted against him too and Neymar suffered his latest setback while on international duty with Brazil last week.\n\nNeymar will now miss PSG's two Champions League clashes against Club Brugge but should be back in time to face Real Madrid.\n\nThe forward missed this year's Copa America because of a right ankle injury. He only returned to action two months later.\n\nThe Brazilian also injured his right foot in January whilst playing for PSG. The problem was in his fifth metatarsal that kept him off the pitch for almost three months.\n\nNeymar also injured his right foot months before the World Cup in Russia in 2018.", "description": "United were among the few clubs with the financial power to complete a deal for Neymar but it seems the Premier League giants were put off by his personality and his father's demands.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/09/19778356-0-image-a-22_1571214837121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
