A wasp then landed on the coral snake and moments later the reptile began to thrash about wildly to shoo away the wasp.\n\nIt was unclear whether the wasp had stung the coral snake to make it whip about. It was also unclear how the two snakes ended up in the branches of the bush.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how rat snake got there,\u201d Cummings wrote. \u201cDropped by a hawk? So many questions. And how does a coral snake climb the thorny rose bush!?!\u201d\n\nNatalie Claunch, a doctoral student at the university, replied that while coral snakes aren\u2019t great climbers, the free meal acted as good motivation.\n\nThe eastern coral snake, also known as Micrurus fulvius, eats lizards, frogs and smaller snakes, including other coral snakes, according to National Geographic. While the serpents are known for their potent venom, they must chew on their victim to inject their poison fully.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor now, Cummings has settled on one idea of how circumstances unfolded.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve now settled on our favorite theory: rat snake was dropped by a hawk or similar and landed in the rosebush,\u201d Cummings wrote. \u201cBut the rat snake is somewhat twisted around the branches so I wonder if when it was dropped it was still partially alive and tried to free itself and could not.\u201d", "description": "Florida wildlife has proven yet again just how wild it can be after a woman shared\u00a0video of a venomous coral snake eating another snake while it was being attacked by a yellow jacket wasp.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/21/694940094001_6096559320001_6096562818001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
