Boeing has developed the Massive Ordnance Penetrator at the company's facilities in St. Charles, Mo., for the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).\n\nThe U.S. Air Force B-2 and B-52 heavy bombers carry the Massive Ordnance Penetrator for dropping from high altitudes. Boeing completed a static tunnel lethality test of the MOP munition in March 2007 at DTRA's weapons tunnel complex at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.\n\nThe Massive Ordnance Penetrator super bomb was developed amid heightening worldwide concern of the mounting capability to build and deploy nuclear weapons in countries such as Iran and North Korea that are openly hostile to the United States.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Huge and very powerful.", "authors": ["Military", "Aerospace Electronics"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DZ3omkOQFTHhMV7G7pZaAQ--~B/aD05NzM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/c12b01338faa5a9ff49520647d072c9b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
