Rather, it\u2019s clear he has become so used to living in conditions that most people would think of as reminiscent of a prison that he finds it completely normal.\n\nThe pipe bombs, bricks and fireworks that are regularly hurled at these few houses in an otherwise quiet cul-de-sac are so commonplace that they are just part of daily life.\n\nThis is simply where all William\u2019s friends live, this is his home and he doesn\u2019t seem to notice the oppressive atmosphere created by the huge structures outside his bedroom window.\n\n\u201cThe wall should be left the way it is,\u201d he tells me. William says he likes living here and loves the sense of community that exists in Cluan Place.\n\nOn the other side of the wall I meet people who I know will never set foot in Cluan Place. As members of the Catholic nationalist community, their political views are the polar opposite of William\u2019s.\n\nThe red, white and blue murals and Union Flags of Cluan Place are noticeably absent from Bombay Street where Jean McAnoy lives.\n\nThis is a staunchly Catholic area of west Belfast where intense riots in the late 1960s sparked the deployment of the British army in Northern Ireland.\n\nAnd so to protect the residents, the barriers were erected and 40 years later they\u2019re still here - meaning that the view out of William and Jean\u2019s windows are practically identical.\n\nJean lives in what I can only describe as a cage. Not only does she have walls and metal fencing surrounding her house, there is thick wire mesh forming a roof over her back garden too.\n\nBut Jean is used to living like this. She has lived all her life on this street. Her grandfather was burnt out of his house back in the 1960s, but she says she\u2019ll never move.\n\n\u201cThe walls should be left the way they are,\u201d says Jean echoing the words of William, although I suspect they will never discuss the issue over a cup of tea. And that\u2019s a shame because I think they would get on well together - heated debates on politics aside.\n\nBut there\u2019s the problem: until people living on either side of these walls are able to actually see each other going about their daily lives, I think they will continue to think they are very different.\n\nThey aren\u2019t so different really. The flags on the streets are different colours, but the residents share the same set of values and both place great importance on community spirit and family.\n\nStill, as long as the walls remain there will always be mistrust of the \u201cpeople from the other side\u201d.", "description": "So-called \u201cpeace walls\u201d have separated Catholic and Protestant communities in Belfast since 1969.
