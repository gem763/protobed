Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee which oversees FEMA, confirmed Thursday that there are problems with Byard\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThere were some issues raised that are being investigated and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nRepublicans did not learn about the issues with Byard's nomination until after he was approved by the committee in June.\n\nAnother senator on the committee confirmed that the Senate is investigating Byard and that he may not be confirmed. However, most members of the Senate are unaware of the issue, which sources familiar with the nomination say involves an altercation.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. But an administration official with knowledge of the matter said, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that the White House would have leaned on the Senate to get him through confirmation given that we\u2019re in the middle of hurricane season.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the White House silence on this is very telling,\u201d the official added.\n\n", "description": "The president said he would nominate Jeffrey Byard in February.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine", "Burgess Everett", "Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f7/00/30296dde4ba6b05e4b51f5d40aad/190912-trump-fema-getty-773.jpg"}
