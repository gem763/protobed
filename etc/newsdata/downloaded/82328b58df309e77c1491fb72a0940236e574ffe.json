An April 2019 Gallup survey found that 43% of Americans believe socialism would be \u201ca good thing\u201d for the country (up from 25% in 1942). A full 47% of Americans say they would vote for a socialist presidential candidate. With those numbers, it should come as no surprise that in 2016, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (America\u2019s most popular \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d) attracted more than 13 million votes during the Democratic primaries. More than 2 million of those voters were under the age of 30.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why Bernie appeals to young voters; after all, he campaigned on a platform of Medicare for all; free education and cancellation of all student debt; a \u201cjob guarantee;\u201d a progressive tax system; and much more. And where Bernie came up short, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez succeeded. As you may remember, AOC upset the New York incumbent, Rep. Joseph Crowley, 57 \u2013 42 percent, on a platform that included Medicare for all; free college tuition; and a job guarantee. Sound familiar?\n\nThese silver-tongued promises are the (seemingly) sunny side of socialism. But they depend on \u2013 and eventually succumb to \u2013 the dark side of socialism, as set forth by its founding father, Karl Marx. Socialism (a term often used interchangeably with its close relative, communism) seeks the elimination of private ownership in favor of \u201csocial ownership\u201d or state control. Merriam-Webster defines it this way: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, socialism trades economic freedom (and many other freedoms) for the \u201csecurity\u201d of state control. But don\u2019t take my word for it.\n\nThe Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) \u2013 which has approximately 60,000 members (up from just 5,000 in November 2016) \u2013calls for \u201ccooperatives\u201d and \u201csocial ownership,\u201d in place of \u201cbig corporate bureaucracy.\u201d It also seeks \u201cgreater democratic control\u201d of private businesses in an effort to encourage accountability. The DSA proclaims that \u201cmany structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed.\u201d\n\nOf course, like Bernie and AOC, the DSA champion the sunny side of socialism, promising that \u201ca long-term goal of socialism is to eliminate all but the most enjoyable kinds of labor,\u201d and pledging to spread any remaining \u201cunappealing jobs\u201d among as many people as possible.\n\nThat last one has a certain comedic appeal; perhaps the DSA should adopt the slogan \u201cmisery loves company.\u201d But the implications of socialism for our great republic would be tragic. Socialism and communism are not variations of a democratic republic. They are its antithesis.\n\nHistorian Lee Edwards, Ph.D., describes it this way: \u201cSocialists promise a classless society but create the prison camps of the Gulag and the Isle of Pines. They assure peace but engage in wars of national liberation. They abolish private property but depend upon the underground economy. They stamp out religion but worship Big Brother. They bring down corrupt dictators but institute a dictatorship of the Party.\u201d\n\nOf course, ask a proponent of socialism about increased government control, and they\u2019ll hail it as a positive development. To quote Winston Churchill, proponents of socialism are quick to cast capitalism as the \u201cpredatory tiger.\u201d It\u2019s blamed for the wealth of the top 1%, deplored as the cause of the Great Recession of 2008, and labeled a cause of greed, \u201cprivilege,\u201d and any number of social ills. The solution \u2013 they say \u2013 is to constrain or abandon the free market in order to obtain equality. Countries like Sweden are lifted up as examples of the utopia that socialism might provide.\n\nThe great irony is that Sweden is a shining example of the fact that free markets are the solution and not the problem. Swedish economist and Cato Institute fellow Johan Norberg explains: \u201cFree markets and small government made Sweden rich. The experiment with socialism crashed us.\u201d Indeed, while Sweden has \u201cgenerous government entitlement programs\u201d (as do its Nordic neighbors Norway, Finland, and Denmark), many of its policies would be very out of place at a Bernie Sanders rally. There are no minimum wage laws. There is school choice. The government sets limits on public spending and a \u201csurplus goal\u201d that helps keep its national debt low and has earned the county an AAA credit rating. In the 2019 Economic Freedom of the World Index, Sweden scored a 75.2, less than 2 points behind the United States (76.8) and above countries like Japan (72.1) and South Korea (72.3)\n\nThankfully, and despite the increased popularity of socialism as an ideal, Americans intuitively understand that the government is not better equipped than the private sector in matters related to the economy and wages. In fact, the same Gallup poll that found 43% of Americans believed socialism would be a good thing, also found that 62% believe the free market should control the economy and wages, and 68% believe it should be primarily responsible for the distribution of wealth. If these poll results sound contradictory, it\u2019s because they are. Americans like the sound of socialism, but the substance is hard to swallow. The icing looks sweet but the cake is dry.\n\nNo reasonable American desires to see fellow citizens suffer from inadequate healthcare, drift aimlessly without work, or stumble under the weight of unreasonable debt. But socialism is not the answer. Socialism promises equality, but obtains it by punishing success and constraining free markets. It replaces our democratic republic \u2013 by the people and for the people \u2013 with a dictatorship of the proletariat.", "description": "Throughout the United States, socialism is enjoying a fresh wind .09/14/2019 1:23:16AM EST.", "authors": ["James", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/202/b96464c1-5bbd-49a7-ae15-83b37b858372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
