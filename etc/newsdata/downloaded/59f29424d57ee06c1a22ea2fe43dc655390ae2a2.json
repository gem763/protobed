It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo denied that Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels were responsible for the attack, as they had claimed over the weekend. Iran has been supporting the Houthi insurgency.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials previously said that Iran was likely involved in the Saudi strikes, according to Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nPompeo said the Houthis appear to lack the type of equipment that was used to carry out the attacks, which targeted the largest oil processing facility in the world. He also told reporters that flight patterns suggest the drones didn\u2019t come from the south \u2015 i.e., they didn\u2019t come across the border from Yemen.\n\n\u201cThe equipment used is unknown to be in the Houthi arsenal,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThese line attack cruise missiles we have never seen there and we think we\u2019ve seen most everything. So the intelligence community has high confidence that these were not weapons that would have been in the possession of the Houthis. That\u2019s probably the most important piece of information.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d ready to retaliate against whoever sent the missiles.\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nSaudi officials have also expressed confidence that the attacks on their oil facilities were carried out by Iran. At a press conference on Wednesday, Saudi defense ministry spokesman Turki al-Maiki said that the \u201cattack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nAs proof, al-Maiki presented twisted and burnt metal fragments that he said were parts of Iranian drones and cruise missiles recovered from the site of the attack, the Guardian reported.\n\nPompeo told reporters on Wednesday that he would be meeting with the Saudi crown prince to gather together European and Arab partners to prevent future attacks from Iran.\n\n\u201cWe are working to build a coalition to develop a plan to deter them. This is what needs to happen. This is an attack on a scale that we\u2019ve just not seen before,\u201d he said.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, denied that his country was involved in the attacks and said that Pompeo had failed at applying \u201cmax pressure\u201d and was now turning to \u201cmax deceit\u201d in a tweet over the weekend.", "description": "The U.S. secretary of state said Iran was behind the missile strikes.
