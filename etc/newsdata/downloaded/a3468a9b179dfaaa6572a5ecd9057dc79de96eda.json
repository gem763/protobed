It is made by taking perfectly delicious whiskey and diluting it with sparkling water. The name \u201chighball\u201d sounds celebratory and festive and vaguely suggestive, but don\u2019t be fooled: it\u2019s another name for \u201cwhiskey and soda.\u201d In an era in which serious drinkers embrace potent, spirit-forward cocktails, Highballs have all the appeal of light beer.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a Highball fan for the reasons outlined above. So, on a trip to Japan earlier this year as a guest of Beam Suntory, I was puzzled by its ubiquity. It was more common than even the cute, wide-eyed kittens on teenagers\u2019 backpacks\u2014I spotted Highballs on commuter trains as salarymen cracked open tallboys of the stuff. In Tokyo, happy-hour crowds lined up at bars to get Highballs dispensed from futuristic-looking machines.\n\nAnd the Highball has invaded the United States\u2014it\u2019s everywhere these days, and it a good contender for the it drink of the year.\n\nIt occurred to me that the problem was not with the Highball, but with me. And my problem, it tuned out, was simple and easily diagnosed: I had grouped Highballs with classic cocktails and rated it accordingly.\n\nHighballs are, in fact, not cocktails. They are an early form of hard seltzer\u2014in fact, they are the ur-hard-seltzer, a category that would not be invented until more than a century after the Highball first appeared.\n\nThat proto-Highball surfaced sometime in the early 1890s, and was then called a Splificator. (The recipe, in its entirety, from an 1895 bar guide: \u201cOne piece ice; let customer help himself to whiskey, and fill up with Apollinaris water.\u201d) It was a hit; by 1898 a popular play appeared called The Highball Family, in which \u201cthe wife and the mother of George Highball endeavor to illustrate to him the folly of indulging in too much liquor when he goes out to the club.\u201d\n\nThe first decade of the 20th century was peak Highball. The Buffalo Enquirer reported in 1900 that fancy drinks\u2014cocktails, fizzes, cobblers and the like\u2014had faded in popularity, to be \u201creplaced by the whiskey highball and the gin rickey, [which] can be compounded by anyone who knows their ingredients.\u201d\n\nIn New York the same year, the Times Union reported that \u201cwhiskey highballs and a number of other combinations of whiskey\u2026and carbonated water\u201d had become all the rage, \u201cand among the summer drinks of which Brooklyn bartenders are so proud.\u201d (I know, classic Brooklyn bartender.)\n\nHighballs persisted through Prohibition, often employing sodas that were flavored and sweetened, like cola and ginger ale. These drinks were easy to make at home, and had the added benefit of masking the taste of crappy bootleg liquor. Highballs continued to be widely consumed in the post-Prohibition years\u2014in the 1940s, Canada Dry marketed its bottled soda water as ideal for Highballs, and touted their \u201cpin-point carbonation\u201d as offering what they called \u201cear-appeal.\u201d\n\nHighballs entered into an eclipse in the 1960s, when American Speech magazine noted that, \u201cin sophisticated drinking circles the term high-ball has become practically archaic...The illuminati ask for \u2018whiskey and water\u2019 or \u2018Scotch and soda.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s back.\n\nThe Highball\u2019s recent resurgence\u2014The Highball is Taking Over America, was an episode of The Daily Beast\u2019s Life Behind Bars podcast last May\u2014can trace its roots to Japan, which has been enjoying Highballs as long as anyone else. In 1907, it was reported that U.S. Secretary of War William Howard Taft drank \u201cJapanese highballs\u201d with his hosts, although exactly what those consisted of is unclear. (The Japanese whisky industry was essentially non-existent then, although in the 1880s any sort of Japanese alcoholic beverage\u2014including sake\u2014might be referred to as \u201cJapanese whisky.\u201d)\n\nThe recent return of the Highball can actually be traced to the fall of Japanese whisky. Around 2008, the House of Suntory was faced with sagging whisky sales\u2014consumers were increasingly drawn to lighter spirits such as vodka and sochu. \u201cWhisky was too hot and aggressive for a younger generation,\u201d said Atsushi \u201cCharlie\u201d Takeuchi, a marketing manager with Beam Suntory. The sales team, where Takeuchi was a member, noticed that whisky Highballs were still selling well at better bars, despite the overall decline in whiskey\u2019s popularity. \u201cThe question was, how can we put a highly skilled bartender in a machine,\u201d Takeuchi said.\n\nBeam Suntory partnered with Nittok, a Japanese company that makes beer and beverage dispensers, to develop a machine that could craft the perfect Highball, every time. Suntory paid the development costs and got exclusive rights for several years. They placed the first few in Tokyo bars, where they were an instant hit\u2014some selling upwards of a hundred Highballs a day. Other bars took notice; by the end of 2008, the machines were in 100 bars, and the following year 300. Articles on their appeal were published, as were numerous ads for Suntory Highballs. Bars across Japan clamored for the machines, and today about 5,000 have Highball dispensers. Then consumers wanted drinks at home, so Suntory released canned Highballs in 2009. The Highball\u2019s renaissance was in full flower.\n\nIn 2011, the Highball turned its sights west. Suntory sensed opportunity in the United States, and spent five years getting its machines approved and licensed for use here. The first were launched in New York and Chicago in June 2017. Word of mouth spread. Two years later, about 120 Highball machines are located in bars across the United States, with about a quarter of those in New York.\n\nOne might be tempted to dismiss their popularity as a potent mix of marketing hype and novelty. But the machines did effectively put a quality bartender in a box. It started with exacting proportions\u2014in the United States, the ratio is one-part whiskey to three-parts sparkling water. (In Japan, where more dilute drinks are favored, the ratio is one to four.)\n\nThe mixing was the easy part. The machines also chilled the whiskey and the soda to near-freezing temperatures before dispensing\u201437 degrees. That not only helped maintain carbonation, but also reduced dilution when the drink first hit the ice.\n\nThe carbonation is also a selling point. The Highball dispensers are engineered to inject higher-pressure gas into the water (which is first filtered in the machine), making it fizzier than what comes out of the standard soda gun. Takeuchi says that gas pressure in a standard soda is about 3.5 to 4.0 volumes. (A volume is a unit of measurement defined as the number of times the total volume of dissolved gas can be divided by the volume of liquid.) Champagne is typically around 5.0 volumes (hence the smaller bubbles and thicker bottles.) The Highball machine produces carbonation at 6.0 volumes, meaning a profusion of small, delicate bubbles, which have been shown (in studies of Champagne\u2060) to convey flavor more efficiently. The machine was also designed with a proprietary nozzle that maintained full carbonation to the point of dispensing.\n\n\u201cOnce the machine came out with the highly carbonated soda, it was just kind of word of mouth,\u201d says Gardner Dunn, the New York-based senior whiskey ambassador for Beam Suntory. \u201cIt\u2019s all down to the bubbles.\u201d As an added benefit, the machines could dispense carbonated water without whiskey, allowing bars to make all sorts of tall drinks with high-quality soda water.\n\nThe growth of the machines in the United States has been slower than in Japan, owing to the fact that Beam Suntory can subsidize or distribute the machines for free in Japan, but is prohibited by law from doing the same here. Bars have to purchase the Highball machines, and at a price of $5,000 to $7,000, that can be a steep hill to climb.\n\nBut Dunn and Takeuchi believe the Highball and its robot master will continue to spread.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little more health conscious these days, and people are looking for lower ABV and fewer calories,\u201d Dunn says. And with the resurgence of hard seltzers and high-end mixers like Fever-Tree and Q Tonic, \u201cit\u2019s the perfect storm for the Highball.\u201d\n\nThe Highball was arguably the first hard seltzer, and if the current trend pops, it may endure to be the last. I\u2019d wager that in 2120 drinkers will still be drinking whiskey Highballs.
