But Johnson added another note saying he was opposed to an\n\nextension and British government minister Michael Gove said on\n\nSunday Brexit will happen by Oct. 31 as the government seeks to\n\nget the Brexit bill through the parliament.\n\nAnalysts said the market focus will turns to this week's\n\nvote on Boris Johnson's deal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab\n\ntold the BBC overnight that he was confident enough lawmakers\n\nwould back the deal this week.\n\n\"The weekend's events, if anything, have further reduced the\n\nrisk of disorderly exit,\" said Adam Cole, chief currency\n\nstrategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.\n\n\"If there is a knee-jerk negative reaction in the pound as\n\nwe emerge from the weekend with a greater overhang of\n\nuncertainty than hoped and some of the long positions are\n\nunwound, it should be faded soon.\"\n\nThe European Union will play for time rather than rush to\n\ndecide on London's reluctant request to delay Brexit again,\n\ndiplomats said on Sunday. While weary of the Brexit process, EU leaders are keen to\n\navoid a disorderly exit and are unlikely to reject the request.\n\nThey hope the deal can eventually be approved in London.\n\nGoldman Sachs GS.N said on Sunday that it lowered the\n\nprobability of a no-deal Brexit to 5% from 10% and maintained\n\nits baseline view that the UK will leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\"The uncertainty is likely to weigh on sterling when trading\n\nresumes in Asia Pacific on Oct. 21. Volatility will remain\n\nelevated until a clearer picture emerges,\" said Marc Chandler,\n\nchief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.\n\nThe euro eased 0.15% to $1.1155 versus the greenback,\n\noff Friday's two-month high of $1.1172.\n\nThe dollar was little changed at 108.41 to the\n\nsafe-haven yen, still not far from its 2-1/2-month high of\n\n108.94 yen marked on Thursday.\n\n\n\nSterling falls https://tmsnrt.rs/35RTMtl\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Sterling slips from 5-mth high after Brexit plan hits snag", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC44011_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
