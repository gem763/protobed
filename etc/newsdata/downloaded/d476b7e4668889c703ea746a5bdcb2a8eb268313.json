Once implemented, more than 90% of U.S. farm imports into Japan will be duty-free or receive preferential tariff treatment.\n\n\u201cThese deals are a game-changer for our farmers and our ranchers,\u201d President Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe love our farmers and we love our ranchers.\u201d\n\nThe countries inked the deals as Mr. Trump prepares to slap levies on $7.5 billion worth of European Union imports in retaliation for years of unfair subsidies to Airbus, an aerospace company that is the main rival to Boeing. The tariffs will go beyond airplanes, however, potentially raising the price of a variety of agricultural goods, including French wines, Italian cheeses and cashmere from the United Kingdom.\n\nAlso, Chinese negotiators will travel to Washington on Thursday to restart talks in pursuit of an elusive U.S.-China trade deal.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is very good. Whether or not we make a deal, I don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s certainly a good possibility,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump boasted that in the meantime, the U.S. is taking in \u201ctens of billions\u201d in tariffs from China.\n\nThe president refuted suggestions he had agreed to stay quiet about pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong to foster trade talks with Beijing.\n\nHe said the crowds of protesters appeared to be getting smaller, however, and reiterated his belief that President Xi Jinping could mediate the situation by meeting with a contingent of demonstrators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see a very humane solution to that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nIn the meantime, he\u2019s touting a win with Japan.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer said Japan is the U.S.\u2019 biggest market in beef, pork and wheat. The administration says the deal also will \u201cboost\u201d $40 billion in existing digital trade between the nations.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will benefit trade in innovative products and services where the United States is a worldwide leader, and will ensure that American businesses have a level playing field in areas like video, music, e-books, and software,\u201d the White House said.\n\nShinsuke J. Sugiyama, the Japanese ambassador to the U.S., said they were able to reach a deal because of the \u201cfundamental trust\u201d and \u201cgood relationship\u201d between the sides, despite \u201cfierce debates\u201d in negotiations,\n\nMr. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paved the way for Monday\u2019s announcement by touting the first stage of a broader trade pact at the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Abe are close friends and golfing buddies. They worked on trade throughout the year, with Mr. Trump agreeing to delay tough decisions until after Japanese elections this past summer.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
