My mom and dad divorced a few years ago, and now my mom is having money problems. She bought some rental properties after the divorce with the idea becoming a landlord and generating income that way. Since then, she has lost the properties to foreclosure and isn\u2019t making a lot of money in her new job. I\u2019m worried about her, but I just graduated from college, and I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t listen to me.\n\nRenee\n\nDear Renee,\n\nYou\u2019ve got a great heart, and I\u2019m glad you love your mom enough to want to help her. Divorce is never an easy thing for anyone involved.\n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve heard sayings at some point in your life about how winners never quit, and quitters never win. Those statements aren\u2019t always completely true. Successful people quit doing things that aren\u2019t working all the time. This doesn\u2019t have to mean you give up on a dream. It might mean you change the processes and methods you\u2019re using\u2014especially if what you\u2019ve done in the past hasn\u2019t worked out well.\n\nPart of being successful in life, and in business, is having the ability to recognize when something isn\u2019t working and make changes. You sound like an intelligent, caring young woman. But honestly, there\u2019s probably not much chance someone fresh-out-of-college will have a lot of influence with her mother when it comes to things like this.\n\nIt might be a good idea if she talked to one of her friends or relatives a little closer to her own age. I mean someone with a little more life experience. If she\u2019s in a good church, she could even talk to her pastor. In the meantime, maybe you could talk to someone like this and explain what your mom is going through. Ask them to approach her, and see if she\u2019ll listen and be willing to accept some new ideas.\n\nYou\u2019re a good daughter, Renee. Show your mom all the love and support you can. It sounds like she needs it right now.\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,What\u2019s the best way to talk to a parent, .10/17/2019 10:23:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/32/4ed47c1c-7686-4968-b223-b1037f4d60a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
