The companies caved to the pressure over fears of being shut out of airline routes into China.\n\nIn May, then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders denounced that pressure campaign by Beijing.\n\nSanders said Trump opposed political correctness during his election campaign and opposes \"efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens.\"\n\n\"The United States strongly objects to China's attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content,\" Sanders said at the time.\n\nFilm critic Christian Toto noted Hollywood has never been more vocal in weighing in on topics like immigration, transgender rights and gun control.\n\n\"Yet when it comes to Chinese censorship they can't spare a syllable,\" said Toto, editor of the online film review website Hollywoodintoto.com.\n\n\"Artists turn away as Chinese censors slice and dice their product,\" he said. \"Even Quentin Tarantino allowed it to happen to his 2012 film Django Unchained. They realize the Chinese movie market can turn flops into hits, and they don't want to rock that fiscal boat.\"\n\nMike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said China has sought to control content in American media.\n\n\"American audiences are being submitted to censorship, not our own censorship, but a foreign power's censorship, and a Communist Party censorship,\" he said.\n\n\"But we get shown a very benign view of China in which China is a normal country, no different from France, or Britain, or Germany. That is not the case obviously. If you speak against the government in Germany nothing happens to you. If you speak against the government in China, they'll throw you in jail.\"\n\nGonzalez said the Chinese box office is No. 2 in the world. Revenue in China is now about $8.6 billion annually compared to around $11 billion for the U.S. movie market, making it a lucrative market.\n\nIn order to gain access to that Chinese market Hollywood has agreed to avoid sensitive topics and to submit scripts to censors, he said.\n\n\"China will demand that for the movie to be considered for showing in China it must be free of any characters or ideas opposed by the ruling Communist Party of China,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nThus films about Tibet or the imprisonment of ethnic Uighurs in western China are no longer considered for production.\n\nGonzalez said there are \"three T's\" that are taboo for movies seeking to be shown in China: Tiananmen, Tibet, and Taiwan. Tiananmen refers to the use of Chinese military forces to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's central square in June 1989.\n\nAmerican moviemakers should disclose whether films were influenced or censored by China.\n\n\"If a Chinese censor has anything to do with a movie, it should be very clear to the audiences, it should be shown in the credits [that] the script of this movie was shown to Chinese censors,\" Gonzalez said. \"\u2018This movie was changed at the direction of Chinese censors.'\"\n\n\"There's nothing we can do about Chinese audiences, but American audiences have the right to know which Hollywood studios and which movies are doing these things,\" he said.\n\nThe comments were made in a Heritage podcast broadcast earlier this year.\n\nThe Pentagon's most recent annual report on the Chinese military stated that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is utilizing \"three warfares\" as part of global influence operations. The three warfares include psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare.\n\n\"China views the cyberspace domain as a platform providing opportunities for influence operations, and the PLA likely seeks to use online influence activities to support its overall three warfares strategy and to undermine an adversary\u2019s resolve in a contingency or conflict,\" the report said.\n\n\"Consistent with this strategy, China conducts influence operations against cultural institutions, media organizations, and the business, academic, and policy communities of the United States, other countries, and international institutions to achieve outcomes favorable to its security and military strategy objectives.\"\n\nThe influence operations are coordinated at high levels and executed by a range of actors, such as the United Front Work Department, the Propaganda Ministry, and the Ministry of State Security, the civilian intelligence service.\n\nChinese foreign influence activities are focused on establishing and maintaining power brokers within foreign governments to promote policies China believes will assist China\u2019s modernization\u2014despite Beijing's frequent claims of not interfering in foreign countries\u2019 internal affairs, the report said.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Hollywood to resist Beijing pressure to censor American films in exchange for gaining access to Chinese audiences.", "authors": ["Bill Gertz", "David Rutz", "Todd Shepherd", "Cameron Cawthorne", "Graham Piro", "Nic Rowan", "Collin Anderson"], "top_image": "https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mike-Pompeo-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
