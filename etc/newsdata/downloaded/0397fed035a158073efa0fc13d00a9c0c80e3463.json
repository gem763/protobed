But one bride envisioned something that\u2019s never been done before. And it involved a large ball.\n\nEvent planner Reverence, from Nigeria, wanted to celebrate her tenth wedding anniversary with Joseph Efoma-Oruerio in style.\n\nShe had the white dress down, the perfect groom, an extravagant venue, dreamy decorations, all of it. But she wanted an entrance like none other.\n\nSo she ordered a giant inflatable balloon to enter the venue in. As you do.\n\nPaying $500 (\u00a3385) for the massive thing which she ordered from Dubai, Reverence rolled in with the transparent ball (yes, like the zorbing ones).\n\nAnd as quirky as it may have been, it certainly made for unique and spectacular pictures.\n\nCan\u2019t touch this (Picture: Victor Samuel/Caters News)\n\nReverence, 35, and husband Joseph, 51, invited friends and family to celebrate the special day with them in Warri, Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of their guests expected the grand entrance Reverence would make.\n\nThe couple celebrated their ten-year wedding anniversary (Picture: Victor Samuel/Caters News)\n\nBursting into the room in a giant inflatable bubble, Reverence looked like she was floating on air as she made her way happily dancing down the aisle in a sight to behold.\n\nShe said: \u2018The idea came from watching my kids playing in the pool with a balloon. I started thinking of how a bride could make an entrance into her wedding in a balloon.\n\n\u2018I searched online for life-size balloons and eventually bought one from Dubai for $500.\n\nYep, we\u2019d take plenty of pictures too (Picture: Victor Samuel/Caters News)\n\n\u2018It was the first time the guests saw a bride in a balloon, they screamed so much with excitement. It was the highlight of the event.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s definitely one way to avoid guests stepping on her wedding dress or, god forbid, spilling something on it.\n\nMORE: Bride asks her four grandmas to be the flower girls at her wedding\n\nMORE: Bride and groom who met through running replace wedding dance with a 5k\n\nMORE: Bride loses eight stone in a year to fit into her dream wedding dress\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Event planner Reverence, from Nigeria, wanted to celebrate her tenth anniversary with Joseph Efoma-Oruerio in style.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90977837_1571655782.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
