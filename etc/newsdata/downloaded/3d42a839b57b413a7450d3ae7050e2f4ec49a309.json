Each year, private-sector employers must put the equivalent of 9.5% of their employees\u2019 salaries into these accounts, out of the employer\u2019s own assets and not the wages of their workers. Employees can then voluntarily contribute their own earnings to the account.\n\nThe employer\u2019s contribution will gradually increase to 12% by 2025.\n\nAustralians may get this benefit from employers because of the government\u2019s rules, but they face severe restrictions when applying for the Age Pension, Australia\u2019s version of Social Security. The Age Pension is means- and income-tested. The age requirement for beneficiaries is gradually increasing from 65 to 67 years old, and individuals must be a resident of the country for at least 10 years to be eligible for benefits (five of which must be consecutively). Single individuals can get a maximum basic rate of $844 every two weeks, and couples can receive no more than $1,272 in the same time frame. Single retirees who earn more than $2,026 every two weeks in retirement are cut off from the Age Pension (and $3,100 for couples).\n\nBenefits are also limited based on how much residents have in assets, including non-principal homes, business ownership, overseas accounts, investments and, if you\u2019re above the retirement age, superannuation funds. Payments for single retirees who are homeowners are canceled out if they have more than $263,250, or $473,750 for non-homeowners. Couples with combined assets have a limit of $394,500 in assets if they\u2019re homeowners, and $605,000 if they\u2019re non-homeowners, before benefits are canceled.\n\n\u201cIt really is a safety net, and it is strictly enforced,\u201d said Ashley Murphy, founder of Arete Wealth Strategists, a financial planning and investment management firm that works with American and Australian clients.\n\nSuperannuation funds are a hedge against the risks of entering retirement with little to no savings. The average man approaches retirement with $300,000 in his superannuation accounts, and the average woman has about $160,000, said Stephen Huppert, a consultant and adviser to Australian institutions in the retirement industry, including those that administer superannuation funds. While the system is generous, there is room for improvement, he said, including ways to help women\u2019s superannuation contributions while on paid maternity leave and the growing population of gig economy workers. There\u2019s also little education during the decumulation phase, when Australians are asked to choose to take a lump sum of their assets or use some or all of the balance to purchase a retirement income stream.\n\nStill, having an employer-funded account to fall back on \u2014 especially if employees also contribute \u2014 bolsters financial security and a successful transition into retirement. Australia was the fourth-highest ranked country for global pension assets in total last year, behind the U.S., Japan and the U.K, according to Willis Towers Watson\u2019s Global Pension Assets Study released in February. \u201cThat\u2019s substantial when you consider it is one-fourteenth of the U.S. population,\u201d Murphy said.", "description": "The country\u2019s Age Pension spreads the wealth around the population", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ772_Austra_ZG_20190905151840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
