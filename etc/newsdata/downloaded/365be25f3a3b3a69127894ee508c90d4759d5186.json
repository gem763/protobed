This time, pharmacy giants Walgreens and CVS are telling their customers that gun owners are not welcomed there.\n\n\"We support the efforts of individuals and groups working to prevent gun violence, and continually review our policies and procedures to ensure our stores remain a safe environment,\" CVS said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this week, Walmart and Kroger also announced open carry is now prohibited in their stores.\n\nOn Fox News on Wednesday, host Tucker Carlson blasted Walmart for their decision to also step selling certain sorts of gun ammunition.\n\n\"The company more responsible than any other company for destroying and degrading rural America, for making our towns uglier and cheaper and poorer. The same people who pushed the appalling lie that brightly colored plastic crap from China is going to make us happy. That company is now lecturing normal Americans, the very Americans that they have hurt, how immoral they are for daring to protect themselves with firearms,\" Carlson said on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"\n\n\"Progressives used to attack the company for destroying small town America and for exploiting workers,\" Carlson continued. \"Walmart hired PR consultants and union busters to push back for years, but the company never really changed the way it does business. And, yet somehow the left has mostly stopped attacking them.\"\n\n\"Walmart meanwhile realized it could buy immunity from criticism from the left by mouthing left-wing pieties. That\u2019s all it takes really. Sounding woke and they\u2019ll leave you alone,\" he remarked.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:06:22AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/179/35184765-d1d6-4cb4-b8c9-652e064992ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
