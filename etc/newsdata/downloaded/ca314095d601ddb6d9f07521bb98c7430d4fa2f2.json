But not the way Trump intends, and not necessarily to the detriment of Trump challenger Joe Biden.\n\nThe investigations and possible prosecutions, if they happen, would take place in the context of a new law signed by Zelensky just before his departure for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he is expected to meet face to face with Trump for the first time.\n\nIn Kyiv, there are widespread hopes that the reforms will help Zelensky, a former comedian who played a corruption-fighting president on television, deliver on his campaign promise to clean up Ukraine for real. A new team of independent prosecutors is supposed to re-open investigations of past cases and answer questions about the corruption in post-revolutionary Ukraine over the last five years.\n\nDuring much of that time, investigations were launched against various powerful oligarchs, then quietly shut down when, it was widely assumed, the prosecutors were paid off. As a result it has been hard to know if the investigations were justified or merely launched for purposes of extortion.\n\n\u201cWe are trying ultimately to re-set the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Ukraine, to speed up the reform,\u201d Kirill Timoshenko, deputy head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. In accordance with the new law, all Ukrainian prosecutors will go through a process of recertification. The number of prosecutors will be cut down from 15,000 to 10,000. Timoshenko said he could not comment on specific cases and could not say more about Zelensky\u2019s agenda for the meeting with Trump on Wednesday.\n\nValentin Nalyvaichenko, a former head of Ukraine\u2019s domestic intelligence agency and a member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, says he expects the corruption case of the Burisma gas company\u2014two cases were opened and dropped by various prosecutors over the years\u2014to be revisited. Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, was a board member.\n\nJoe Biden is now Trump\u2019s leading opponent in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, and both Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have been working to find dirt on Biden in Ukraine.\n\n\u201c Ukraine\u2019s parliament is planning to hold hearings about the various corrupt schemes. \u201d\n\nNalyvaichenko said his country will be best served by pursuing an investigation related to Burisma\u2019s alleged multi-million-dollar corruption deals, not because of Trump\u2019s pressure but because Ukraine wants to know the truth about its own corruption, whether the founder of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s ex-minister of natural resources Mykola Zlochevsky from 2010 to 2012, had paid to quash the earlier investigations into the way he acquired gas licenses.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Nalyvaichenko said Ukraine\u2019s parliament is planning to hold hearings about the various corrupt schemes. Nalyvaichenko, who is a member of the opposition Fatherland Party, serves in a parliamentary group focused on U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\n\u201cI am going to support President Zelensky\u2019s initiatives to have new investigations by a new team at the law-enforcement agency,\u201d Nalyvaichenko said. This would include inquiries into the actions of previous prosecutor generals, Yury Lutsenko and Victor Shokhin. \u201cI am convinced that Zelensky will say in New York that these are our domestic investigations, we are going to figure them out on our own.\u201d He added, however, \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to cooperate with the FBI.\u201d\n\nProsecutor Sergiy Gorbatyuk investigated the founder of Burisma company, Zlochevsky, for three months in 2016, until Prosecutor General Lutsenko made a decision to drop the probe. First, Lutsenko took the case away from the investigators, then closed it down illegally, Gorbatyuk told The Daily Beast on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere would not have been any question [about pursuing] such cases today, if Lutsenko did not interfere in the investigations,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cI hope that with the change of management at the prosecutor general\u2019s office, there will be no illegal interferences and this case as well as other probes will be investigated strictly in accordance with the law.\u201d\n\n\u201c We are going to see some big former decision makers behind bars very soon, I have no doubt. \u201d \u2014 Ukrainian sociologist Irina Bekeshkina\n\nA leading Ukrainian sociologist, Irina Bekeshkina says there is powerful will in Zelensky\u2019s team and a strong social demand to see some former corrupt bureaucrats in jail. \u201cIt is not the number of punished criminals but their status that will make the difference and set a good example,\u201d Bekeshkina said. \u201cWe are going to see some big former decision-makers behind bars very soon, I have no doubt.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine scandal has rocked American politics, where opponents of Trump have fixed on reports that, at least implicitly, he threatened to withhold vital military aid from Ukraine if Zelensky did not pursue the Burisma case.\n\nTrump has said there was no quid pro quo, but admits that he raised the issue of Burisma, and the Biden connection, in his July 25 phone call with Zelensky as part of a discussion about corruption.\n\nA major part of the Trump narrative is that in 2016 then-Vice President Biden pressed for the resignation of Shokhin in order to protect his son. That is not the way people in Ukraine remember things. Lutsenko\u2019s reputation for corruption was infamous, and Biden supported the efforts of Ukraine\u2019s reformers to be rid of him.\n\nAccording to Nalyvaichenko, Lutsenko needs to be investigated further, not least because he has been in communication with Trump\u2019s agents \u201cfor vindictive purposes.\u201d\n\nNalyvaichenko said Ukraine should also be interested in a thorough investigation into the \u201cblack ledger\u201d that recorded slush-fund payments to Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\n\n\u201c In a Ukrainian dream scenario, Kiev would want Zelensky to agree with Western leaders on an approach to settling the war in the east. \u201d\n\n\u201cAs it turns out, nobody really investigated the case properly,\u201d Nalyvaichenko said. \u201cOfficials close to former President Petro Poroshenko mentioned two names of the U.S. citizens. One was Paul Manafort, who lost his job as Trump campaign manager, the other, Larry King, was never talked about again.\u201d\n\nUkraine previously suspected the well-known television host, Larry King, of accepting $225,000 from the \u201cblack ledger\u201d for interviewing a pro-Russian politician in 2011. At the time of the allegations, King hosted the Larry King Now show on RT America, the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda channel. At the time, King did not respond to requests for comment from Ukraine\u2019s Kyiv Post, and, as Nalyvaichenko says, the allegations faded away.\n\nThere are high expectations in Ukraine this week surounding Zelensky\u2019s meetings on the sidelines of the United Nations. In a Ukrainian dream scenario, Kyiv would want Zelensky to agree with Western leaders on an approach to settling the war in the east. There has been talk here, at least, of a sweeping peace treaty in the works.\n\nSovereignty is not just a word here, threatened as Ukraine is by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s irredentist ambition to resurrect the Russian Empire. Since 2014, Ukraine has paid with thousands of lives and territory, first during the uprising on Independence Square and thereafter during the war that has raged since.\n\nMemories are long in such conflicts, and efforts to help are deeply appreciated. Nalyvaichenko says he has no ill will toward Biden. He remembers the U.S. vice president as one of the \u201cbravest\u201d Ukraine friends coming from Washington during the first and most violent year of war with the Kremlin-backed forces.\n\n\u201cBiden asked me about Russia\u2019s aggression at the time when not many believed in it,\u201d Nalyvaichenko said. He said Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service shared with U.S. officials data they had at the time on Russian military forces fighting in Ukraine.\n\nNalyvaichenko said Biden did not shrink from denouncing corruption. \u201cHe is a man of sharp and fresh thoughts; he had no fear to turn with his face to the government, to our prime minister and top politicians and say: \u2018You have corruption at a high level.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe executive director of the Center for Combating Corruption, Darya Kalenyuk, said that all of Ukraine\u2019s corruption fighters expect the Burisma probe to be reopened. \u201cThe Burisma case has been a systematic problem for years, first Prosecutor General [Viktor] Shokin, then Lutsenko blocked the criminal investigations,\u201d Kalenyuk told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. \u201cThe pressure from Joe Biden was really needed, we welcomed it with gratitude, now it is up to the newly formed team of prosecutors to revisit the probe.\u201d\n\nInternational experts working in Ukraine also have strong memories of Biden\u2019s move to pressure Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Victor Shokin, in 2016. \u201cThe U.S. law-enforcement community was very supportive of the efforts to oust Shokin at the time, working with civil society,\u201d Donald Bowser, a former adviser on institution building, told The Daily Beast.\n\nIn 2016, Bowser\u2019s group advised NABU, Ukraine\u2019s national anti-corruption agency. \u201cFor example, a current serving Republican congressman, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, was seconded by the FBI in Kyiv at the time of the push to oust Shokin, he was helping on the anti-corruption efforts.\u201d\n\nBowser also suggested it was time to pay attention to one of the erroneous statements by Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani. \u201cGiuliani claims the Anti-corruption Center, ANTAC, was [George] Soros-funded,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were mostly funded by INL [the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement] of the State Department.\u201d\n\nMP Nalyvaichenko welcomed President Trump\u2019s and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s critical statements about Ukraine\u2019s corruption, but pointed out how important it was for Kyiv to remember its own history, value its old friends, and keep good relationships with all political powers in the United States, Ukraine\u2019s most important strategic partner. \u201cPlease understand us correctly\u2014our bipartisan position\u2014U.S. support is very important for us as a state.\u201d", "description": "President Zelensky came to office vowing to fight corruption, and it looks like he\u2019ll open a lot of cases shut by shady prosecutors.
