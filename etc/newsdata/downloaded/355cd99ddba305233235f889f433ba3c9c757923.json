Peers are set to debate the Benn bill itself and amendments on Thursday.\n\nBaroness Smith, Labour\u2019s leader in the House of Lords, said the opposition supported the move, and hoped there would be \u201cno further frustrations\u201d of the bill on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt has been quite a night. It has been a long debate \u2013 and I am grateful to the noble Lords who have stayed the course \u2013 it shows the importance of the work we do but also the issue on which we are debating,\u201d she said. \u201cI am grateful that we are now able to confirm that we will be able to complete all stages of the bill in a time-honoured way by 5pm Friday.\u201d\n\nRichard Newby, the leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, told the chamber he was very pleased that he would no longer need to use his duvet: \u201cI don\u2019t think that carrying on through 24 or 48 hours as we have been doing in a sort of pathetic attempt to set a new Guinness world record \u2026 would do anybody any favours.\u201d\n\nThe late-night agreement came after Johnson\u2019s bid to trigger an October general election failed amid a string of heavy defeats for the government. The bill supported by opposition parties and Tory rebels to block a no-deal Brexit easily cleared its second and third readings.\n\nAndrew Adonis (@Andrew_Adonis) Government chief whip announces government cave-in at 1.20 am - they are lifting the filibuster after 10 hours, with a commitment that the EU Bill will pass by 5pm Friday.
