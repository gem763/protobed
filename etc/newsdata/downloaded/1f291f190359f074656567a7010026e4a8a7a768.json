Due to desperate circumstances, he decided to shut down the official Jeremy Renner app after it was overtaken by pornography-obsessed trolls posing as the 48-year-old actor. Renner made the announcement via the app, in a message typed in a faux-handwriting font that I initially thought was Papyrus, but on closer inspection appears to be Bradley Hand.\n\n\u201cThe app has jumped the shark. Literally,\u201d Renner writes in the post, demonstrating an apparent misunderstanding of both the phrase \u201cjumped the shark,\u201d which implies the app was popular to begin with, and the word \u201cliterally.\u201d He explains that the downfall was due to \u201cclever individuals\u201d impersonating him on the platform. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a place for fans to connect with each other has turned into a place that is everything I detest or can\u2019t and won\u2019t condone,\u201d Renner laments.\n\n\u201cHow could this possibly be a real thing happening to an Academy Award-nominated actor?\u201d you might wonder. \u201cAre you sure the Bradley Hand post was not also written by one of the \u2018clever individuals\u2019 impersonating Renner?\u201d More likely, you may not have known there was such a thing as the official Jeremy Renner app to begin with. But let me assure you that this is all very, very real, and it is just one small chapter in the Summer of Jeremy Renner\u2019s Midlife Crisis.\n\nThe past few months have been a whirlwind for Renner. In April, he reprised his role as Marvel\u2019s least interesting Avenger in Avengers: Endgame, which went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. One would think that, in spite of the muted melancholia of living in Tony Stark\u2019s looming shadow for seven years, he would be feeling pretty good about himself after such profound box office success.\n\nYet since Endgame, Renner has kept himself busy by attempting to launch a \u201crip-off Imagine Dragons music career,\u201d as one Twitter user puts it, and starring in not one, not two, but three music video commercials for Jeep. The \u201cSummer of Jeep\u201d campaign features Renner doing his best country crooner impression in too-tight stonewashed jeans and an assortment of jackets with popped collars.\n\nIn one video, set to his song \u201cSign,\u201d Renner dances amidst sand dunes and drives a shiny blue Jeep wrangler through the desert. His other songs are called \u201cNomad\u201d and \u201cMain Attraction,\u201d and the accompanying videos exude similar, aggressively masculine dirty-tires-and-whiskey energy. The songs are not very good, but that is beside the point. With the release of four singles this summer alone, and the desperation of the sponsored music videos, Renner has joined the ranks of countless other critically favored actors who make the ill-fated decision to play out their rock star fantasies in middle age.\n\n\u201cOver the last decade or two,\u201d writes Shawn Cooke for the Outline, \u201cactors of a certain age\u2014including, but not limited to, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Costner, Idris Elba, David Duchovny, Russell Crowe, Johnny Depp, and so many more\u2014have covered similar ground. From afar, most of these men share a number of things in common: divorce, little discernible musical talent, and the protection fame can provide you from failure.\u201d Renner is, at the very least, in good company.\n\n\u201c \u2018The app has jumped the shark. Literally,\u2019 Renner writes in the post, demonstrating an apparent misunderstanding of both the phrase \u2018jumped the shark\u2019 and the word \u2018literally.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn between shooting commercials, the wannabe rocker also found time this summer to indulge his hobby of selling camping equipment to strangers on the internet. The Jeremy Renner Store on Amazon is a one-stop-shop for all of your archery needs, featuring products like \u201cScout Youth Bow Set\u201d and \u201cBarnett Carbon Crossbow Arrows.\u201d Customers can also stock up on sunscreen, flannels, and beef jerky. In one photo on the page, Renner sits over a campfire doing his best blue steel smolder, probably unwinding after a long day of off-roading in his Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nNo sign of crisis is more glaring, however, than the demise of the official Jeremy Renner app. Renner unveiled his app, developed by the company Escapex, in 2017 as a platform for sharing exclusive content and interacting directly with fans. With a feature allowing fans to earn and purchase stars to secure spots in top fan rankings, the app also served as a convenient way for Renner to earn a little extra cash. In the press release for \u201cJeremy Renner Official,\u201d as the app was called, Renner said, \u201cI\u2019m always looking for new ways to connect directly with my fans all over the world in our own shared environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Deadspin article titled, \u201cI Broke the Official Jeremy Renner App By Posting the Word \u2018Porno\u2019 On It,\u201d Vancouver-based comedian Stefan Heck claims responsibility for the downfall of the fan hub. Essentially, Heck discovered that the format of the app\u2019s push notifications makes it look like every message or comment reply is coming directly from Hawkeye himself. He first learned about this poorly conceived feature by jokingly commenting under a post on the app that he planned to spend his weekend \u201clooking at porno on my computer,\u201d to which one user (not Jeremy Renner) replied, \u201cNasty!! Not cool.\u201d Because of the aforementioned oversight, it appeared in the notification as though Renner was directly disapproving of Heck\u2019s affinity for porn.\n\nHeck shared the amusing screenshots on Twitter and then unplugged for a weekend camping trip, unaware of the chaos he inadvertently triggered. \u201cWhen I arrived back in civilization on a Sunday afternoon, the calm, welcoming landscape of the official Jeremy Renner app that I had grown to love over the past week appeared to have been irreversibly shattered,\u201d Heck writes in the Deadspin article. \u201cDozens of false Renners had sprouted up, sowing chaos and pretending to like porno. Legitimate Renner fans were rightfully confused and terrified.\u201d\n\nAnd so came the end of an era. The Jeremy Renner Official app is no longer available for purchase in the Apple App Store, but at least now the actor has more time to focus on writing the next great pop rock song about four-wheel drive.", "description": "The \u201cAvengers\u201d actor has spent months bouncing from one weird stunt to the next, from a Jeep-sponsored foray into country crooning to the sublime chaos of the Jeremy Renner app.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_844,w_1500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567834209/190907-julian-jeremy-renner-hero_lw2prz", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
