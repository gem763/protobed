(Jeremy Lock/Reuters)\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp defended her decision to give ex-cop and convicted murderer Amber Guyger a hug and a bible in the moments after the conclusion of last week\u2019s trial, in her first public interview after the event.\n\n\u201cFollowing my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug. I would not,\u201d Kemp told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I thought that God could forgive her and I said, \u2018Yes, God can forgive you and has,\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nIn the moments after Brandt Jean, the younger brother of Botham Jean, forgave Guyger in a now-viral moment, Kemp took time to speak to both Jean\u2019s family and Guyger. Kemp gave Guyger the Bible, saying \u201cyou just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this,\u201d before giving her a hug and continuing, \u201cyou haven\u2019t done as much as you think you have, and you can be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\u2019\n\nJUDGE EMBRACES GUYGER: Judge Kemp reads the bible to #AmberGuyger and hugs the convicted murderer after her sentencing.

Co-presidents Don Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor wrote that \u201chere, compassion crossed the line into coercion. And there can be few relationships more coercive than a sentencing judge in a criminal trial and a citizen accused and convicted of a crime.\u201d\n\nBut Kemp defended the display of religiosity during her recent interview, telling the AP that she was entirely motivated by a desire to prevent Guyger from falling into depression.\n\n\u201cIf she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u2019t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u201d", "description": "\u201cFollowing my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug.
