You say it\u2019s our behavior that\u2019s different; our brains are strikingly similar. Why?\n\nThis goes all the way back to Charles Darwin, who said that women are inferior because they have inferior brains and therefore they do not have the right to assume a powerful role in society. But the bottom line is there is no consistent pattern or structure which reliably characterizes the brain so that we could say, \u201cO.K., that\u2019s a female brain and that\u2019s a male brain.\u201d\n\nBut we don\u2019t have to be talking about inferior or superior brains\u2013just different brains.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

There are sex differences that we should pay attention to, but the power that\u2019s attributed to biology is what needs challenging. We have to pay more attention to how our experiences drive our brain architecture. It\u2019s a bit like trees that grow on windy plains. Their biological drivers make them grow upward, but the winds make them twist or grow branches on only one side.\n\nIs this what you mean by the \u201cpink and blue tsunami\u201d you write about in your book?\n\nYes, and it starts early. There was a BBC program called No More Boys and Girls, and they showed a classroom with a blue cupboard for the boys\u2019 coats and a pink cupboard for the girls\u2019, and no one knew why. It suggests that there\u2019s something so important about your sex that you have to hang your coat somewhere else.\n\nYou\u2019re open about the fact that you hate gender-reveal parties.\n\nI\u2019ve called them jaw-droppingly awful. Twenty weeks before children even arrive, people are already stressing about how important it is to be a boy or a girl.\n\nA lot of parents work hard to raise their kids without strict gender differences. Can that compete with the gender messages in the culture at large?\n\nChildren are tiny social sponges, and it starts early. Little boys quickly pick up the fact that they shouldn\u2019t cry\u2013that if they want to be on the football team, then, in British terms, stiff upper lip. Is that what you\u2019d call it in America?\n\n\u201cSuck it up\u201d is what we\u2019d say. It\u2019s a little more vulgar.\n\nYeah, but telling, actually.\n\nIf we can\u2019t lay gender differences off on brain structure, surely hormones play a role, don\u2019t they?\n\nThey\u2019re obviously powerful, yes, but they\u2019re responsive to the social environment. Testosterone, for example, is not the one-directional driver people say it is. The father of a newborn baby who is the primary caregiver of the baby will have a much lower testosterone level than the father who is not the primary caregiver.\n\nRightly or wrongly, much has been written about women\u2019s empathy and collegiality and how the world would be more peaceful if there were more female heads of state. Do you agree?\n\nI think the best way forward would be gender irrelevance. If good leaders need to be empathic, networking, collegial, then let\u2019s encourage that. If good leaders need to be assertive, thick-skinned, able to make rapid decisions, let\u2019s encourage that too.\n\nYou spend little time in your book on transgender people. How come?\n\nI don\u2019t do research in that area, and I think you need to be a genuine authority. I\u2019ve been contacted by transgender males or females who ask, \u201cCan you put me in a scanner and prove my brain is male or female?\u201d I say, I\u2019m sorry, there isn\u2019t any such thing. I can\u2019t say your brain is all pinks or blues. In fact, I wanted to call my book Fifty Shades of Gray Matter.\n\nWrite to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the September 16, 2019 issue of TIME.", "description": "British cognitive researcher Gina Rippon on the male and female brains, explored in her new book, 'Gender and Our Brains.'", "authors": ["Jeffrey Kluger"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gina-rippon-interview-gender-and-our-brains.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
