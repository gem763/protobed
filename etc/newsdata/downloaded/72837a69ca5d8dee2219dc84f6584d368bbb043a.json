Mueller III indicted a number of Russian officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile members of both parties have warned that the U.S. voting system remains vulnerable to foreign interference, Democrats have been especially frustrated that Republican leaders have not been more focused on advancing election security legislation \u2014 particularly in the Senate, which has yet to hold votes on several measures to increase investments and impose new security and election reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cI just would really like to know from my Republican friends, what\u2019s wrong with replacing outdated, vulnerable voting equipment? What is wrong with requiring paper ballot voting systems to ensure the integrity of our elections? What is wrong with enacting strong cybersecurity requirements for elections technology vendors and voting systems?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday during a floor speech before the vote. \u201cWe must be relentless in the defense of our democracy, fighting on all fronts to keep America safe.\u201d\n\nThe legislation would authorize more than $600 million to spend on updating voting equipment to comply with new standards between now and 2020, including requirements that voting machines produce a paper record, stay disconnected from the Internet and be produced in the United States. But Republicans have objected to the legislation, arguing that its provisions the interfere with the authority of states and localities to conduct their own elections, Rep. Jim Baird (R-Ind.) said Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) predicted that the bill stood \u201cno chance of being signed by the president.\u201d\n\nWhile the president has not formally issued a veto threat, the bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has played down the near-panic of Democrats and chided the media for not giving Trump more credit that the 2018 elections were apparently devoid of major security breaches.\n\nThis month, the Senate passed a measure to bar people who have interfered with American elections from obtaining visas to enter the United States, and last year, Congress approved $380 million to improve election security systems. But Senate Democrats\u2019 recent efforts to secure votes on legislation requiring campaigns to report foreign interference attempts or to improve voting systems similar to the House\u2019s measure have been stymied by the GOP.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe latest iteration of the election security debate on Capitol Hill is playing out as lawmakers prepare for a high-profile hearing with Mueller next month that is expected to be a pivotal moment in the ongoing investigations of the Trump campaign and possible ties to Russia.\n\nA significant portion of Mueller\u2019s report was dedicated to detailing the scope of Russian interference during the 2016 election and, after the election, the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. But his findings have inspired fierce partisan fighting, as Republicans defend claims by Trump that the report found no evidence of obstruction of justice or collusion with Russia and thus fully exonerated him.\n\nDespite opposition from Republican leaders, Democrats are promising to continue seeking passage of election security legislation, expressing little faith that Trump \u2014 who said in a recent interview that he might take information from a foreign source in 2020 if it were offered \u2014 will do enough to protect the integrity of elections against adversaries such as Russia.\n\n\u201cIf past is prologue, the American people will have little confidence that President Trump will stand up to Vladimir Putin,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during a news conference Wednesday. \u201cIf Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans fail to act, you know what they\u2019re going to be saying? \u2018Come on Putin, interfere in our elections.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The bill would require that voting machines produce a paper record and would dedicate money for the improvements after Russian interference in the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Hailey Fuchs", "National Political Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VS04hjbCjw_hNZpGa349lPSepGc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/67BZFQEZAMI6TELNTRQWA7MBSA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-27"}
