Juan Soto had a two-run single and the third run scored on an error as Washington took the lead in the eighth.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t have time to think. I was warming up the whole inning,\u201d said Hudson, who began the season with the Toronto Blue Jays and was acquired at the trade deadline. \u201cI just went in there and tried to get three outs.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals scored three runs in the last of the eighth to take over the lead and win.\n\nHudson told The Washington Times his wife is nine months pregnant with their third child.
