Users do not know what is in their e-cigarette or e-liquid solutions. However, many of the products or substances themselves can be modified by a supplier or user.\u201d\n\nRELATED: How Dangerous Is Vaping?

Schuchat said that because of those cases, they are not narrowing their investigation to only THC products.\n\n\u201cThe outbreak, currently, is pointing to a greater concern around THC-containing products,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t know whether the only risky substance for lung injury is the THC-containing products, and we didn\u2019t feel comfortable dropping the broader recommendation [to refrain from using e-cigarettes] yet.\u201d\n\nSchuchat also said that the CDC does \u201cnot know yet what exactly\u201d in e-cigarettes \u2014 THC- or nicotine-based \u2014 is making people sick, such as \u201cparticular solvents or adulterants.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: How Vaping Sent This Teenager to Rehab: \u2018I Did Not Understand the Severity of It\u2019\n\nAlso participating in the call were health officials from Wisconsin as well as Illinois, which has one of the highest numbers of lung illness cases in the country. They found that 66 percent of the cases in their states had used Dank Vapes brand cartridges.\n\nRELATED: Wisconsin Man, 20, Accused of Running Large-Scale Counterfeit THC Vaping Scheme: \u2018National Epidemic\u2019\n\nNationwide, the CDC found that the median age of patients is 23 years old, and two-thirds are male. Additionally, 54 percent of cases occurred in people under 25 years old.\n\nSchuchat said that the CDC \u201crecommends people refraining from use of e-cigarettes or vaping products, particularly those containing THC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see any more vaping-related illnesses, and as such, I want to stress that we at the CDC are concerned about the occurrence of life-threatening illness in otherwise healthy young people, reported from around the country.\u201d", "description": "Vaping-Related Illness Primarily from THC Vapes, Says CDC", "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CqLyLFUyAr3p5WgGPlFTMA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/29c37c88af12ca597dfd329475ad0459", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
