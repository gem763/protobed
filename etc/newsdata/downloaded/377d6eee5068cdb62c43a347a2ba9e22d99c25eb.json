Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity.\n\nTo understand what lead to the tweet, it is essential that you get a background. Elon Musk has previously been a victim of a fake Twitter account which impersonated him, promising to give away free ETH and BTC. Elon Musk has not been the only one as notable figures such as U.S President Donald Trump, Binance creator Changpeng Zhao, and even Vitalik Buterin have also fallen victims.\n\nSo it all started when Techmeme tweeted about Twitter\u2019s removal of 486 accounts accused of participating in malicious schemes. \u201cTwitter says it removed a further 486 accounts from engaging in \u201ccoordinated manipulation\u201d following the removal of 284 last week.\u201d\n\nElon Musk responded to the tweet with a commendation to Twitter:\n\n\u201cGreat action by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.\u201d\n\nElon Musk was fully aware of his impersonated account that had promised ETH to users. He responded to a joke from a twitter user who inquired about him giving out ETH with the response where he swore that the promised ETH is coming. The joke quickly spread like wildfire as the trend was flocked by Twitter users mostly crypto enthusiasts to join in the conversation. One particular tweet from @McMurche once again caught Musk attention.\n\n\u201cAny chance you can tell us anything about BFR\u2026 I am willing to pay 200ETH at this point.\u201d\n\nElon Musk then retweeted: \u201cAt this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam.\u201d\n\nElon Musk\u2019s tweet had previously helped improve the value of shares at Tesla when he promised to purchase the entire company for $82 billion. That\u2019s evidence that his tweets can be good publicity, precisely what Ethereum needs especially now that its price has fallen from $1,400 to about $300.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
