Here's how to check if you're eligible.", "language": "en", "text": "Saatva\n\nIf you have a Chase credit card and you're looking to purchase a new mattress, you may want to log in to your account and see if you're eligible for a Chase Offer with online mattress retailer Saatva.\n\nRead more: The best Chase Offers available now\n\nOffer details\n\nEligible Chase cardholders can get 10% back with Saatva, for a maximum discount of $130 back through this Chase Offer. The deal is available until October 10, 2019.\n\nThe terms of the offer state that for a purchase to be eligible for the discount, it must be made directly with Saatva, and you can't combine it with any other promotion or discount.\n\nI found this deal when I logged in to my Chase account and browsed the Chase Offers associated with my Chase Freedom Unlimited. That's not to say you couldn't see it attached to another Chase card, since Chase Offers vary from card to card and account holder to account holder. But since the Freedom Unlimited earns 1.5% back (or 1.5x Chase points) on every purchase, it would be one of my top picks to make a mattress purchase anyway, since mattresses don't qualify for bonus points on any of the cards I have.\n\nTo max out the discount and get $130 back, you'd have to spend at least $1,300. Saatva's queen mattresses start at $1,099, so depending on what size you select and any customizations you add, this could be easily attainable.\n\nIf you're considering a Saatva mattress, check out this review from Insider Picks:\n\nHow Chase Offers work\n\nChase Offers are targeted, meaning not every Chase cardholder will see the same selection of deals. Additionally, you won't necessarily see Chase Offers just because you have a Chase card; I have five Chase cards, and I only see offers on three of my accounts.\n\nTo use a Chase Offer, you need to add it to your card before you make the relevant purchase. Here's how you can find a Chase Offer and do that. Log in to your Chase account online. Go to the scroll bar on the left side. Go to the bottom and find Chase Offers underneath your accounts list. (Note that you might not see this option if you have business credit cards and you have \"Chase for Business\" on a banner at the top of the page.) Once you see an offer you want, click \"Add to card.\"\n\nYou can also find Chase Offers via the Chase mobile app.\n\nChase Offers are similar to Amex Offers in that they offer an extra incentive to use your credit card with specific retailers, but unlike Amex Offers, Chase Offers currently don't offer bonus points; you'll only earn cash back. There's usually a relatively conservative cap on how much cash back you can earn, too, but if you were already planning on making a purchase with Saatva or another participating retailer, an extra return on your spending is a nice bonus.\n\nIf you don't have a Chase card, here are some great ones to consider:\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred Card\u2014 This is one of our top picks for those who are new to travel rewards but want to start strong. The card has a $95 annual fee and is offering a sign-up bonus of 60,000 Chase points to new cardholders who spend $4,000 in the first three months. It earns 2x points on travel and dining.\n\nThis is one of our top picks for those who are new to travel rewards but want to start strong.

Chase Freedom Unlimited\u2014 This card has no annual fee and earns 1.5% cash back on every purchase with no cap on how much you can earn.

Chase Sapphire Reserve\u2014 This is the higher-end version of the Chase Sapphire Preferred, with a higher $450 annual fee. In exchange for that, you get higher points earning (3x on travel and dining vs. 2x) and up to a $300 travel credit each year.\n\nMore credit card coverage", "description": "If you have a Chase credit card and are eligible for this deal, you can get up to $130 off a purchase with mattress maker Saatva.", "authors": ["Sarah Silbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8251be2e22af73865a4613-480-240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
