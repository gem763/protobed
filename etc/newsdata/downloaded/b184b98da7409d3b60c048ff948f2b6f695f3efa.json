The party\u2019s momentum also comes as House Democrats lead an intense impeachment inquiry into Trump. Earlier this month, the RNC launched a \u201cStop the Madness\u201d national counter-impeachment campaign, targeting those House Democrats and vowing to cause \u201cchaos\u201d in response to the formal impeachment inquiry against the president.
