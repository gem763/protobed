Unlike them, he cultivates a comparatively liberal image on social issues, emphasizes his love of learning, and believes that Britain stands to benefit from at least some forms of diversity and immigration.\n\nEach camp seemingly has evidence on its side. But if this debate seems inconclusive, that is in good part because it is based on a misunderstanding of populism. Populists can come in all kinds of ideological flavors. Many, especially in Europe, are far-right. Some, especially in Latin America, are far-left. A few, like those who belong to Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, claim to eschew traditional political categories. What they all have in common is an opposition to the pluralism that is inherent to any functioning representative democracy: By claiming that they, and they alone, stand for the people, populist leaders around the world delegitimize any institution that might provide a check on their power. This is why populists so often turn against long-standing democratic traditions.", "description": "The new science of old age, an interview with Bill Clinton, how gangs took over prisons, debating dinosaurs with creationists, the art of being Lena Dunham, and more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/issues/2014/09/17/1014_Cover/original.jpg"}
