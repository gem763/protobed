Chickens and cats mingle on the road.\n\nBut this southwestern Chinese backwater has seen a glimpse of the future that even major U.S. cities such as Boston and Philadelphia still haven\u2019t experienced. As part of a publicity stunt two years ago, a government-owned wireless carrier briefly flipped on a superfast 5G cellular network to broadcast a song-and-dance performance from members of the Dong ethnic minority.\n\nThis is the audacity of Beijing\u2019s plan to roll out the next-generation wireless technology, which government leaders around the world say could spark the next industrial revolution.\n\nNot Phoning It In Analysts say China will lead in building and spending on cellular infrastructure. Wide-area 5G cellular sites by end of 2019 China 150,000 South Korea 75,000 U.S. 10,000 U.K. 2,500 Australia 1,000 Projected investment in cellular equipment in 2023 China $12 billion N. America 11\n\n5G, short for fifth-generation wireless, promises to be the heartbeat of the future. Expected to be 100 times faster than today\u2019s 4G networks, 5G\u2019s seamless connections could enable innovations such as driverless cars, robot-run factories and remote surgery. Because 5G is set to be embedded in so many fields of endeavor, the country that dominates the technology is likely to reap outsize profits, attract top-tier engineering talent and seize an edge in other critical future technologies, including weaponry.\n\nPresident Trump has said 5G is a race that the U.S. must win. But while American wireless carriers are leading in early deployment of the technology, some telecom-industry leaders say Beijing is poised to vault ahead in coming months.\n\nIn Tongguan, the 5G predecessor, 4G, has already improved life, allowing residents to video chat with relatives working in cities.

A local manager at one carrier estimated that even Tongguan, which lacks modern plumbing, could get the superfast networks by 2021.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to 5G,\u201d said Wu Shengmin, Tongguan\u2019s baby-faced village chief. His locale boasts superb service on current 4G systems that would be the envy in much of the U.S., courtesy of a nearby cellular tower nestled in a tree-covered peak.\n\nAs it did in constructing its high-speed rail network and Olympic Games infrastructure, the Chinese government has flexed its authoritarian, top-down power to clear red tape for a 5G project that it deems a national priority. It has directed regulators, provincial and local governments and its three major state-owned wireless carriers to work together.\n\nIn the U.S., where residents are prone to complain loudly about new cellphone towers going up next door, Washington\u2019s strategy is far from unified. The White House hasn\u2019t taken an important step to clear the military from valuable 5G airwaves, while measures from the Federal Communications Commission meant to fast-track 5G have actually created infighting among Washington, municipal governments and private wireless carriers, which are now suing one another.\n\nAmerican officials and wireless-industry leaders say they are clearing roadblocks and that the U.S. will maintain its lead in 5G, citing projections showing that a greater proportion of Americans will use the technology compared with the Chinese in a few years.\n\n\u201cBeijing can snap its fingers and put up untold cellular towers overnight, but in the long run, I have more faith in the U.S. system,\u201d said FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, the organization\u2019s point person on wireless infrastructure. \u201cBeijing is known for wasteful, debt-fueled spending on massive infrastructure projects. You don\u2019t have to look further than some of the ghost cities across China.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Chinese government granted 5G licenses to wireless carriers months earlier than anticipated. Days later, China Mobile Ltd. awarded its first major contracts for 5G equipment, with Chinese cellular-equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co. winning the most deals. The country\u2019s two smaller state-owned carriers said last month they were discussing jointly building and sharing a 5G system, a partnership that would save costs and speed construction. China\u2019s first 5G networks will go live within weeks.\n\n\u201cBy the end of this year, it\u2019s clear that China will have more 5G than any other place on the planet, and by the end of 2020, they\u2019ll have 100 million 5G users,\u201d said Chris Lane, a Bernstein analyst and former strategy director for Vodafone Group PLC, the world\u2019s No. 2 wireless carrier by subscribers behind China Mobile. \u201cThat\u2019s far more than any other country.\u201d\n\nChina Dials It Up China's 4G networks are nearly as good as U.S. ones, and its early 5G systems will probably eclipse America's in availability and, in nonurban areas, speed.

It might also help China\u2019s efforts to stem a scientific brain drain that has led some of its brightest students to study abroad and then stay there.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a scientist, where do you want to do it?\u201d said retired Gen. Robert Spalding, who was essentially forced out of the White House\u2019s National Security Council last year after proposing that the federal government play a bigger role in managing America\u2019s 5G build-out. \u201cYou want to do it where they\u2019re doing the research and have the money.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Can the U.S.\u2019s private-sector-led approach to next-generation 5G technology compete with China\u2019s government-led approach? Join the conversation below.\n\nBeing first to a new technology isn\u2019t always everything. The Soviet Union beat the U.S. to space but not in landing astronauts on the moon. In telecom, European countries pioneered cellular networks in the 1990s. Then American companies rallied to globally dominate the technology that powers today\u2019s mobile internet.\n\nAmerican government officials and telecom-industry leaders say the U.S. is beating China on 5G cellular sites available to consumers at the moment. Even if China pulls ahead on quantity, they say American networks may boast better quality, providing the higher speeds and reliability needed for the most complicated 5G technologies, such as remote surgery and virtual reality.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: The United States, not China, is leading the world in 5G,\u201d FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. \u201cRight now, we have commercial 5G deployments in numerous cities across our country, while China has none.\u201d\n\nThe merger of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. , approved by federal regulators but awaiting the outcome of a lawsuit by state governments, should help speed the U.S. build-out, FCC leaders say. Those two carriers, along with bigger rivals AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., have all launched 5G commercial service in several cities, and all the carriers plan coverage across the nation by the end of 2020, though, analysts say, on less infrastructure and largely on slower airwaves than in China.\n\nU.S. wireless providers are expected to outspend their Chinese counterparts on 5G capital expenses, $284 billion to $179.8 billion, from 2018 to 2025, according to data from GSMAi, the research arm of a global wireless trade group. But because it\u2019s so much cheaper to build 5G in China, that country is projected to have five to 10 times as many major cellular sites over the next five years, said Stefan Pongratz, an analyst at telecom research-firm Dell\u2019Oro Group.\n\nA young man checks his smartphone on the main road of the village. Photo: Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThese cellular sites, or base stations, contain antennas and other hardware and form the backbone of modern communications networks. Base stations typically sit atop stand-alone wireless towers along highways, or on poles on rooftops. These base stations work similarly to Wi-Fi routers, connected by cables to the internet and wirelessly transmitting signals to a person\u2019s cellphone.\n\nChina is on pace to have at least 150,000 5G wide-area base stations available for anyone to use, by the end of the year, more than any other country, said Bernstein\u2019s Mr. Lane. Bernstein estimates South Korea will place second with 75,000, while the U.S. will have 10,000 such sites by the year\u2019s end.\n\nIn the U.S., wireless carriers spend billions in Washington-run auctions for radio frequencies, or spectrum, for 5G. Then they spend billions more to lease real estate for cellular towers. Then they spend billions on top of that to build the actual towers and put hardware on them.\n\nBeijing gives its carriers the spectrum and real estate\u2014the government decides land-use rights in China\u2014at a low price. And it is employing strategies that make efficient use of both.\n\nTwo young women in Tongguan watch a streaming video about make-up. Photo: Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor the most part, Washington has set aside two chunks of spectrum for 5G. One lets a cellular tower beam a signal over miles, but at speeds not much faster than 4G. The other chunk, which U.S. wireless carriers are focusing on, lets a tower zip data at superfast rates, but over only a few hundred feet.\n\nChina\u2019s telecom regulator focuses on a third chunk, what telecom executives and experts call the Goldilocks of spectrum: airwaves that blend fast speeds with transmission distances of about half a mile. One cellular tower in China can cover the same area as 100 high-speed American ones.\n\n\u201cSpectrum is very important in determining the costs of 5G,\u201d said Huawei global vice president Daisy Zhu. \u201cThe U.S. has a problem with spectrum.\u201d\n\nThe military and video-broadcasting satellite operators, among other organizations, hold much of these coveted middle frequencies in the U.S. A Pentagon advisory board in April suggested that the military share this spectrum, while satellite operators propose selling some of theirs to wireless carriers for billions of dollars.\n\nOnly Sprint holds a significant chunk of these airwaves in the U.S. Mr. Carr, the FCC commissioner, said his agency is working with the Pentagon and satellite operators to free up this spectrum, and that U.S. wireless carriers could eventually have more of these frequencies than Chinese ones.\n\nTo carry the 5G signals, China is reusing existing 4G towers, requiring carriers to share towers and repurposing lampposts and other street fixtures.\n\nVillage boys playing online video games on their smartphones. Photo: Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe FCC last year set up strict \u201cshot clock\u201d deadlines to encourage local governments and utilities to share facilities with wireless carriers, but some telecom executives say the rules haven\u2019t helped much. \u201cThere\u2019s an unwillingness to share by the utilities,\u201d said Ken Schmidt, head of Steel in the Air, a wireless-infrastructure valuation firm. \u201cWithout the sharing, it\u2019s going to significantly limit the expansion of 5G outside dense urban areas for the next five years.\u201d Mr. Schmidt said carriers are finding it faster just to build new towers.\n\nChinese carriers will also build new towers, which shouldn\u2019t take long once they identify the ideal land plots. \u201cIf it\u2019s public use, we will just build there,\u201d said Ouyang Xintian, a China Mobile senior technician, in an interview in Tongguan\u2019s council building, next to one of the elaborate multitiered wooden towers that dot the region.\n\nChina Tower, the state-owned enterprise in charge of building cellular towers for the three Chinese wireless carriers, says it mostly uses state-owned land for ground sites.\n\nIn the U.S., about 95% of the grounds and rooftops suitable for cellular towers are privately owned, Mr. Schmidt said, with the average rent for a ground lease around $1,300 a month. The timeline from finding a location to having a working tower typically takes between one and six months, but in rare cases can stretch to two years, he said. The biggest delay is obtaining zoning permits from municipal governments, despite FCC efforts to speed up the process.\n\nA 4G transmission tower looms over the village of Tongguan. Photo: Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for The Wall Street Journal\n\nA typical steel cellular tower costs $80,000 in the U.S. Because China\u2019s telecom regulator mandates its three carriers to share towers, it is common to see three sets of antennas stacked on top of each other. They also cut equipment and energy costs by sharing power converters, the fiber-optic cables that provide connectivity and other equipment on or around the tower.\n\nAmerican wireless carriers also share. About 60 to 70% of U.S. towers have more than one tenant, Mr. Schmidt said, with an average of 1.5 tenants per tower. But he said carriers often don\u2019t want to share the fiber-optic cable, which forces rivals to go through the expensive process of digging new lines for wires.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the cost of the telecom equipment itself, which includes the radios hanging on towers that wirelessly communicate with phones, as well as the giant routers and switches in climate-controlled rooms that make sure data gets to the right place. Telecom carriers spend $80 billion a year on it, and Huawei is the world\u2019s biggest maker of the stuff by far. Its hardware is often more advanced and cheaper\u2014by 20% or more\u2014than equipment from Western rivals, say European wireless-carrier executives.\n\nWashington has effectively banned Huawei from major U.S. networks over concerns that the company can\u2019t refuse orders from Beijing to spy or conduct cyberattacks. Huawei denies it does the bidding of the Chinese government.\n\nCost savings and reduced red tape mean that wireless networks can affordably serve Tongguan village and its surrounding province, Guizhou, an infamously poor, mountainous region in the south akin to the West Virginia of China. Chinese officials believe that providing wireless service promotes better connectivity and economic opportunity, helping to alleviate poverty\u2014a key goal of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n4G was available across 97.3% of Guizhou in the first half of 2019, according to Ookla, a Seattle internet-speed research firm. West Virginia had 85.3%.\n\nWu Yinglei, a local entrepreneur, quit his job in the provincial capital and moved back to Tongguan to open a business selling food products online.

He uses his smartphone to sell the wares via an online store on China\u2019s ubiquitous WeChat app.\n\n\u201c4G already makes our life better. In the past, we were isolated. Now our products and sauce are in high demand,\u201d said Mr. Wu, now 35 years old, adding that he looks forward to 5G \u201cso we can connect with the world.\u201d\n\n\u2014Xiao Xiao\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "description": "The super-fast wireless technology 5G is expected to revolutionize everything from driving to surgery, and everybody wants to be first.
