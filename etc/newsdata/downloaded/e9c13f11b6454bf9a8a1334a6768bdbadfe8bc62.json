Will it be at the \u201cfull retirement age\u201d of 66? Perhaps you\u2019ll be able to retire early, at the age of 55.\n\nUnfortunately, most millennials think they\u2019ll be working until they die. On Twitter, the hashtag \u201c#MillennialRetirementPlans\u201d recently started trending, prompting a flurry of 20- and 30-somethings to proclaim their outlook on retirement. Needless to say, the results were depressing.\n\n\u201cWhy is this on trending? We all know we'll never be able to retire,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n\u201cMost of us will die early from the lack of a universal health care system,\u201d another tweet stated. \u201cThe rest of us will never be able to retire from working our multiple jobs to pay off our massive student debt in an economy where wages have not kept up with inflation.\u201d\n\nVery few tweets show millennials with concrete retirement plans, like contributing to an employer sponsored plan like a 401(k), or an individual retirement account (IRA).\n\nWork myself to death since healthcare is a debt sentence & social security won\u2019t exist by the time I\u2019m of \u201cretiring age\u201d. Or just wait for the nuclear apocalypse. #millennialretirementplans pic.twitter.com/fsadjbOn0l \u2014 Lumppytaters (@Lumppytaters) September 17, 2019\n\nBut the anxiety over retirement isn\u2019t exclusive to the millennial generation \u2014 most Americans don\u2019t have enough saved for retirement. A 2018 study from Northwestern Mutual found that 1 in 3 Americans had less than $5,000 in retirement savings, while 21% had nothing saved for their retirement at all.\n\nAnd with health care costs on the rise, the student loan debt crisis topping $1.5 trillion, and the Social Security trust fund set to run out of money in 2035, most millennials feel that the possibility of retirement is just out of reach.\n\nMillennials graduated from college into a recession, but even with an economy growing over the past decade, and an unemployment rate at a 49-year-low, not all Americans have recovered.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), wage growth hasn\u2019t bounced back to pre-recession levels, and remains fairly low and flat. In August, wages grew by 3.2% over the year \u2014 below targets of 3.5-4%. And most of whatever gains were made in the last decade of economic recovery went to the wealthy.\n\nOn a national level across all races, the top 1% captured 85% of post-recession income growth from 2009 to 2013, according to an Economic Policy Institute study on income inequality. In some states, they recovered 100% of those gains.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau shows the median age in the U.S has increased by a year to 38.2 years from 2010 to 2018. The date released Thursday, June 20, 2019, comes as many baby boomers have been hitting the retirement age in recent years. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) More\n\nAnd Americans are feeling it. A survey from Bankrate shows that nearly a quarter of Americans are \u201cworse off\u201d now than they were before the recession.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that millennials are resigned to work until they die.\n\nPresidential hopefuls Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders hope to expand Social Security, so that the government pension is funded beyond 2035. Under Warren\u2019s proposal, Social Security payouts would increase by $200, or $2,400 each year. Both candidates aim to tax the rich to fund the plan.\n\nAnd for millennials, there is still time to save for retirement. Financial planner Harold Evensky says the key is planning \u2014 and being realistic.\n\nNever retire because I need employer-sponsored health insurance to afford the insulin I need to stay alive. #millennialretirementplans \u2014 Laura Marston (@Kidfears99) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cSave more and expect to work longer,\u201d he said. \u201cBe realistic about what your goals are. If you want to have a life now and not put your axe to the grindstone all the time, then be realistic about what your retirement is going to look like.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarket returns are going to be extremely modest over the next 10 years, so I don\u2019t think you can be bailed out on returns,\u201d says Evensky. But if you don\u2019t mind leading a \u201clow-cost lifestyle\u201d now, then it\u2019s realistic to expect in your retirement you can join golf clubs, and go on trips, he told Yahoo Finance.", "description": "Most millennials believe they'll die before they are ever able to retire.", "authors": ["Kristin Myers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vae0UO474lFf96tijeFlVA--~B/aD0yNDg5O3c9MzcwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/912121c0-db13-11e9-b7fd-0ad3f880128c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
