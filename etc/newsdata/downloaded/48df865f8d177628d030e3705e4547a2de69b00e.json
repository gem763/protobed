And it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re not overweight.\u2019\n\nBut these DNA tests are widely used by geneticists, so surely my results are worth something?\n\nDr Yeo says: \u2018These tests are great for finding out about your genealogy \u2013 what percentage Ashkenazi Jew you might be, for example \u2013 but that\u2019s about it.\u2019\n\nDr Dan Reardon, founder and CEO of FitnessGenes, says: \u2018The results reflect whichever goal you set, for example weight loss, hence the calorie deficit.\n\n'BMI is a crude measure of health that doesn\u2019t account for muscle or body-fat percentage. However, we will take your concerns on board and offer extra advice for people at the low weight end of the scale.\u2019\n\nThe verdict\n\nI might give the exercise bit a go (I didn\u2019t need a DNA test to tell me that my aversion to the gym might need addressing).\n\nBut the \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 diet advice? I\u2019ll give it a miss.", "description": "DNA-based regimes have become something of a trend, claiming to be the latest and most medically advanced way to get into shape, but are they worth it, writes EVE SIMMONS?", "authors": ["Nutribabble", "Eve Simmons"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/04/03/49C69BBA00000578-0-image-a-23_1520132543939.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-04"}
