Okay, fine, Pollard, a registered medical assistant, told the two women. She would walk with them to the neighborhood Harris Teeter grocery store.\n\nCwiklinski is alive today because she did.\n\nAD\n\nNeighbors thought they witnessed a tragedy. Then a sign appeared: \u2018You Saved My Life!\u2019\n\nAt a ceremony held Thursday morning at the Engine Co. 8 firehouse in Southeast, firefighters, residents and members of the press gathered to hear D.C. officials recount the dramatic tale of neighborhood heroics: how Cwiklinski suffered a sudden heart attack around 8 p.m. on Aug. 12, just blocks from his home, and crashed his car in the middle of the street. How concerned strangers spilled from their houses and porches, praying, crying and calling 911.\n\nAD\n\nHow Pollard \u2014 midway to the Harris Teeter \u2014 spotted Cwiklinski, still sprawled in the driver\u2019s seat, looking as if he didn\u2019t have a pulse. Drawing on her medical training, Pollard, who is CPR-certified, pulled Cwiklinski from the car, jumped atop his chest and started madly pumping, up-and-down-and-up-and-down, until paramedics arrived.\n\n\u201cJoe was actually turning colors in that car,\u201d Pollard said in an interview Thursday. \u201cI was just like, \u2018Oh, my God, got to pump, got to pump.\u2019 \u2026 It was exhausting, but the neighbors encouraging me gave me strength to keep going: harder, harder, harder.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, D.C. Fire and EMS personnel arrived and transported Cwiklinski to the nearest hospital, where doctors concluded Pollard\u2019s quick work had saved his life. But Cwiklinski had no idea whom to thank \u2014 and anxious neighbors did not know the final fate of the man they had worked so hard to keep from death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA few days after Cwiklinski got out of the hospital, his longtime partner, Tom Kai \u2014 who had been riding in the passenger seat that night \u2014 suggested a solution: Why not post a thank-you sign near the site of the accident? The couple decided to tie a single, laminated piece of white paper to a tree. \u201cGood Samaritans of Potomac Ave \u2014 You saved My Life!\u201d it read in part, before concluding: \u201cForever Grateful, Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea how to get the message out \u2014 I didn\u2019t know who these people were,\u201d Kai said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not digitally savvy. So I thought, maybe a sign would work.\u201d\n\nIt did.\n\nA stranger snapped a picture of the sign and posted it to Twitter, which led to social media speculation, then press coverage, then the involvement of D.C. Fire and EMS \u2014 and, finally, the award ceremony Thursday. After a brief speech by D.C. Fire and EMS medical director Robert Holman, Cwiklinski listened \u2014 head bowed and hands clasped \u2014 as D.C. Council staffer Nichole Opkins recounted how medical personnel had to administer two rounds of electric shocks to keep his heart going.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen he took the podium.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize all of the things that had to be done to get me to this point right now,\u201d Cwiklinski said.\n\nHe glanced sideways to where Pollard stood, a few feet away, in purplish-blue medical scrubs and shiny clogs. They had met formally for the first time that morning.\n\nAn airman was picking up an award for heroism. But first, he saved a baby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still absorbing it,\u201d he added. \u201cAll I can really think of to say right now is thank you.\u201d\n\nOnce the applause died down, Cwiklinski reached into a blue plastic box and handed thick medallions \u2014 known as \u201cCardiac Arrest Save Coins\u201d and granted only to those who\u2019ve \u201creturned a pulse to the pulse-less,\u201d Holman said \u2014 to every person who participated in his rescue. One by one, he shook hands with and murmured his thanks to Sgt. Jason Lerch, EMS Capt. Jason Sadler, and firefighters Joshua Bazara, George Hayden, Laurie Parrish, John Anderson and Brandon Cober.\n\nWhen Pollard stepped forward to receive her coin, Cwiklinski traded the handshake for a hug.\n\nLater, Pollard said meeting the man whose life she saved felt surreal. It was hard, almost impossible, to believe her hands \u2014 \u201cthese hands,\u201d she said, holding them up \u2014 kept Cwiklinski from the lip of the grave.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never saved a life before, and to see someone that you actually saved their life \u2026 it\u2019s like a miracle, and it\u2019s still a shock to me,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cPeople are all saying, \u2018You\u2019re getting an award!\u2019 and, you know, my real reward is Joe.\u201d\n\nAfter the ceremony, Pollard was sitting beside Cwiklinski in the firehouse, munching on kruchen, a Hungarian version of coffee cake, stuffed with peaches and apples, that Cwiklinski baked the night before as a special treat for his saviors.\n\nCwiklinski loves to cook all kinds of things, he said, especially \u201cthe unusual recipes.\u201d Kruchen has been a favorite since childhood, though he prefers to make the pastry with seeded grapes, not apples and peaches. (Harris Teeter only had the seedless variety when he went shopping this week, Cwiklinski explained.)\n\nAD\n\nThey met at a GM plant. On their wedding day, they joined the picket line.\n\nPollard looked at the former teacher, white-haired and grinning slightly in a floral shirt.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t the dead guy I was doing all that to on that day \u2014 this is not the guy!\u201d she said, putting down her pastry. \u201cAnd to see that you are that guy is amazing.\u201d\n\nCwiklinski said he finds Pollard a little startling, too.\n\n\u201cThis is the person, this is it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is somebody who really did this, and this is the person.\u201d\n\nThey both shook their heads. Firefighters and neighbors filed by, snagging slices of kruchen. The question hung unspoken: What if Pollard hadn\u2019t agreed to walk to the grocery store that Monday?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Cwiklinski said.\n\nAD\n\nAlmost at the same time, Pollard chimed in: \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy this man put up billboards proclaiming, \u2018Amy, I love you more!\u2019\n\nIs the world an exciting or a terrifying place? Your answer can powerfully shape your life and your political views, new research says.\n\nEmployees at this Florida bar pulled about $14,000 off the walls \u2014 and they\u2019re donating it to Hurricane Dorian relief\n\nAD", "description": "In early August, strangers banded together to save the life of a D.C. man who suffered a sudden heart attack.
