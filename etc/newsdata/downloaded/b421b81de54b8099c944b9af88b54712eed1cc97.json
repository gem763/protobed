At that time, several disability agencies called for statewide early warning systems, a toll-free emergency hotline and charging stations.\n\nNow, almost 20 years later, Wrong and fellow advocates are asking for a lot of the same things.\n\nPG&E is setting up grant programs that allow independent living centers in the state to give residents hotel vouchers and backup power, but Wrong says this won\u2019t help everyone.\n\n\u201cWhat we need are more resources specifically from PG&E because they can certainly afford it,\u201d she says. \u201cPG&E needs to be providing local governments with resources to be able to reach residents. We need very hyper-local, neighborhood by neighborhood-based resources.\u201d\n\nTo help the community through the outages, Wrong says people are raising funds and developing mutual aid networks to support people who need it instead of relying on local government or PG&E.\n\nThere are about 20 volunteers around East Oakland fielding requests from individuals and families who need hotel vouchers or backup power, she says.\n\nPeople in the San Francisco Bay Area with respiratory issues may need someone to help seal windows and doors in their home to keep out traveling smoke, she says.\n\nUntil PG&E gives the community the support it needs, she says people who aren\u2019t disabled should step up and support folks who need it.\n\n\u201cBe allies. Find out what the community needs,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need for everybody to join with us so that nobody is left behind in these kinds of scenarios.\u201d\n\nAshley Locke produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Tinku Ray.
