It has 300 loyal volunteers.", "language": "en", "text": "She interprets canine social behavior for some of the volunteers, alerting them to brewing playground brawls and dismissing some snarls and bared teeth as signs of dogs simply being dogs.\n\nPetroni, 50, spends upward of 20 hours a week leading play groups at Lost Dog when she\u2019s not at her full-time professional job as a consultant on global women\u2019s rights. She is part of a group of nearly 300 active volunteers with Lost Dog, which welcomes animals into the D.C. metro area from crowded municipal shelters and places them in permanent homes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt has been an amazing and life-changing experience for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t ever see not coming here.\u201d\n\nSince 2001, Lost Dog has facilitated the adoptions of more than 30,000 cats and dogs or about 1,500 dogs and 500 cats annually. The rescue has a staff of nine employees, only four of them full time, so it\u2019s the volunteers, with their distinct skill-sets and wide-ranging interests, who keep the wheels turning.\n\n\u201cThe more you help, the more you figure out other ways to help,\u201d said Kristin Johnson, 37, a longtime volunteer and play group veteran.\n\nOrganization leaders say it\u2019s Lost Dog\u2019s people-centered approach that keeps volunteers coming from as far away as Centreville and Baltimore to spend time at the shelter.\n\nAD\n\nThere are couples who spend date nights walking kennel dogs, families that take pups on \u201cdogventures\u201d (hiking trips into Virginia parks or overnighters in comfortable homes), high school students who handle animals at adoption events, and people who bring plush toys to sit with traumatized dogs newly arrived from stressful environments.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson, a digital project director, said she joined the community as an adoption-event handler about nine years ago. But for the past several years, she also has been volunteering one night a week ensuring all the dogs are settled in for the night and the facility is closed up.\n\nThe kennel is a home-away-from-home of sorts for many volunteers, including clusters of German au pairs, such as Katharina Sommer, who find comfort at the rescue.\n\nAD\n\nSommer, 24, who lives with a family in Bethesda, says she misses her Doberman back in Cologne.\n\n\u201cI need my cuddles,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe visits Lost Dog three times a week to walk dogs and sees it \u201cas a therapeutic thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I get there I can see my friends and interact with the dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just calms me down.\u201d\n\nMother and daughter team Emma Gregory and Kiera Sheppard have been volunteering at the kennel for a year. The Arlington pair, both British citizens, initially became involved in the rescue \u201cbecause we wanted something to do together,\u201d said Sheppard, 22.\n\nIt soon became a near-daily activity for Sheppard, a recent college graduate, and Gregory, 42, who works at the British Embassy. Together they care for dogs at the kennel, foster dogs in their home, help out at adoption events and orient new volunteers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe spend all our family dinners talking about dogs we\u2019ve fostered and what\u2019s happening over at the kennels,\u201d Sheppard said.\n\nShe stays connected with the larger group through the rescue\u2019s Facebook volunteer page, often posting about one of her foster dogs. The feed is filled with photos of puppies tumbling around a foster family\u2019s backyard, dogventure narratives and comments about individual kennel residents.\n\nKennel volunteer activities include cleaning cat cages and socializing frightened cats. Other volunteers conduct new animal intake, manage the front office, fold towels, administer medication and bathe puppies. Also poop scooping \u2014 so much poop.\n\nAD\n\nOne critical volunteer job at the kennel is transporting animals to weekend adoption events at places such as PetSmart and Petco. Dogs and cats need to be picked up from other shelters or the airport.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s where Ken Pezzella comes in. The 54-year-old finance executive spends much of his volunteer time behind the wheel of the rescue\u2019s large vans, playing Latin or classical music on the radio to get his crated passengers to settle down. He prefers jobs such as driving, shoveling snow \u2014 and showing up at 5 a.m. to process new animals.\n\n\u201cThe people at Lost Dog have totally embraced me,\u201d Pezzella said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to describe it as therapy, but it restores my faith in humanity. I hear the other members saying yes, so I say yes.\u201d\n\nBarbara Hutcherson, 52, Lost Dog\u2019s executive director and a former high school teacher, spends about 60 hours a week at the kennel.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their niche,\u201d she said. \u201cSomehow it all works together to make a community. We do animal rescue very well, but we are so much more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat keeps her going is seeing how important Lost Dog is not only to the animals, but to the community of volunteers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people tell me that a foster dog or cat helped them get through a tragedy in their lives, and that it made all the difference to be connected to that animal and these people,\u201d she said. \u201cI've had parents come to me after their kids have graduated college and tell me that their child really struggled in high school and that volunteering with Lost Dog on the weekends was like a lifeline.\u201d\n\nHutcherson says she attends animal-care conferences across the country, and when she talks about her volunteers, people are almost always surprised.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot everyone\u2019s been able to build what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they ask me, \u2018How did you do that?\u2019 I don't always know how to answer. People want to help and they want to be part of something. When you give them opportunities, tell them you value their presence, and trust that they want to do the right thing, they usually come through.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlexandra Rockey Fleming is a D.C.-area journalist.
