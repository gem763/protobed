Being able to show you how my business started 10 years ago and that it's not only about posting a nice selfie was of extreme importance to me.\"\n\nIn the documentary, written and directed by Italian writer and filmmaker Elisa Amoruso, Ferragni talks about her work, which now includes a fashion brand and beauty classes, sharing personal moments such as her pregnancy worries and son's birth online as well as dealing with negative comments.\n\nFamily members, colleagues, academics, fans as well as designers like Alberta Ferretti, Jeremy Scott and Dior's Maria Grazia Chiuri, talk about Ferragni as a person and businesswoman.\n\nAs well as highlighting the power of social media stars, the film also looks at Ferragni's split with a former boyfriend and business partner and her 2018 nuptials to Italian rapper Federico Lucia, which was dubbed \"Italy's royal wedding\".\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Additional reporting by Cristiano Corvino; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "Fashion came to the Venice Film Festival on Wednesday when Instagram star Chiara Ferragni took to the red carpet for the premiere of a documentary about her rise to global stardom as a digital influencer.
