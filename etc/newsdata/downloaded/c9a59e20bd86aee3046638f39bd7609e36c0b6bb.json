Even through intense treatment, she would smile and find a way to have fun in the hospital -- and often times, it was through dancing.\n\n\u201cMaddie, in true toddler form, battled her cancer the only way she knew how, which was through the powers of imagination, dancing and singing,\u201d her father, Scott Kramer, told \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\nSadly, Maddie lost her battle with cancer in January 2018.\n\nScott and Pammy Kramer\n\nHer parents, Scott and Pammy Kramer, founded Dancing While Cancering in October 2018 in memory of their daughter.\n\nTheir goal is to bring joy to the in-patient hospital experience for kids with cancer.\n\nAs parents of a child who had cancer, they know how troubling a diagnosis can be for both the family and the child.\n\n\u201cThe time right after a child is diagnosed with cancer is extremely dark and overwhelming, and we just want to bring some smiles to that moment,\u201d Pammy Kramer told \u201cGMA\u201d\n\nScott and Pammy Kramer\n\nDancing While Cancering brings joy to hospitals by providing kids who have been recently diagnosed with cancer with a Smile Pack, a bright green backpack filled with goodies such as decorations and musical instruments to brighten up their hospital rooms.\n\nItems in the Smile Packs vary depending on the age of the patient, but every Smile Pack includes a wireless speaker so patients can enjoy their favorite music.\n\n\u201cIn so many ways, the Smile Pack is an extension of what brought Maddie joy,\u201d Scott Kramer said.\n\nScott and Pammy Kramer\n\nAlthough Maddie loved all music, Scott Kramer shared that he\u2019d often find Maddie dancing to her favorites, such as Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cShake It off\u201d and Beyonce\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because they have cancer doesn't mean that they shouldn't have fun,\u201d Pammy Kramer said.\n\nToday, Dancing While Cancering brings joy and smiles to 11 hospitals across seven states with the Smile Packs. The organization also launched a #BattleWithJoy campaign on Instagram to inspire other kids and families who may be going through a hard time.\n\n\u201cWe often get asked how did we get through it. What got us through was Maddie. Despite taking chemo that was making her feel terrible, she was there dancing and singing and living in the moment. And we should all learn from Maddie and these awesome kids that that\u2019s the way to live life,\u201d Pammy Kramer said.\n\n\u201cJust live it up.\u201d", "description": "Scott and Pammy Kramer founded Dancing While Cancering in October 2018, months after their young daughter, Maddie, lost her battle with a rare form of cancer.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/maddie-kramer-01-ht-jef-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
