REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index was within striking distance of a record high hit in July after trading above 3,000 points in the previous session on signs of progress toward resolving the spat between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\n\nBiogen\u2019s shares surged 36% after the drugmaker announced a surprise plan to file for U.S. regulatory approval for its Alzheimer\u2019s treatment.\n\nThe wider healthcare index .SPXHC clocked the biggest increase among the major S&P 500 sectors.\n\nStrong corporate earnings since last week have provided some respite to equity markets, which were rattled over the past few months by geopolitical worries and a slowing global economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty good season so far, but I always caution people the early announcers have a tendency to be better than the later ones, so those numbers come down throughout the season,\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nOf the 98 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, over 80% of them topped Street estimates. Still, analysts project the first earnings contraction since 2016 against the backdrop of a slowing domestic economy and the prolonged trade war.\n\nProcter & Gamble Co (PG.N) gained 3.1%, lifting the consumer staples sector .SPLRCS by 0.5%, after raising full-year forecasts and beating Wall Street estimates.\n\nHarley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) jumped 5% as it beat quarterly profit expectations, while United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) gained 0.7% on a forecast raise.\n\nHowever, the Dow struggled for direction after a 2.8% decline in the shares of McDonald\u2019s Corp (MCD.N) and a 7.3% drop in Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) on poor results.\n\nThe threat of tariffs on toys imported from China hit toymaker Hasbro Inc\u2019s (HAS.O) quarterly profit as shipping and warehousing costs soared. Its shares fell 14.6% and were the biggest decliners among S&P 500 companies.\n\nAt 10:08 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 11.69 points, or 0.04%, at 26,839.33, while the S&P 500 .SPX was up 5.98 points, or 0.20%, at 3,012.70. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 18.48 points, or 0.23%, at 8,181.47.\n\nAmong other stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) was trading 6.8% higher on positive data from a late-stage lung cancer trial. Shares of rival Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) slipped 4.7%.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.04-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 32 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 35 new lows.", "description": "The S&P 500 rose on Tuesday, bolstered by gains in Biogen and upbeat earnings reports that eased concerns over the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war, but the Dow Jones index was pressured by a drop in McDonald's and Travelers.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443744874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0ZM", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
