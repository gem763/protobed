This is a natural treasure. It needs to be protected, not exploited,\u201d warns Fytilis.", "description": "Kyparissia (Greece) (AFP) \u2013 Freed from its eggshell by a volunteer, the tiny turtle hatchling clambers across a pebble-strewn sandy Greek beach in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/b0c66e_one-in-000-tiny-loggerhead-turtle-hatchlings-survive-med-biggest-nesting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
