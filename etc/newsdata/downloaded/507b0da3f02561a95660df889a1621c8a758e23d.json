Not a lot of people know who I am off of it. Me being here \u2026 you\u2019ll learn who I am more and kind of learn my personality a little bit, see the guy I am. I\u2019m very confident. I love the game of football. I love to have fun.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe joins former Jaguars Blake Bortles and Blake Ramsey in a locker room that Coach Sean McVay said \u201cwill suit him well.\u201d The buzz, according to Ramsey, is that \u201cthe culture here is dope. I can\u2019t wait to be a part of it. I can\u2019t wait to be able to be myself on and off the field, and just help the organization in every way that I can.\u201d\n\nHe and Fowler played on the Jaguars team that lost to the Patriots in the 2017 AFC championship game. \u201cI know Dante, of course,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI know Aaron Donald is on this defense, the best player in the NFL. Eric Weddle is back there. I\u2019ve got to get to know the guys a little bit more, of course, just now getting here.\"\n\nBehind him is the sideline fight with Coach Doug Marrone during the second game of the season and so, too, is Ramsey\u2019s problems with the team. One of the best cornerbacks in the league, Ramsey left the team for the birth of his daughter in Tennessee and, after returning, had a back ailment that caused him to miss the Jaguars\u2019 past three games. It became increasingly clear that Ramsey, who turns 25 next week, badly wanted out. On Tuesday, the Jaguars cut their losses with a player who has intercepted nine passes (returning one for a touchdown) and broken up 45 others in his 51 games in the league.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 3-3 Rams gave up a lot for him, including a fourth-round pick in 2021. Ramsey has been a lightning rod at times, including during training camp in 2018 when he unloaded on essentially every NFL quarterback in a GQ interview. Among the things Ramsey said: Josh Allen \u201cis trash.\u201d Jimmy Garoppolo is \u201call schemes, but I guess you could say he\u2019s good.\u201d Ben Roethlisberger \u201cain\u2019t all that.\u201d Joe Flacco \u201csucks.\u201d Matt Ryan\u2019s \u201coverrated.\u201d Dak Prescott seems to fall in between because his offense relies on Ezekiel Elliott: \u201cHe\u2019s good. He\u2019s all right. He\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nSome quarterbacks, Ramsey allowed, were pretty good, guys such as Derek Carr, Russell Wilson, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Philip Rivers, Deshaun Watson, Carson Wentz and Aaron Rodgers. Kirk Cousins is a \u201chell of a competitor\u201d who \u201ccoming off play action\u201d is the \u201cbest quarterback in the league.\u201d\n\nHis new quarterback, Jared Goff, has struggled this season and Ramsey called him \u201caverage to above average\u201d in that interview. \u201cHe reminds me of Jimmy Garoppolo a little bit,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cYear one, he wasn\u2019t good. He wasn\u2019t even good enough to earn his own starting role. Like, if you the number one pick, you expected to start now. Period. He wasn\u2019t ready to do that. He wasn\u2019t able to do that. Then when he did get in, he didn\u2019t really do that good. But in his second year, they got a new offensive coordinator. Your offensive coordinator is just your brainiac. When we played them, it felt like his offensive coordinator was drawing up perfect plays and then he was hitting the open man. For what his team ask [sic] him to do, yeah, he\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRamsey made it clear when training camp began last summer that he badly wanted a reworked contract, pulling up for the first day of work in an armored vehicle. The season had hardly began when reports surfaced that he wanted a trade, a demand that owner Shad Khan at least publicly refused to satisfy. Now, all that is behind Ramsey.\n\n\u201cI was overjoyed,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI was super, super excited. A fresh start and a fresh start in a place like L.A., with the culture that I\u2019ve heard about here. I\u2019m a young guy still, everybody around here is kind of young. I feel like it\u2019ll be a little bit more understanding.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll play this weekend against the Falcons if his balky back allows. At least one former teammate ridiculed his ailment after the trade went down. \u201cOh, my back,\u201d defensive tackle Marcell Dareus joked, grabbing his lower back and faking a limp Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRamsey wasn\u2019t sure how soon he would be able to play for the Rams.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s smart for me to go out there on Sunday, then I will,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing football. I love football. So I would love that, but at the end of the day, we do have to be smart as well.\u201d\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "A new team with a culture he says is \u201cdope\u201d might make all the difference for one of the NFL\u2019s best cornerbacks.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lsR7DCUgUPcD-9NhH6RpR640qhY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R423DZXN3AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
