Before the incident, per Buzzfeed News, the gunman purportedly uploaded a manifesto to an online forum announcing the upcoming \u201clive testing\u201d of his homemade weapons. The post included a link to a channel called \u201cspilljuice\u201d on Twitch, an Amazon-owned streaming platform popular among gamers, that livestreamed the shooting for 35 minutes.\n\nThe gunman posted the manifesto on Meguca, an online anime message board, in a now-deleted thread Buzzfeed News shared screenshots of on Friday. Over the course of 16 incredibly disconcerting pages, he outlines how he plans to \u201cprove the viability\u201d of his arsenal of improvised weaponry by \u201ckill[ing] as many anti-White as possible, jews preferred\u201d and making the footage go viral. He also lists specific body counts as \u201cachievments\u201d with names like \u201cChosen to die\u201d and \u201cMidnight Genocide,\u201d as if the attack was a video game with a point system. One of his objectives also harkens back to this delusion: \u201cBonus: Don\u2019t die.\u201d The manifesto also name-drops the infamous online forum 8chan, features a fake ad with a picture of an anime girl with cat ears, and promises other users that they can \u201cView the live-stream to find out more.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s incident follows a disconcerting pattern that\u2019s becoming entirely too familiar at this point. The suspected shooter at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart earlier this year purportedly posted a racist, anti-immigrant message to 8chan before an attack that left 20 people dead and dozens more injured. In it, he referenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre in March, where plans to attack a local mosque were similarly posted on the forum before a gunman livestreamed himself killing 51 people on Facebook.\n\nAs with the Christchurch livestream, footage of the Halle shooting quickly spread to platforms like Twitter and 4chan despite Twitch removing the original video. In the 30 minutes it remained up before being flagged, a recording of the stream was viewed by 2,200 people. Five viewers also watched it live, Twitch wrote in a Twitter thread on October 10.\n\nWe\u2019re continuing to investigate the Halle event and would like to share what we\u2019ve uncovered. The account owner streamed this horrific act live on Twitch for 35 minutes, during which time it was viewed by approximately five people. \u2014 Twitch (@Twitch) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cWe are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Germany today, and our deepest condolences go out to all those affected,\u201d a Twitch spokesperson previously told Gizmodo. \u201cTwitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously. We worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act.\u201d\n\nMultiple countries worldwide and five of the biggest names in tech have committed to fighting violent extremist content online since the Christchurch massacre, but this week\u2019s incident shows just how far this content can spread even when platforms provide a quick response. Megan Squire, a senior fellow with the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, mapped how the video travelled across Telegram, spreading from just two accounts to more than 15,000 in less than 30 minutes.\n\nHow the Halle shooter's media content flowed through Telegram in < 30 minutes. There are two source channels, one for a long video, another for a short clip. Each video was amplified via \"forwards\" by smaller channels, shown in black. Total audience was ~15,625 accounts. pic.twitter.com/IX7E1Vqkf4 \u2014 megan squire (@MeganSquire0) October 9, 2019\n\nIndividual countries and websites have begun taking steps to stymie the spread of this kind of content with moves like legislation to block domains hosting this kind of content or instituting one-strike policies on livestreaming platforms. But when fighting a beast with this many heads, I\u2019m not sure if these kinds of unilateral approaches will make much of a dent. Online virality isn\u2019t limited by geography or platform, so stopping it may take a coalition that isn\u2019t either.", "description": "Additional details have come out about a shooting in Germany that was livestreamed on Twitch earlier this week, and the case only continues to grow more disturbing....", "authors": ["Victoria Song", "Jennings Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xcqx4faiofqbygu0z4yq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
