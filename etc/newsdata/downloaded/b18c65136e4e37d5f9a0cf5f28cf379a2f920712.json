But that doesn't mean we can take our eye off the ball.\"\n\n'Challenges remain'\n\nDr Emily Burns head of research communications at Diabetes UK, said: \"This study looks at type 2 diabetes through a different lens, reporting on the number diagnosed rather than the number living with the condition - which can often be distorted by factors such as how long people live for.\n\n\"With this in mind, it's promising to see that the number of people being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes might potentially be plateauing in certain parts of the world.\"\n\nBut she added: \"The challenges posed by obesity and unhealthy lifestyles - the two main drivers for type 2 diabetes - remain significant.\n\n\"That's why, while the findings are interesting, this study doesn't detract from the seriousness of the growing diabetes crisis and the vital prevention efforts under way to help tackle this.\"", "description": "The number of new cases of type 2 diabetes is stable, or even falling, a study suggests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DDF9/production/_108752865_unhealthy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
