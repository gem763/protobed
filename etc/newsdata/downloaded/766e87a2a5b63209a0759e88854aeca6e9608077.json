One of the eyewitnesses told us that at one point, the woman ended up over McGregor's shoulder, and she witnessed the woman being carried toward the door. The witness said she was then passed to another member of McGregor's entourage and carried to an SUV outside.\n\nThe exterior of Delilah is pictured in December 2016.

When he got outside, he said he saw the woman in the back of the SUV, trying to roll down the window and \"freaking out.\"\n\nRead more: Drake and a night of violence: How one LA nightclub business allows its employees to be vulnerable to mistreatment by celebrities\n\nThat witness said that a manager then came out and threatened to call the police. It's unclear whether any call was made, however.\n\nThe woman did eventually exit the car and return to the restaurant. The first witness said she looked \"rattled.\"\n\nFellow MMA fighter Charlie Ward (pictured in November 2016) told Insider that he made out with the bottle service girl in the back of an SUV parked outside Delilah, but that it was consensual.

He told us it was he \u2014 and not McGregor \u2014 who went out to the SUV with the staffer.\n\nHe said they were making out in the back when a male manager peeked his head into the car and asked if the woman was being held against her will. Ward said he thought the manager was making a joke. But then, he said, the manager started yelling and threatening to call the police. Ward said that the waitress indicated that she was there on her own accord, but got out of the vehicle and he didn't see her for the rest of the night.\n\nThere is one key aspect of Ward's story that differs from what sources close to McGregor initially told us about the incident, but they refused to put this account on the record.\n\nBoth sources at Delilah who witnessed the incident said McGregor was banned from the restaurant afterward, but it seems like the banning wasn't taken too seriously. One of the witnesses said McGregor returned to the restaurant about a month and a half later, and left without paying his bill.\n\nThe H.wood Group \u2014 the company that owns Delilah \u2014 refused to comment on the matter.\n\nWe also reached out to the woman at the center of this story back in March, and asked her about the alleged incident. She declined to comment. At the time, she was still employed by the company.\n\nMcGregor, arguably the most famous UFC fighter in the world, has been connected to a series of troubling incidents.\n\nIn March, The New York Times reported that McGregor had been arrested in January after a woman accused him of a sexual assault. He was released without being charged, but Irish police in March said they were still investigating.\n\nRead more: Conor McGregor is reportedly being investigated by Irish police over sexual-assault allegations\n\nUFC President Dana White told reporters in August that McGregor had denied the allegations to him and said that it was \"somebody else.\"\n\nMcGregor was also suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission earlier this year in connection with a brawl that broke out after his defeat of Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229.\n\nJust this past August, McGregor found himself in the news again when TMZ Sports published video showing him punching an elderly man in the face at a Dublin pub, after the older gentleman refused a free shot of his brand of whiskey.", "description": "Insider uncovered the story while investigating Los Angeles nightlife company The H.wood Group, which is popular among celebrities.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cfb93e94e861288207211?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
