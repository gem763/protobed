(AP Photo/Hadi Mizban, File)\n\nBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Once again, Syrian President Bashar Assad has snapped up a prize from world powers that have been maneuvering in his country's multi-front wars. Without firing a shot, his forces are returning to towns and villages in northeastern Syria where they haven't set foot for years.\n\nAssad was handed one victory first by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from northeastern Syria, analysts said. Then he got another from a deal struck between Turkey and Russia, Damascus' ally.\n\nAbandoned by U.S. forces and staring down the barrel of a Turkish invasion, Kurdish fighters had no option but to turn to Assad's government and to Russia for protection from their No. 1 enemy.\n\nFor once, the interests of Damascus, Moscow and Ankara came into alignment. Turkey decided it was better having Assad's forces along the border, being helped by Russia, than to have the frontier populated by Kurdish-led fighters, whom it considers to be terrorists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan struck a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that allows Syrian troops to move back into a large part of the territory and ensure Kurdish fighters stay out.\n\nThe Kurds once hoped an alliance with Washington would strengthen their ambitions for autonomy, but now they are left hoping they can extract concessions from Moscow and Damascus to keep at least some aspects of their self-rule.\n\nTurkey, which had backed rebels trying to oust Assad, has now implicitly given the Syrian leader \"de facto recognition,\" said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House.\n\n\"Assad and Russia see this recognition as the beginning of international community normalization with the Assad regime, and as such an indication of their victory in the war,\" she said.\n\nIt's a method that Assad has used successfully before, positioning himself as the lesser of two evils in the eyes of those who might want him gone. Throughout Syria's civil war, he has presented the conflict as a choice between him and jihadis. Fear of the extremists watered down enthusiasm in Washington and other Western governments for fully backing the rebels.\n\n\"Assad has been benefiting from two narratives: shaping the Syrian uprising as a regional war and reminding that there is no viable alternative to his rule,\" said Joe Macaron, a resident fellow at the Arab Center in Washington D.C.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" policy, with its sometimes chaotic and impulsive shifts, has been a godsend for Assad.\n\nLast year, Trump called Assad an \"animal\" following a suspected chemical weapons attack near Damascus, carrying out limited airstrikes as punishment.\n\nBut the U.S. president has repeatedly said he's not interested in removing Assad from power or keeping American troops involved in \"endless wars\" in the region's \"blood-soaked sands.\" He has welcomed having Russia and Assad's government fill the void.\n\nBacking from Russia and Iran also has enabled Assad to simply outlast his opponents. With the help of Russian airstrikes since 2015, the Syrian military has recaptured town after town from the rebels. Abandoned and exhausted, the insurgents have repeatedly submitted to deals with Assad that allowed them to leave their besieged enclaves with safe passage to the north.\n\nBut the Russian-Turkish agreement is not all good news for Assad.\n\nIt allows Turkey to keep control over a significant chunk of northeastern Syria, a belt of land 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide and 30 kilometers (19 miles) deep that it captured in its invasion. Turkey already holds a larger piece of the border in the northwest, captured in previous incursions.\n\nSyrian forces will move into the rest of the border zone. But in a strip immediately at the border, Russian and Turkish forces will hold joint patrols, with only Syrian \"border guards\" in place, suggesting a presence in limited numbers.\n\nElsewhere, a large wedge of eastern Syria remains in the hands of the Kurdish-led fighters. That includes the bulk of Syria's oil fields, depriving Damascus of control over a crucial resource and giving the Kurds a major bargaining chip. Trump has said some U.S. troops will remain there to help Kurds \"secure\" the oil fields.\n\n\"Given where the regime was a few months ago, the regime is expanding its control,\" Macaron said, but it has to live with its opponents' presence on its soil and with Russia preventing any confrontation with them.", "description": "Once again, Syrian President Bashar Assad has snapped up a prize from world powers that have been maneuvering in his country's multi-front wars.
