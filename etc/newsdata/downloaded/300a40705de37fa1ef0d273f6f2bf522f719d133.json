But three second-half floodlight failures at the Pirelli Stadium, caused by issues within the local area and not with the ground\u2019s own system, resulted in 28 minutes of delays.\n\nOxford United humiliate West Ham in shock Carabao Cup thrashing Read more\n\nReferee John Busby even called a halt to proceedings after the third failure, only to be told by the Football League a match can only be called off if there is a total delay of at least 30 minutes.\n\nClough said: \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like that, not going \u2018on off, on off\u2019 for floodlight failures. But it was a problem no one could control. I\u2019m just delighted to get the game finished, and Bournemouth were desperate to get it on as well. They didn\u2019t want to come back in a couple of weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cBut initially we got conflicting messages. It was the Football League who said you have to give it 30 minutes in total for outages. No matter how many times you stop, if it\u2019s not 30 minutes \u2026 and we were still within that, and that\u2019s why we went back out that final time.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nathan Broadhead celebrates scoring Burton Albion\u2019s second goal.

Max Power\u2019s superb 25-yard strike after nine minutes gave the Black Cats a 1-0 win at Bramall Lane and it was the visitors who came closest to scoring the game\u2019s second goal when Luke O\u2019Nien\u2019s shot struck a post in the second half.\n\nEuropean round-up: PSG stunned at home by Reims as Real Madrid go top Read more\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do enough and we didn\u2019t deserve to go through, we were second best,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cThere would have been a time when I\u2019d have had them in the dressing room dissecting that until 11.30pm but we\u2019ve got the European champions coming here at Saturday lunchtime and I\u2019m not going to waste my time on it.\n\n\u201cIt was an opportunity for some players to knock on my door and ask why they aren\u2019t in the team, well I don\u2019t think there will be any knocks on my door, apart from maybe Mo Besic. And I thought the two strikers who came on did okay. I made 10 changes and Sunderland made eight changes and their changes were better than mine. They were pretty comfortable in the end and saw the game out comfortably.\u201d\n\nWolves head coach Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo expressed his concern after debutants Bruno Jord\u00e3o and Meritan Shabani were both carried off in their penalty shootout win against Reading.\n\nJord\u00e3o has an ankle injury after a challenge with Charlie Adam and Shabani\u2019s is a mystery after he buckled, unable to straighten his leg with no one around him as Wolves advanced 4-2 on spot kicks after the tie ended 1-1.\n\n\u201cShabani looks like a long one, he is now being analysed by the doctor, then we will know what happened but it looks bad. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cJordao\u2019s is a different situation \u2013 someone fell on him and he twisted his ankle.\u201d\n\nBrighton manager Graham Potter says injuries and sickness forced him to field a youthful side for the third round loss to Aston Villa.\n\nPotter named a starting XI with an average age of just over 21 and handed 10 senior debuts to academy players during the course of the 3-1 defeat at the Amex Stadium.", "description": "Burton manager Nigel Clough is relishing the prospect of a Carabao Cup last-16 tie against Leicester after coming within two minutes of facing a third-round replay with Bournemouth", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be0aa7cf51c4b823e409bb374a5f30dfe7f7186f/120_467_4309_2586/master/4309.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb786d132fbc5262a35f7c669332aab7", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
