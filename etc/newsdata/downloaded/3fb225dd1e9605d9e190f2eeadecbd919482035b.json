There were no reported injuries.\n\nRiders reported being stuck as long as three hours as rescuers worked their way up to evacuate the Disney Skyliner. Disney officials said in a statement that one of the new cable car system routes \u201cexperienced an unexpected downtime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Skyliner will be closed while we look into the details surrounding this downtime,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are working with each guest individually regarding impacts to their visit with us.\u201d It was not immediately clear what caused the incident.\n\nThe Skyliner air gondolas opened to visitors last week. The cable cars whisk visitors from hotels to theme parks three stories above the ground while going 11 mph (18 kph). No more than 10 people are allowed in each cable car. There are almost 300 air gondolas, allowing the cabins to handle about 3,000 people an hour. They are painted with neon colors and with the images of almost two dozen Disney characters.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The message that just kept coming over again and again is that they were sorry for the delay,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe were getting better information off of Twitter.\u201d\n\nThe gondola behind them was assisted first possibly because there was a person that needed help, he said. Murray said he saw a woman being placed on a stretcher.\n\nMurray recently moved to the Orlando area from Missouri and became a Disney pass holder. He was hoping to catch the new \u201cEpcot Forever\u201d nighttime show on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to celebrate at Epcot, and we ended up seeing \u2018Epcot Forever\u2019 but from the sky,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could barely see it.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Walt Disney World park-goers were stuck for hours aboard the Florida resort's newly launched aerial cable car system Saturday night.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/disney-cable-cars-stuck.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
