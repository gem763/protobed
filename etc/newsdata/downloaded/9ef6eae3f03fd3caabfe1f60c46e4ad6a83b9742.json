Robert Torricelli told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d on Tuesday that the Ukraine allegations will harm former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine a Democratic primary electorate witnessing this spectacle of $50,000 a month to Hunter Biden, the contradictory information about whether there was consultation with him and his father, the rather unseemly view of this, that the Democratic primary electorate is going to decide this is our guy,\u201d said Torricelli, D-N.J.\n\nEarlier this month, Biden told Fox News in Iowa that he had never discussed his son\u2019s foreign business dealings with him.\n\nBut a photo obtained by Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" showed Biden and his son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings along with Hunter.\n\nFORMER UKRAINE PRIME MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY MUST INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDEN\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden said, pointing the finger at President Trump. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden told The New Yorker magazine previously that he and his father had spoken \u201cjust once\" about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNobody has a son who gets paid 50,000 a month in something which he has no experience, no background and you don\u2019t discuss it,\u201d said Torricelli, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1997 to 2003.\n\n\u201cSome of this is inexplicable,\u201d he said, while also noting Biden is a friend of his.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nA source close to Archer told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. Contemporaneous news reports indicate the vice president was in the Hamptons at the time.\n\n\u201cThere is an element here of mutually assured destruction. As the country is now focused on the impact of the last 48 hours on Donald Trump, there has been very little attention of what\u2019s the impact here of Joe Biden,\u201d Torricelli said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Democratic Sen.
