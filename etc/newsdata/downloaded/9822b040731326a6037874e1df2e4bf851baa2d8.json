In fact, it appears to be accelerating.\n\nThat\u2019s a key part of the reason Disney has launched ESPN, a streaming app that delivers sports programming. It\u2019s also part of the reason Disney now owns the bulk of Hulu, and is planning to launch the entertainment streaming channel dubbed Disney+ in November.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf the three, though, it\u2019s the ESPN+ piece of the company\u2019s streaming offering that could prove the toughest for DIS, as it will eventually pit the company against the television providers who are also its de facto partners. It may boil down to a matter of who flinches first.\n\nFighting an Oversized Headwind\n\nDisney doesn\u2019t provide a detailed revenue breakdown of the components of its \u201cMedia Networks\u201d division. (Accounting for about one-third of Disney\u2019s revenue, Media Networks is its largest unit.) But some estimates suggest ESPN accounts for about 50% of the unit\u2019s top line. A little math work leads to a rough assumption that ESPN makes up 15% of Disney\u2019s total revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nCord cutting has made that piece of Disney\u2019s revenue pie tough to defend, though.\n\nThe majority of cable packages include most of Disney\u2019s channels. Nearly all cable providers offer ESPN to their subscribers, though, even if some cable providers leave out a number of the company\u2019s other channels.\n\nAs of 2017, cable providers were paying Disney an estimated $7.21 per subscriber per month for ESPN. With ESPN2 and ESPNU, the monthly total rose above $9.00. That\u2019s pretty lucrative for DIS, and that revenue stream has been a key supporter of Disney stock.\n\nThat\u2019s why cord-cutting mania has proven so problematic for Disney stock and so worrisome for the owners of DIS stock. As of late last year, ESPN had lost approximately 14 million subscribers in just seven years, and eMarketer anticipates that the number of customers canceling their cable package will grow by another 19.2% this year.\n\nThe solution, of course, is to offer those defectors an alternative. Even at a monthly price of $5.00, Disney can collect something from ESPN+ customers who are no longer cable subscribers. Even though $9 per month is way below $5 per month, something is better than nothing.\n\nThe matter isn\u2019t nearly that simple, though.\n\nAt the Tipping Point\n\nContrary to the rhetoric, ESPN+ is not an alternative to cable-delivered ESPN. It\u2019s an addendum to ESPN\u2019s sports programming. No major event that\u2019s broadcast on one is shown on the other, and only a few of the commentary shows appear to be available on both channels.\n\nThat leaves the all-important Monday Night Football out-of-reach for cord cutters. But MNF isn\u2019t the only key program that\u2019s not available on ESPN+.\n\nThat\u2019s because Disney doesn\u2019t want to further alienate the conventional TV providers it still relies on for a wide swath of its revenue.\n\nBut nonetheless, DIS is starting to clash with the cable companies. Case in point: Disney is currently warning customers of AT&T\u2019s (NYSE:T) satellite TV provider, DirecTV, that they could soon be losing access to all of their Disney-driven content if the two companies don\u2019t renew their deal soon.\n\nNow that streaming platforms are being established and cord cutting is an increasingly viable option, DIS could take a harder line and start offering some content via ESPN+ that previously was only offered on older types of TV.\n\nDisney likely knows that access to sports programming is one of the key reasons consumers have not yet canceled their cable and satellite service. Many of those relationships are hanging by a thread, though. Bolstering the amount of content available through ESPN+ could help greatly accelerate the exodus from conventional TV.", "description": "Sports network ESPN has been something of a double-edged sword for Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), as well as the owners of Disney stock, for a long time.
