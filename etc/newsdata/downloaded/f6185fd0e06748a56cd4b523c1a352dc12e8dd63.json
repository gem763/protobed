This is the first time people can buy the ingredients directly and make their own Impossible meals.\n\nUnfortunately, there's one major speedbump for potential buyers: A strikingly high price.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAt most grocery stores, you'll pay anywhere from $3 to $8 for a pound of ground beef.\n\nMore often than not, you're paying under $5/lb. \u2014 we're talking about ground beef here, not prime rib.\n\nIt's pretty rare to pay the higher end of that spectrum, even here in New York City. I had to call the fanciest butcher shop in Brooklyn, The Meat Hook, which prides itself on being a more labor-intensive whole-animal butchery, to find ground beef that costs $8 a pound.\n\nThat's why I was so shocked to find out that Impossible Foods, which aims to replace beef with its own vegetarian beef option, is selling less than a pound of its ground \"meat\" \u2014 12 ounces \u2014 for $9.\n\nAn Impossible Foods burger I made at home, and then lovingly photographed in the afternoon sunlight. Ben Gilbert/Business Insider\n\nThat's a pretty stark comparison to the $3 you could pay for 16 oz. (1 lb.) of ground beef.\n\nFor some folks, the high price is worth it. \"Fortunately, we have more demand than we can handle at our current price, \" Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told me during an Impossible Foods event in New York City on Thursday.\n\nImpossible's only offering its veggie beef in a handful of regional supermarket chains to start, before ramping up to national chains and, the company hopes, expanding internationally. It's one of the first steps in Impossible's plan to lower cost, broaden availability, and convince the general public that its version of veggie beef is a better option than ground beef.\n\nRead more: I cooked 4 Impossible Burgers at home, and it felt bizarrely familiar \u2014 these are the best and worst parts of the experience\n\n\"We're scaling up right now from tiny to big,\" Brown said. \"And it's only when we get to a bigger scale when we realize the advantages of our process. Our goal is to get our prices affordable to everybody in the world, not just even in the US but in the developing world, as fast as we possibly can. But it doesn't happen instantly, and we can't sell our products at a loss if we want to stay in business.\"\n\nAs Impossible's \"meat\" becomes more popular, its price should correspondingly decrease as its makers feel more of the financial benefits of the company's more environmentally friendly approach to food creation. It's a reasonable plan, but \u2014 in the meantime \u2014 it makes Impossible's meat replacement hard to suggest for most people.", "description": "If Impossible Foods truly wants to compete with mass produced, easy-to-use ground beef, it needs to bring down the price dramatically.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cd5922e22af0197465cad?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
