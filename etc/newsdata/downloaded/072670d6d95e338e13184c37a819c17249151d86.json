Ergh, THIS is art, people.\n\nJohn noticed the shout out, and commented: \u2018Yes! Cap likes it, haha so glad you enjoyed it, Chris!\u2019\n\nMemories of him attempting to handle the hammer (Picture: Marvel)\n\nOne fan who is well into the Avengers and Transformers crossover was feeling it as they, too, chimed in: \u2018This is literally EVERYTHING and it makes everything that\u2019s wrong in the world fade away. Thank you for sharing @ChrisEvans and THANK YOU for making this @john_grosjean (this is coming from a guy with an Autobot Tattoo and a spot on Captain America costume).\u2019\n\nThe mighty remixed moment comes after the Russo brothers suggested Cap could always wield Mjolnir, after making it budge ever so slightly in Age Of Ultron way back in 2012.\n\nAt the time, viewers were given a tease that Steve may have the power to lift Thor\u2019s hammer, however it wasn\u2019t until Endgame we were shown the powers for real as he summoned the weapon to end the battle against Thanos\u2019s army.\n\nWhile you could say they\u2019re messing with the canon, in a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything forum, the directing duo faced a barrage of in-depth questions from Avengers fans who wondered if Cap always had the gift.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony was the one to answer that spicy nugget, as he replied: \u2018He always could.\n\n\u2018Our interpretation of the famous scene in Ultron was that when he realized he could pick up Mjolnir he quickly chose not to, because he didn\u2019t want to embarrass Thor.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
