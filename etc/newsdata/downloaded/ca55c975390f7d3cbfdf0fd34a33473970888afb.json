Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime had developed a clear preference for Donald Trump, including and perhaps especially \u201chis Russia-friendly positions on Syria and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIt is exactly those two issues that are playing out at the forefront of American politics right now. Trump is facing impeachment over his campaign to withhold diplomatic recognition and military aid from Ukraine while working covertly in an alliance with pro-Russian political actors in that country. Meanwhile, Trump suddenly and impulsively engineered a\n\nU-turn in American policy toward Syria to the direct benefit of Russia and its regional proxies.\n\nThe mystery of Russia\u2019s influence over Trump has largely disappeared from public attention since the publication of the Mueller report. Yet now, as thousands of ISIS terrorists go free and a humanitarian crisis unfolds, whatever illicit or corrupt backchannel or leverage Russia may have still poses a great danger to American security.\n\nMueller, of course knocked the wind out of the question without resolving it. In his testimony, he did concede, after one House Democrat drew it out of him, that Trump\u2019s secret campaign negotiations for a lucrative Moscow building deal made him vulnerable to Russian blackmail. But Mueller\u2019s report focused on finding criminal-law violations, not counterintelligence threats. New details of Trump\u2019s odd Russophilia have continued to leak into the public domain. In late September, the Washington Post reported that Trump privately told the Russian ambassador he was not concerned about Russia\u2019s interference in the election. Days later, the same newspaper revealed that Trump \u201cfawned over\u201d Putin in one of his first calls as president and spent ten minutes with Theresa May disputing her country\u2019s intelligence assessment that Russia had poisoned a former Russian spy on British soil.\n\nFrom the American perspective, the Ukraine scandal is primarily about the president\u2019s attempt to leverage his power over a vulnerable foreign country to gin up investigations of his domestic opponents. But from Ukraine\u2019s end, the narrative looks a bit different. It is a story about restoring Russian influence over Ukraine\u2019s political system.\n\nEven while it has menaced its smaller neighbor, Russia has sought to manipulate Ukraine internally by covertly supporting corrupt political officials who would promote Russian interests. Russian oligarchs hired Paul Manafort to advise corrupt Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. After a popular uprising drove Yanukovych out of power, the nexus of corruption and Russophilia didn\u2019t disappear. It has instead reconstituted itself around a series of figures who, like Manafort, have cultivated influence with Trump.\n\nThe great joke behind Trump\u2019s claim to be rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine is that it is the literal opposite of his agenda in that country. Trump has been allied with the most corrupt elements in Ukrainian politics, a point Michele Goldberg explains lucidly in her recent reporting from that country.\n\nManafort is now in prison, but Rudy Giuilani appears to have taken on a successor role. He has collected half a million dollars from Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two shadowy figures with links to Russian organized crime. Parnas and Fruman may not be the ultimate source of Giuliani\u2019s money; Reuters reports U.S. prosecutors charge an unidentified Russian businessman sent a million dollars to their accounts.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine began with attempts to absolve Manafort of collecting illicit sums from Russia by smearing the Ukrainians who exposed his corruption, and absolving Russia of election hacking by promoting a conspiracy theory that blamed Ukraine for hacking Democratic emails. From there, he expanded his efforts to attacking Joe Biden.\n\nBut Giuliani, who was being paid by the Russians and representing Trump for free, advanced a policy agenda that benefited both. As the curtain behind the Ukraine scandal has been slowly pulled back, it has become increasingly clear that Trump stands almost alone within his own administration in his coldness toward Ukraine.\n\nTrump had to turn over his Ukraine policy to an outside, Russian-paid lawyer because it repelled almost the entirety of his own administration\u2019s foreign-policy staff. Trump\u2019s refusal to support Kiev and release the military aid voted by Congress appalled and alarmed numerous White House advisers, many of whom saw the extortion play as not only misguided but outright criminal.\n\nTrump has concealed his discussions with Putin from other members of his administration. When the two leaders spoke in July, Trump implausibly claimed to have called out of concern for wildfires in Siberia. This last summer, he pleaded with fellow G7 members to readmit Russia, which had been expelled as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine. Even in September, in a televised meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky while the scandal was blowing up all around him, Trump treated Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as a minor misunderstanding between the two countries. \u201cThat was done a long time ago, and I think it was handled poorly. But it\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. Addressing Zelensky, he offered, \u201cI really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem,\u201d as if a small country under military attack from a much larger one was in any position to work out its problems by itself.\n\nSo the question again turns to why is Trump almost alone in his own administration on this issue. All the old suspicions still apply. Trump has not released his financial information, and we don\u2019t know how much Russian money he has collected. (Remember, he was trying to collect several hundred million dollars in fees from the Moscow project during the campaign, completely in secret.) Or perhaps the Russians might simply be very good at manipulating Trump\u2019s ego, which they\u2019ve been doing since the 1980s, so that his spiteful or self-destructive lurches tend to redound to their benefit.\n\nIt hardly requires a nefarious conspiracy to explain why Trump has done something stupid. That outcome is, as a social scientist would put it, overdetermined. Still, the juxtaposition is quite striking. Trump is currently enduring a domestic crisis (the Ukraine scandal) and a foreign one (the Syria debacle). One of these crises \u2014 green-lighting a Turkish invasion of Syria \u2014 had no plausible connection to his own political self-interest. Both have transpired because Trump took reckless and self-destructive actions that happened to follow the course of action Russia desired.", "description": "President Trump is facing crises in the Ukraine scandal and the debacle in Syria.
