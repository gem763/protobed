Among them was Tanzania's major English-language paper, The Citizen.\n\nThe authorities have also used the 2015 Cybercrimes Act to prosecute journalists and activists for social media posts. In 2017, a court in Dar Es Salaam used this law to convict human rights activist Bob Chacha Wangwe for \"publication of false information\". His conviction over a Facebook post in which he questioned the fairness of the 2015 election in Zanzibar was later overturned by the High Court.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Wangwe said there is a \"shrinking media space\" in Tanzania, attributing the change to the political climate to Magufuli\u2019s policies.\n\nThe rights groups found that one way in which speech has been stifled is through amendment to legislation. The Political Parties Act, for example, was amended in January 2019 to give the Registrar of Political Parties sweeping powers to deregister parties, to demand information from political parties and to suspend party members.\n\n'Dangerous repressive trend'\n\nThe organisations also said the government uses the 2015 Statistics Act to control independent research and public access to independent statistical information, denying people alternative sources of independently verified information.\n\n\"We see a dangerous repressive trend escalating in Tanzania,\" Roland Ebole, Amnesty International\u2019s Tanzania researcher, said. \u201cThe authorities are denying citizens their right to information by administering only those \u2018truths\u2019 sanctioned by the state.\u201d\n\nIn July 2016, President Magufuli announced a blanket ban on political activities until 2020. The ban has been selectively applied against opposition politicians, several of whom have been arrested on trumped-up charges, the rights groups said.\n\n\u201cThe restrictions on political parties mean that they cannot do their work,\u201d Wangwe said. \u201cParties are banned from campaigning outside their own constituencies.\u201d\n\nBoth Amnesty and HRW called on the Tanzanian government to \"immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against journalists and politicians brought simply for exercising the rights to freedom of expression and association\".", "description": "In new reports, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also say censorship is mounting in Tanzania.", "authors": ["Mia Swart"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/12/5fc91290c3cf4f00a9bd3c4b34bd1162_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
