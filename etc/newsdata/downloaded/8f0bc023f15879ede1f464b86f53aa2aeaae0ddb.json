Isn\u2019t it the people who put them all there?\u201d asked protestor Athir Malek, 39.\n\nHe had come from Diwaniyah, 200 kilometres (130 miles) further south, to join the biggest rallies so far in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square, where celebration was in the air.\n\nYoussef, 33 expressed optimism late Tuesday as he spent his sixth straight night in the square.\n\n\u201cThey said we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. But even if we change one name, now we have a voice,\u201d he said.\n\nParliament has demanded that the premier appear \u201cimmediately\u201d for questioning amid speculation he will face a no-confidence vote.\n\nBut protestor Malek retained some scepticism.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll replace Abdel Mahdi with someone else just like him,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nAbdel Mahdi, 78, came to power last year through a tenuous partnership between populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and powerful paramilitary chief Hadi al-Ameri. But the kingmakers\u2019 alliance has since drifted apart.\n\nThe protests exposed more clearly than ever the rift between Ameri and Sadr\u2019s powerful Saeroon bloc, the biggest in parliament, which has backed the demonstrators.\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force\u2019s political arm Fatah, headed by Ameri, is the second-biggest bloc and has so far backed the government.\n\nSeveral Hashed offices were torched in southern Iraq last week, further straining ties between the two.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Back to square one\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut Sadr extended a hand to Ameri late Tuesday, inviting him to coordinate on a no-confidence vote in Abdel Mahdi and using Twitter to urge the premier to \u201cGet out!\u201d\n\nHours later, Ameri announced he and Sadr would \u201cwork together to achieve the people\u2019s demands\u201d \u2014 hinting he may agree to a vote on the premier\u2019s future.\n\nSadr took to Twitter again Wednesday to pile on the pressure, warning that failing to oust Abdel Mahdi would \u201cturn Iraq into Syria or Yemen,\u201d both engulfed in bloody wars.\n\nWhile the premier\u2019s departure would be seen as a \u201cvictory\u201d for demonstrators, it would \u201cgive protests a break but not break them,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, an Iraq analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nDemonstrators have demanded deep-rooted reforms, including a new constitution, a reworked electoral law and mass resignations from a government they see as corrupt.\n\nFantappie cautioned that \u201ceven an election with the same election law would bring same figures into parliament and the same process as last year in selecting the prime minister, which puts you once again at square one.\u201d\n\nAs rumours swirled that Abdel Mahdi\u2019s days were numbered, people rallied at central Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square for a seventh consecutive day on Wednesday.\n\nDespite violence that has left more than 240 people dead and more than 8,000 wounded, they have defied orders to clear the streets.\n\nThe largest numbers yet \u2014 tens of thousands \u2014 flooded Tahrir overnight amid blaring horns, fireworks and loud Iraqi music.\n\nDemonstrators have shrugged off a litany of government reform plans and piled the pressure on Iraq\u2019s entrenched political class, saying they want to \u201cweed them all out\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey should all quit and we should have a national salvation government,\u201d said Alaa Khdeir, 63.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Take back everything\u2019 \u2013\n\nSince the US-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq\u2019s political system has been gripped by clientelism, corruption and sectarianism.\n\nThat means getting a job in government \u2014 by far the country\u2019s biggest employer \u2014 is often secured with bribes or connections. The country is ranked by Transparency International as the 12th most corrupt in the world.\n\nAnger at the state of affairs had been swelling among the youth, who make up 60 percent of Iraq\u2019s nearly 40 million people.\n\nYouth unemployment stands at 25 percent, while one in five live below the poverty line, despite the vast oil wealth of OPEC\u2019s second-largest crude producer.\n\nInequality has been a major rallying cry for protestors.\n\nAn initial six-day wave of demonstrations broke out on October 1 but was met with violence that left 157 people dead, mostly protesters in Baghdad.\n\nThe demonstrations resumed on October 24, with clashes breaking out in the south and heavy use of tear gas canisters in Baghdad, leaving another 85 dead.\n\nThey included at least one protester killed overnight in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, according to the Iraqi Human Rights Commission.\n\nBut the threat of violence did not prevent 55-year-old Hussein Nuri returning to Tahrir Square on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe want to take back everything they stole,\u201d he said.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 The future of Iraq\u2019s embattled premier was in the hands of his onetime parliamentary backers Wednesday, as they deliberated", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/48b01b_iraqi-protestors-are-demanding-total-overhaul-political-see-as-corrupt-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
