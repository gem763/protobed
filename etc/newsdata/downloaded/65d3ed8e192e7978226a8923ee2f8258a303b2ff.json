Before becoming president of the University of the Bahamas, Rodney Smith was an administrator at Hampton.\n\nMr Harvey said displaced Bahamian students would be welcome to stay at Hampton after the autumn term, but they would be charged the university\u2019s regular rates for tuition and fees.\n\nOrdinarily, tuition and fees for a full school year at Hampton would be about $28,000 (\u00a322,790), not including room and board. The university had about 4,300 students as of last autumn.\n\n\u201cHampton has been the educational choice for many Bahamians over its long history,\u201d Lawrence Rigby, a former Hampton student body president, who is from Nassau, said.\n\n\u201cYoung Bahamians from Abaco and Grand Bahama who are looking for the tools to rebuild their lives and our home will find them at Hampton.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "A historically black university in Virginia is offering a free\u00a0term\u00a0of education to Bahamian students displaced by Hurricane Dorian.\u00a0 Hampton University announced on Thursday an agreement to help the University of the Bahamas-North, which serves students from the battered islands of Grand Bahama and\u00a0Abaco Islands.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/13/Hurricane-Dorian2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
