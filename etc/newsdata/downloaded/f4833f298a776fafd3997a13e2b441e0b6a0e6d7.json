And the last group of names didn\u2019t arrive until just a few weeks ago, Dumbacher said.\n\nAD\n\nDespite the delays, the organizers said that a top Chinese official, Tian Yulong, and a delegation of five staff members were granted visas and planned to arrive for the conference on Wednesday, according to an email reviewed by The Post that was sent to conference organizers by Chinese officials.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe work very hard to ensure the international involvement, participation and flavor of the International Astronautical Congress,\u201d Dumbacher said. The group \u201ctook these requests very seriously. We took the challenge very seriously.\"\n\nBoles said that the delay was caused when the conference received required paperwork \"extremely, extremely late. And, of course, that puts (the State Department) in the bind of trying to administer visas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe group also worked with Russia, the local organizers said, and Sergey Krikalev, executive director of piloted spaceflights at Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, is attending the conference. More than 60 Chinese citizens were also in attendance, Dumbacher said. Having representation from as many countries as possible is a core value of the conference and a way to showcase how space often transcends geopolitical tensions, according to organizers.\n\nAD\n\nBut the tension comes as the U.S. increasingly sees space as a war fighting domain and is trying to stand up a Space Force in an effort to stem advances by potential adversaries such as China and Russia. In a speech earlier this year, Vice President Pence called for NASA to dramatically speed up its plan to return astronauts to the moon, casting it as part of a great-power competition with China, which landed a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, a historic first, in January.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: We\u2019re in a space race today, just as we were in the 1960s, and the stakes are even higher,\u201d Pence said in a speech in March. China\u2019s lunar efforts \u201crevealed their ambition to seize the lunar strategic high ground and become the world\u2019s preeminent spacefaring nation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nScott Pace, the executive secretary of the National Space Council, told The Post that U.S. officials are wary of cooperating with China in space the way they do with other nations, including Russia, which flies NASA\u2019s astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLooking at Chinese behavior in other shared domains\u2014the South China Sea, cyberspace\u2014they\u2019ve given us pause for concern,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so looking out in space, it\u2019s hard to imagine that they will behave any better than they\u2019d behaved in other areas where they felt that their national interests are at stake.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration said it would restrict visas for Chinese nationals suspected of being involved in human rights abuses of Uighur Muslims and other minorities. China condemned the move, saying it \u201cviolates the basic norms governing international relations,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe absence of top officials from the China National Space Administration was noted at the conference, particularly at a panel where the heads of the space agencies from India, Russia, Japan, Canada, Europe and the United States gathered on Monday. In the conference program, Yanhua was listed as \u201cinvited.\u201d\n\nAsked about the absence of the Chinese delegation, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, \u201cI know we invited them, and I was anticipating them being here.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Diplomatic tensions between China and the United States continued to climb Wednesday, when Chinese officials accused the U.S. of having \u201cweaponized\u201d the visa process after a top Chinese official was unable attend a major international space conference currently being held in Washington.", "authors": ["Christian Davenport", "Reporter Covering The Defense", "Space Industries"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/anuRi5VUIKaAzi-vjN_eMIHjzp0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YOWVRZHVREI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
