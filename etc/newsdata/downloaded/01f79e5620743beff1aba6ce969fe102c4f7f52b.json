I was able to move into an apartment on my own. It\u2019s all a chain of events in the end, with one thing leading to another.\u201d The trio have run into each other once or twice in the years since, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always one of those \u2018We think we know him\u2019 things.\u201d\n\nTo be fair to the Olsen sisters, Clarke has one of those faces. A blend of comfortable familiarity and uncertain ambiguity, it has been appearing in movies big and small for more than two decades. The 50-year-old native of Queensland, Australia, has had lead roles, notably opposite Keira Knightley in The Aftermath and the underrated Chappaquiddick (in which he played Ted Kennedy), but he\u2019s better known as a consummate supporting player. Films such as First Man, Zero Dark Thirty, The Great Gatsby and Everest have therefore cemented him as an actor who is incredibly recognisable, even if you may not know his name. It\u2019s how he likes it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve led shows and I\u2019ve led films, and you have to get up every day and make it happen and it\u2019s taxing,\u201d he explains. \u201cYour family life and everything is just down the tubes. And you\u2019ve gotta take care of yourself. Because if you don\u2019t then it\u2019s on you, it\u2019s not gonna work. I\u2019m an ensemble player. But I love being able to move around into different genres, or whether it\u2019s England or America or Australia, and just mixing it all up. I still love what I do, and I love the life that I\u2019m living and I have energy for both [leads and supporting roles], which is gonna sustain me hopefully until I\u2019m Helen\u2019s age or older, and I\u2019ll still love it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Helen of which he speaks is Dame Helen Mirren, who this month may be the key to Clarke finally becoming more of a household name. In the lavish Sky Atlantic historical drama series Catherine the Great, he is Grigory Potemkin, the charismatic army officer who became Catherine\u2019s most trustworthy adviser, most rapacious lover and closest confidante. The show is glitzy, bloody and licentious, existing somewhere between The Tudors and Game of Thrones, but it is also fiercely intimate. Strip away all the Russian palace intrigue and power play and Potemkin and Catherine are movingly tender together, all intimate correspondence and deep-seated pain.\n\nClarke says he loved all of Potemkin\u2019s different modes, but fell most for how \u201cheightened\u201d he was. \u201cHe\u2019s histrionic but very emotional, aggressive but tender, and he\u2019s out there founding countries and cities and dealing with Malaria,\u201d he explains. \u201cHe\u2019s f***ing great! I loved him. It was challenging, because you had to bring it. You can\u2019t be a timid Potemkin. I remember my first day on set thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve gotta f***ing go for this, man! Go for it, Jase, find this thing and settle there. I\u2019m not just gonna \u2018kitchen drama\u2019 this.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation.

Amazon Prime 25/34 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.\" BBC 26/34 Killing Eve \"As the series develops, it\u2019s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/34 Chernobyl \"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.\" HBO 28/34 The Handmaid's Tale \"Season three's knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.\" Hulu 29/34 This Way Up \"The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.\" Channel 4 30/34 Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain \"A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.\" Channel 4 31/34 Succession \"Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all.

Restless in a London hotel room, he is somehow always in the process of moving. He\u2019s playing with his shoelaces when I greet him, and spends the rest of our time together absent-mindedly swapping the placement of his feet between the floor and a nearby loveseat. His hands are permanently stroking at his arms and running his fingers through his hair, which has been cut into loose and messy curls. Taller and leaner than he appears on-screen and sporting small spectacles, he\u2019d be the shoo-in for the role of a bookish, unexpectedly handsome nerd in a high-school movie if he were 25 years younger.\n\nPast interviews have remarked on Clarke\u2019s guarded quality, and his reluctance to give away too much of himself. But he\u2019s nothing of the sort today \u2013 perhaps because, after so many recent misses, from Terminator Genisys to Pet Sematary, he\u2019s excited to be a part of something genuinely very good. He\u2019s giddy with excitement as soon as I tell him I\u2019ve watched three episodes of the show. \u201cAh, wait until you get to four, dude!\u201d\n\nClarke and Mirren previously worked together on the haunted house movie Winchester, and became good friends. It was Mirren who suggested Clarke for the role of Potemkin, and when I remark that she had said in a recent interview how his face is \u201cso Russian\u201d, he erupts in laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll take that well!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very liberating as a man to work with,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe gives you confidence. She inspires you to be a great man, and part of finding my character was taking care of Helen as well. Making sure she\u2019s laughing, making sure she\u2019s energised, making sure she\u2019s warm and comfortable and feeling confident. It was a great experience just to spend so much time [with her] creating this.\u201d\n\nThe series also marked a long-delayed reunion between Clarke and the revered Australian actor Richard Roxburgh, who got him his very first professional gig. While attending drama school in Australia in the late 1990s, Clarke failed in his critical studies module, meaning he couldn\u2019t complete the year. As a penalty, he had to write an essay on the Australian theatre world, and was put in touch with Roxburgh\u2019s then-fledgling theatre company. While interviewing him for the essay, Clarke mentioned that he was training to be an actor, and Roxburgh kindly put him in touch with a director working on a production of Shakespeare. Allowed to audition for it, Clarke eventually won a role, starring alongside one or two actors you may have heard of.\n\n\u201cIt was for The Tempest, and it was Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving and Richard Roxburgh,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a cast from heaven in Australia. So to see Rox all these years later in this was really good. I very rarely work in Australia, so it meant we caught up.\u201d\n\nAfter The Tempest, Clarke became a jobbing actor in Australia, appearing in homegrown indies and series including Farscape, Heartbreak High and, somewhat inevitably, Home and Away. It was only after seeing so many native Australians making it big in America that he was convinced to throw caution to the wind and try the USA out for himself. His first major US role was in the acclaimed Irish-American drama series Brotherhood in 2006.\n\n\u201cFor a long time it was impossible to have a sustainable career and buy a house and have a family just by working in Australia, so people just had to f***ing go,\u201d he explains. But brave too, surely? \u201cOf course, but when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t realise. You\u2019re not considering the tomorrows, you\u2019re going for the now, and it\u2019s not until you do break through and you make a living that you go, \u2018My god, I was close to the edge there\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cBut that\u2019s what it takes, you know? It\u2019s not a business for the faint-hearted. And it\u2019s not a business for those with false hearts either. If you just want to be loved or be famous, it\u2019ll break you. You\u2019ve gotta love and be in it for the right thing, to tell a good story and because you enjoy being a part of that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a mission statement that has produced a number of creative hits in the years since \u2013 including the Oscar-nominated Netflix film Mudbound. But it\u2019s also meant taking risks that don\u2019t always pay off. Earlier this year, Clarke was the very angry husband to Anne Hathaway\u2019s femme fatale in the Matthew McConaughey flop Serenity, a film immediately infamous for its audacious last-minute plot twist. The Independent blasted it as \u201ca sweaty collection of neo-noir tropes with one of the most seismically stupid twists in cinematic history\u201d. But Clarke believes its notoriety was less because the film was especially bad, and more the result of a culture-wide resistance to experimental and ambitious films today.\n\n\u201cIs it perfect? No. But what the f*** is? It was massively ambitious, and it got treated very harshly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre how people look at things nowadays. Like if Peter Greenaway was to come along now, or early Ken Loach or something \u2013 we\u2019re too cynical to understand Kes now! Or even to examine, you know, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. We\u2019re too owned by big business and Marvel to examine a film like Serenity properly.\u201d\n\nIt makes for a convincing argument \u2013 and is a testament to how, whatever the outcome, you won\u2019t stop seeing Jason Clarke in incredibly polarising and risky projects anytime soon. Something in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however? Maybe not.\n\nCatherine the Great begins tonight on Sky Atlantic at 9pm", "description": "Jason Clarke owes his career to the Olsen twins. \u201cThey were integral,\u201d laughs the star of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, when I ask about his scene-stealing work in Our Lips Are Sealed \u2013 a 2000 straight-to-video vehicle for the former child stars turned pouty, chain-smoking fashion moguls. \u201cThe money I got from that helped me move to America.
