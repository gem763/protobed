Most importantly for Washington, he and the Nats prevented LA from closing out the NLDS after taking a 2-1 lead into Game 4.\n\nGame 5 will be Wednesday in Los Angeles, with Stephen Strasburg set to start for the Nationals against Walker Buehler.\n\nThe 35-year-old Zimmerman showed what he still can do at the plate by taking a 97 mph pitch, the second thrown by reliever Pedro B\u00e1ez, and turning it into a high-arching parabola that descended onto the green batter\u2019s eye in straightaway center field for a three-run shot that made it 5-1.\n\nThat was after Julio Ur\u00edas, the third Los Angeles pitcher and the one charged with the loss, began the fifth by serving up a hard liner by Trea Turner, who finished with three hits. Anthony Rendon delivered a run-scoring single that made it 2-1, one of his three RBIs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Max Scherzer's season-saving, seven-inning pitching performance and Ryan Zimmerman's three-run homer lifted the wild-card Washington", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/42934f_nlds-dodgers-nationals-baseball-71238-los-angeles-dodgers-joc-pederson-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
