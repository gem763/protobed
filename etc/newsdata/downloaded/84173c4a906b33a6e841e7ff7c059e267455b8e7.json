But in an effort to stop Mr Kupperman from doing so, the White House on Friday said the president had invoked \u201cconstitutional immunity,\u201d leaving Mr Kupperman uncertain about what to do.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff obviously cannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches, and he is aware of no controlling judicial authority definitively establishing which branch\u2019s command should prevail,\u201d the suit said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe implications of the suit, filed in federal court in Washington, extend beyond Mr Kupperman. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, also represents Mr Bolton and is likely to address congressional requests for his testimony in a similar fashion. House Democrats have had discussions with Cooper in recent days about Bolton testifying but have not subpoenaed him.\n\nDemocrats believe Mr Kupperman and Mr Bolton could be significant witnesses for their investigation. Unlike several of the administration officials who have already testified, they were both close advisers of Trump, dealt directly with him on Ukraine policy and could testify about what Mr Trump said behind closed doors.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal 1/19 Donald Trump Accused of abusing his office by pressing the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden, who may be his Democratic rival in the 2020 election. He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/19 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff. Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable. Expected to give evidence to Congress voluntarily and in secret.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d.

He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works.

On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry.

He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.

After Mr Bolton resigned on 10 September, Mr Kupperman took over as the acting national security adviser. The next day, Mr Trump released the $391m (\u00a3305m) in aid that he had withheld.\n\n\u201cConstitutional immunity\u201d is essentially executive privilege on steroids. Mr Kupperman said in the lawsuit that Mr Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, had ordered him not to comply with the subpoena.\n\nThe president\u2019s legal team apparently issued the same advice it had given other former top White House aides, like Mr Cipollone\u2019s predecessor, Donald McGahn, who had been asked to testify before lawmakers in the spring.\n\nMr McGahn defied the subpoena, and in August, the House Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit seeking an order requiring him to comply. That litigation is not yet resolved.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "A key witness in the Donald Trump\u00a0impeachment investigation has filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to rule on whether he can testify, a move that raises new doubts about whether the president's closest aides, like the former national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton, will be able to cooperate with the inquiry.", "authors": ["Michael S Schmidt"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/11/john-bolton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
