ETH price is likely to start a fresh increase above $188.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nRecently, there was a downside correction in Ethereum from the $200 resistance area. ETH price declined below the $190 and $185 levels. However, the $175 area provided support and the price remained well above the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nA swing low was formed near $174 and the price started a fresh increase. It recovered above the $180 and $182 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $199 high to $174 low.\n\nAt the outset, the price is trading well above the $182 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nAn immediate resistance is near the $186 and $188 levels. More importantly, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $199 high to $174 low is near the $190 level to stop the upward move.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum must surpass the $188 and $190 resistance levels to continue higher in the near term. The next major resistance is near the $195 level, above which the price could revisit the $200 handle.\n\nOn the downside, there is a strong support forming near the $180 level and the 100 hourly SMA. If there is a bearish break below the $180 support, the price could decline towards the $175 support. Any further losses may perhaps lead the price towards the $170 pivot level.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is showing a lot of positive signs above the $180 support area. A convincing close above the $188 and $190 resistance levels could set the pace for another rally towards the $200 area. If no, there is a risk of an extended downside correction towards the $170 zone.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is climbing higher and is well above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $180\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $190", "description": "Ethereum price is showing positive signs above $180 versus the US Dollar, while bitcoin is correcting lower.
