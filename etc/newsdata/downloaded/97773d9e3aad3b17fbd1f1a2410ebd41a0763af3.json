A full English served by BA included a serving of scrambled eggs that was virtually unrecognisable because of its weird colour and consistency, alongside sweaty mushrooms.\n\nNick Avery, who was flying with the Indian carrier SpiceJet, said: \u2018I now know why most passengers opted for a curry breakfast.\n\n\u2018Apparently, it was an omelette, sausages and hash brown. It tasted as good as it looked.\u2019\n\nDavid Ball flew business class with British Airways from London Gatwick to Mauritius and assumed the higher fare would afford him a luxurious experience. However, those hopes quickly died when he was presented with a lumpen chicken Biriyani.\n\nOn the way back David was treated to a 'so-called' omelette for his breakfast, calling the meal 'disgusting'\n\n\u2018The steward was raving to all in my section about the treat we were going to enjoy,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018What you see in the picture is a chunk of dry chicken, a piece of dead, burnt cauliflower, a spoonful of gunk and overcooked rice. Awful.\u2019\n\nHis return journey in World Traveller Plus, which is a premium economy, was no better when he was served a \u2018so-called omelette\u2019 for breakfast.\n\n\u2018It tasted exactly as it appears in the photo - disgusting,\u2019 he said.\n\nOne Norwegian passenger shared her chicken and mash 'slop' swimming in grease in it's plastic container\n\nAnother BA premium economy flyer was just as disappointed with his upgraded meal. He described his beef with roasted vegetables and mashed potato as \u2018overcooked and burnt on the edges\u2019.\n\nA passenger with Norwegian was dismayed to find her chicken and mash swimming in grease in a meal she described as \u2018slop\u2019.\n\nA turkey ham and Swiss cheese \u2018baguette\u2019 was equally underwhelming and wrongly described with a scant filling and only a vague attempt to butter the bread.\n\nEtihad customer Richard Cooney was unimpressed with the \u2018poor quality and tasteless\u2019 offering on his flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi in March.\n\nAnother passenger flying with Norweigan revealed their less than appealing turkey ham and Swiss cheese sandwich\n\nHe described the sweetcorn, pea and rice starter as \u2018cold with no seasoning\u2019 while the cake was so \u2018dry and tough\u2019 it resembled a brick.\n\nDavid Cann had a memorable dining experience on-board little-known Uzbekistan Airways for all the wrong reasons.\n\nHe said: \u2018It was billed as chicken with aubergine and pasta, which sounded promising. It tasted like an assortment of cardboard packaging.\u2019\n\nThose with special dietary requirements can find their in-flight options are even more limited and unpalatable.\n\nRichard Cooney was shocked by the meal he was given when he flew with Ethiad airlines in March, and said the cake dessert 'resembled a brick'\n\nMeanwhile another British Airways passenger Yannis Psomadakis, who has complex dietary requirements, was served a revolting low lactose option of cod with spinach and pulses\n\nOne BA passenger and coeliac requested a gluten-free option only to end up with a vegetarian/vegan \u2018one size fits all\u2019 meal.\n\nShe said: \u2018What did it taste like? Disgusting. Inedible. Mushy without flavour. I\u2019d brought a bag of crisps which I had to eat as I was very hungry.\u2019\n\nBA flyer Yannis Psomadakis who has a complicated set of dietary requirements, finds its particularly difficult \u2018being captive on long-haul flights\u2019. He had a horrible experience with a low lactose option of cod with spinach and pulses.\n\nAirlines UK, which speaks carriers, said it was unable to comment on the Which? research.", "description": "A picture gallery of meal horrors collated by members of Which ? has revealed revolting plane meals, including include a \u20ac10 Irish breakfast on Ryanair and an 'awful' BA chicken biryani.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20366368-0-image-a-26_1572427147974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
