(Picture: BBC)\n\nRic Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) faces a stark and terrible choice: treat his brain tumour with drugs and sit at home fading away, unable to work, eventually being confined to bed \u2013 or take the high-risk surgery offered by Max McGerry (Jo Martin), an operation that\u2019s never been successfully tried on a human being and which could leave him either dead or severely impaired. \u2018See how many words you can string together once she\u2019s done with you,\u2019 as Serena (Catherine Russell) put it, with gut-wrenching honesty.\n\nAt the end of tonight\u2019s episode Ric\u2019s mind was made up. He would go for the surgery. \u2018I\u2019m choosing life,\u2019 he told Serena, because \u2018if I can\u2019t be a surgeon, what is the reason for my existence?\u2019 Whether he survives the procedure is unclear at this point. All we know for sure is that the autumn trailer didn\u2019t end well, with Ric\u2019s heart stopping during surgery as an anguished Serena tried to keep him alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trailer also features some characters who might be memories, visions, hallucinations or angels. They\u2019re the ghosts that Ric spoke of at the end of this episode, the \u2018ghosts that still haunt me.\u2019 For a few moments we were inside Ric\u2019s mind, hearing him think about Leo: \u2018I should have realised something was wrong.\u2019 He also thought about Diane: \u2018I wasn\u2019t there when she needed me the most.\u2019 But who are Diane and Leo, the ghosts who still haunt Ric after so many years?\n\nLeo Griffin was Ric\u2019s son. Played by Junior Laniyan in 2002-3 and Daon Broni in 2004, Leo was a promising medical student whom Ric thought would go on to a great career as a CT surgeon. Leo and Ric had a turbulent relationship and when Leo died of a heroin overdose in series 10 Ric reproached himself for not being more involved in his son\u2019s life. It\u2019s something that has been a deep source of regret to him ever since.\n\nRegrets\u2026 he\u2019s had a few (Picture: BBC)\n\nDiane Lloyd (Patricia Potter) worked at Holby City from 2002 to 2007 and right from the beginning she had a connection with Ric Griffin \u2013 it was revealed she was his ex-girlfriend. The relationship between them was on-and-off for the whole time she was in the show, although both of them had other relationships. Diane was even married to obstetrician Owen Davis, but in a special episode set in Ghana she and Ric rekindled their feelings for each other. Their relationship finally ended when Ric introduced Diane to his fianc\u00e9e Thandie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiane\u2019s life took a downward spiral and she was killed when her car was hit by a train, in an incident that was ruled as suicide. Following this, Thandie accused Ric of still being in love with Diane and he didn\u2019t deny it. Ric went to say goodbye to Diane in the chapel of rest in a scene which Hugh Quarshie recently described as the saddest moment he\u2019s had to film in his long Holby career.\n\nSo it\u2019s clear that the deaths of these two important people in his life have always troubled Ric and as he reflects on his own mortality they\u2019re very much in his thoughts. But will their appearance mean forgiveness and peace for him \u2013 or does it mean he\u2019s about to join them in the afterlife?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
