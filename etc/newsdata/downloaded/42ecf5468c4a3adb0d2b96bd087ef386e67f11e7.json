Whoever their Pollster is, they suck.'\n\nNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was seen talking with Fox Network owner Rupert Murdoch before a game against the New York Giants at Gillette Stadium Thursday\n\nMurdoch met with AG William Barr at his New York home on Wednesday after a Fox News report showed the majority of Americans want Trump impeached and removed\n\nTrump vented on Twitter, saying Fox News pollsters 'suck,' after they found 51 per cent of registered U.S. voters want Congress to impeach him and remove him from office\n\n'But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days,' POTUS continued. 'With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore.'\n\n'It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!' he sniffed.\n\nThat evening Murdoch didn't appear to be too concerned as he was pictured talking to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft at a New York Giants game inside the Gillette Stadium, Foxborough that night.\n\nThis week Kraft filed a complaint against Palm Beach State Attorney Dave Aronberg, just a few months after the Florida office was forced to delay criminal proceedings against the 78-year-old businessman who had been charged with two counts of soliciting a prostitute.\n\nThe filmed incidents that happened on back-to-back days at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.\n\nMurdoch and Kraft chatted around as they watched the teams warm up before an NFL football gameThursday\n\nMurdoch met with Kraft the week Kraft filed a complaint against Palm Beach State Attorney just a few months after the Florida office was forced to delay criminal proceedings against him for charges on two counts of soliciting a prostitute\n\nThose tapes are now high on the list of materials Kraft would like prosecutors to turn over but they have not, which is why his is now demanding declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe two men enjoyed the game as Trump fumed according to two White House officials who said Thursday he is becoming increasingly frustrated by daytime news anchors and paid pundits who take pointed shots at him.\n\nThe morning show 'Fox & Friends,' along with evening opinion hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, have been reliable cheerleaders for the Trump administration.\n\nBut Trump directed his anger to more impartial voices Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is increasingly frustrated by Fox News Channel daytime anchors and paid pundits who take pointed shots at him, two White House officials said Thursday\n\nNapolitano has denied in the past that he has ever asked Trump for a judicial appointment. In recent months he has morphed into a reliable critic, enraging the president by offering legal analyses that conclude he has committee impeachable offenses.\n\nFox News polls have been uniformly unfavorable to the president since a month after his inauguration, with 30 polls in a row finding more Americans disapprove of his job performance than approve. The same can be said of most national opinion surveys.\n\nThe network released 23 presidential polls in 2015 and 2016 simulating head-to-head contests between Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. She prevailed in 18 of them.\n\nTrump came out on top in the last 13 of 22 Fox News polls published during the Republican primary season.\n\nWednesday's poll results indicated that 51 per cent of registered voters believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, a nine-point jump from the previous survey on July 19.\n\nAnother 4 per cent said the president should be impeached but not removed. Forty per cent opposed impeachment completely.\n\nThe president lashed out at Fox News in August after news anchor Sandra Smith interviewed Democratic National Committee Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa. He tweeted that the press flack was 'spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback' from Smith.\n\n'The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!' Trump vented.\n\n'Fox hires \u201cgive Hillary the questions\u201d @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win,' he tweeted at the time.\n\nFox on-air personalities fired back.\n\n'Fox News isn\u2019t supposed to work for you,' the network's senior political analyst Brit Hume tweeted.\n\n'We don't work for you,' added contributor and Fox radio host Guy Benson.\n\nHinojosa blasted the president hours later on MSNBC, saying that 'the fact that he is attacking a Democratic staffer and believes he has control of Fox News is really something else. It tells you a lot about the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News.'\n\n'This man is running scared. It is laughable,' she said.", "description": "Rupert Murdoch was involved in private talks with Attorney General William Barr Wednesday as President Donald Trump grew increasingly hostile toward his Fox News Network.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com", "David Martosko For For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19604032-0-image-a-34_1570821587573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
