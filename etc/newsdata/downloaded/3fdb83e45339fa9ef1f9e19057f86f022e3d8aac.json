This repo operation will be conducted with Primary Dealers for up to an aggregate amount of $75 billion. Securities eligible as collateral in the repo include Treasury, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Primary Dealers will be permitted to submit up to two propositions per security type. There will be a limit of $10 billion per proposition submitted in this operation. Propositions will be awarded based on their attractiveness relative to a benchmark rate for each collateral type and are subject to a minimum bid rate of 2.10 percent.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call yesterday\u2019s session a nail-biter, but the entire session had an anxious feeling as investors braced for the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the subsequent question-and-answer period. Meanwhile, the experts were whistling past the graveyard, ignoring the fact that the Federal Reserve had to inject cash into the repo market for the first time in a decade.\n\nYou may remember on September 11, 2008, when Tim Geithner told Hank Paulson of Lehman Brothers that he needed $230 billion to support their repo program and to keep trades afloat. Since then, the Fed has printed so much cash that the last thing anyone would expect is that the trading system could run dry.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s balance sheet swelled to $4.52 trillion by January 2015, and most recently, $4.44 trillion in January 2018. Now, the balance sheet is only $3.77 trillion.\n\nAs for cash in circulation, $1.7 trillion U.S. dollars are floating around in the system.\n\nNothing to See Here, Folks\n\nThe Fed intervention in the repo market was somewhat commonplace before the Great Recession. The market meltdown and seasoned investing expert\u2019s kind of yawned. This was just a unique series of events and nothing to be alarmed about.\n\nWhen the \u201cexperts\u201d say \u2018be cool, all is well,\u2019 I tend to worry a little more.\n\nThere will be more intervention this morning, so we\u2019ll see just how cool we should be. On that note, you have to wonder if folks at the Federal Reserve were as cool as Wall Street mavens. There has been a lot of anxiety at the Fed for some time about the institution\u2019s ability to control short-term rates.\n\nYesterday, the effective fed funds rate rocketed to the higher end of the 2.25% rate, overnight general collateral repurchase agreements climbed almost 600 basis points (bps) to 8.75% and then settled at 7.25%. The New York Fed came to the rescue. It looked as though the kerfuffle was over until late in the session when the issue was raised again.\n\nWhat\u2019s Up, Player?\n\nAll day long, wearing a mask of false bravado\n\nTrying to keep up the smile that hides a tear\n\nBut as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again\n\nHow I wish to God that you were here\n\nBaby come back, any kind of fool could see\n\nThere was something in everything about you\n\nBaby come back, you can blame it all on me\n\nI was wrong, and I just can't live without you\n\n-Player\n\nLate into yesterday\u2019s session, DoubleLine Capital founder Jeffrey Gundlach made comments to Reuters that the episode made it more than likely the Fed would start to repurchase assets \u201cpretty soon.\u201d That put a spark into the market, which saw all the major indices close at the highs of the session.\n\nHis comments and observation mean Jay Powell & Co could be singing \u201cBaby Come Back\u201d to Quantitative Easing (QE), as they turn the money printing machine back on. The speculation sent stocks higher as 9 out of 11 sectors finished higher.\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.26% Communication Services (XLC) +0.10% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.61% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.55% Energy (XLE) -1.39% Financials (XLF) +0.11% Health Care (XLV) +0.15% Industrials (XLI) -0.05% Materials (XLB) +0.81% Real Estate (XLRE) +1.41% Technology (XLK) +0.41% Utilities (XLU) +0.87%\n\nHow Big Is the Cut?\n\nThat kind of speculation also has many wondering if the Fed could go as deep as a 50-basis point cut today. Heading into the FOMC gathering, the Street was sure of two more rate cuts this year with a chance of a third one.\n\nWall Street Consensus Fed Rate Range Consensus 2.00 to 2.25 3% 1.75 to 2.00 31% 1.50 to 1.675 46% 1.25 to 1.50 19%\n\nThe plot thickens.\n\nPortfolio Approach", "description": "Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkOPERATING POLICYStatement Regarding Repurchase OperationSeptember .09/18/2019 19:23:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/76105473-2de5-44a2-b1d1-c1b10b6c6076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
