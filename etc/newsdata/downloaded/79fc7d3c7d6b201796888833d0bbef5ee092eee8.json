Bode Miller's wife Morgan, 32, shared with followers how a rainbow appeared above her daughter Emeline's image in a video she shared\n\nWatching over: Morgan (pictured with Emeline) said she thought the rainbow was caused by her late daughter, who died last year in a tragic drowning accident\n\nHaving fun: The rainbow moment comes from a video of Morgan's four-year-old son Nash running around in a dinosaur costume\n\n'You guys! Did anyone else see this rainbow orb over her pictures? My baby girl is seriously everywhere,' Morgan wrote over an image grab from the video she shared.\n\nHer baby girl, who they called Emmy, is in a picture on the wall seen in the video and then directly above her image is a rainbow.\n\nSeeing the rainbow over her daugher's image comes as Morgan is currently 38 weeks pregnant with twins. She has been updating followers about her pregnancy by sharing bump pictures on her Instagram.\n\nBut her daughter Emmy still remains close to her mind as the family prepares to welcome the two new babies in a matter of weeks.\n\nEarlier this month, Morgan shared a mirror selfie of herself at 36 weeks. At the time, she tagged the picture with a hashtag stating 'I'm going crazy', hinting the mom is ready to welcome her new twins to the world sooner rather than later.\n\nBut the twins have refused to budge and are instead comfortable staying in their mother for a little bit longer. The babies are due on November 11.\n\nIn the picture shared two weeks ago was also Morgan's phone case, which showed a picture of Emmy.\n\nThe couple announced they were pregnant with twins in August on both Instagram and when appearing on the Today show.\n\nReady for her babies: Her post comes as Morgan is currently 38 weeks pregnant with twins\n\nGoing crazy: She has been sharing multiple bump updates with followers, including one at 36 weeks where she confessed she was 'going crazy'\n\nExciting! Bode Miller and his wife announced they were expecting in August, just 14 months after they lost their daughter Emmy in a tragic drowning accident\n\nDouble trouble! Bode and Morgan have three sons already, six-year-old Samuel, four-year-old Nash, and 10-month-old Easton, as well as 11-year-old daughter Neesyn\n\nIn August, Morgan described the babies as a 'miracle' pregnancy, one that she believed her daughter Emmy had 'her hand' in.\n\n'From the day I met my husband, he has always said he wanted identical twin boys born on his birthday,' Morgan wrote on Instagram while sharing several images of her four children posing with balloons spelling out the word 'twins'.\n\n'We are due on the lucky day/angel number of 11/11 which is not far off from @millerbode birthday of 10/12. From the beginning of this pregnancy, we knew Emmy had her hands in this miracle somehow.'\n\nBode, an Olympic alpine ski racer, and his wife announced the news of their pregnancy almost exactly one year after they lost Emmy.\n\nThe death happened when Morgan was pregnant with her youngest child Easton, which made the moment more conflicting for the family.\n\n'Losing a child while pregnant was the most confusing experience of my life,' she wrote at the time.\n\n'The conflict of emotions from what was pure joy turned to guilt and terror overnight. How could I love this baby the way I loved Emmy? Was it okay to love this baby the way I loved Emmy? It felt like by loving my son, I was trying to replace her.\n\n'The fear of birthing my son and what that meant .....a monumental step forward....proof that time continued without her when all I wanted was for time to stop. But let me say this....I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.'\n\nTragic: Emmy drowned in a neighbor's swimming pool in June last year when she was just 19 months old. Her picture was featured on Morgan's phone case in a selfie (right)\n\nCelebration! The couple appeared on the Today show in August and also shared their news on Instagram for followers\n\nDevastating: The news of the couples new twins is bittersweet, though, as the couple continues to grieve the loss of their daughter\n\nShe continued: 'Easton provided us an even closer bond to his sister. The moment I heard his cry, something sparked back alive in my soul. Hope. Love. I\u2019m not sure.\n\n'But in that moment, I knew I was Mom and my kids deserved the world from me. Everything was going to be okay. My joy and grief could coexist. Now, I can actually say with joy and excitement that we are expecting identical twin boys.'\n\nBode and Morgan have three sons, six-year-old Samuel, four-year-old Nash, and 10-month-old Easton, and a daughter Neesyn, 11, from Bode's previous relationship.\n\nThe couple was attending a neighbor's party last June when their daughter, who was just 19 months old at the time, ended up in the pool.\n\nEmmy was rescued from the water but paramedics were unable to revive her, and she later died in hospital.", "description": "The former Olympic ski racer's wife Morgan Beck, 32, shared a video of her four-year-old son Nash running in a dinosaur costume.
