He has just 13 at-bats this month. Suzuki\u2019s only trip to the plate since Sept. 5 came Saturday when he had a pinch-hit double in Miami.\n\n\u201cHe wants to play,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cHe wants to be out there.\u201d\n\nBut with the team being cautious, Raudy Read started at catcher in the first game of Tuesday\u2019s doubleheader at home against the Philadelphia Phillies. It was just Read\u2019s second start of the season and the third of his major league career.\n\nRead went hitless in four at-bats, but caught six different pitchers in the Nationals\u2018 4-1 win. Five Washington relievers combined to retire 15 in a row with the 25-year-old Read behind the plate.\n\n\u201c(Read) gave a really good target,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe had a good game plan. He called a really good game.\u201d\n\nYan Gomes, 32, started at catcher for the second game Tuesday with ace Max Scherzer on the mound. Martinez noted, however, that if Tuesday were the National League wild card, there was a good chance Suzuki would have gotten the start. Martinez said Suzuki wanted to catch Scherzer, who is Washington\u2019s likely wild card starter on Oct. 1.\n\nMartinez spoke with Suzuki and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard late Monday.\n\n\u201c(Suzuki is) about 70-75 percent right now,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s progressing, so I\u2019d rather not push the envelope right now and just get him ready hopefully by Friday or Saturday. Then by Friday or Saturday, he\u2019ll be ready to catch.\u201d\n\nSuzuki was available to pinch hit Tuesday. He is hitting .263 with 16 home runs and 61 RBI in 82 games this season.\n\nGomes was hitting .226 with 11 homers in 40 RBI in 93 games going into the nightcap Tuesday. He hit his fifth homer in his last 22 games in Monday\u2019s win over the Phillies. Gomes has been durable in Suzuki\u2019s absence. Suzuki threw from 120 feet before Monday\u2019s game and is eager to get back behind the plate.\n\n\u201cThis is what you play for,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cYou kind of leave it all on the table now, and whatever you got, you got. Everybody\u2019s tired, everybody\u2019s getting to that finish line and keep grinding away.\u201d\n\nSuzuki has thrown out just five of 50 would-be base stealers this year. He joked that he can\u2019t get any worse.\n\n\u201cI know my numbers didn\u2019t look like it, but I felt good,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t throw out anybody before. So why not? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d\n\nMartinez cautioned that if Suzuki re-injures his elbow, \u201che is pretty much done for the season.\u201d Another issue for the Nationals to consider is Suzuki is under contract for 2020. The Nationals certainly don\u2019t want to hinder his availability for the start of next season.\n\nBut for now, the Nationals are preparing for the playoffs. Washington ends its regular season at home Sunday against the Cleveland Indians.\n\n\u201cSince we have time, I want to get him as close to 100 percent as we can,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
