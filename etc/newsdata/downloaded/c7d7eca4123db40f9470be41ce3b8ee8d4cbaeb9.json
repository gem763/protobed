This is really deplorable behavior. I hope that the Obamas realize that these actions are not consistent with the values they preach and that they instruct their attorneys to immediately dismiss the petition.\"\n\nWhile the Obamas tried to argue both companies could co-exist, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office saw otherwise, believing they were too similar and related in services.\n\n\"The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer,\u201d the agency said.\n\nInstead of backing down, the Obamas\u2019 attorney mounted a challenged and filed a petition to cancel the Higher Ground Enterprises trademark, claiming it was not being use at the time of its 2016 registration.\n\nApparently the Obamas don\u2019t truly live by their word\u2014that \u201cwhen they go low, we go high.\u201d\n\nThe trademark battle comes as the Obamas have a deal with Netflix to produce films and television series.", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:05:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/72/382277dc-bd63-47f1-82c7-9d0d1cbe4219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
