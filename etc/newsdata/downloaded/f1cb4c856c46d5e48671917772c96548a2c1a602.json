This so-called yield-curve inversion is important because similar kinks have preceded all seven US recessions since 1950. Harvey first drew attention to the yield-curve signal in his 1986 dissertation at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nWhen Harvey published his dissertation, the inverted yield curve had preceded four recessions. It's since gone on to indicate three more, including the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nNow that the indicator is inverted again, he's been cautioning investors and businesses about what it means and how to prepare.\n\nIn an earlier interview with Bloomberg, Harvey said that the indicator was flashing \"code red\" and that it was \"really hard to ignore.\"\n\nHarvey also pointed out that the meaning of the indicator has shifted slightly since the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 and that actually could be a good thing. Now, he says, consumers, investors, and businesses that pay attention to the curve as a leading indicator (preceding a recession by six to 18 months) can slow down spending and prepare to make it through a downturn.\n\nWhile spending less can lead to slower growth, it can also be seen as risk management, Harvey told Brown. He doesn't think that this is a \"self-fulfilling prophecy,\" or that the indicator could cause a recession by damaging sentiment.\n\nBecause his model suggests slower growth \u2014 and is not the only indicator reflecting it \u2014 it has given an accurate signal even if the US does dodge a recession, he told Bloomberg. His hope is that because the indicator is getting more notice after the latest financial crisis, it might actually help the US steer clear of another one.\n\n\"If we go into recession next year, it's not going to be a surprise\" as it was with the global financial crisis, he told Bloomberg.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Duke University Professor Campbell Harvey, the inventor of the inverted yield curve as a recession indicator, said investors should pay attention to the l...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9cdc66122bd5046c4e1f4c-2400/screen-shot-2019-10-08-at-25712-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
