In the last year, 900 officers were hired.\n\nThree private ambulances arrive at Tilbury Port to remove the remaining victims this morning\n\nFloral tributes have been left at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays this morning\n\nMr Lilley told The Times there is a 'notorious' lay-by near the port where migrants ditch their documents so UK authorities don't know where to repatriate them to.\n\nHe added: 'Minibuses wait there at night for them to arrive. Last summer during the heatwave I gave water bottles to two five-year-old girls as they looked desperate.\n\n'They were standing by the side of the road in a group of about 15. At the lay-by you see the lorries pull up and the migrants pop their heads out to see if it's safe.\n\n'On many occasions I've seen minibuses pull up and they jump in and are driven off. It's so organised.'\n\nPolice at the industrial estate in Grays in Essex today after 39 bodies were discovered in a lorry\n\nPolice still present on the industrial estate in Grays this morning following the grim discovery\n\nMr Lilley said security is 'lax' at the port, with an X-ray scanner on a customs and excise lorry arriving once every two months for a day to scan vehicles arriving.\n\nThe driver of the truck was 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Northern Ireland\n\nThe local resident, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said the deaths were 'heartbreaking' and left him upset - but he was not surprised by what happened.\n\nIt follows the National Crime Agency warning in 2016 that people-smugglers were switching to Purfleet because it was 'less busy' than other UK entry points.\n\nThe incident on Wednesday has raised questions about border checks and whether the authorities have done enough to tackle trafficking gangs.\n\nThis May the NCA warned that Belgian ports such as Zeebrugge \u2013 from where the contained travelled to Purfleet - were becoming people-smuggling hotspots.\n\nAn earlier report from the Border Force also said Zeebrugge was a key concern.\n\nAsked about security at Purfleet, a Home Office spokesman said this week: 'I cannot comment on the specific deployment of Border Force staff and security technology.'\n\nJanet Lilley, who lives by the port in Purfleet, said that around a decade ago she started to notice people 'wandering around with suitcases, backpacks' and they 'kept asking where's the station' in broken English.\n\nLorries are pictured outside the Purfleet Thames Terminal in Essex on Wednesday\n\nThe 61-year-old said that dozens of torn-up pages of passports have blown into her garden and that she reported this to police.\n\n'Over the last few years it's got worse,' she said. 'People would come strolling out of the docks, get in the vans and that's it, they drive off.'\n\nShe said the people coming out are 'acting suspiciously, they're dishevelled' and that the port does not have a passenger terminal. 'It's so sad,' she said.\n\n'I can't imagine a worse death. I know they shouldn't be there because they're trying to get in illegally, but the point is they're humans and they're being exploited.'\n\nAn aerial view of Purfleet Port (file image) where 39 Chinese people were found dead this week\n\nShe claimed that security at the port is 'virtually non-existent'. 'It's a magnet for illegals,' she said.\n\nLee Tubby, 45, who lives opposite the port, said he has seen people 'climbing out the top and out the back' of lorries and cutting the plastic roof covering to climb through.\n\n'We've had people just come out of the port knocking on the door asking for shoes, asking for water,' he said.\n\nAnother made a bonfire under a bench to cook some food after he was chased out of the port by security, he said.\n\nPurfleet in Essex is said to 'come alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants\n\nThe forklift truck driver said there was a lack of staff and that groups of illegal immigrants were able to get away after they were stopped.\n\n'They've got one security guard with them or one police officer and when they decide they're going to bolt, what do you do? Your hands are tied.'\n\nHis neighbour Susan Bridge, 47, said she has seen vans waiting to pick people up, minibuses lined up and illegal immigrants walking along the road.\n\n'I wouldn't say it was even a secret to be perfectly honest,' the retail worker said. 'We all know that it's going on in this area.'\n\nMinibuses are said to meet lorries to take away the migrants following their arrival at Purfleet\n\nShe said people have alerted police to suspicious activity and illegal immigrants have been detained by the authorities but 'it continues to go on'.\n\n'Unless you have police and security checking every single lorry coming in and out then it's going to continue,' she said.\n\nLast night, police began moving the bodies found in the refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry as a 25-year-old man remains in custody on suspicion of murder.\n\nDetectives were granted more time to question the driver of the truck, Mo Robinson from Northern Ireland, after eight women and 31 men were discovered dead.\n\nThere is said to be a 'notorious' lay-by near the port where migrants ditch their documents\n\nYesterday evening, the first 11 victims were moved by a private ambulance with a police escort from the Port of Tilbury to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford.\n\nThe remaining bodies will be transported in stages, with police expecting all the victims to be moved to hospital by the end of the week.\n\nPost-mortem examinations will be carried out, but police warned the investigation will take 'some considerable time'.\n\nEssex Police Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said he had the 'utmost confidence' in his officers as the force leads its largest-ever murder investigation.\n\nPolice drive the lorry along a road from the scene at Waterglade Industrial Park on Wednesday\n\nIrish police are conducting follow-up inquiries in relation to the registrations and movements of the refrigerated container and the Irish-owned truck.\n\nQuestions have been raised about when the victims entered the sealed refrigerated trailer, where temperatures can be as low as -25C, as well as the full route of the unit.\n\nVigils have been held in London and Belfast to pay tribute to the victims and a book of condolence has been opened in Grays.", "description": "Former port security guard Gary Lilley, 61, has described how Purfleet on the River Thames in Essex 'comes alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/11/20175696-0-image-a-5_1571999994038.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
