When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides.\n\nThe eastern US states are also bracing for possible storm surges.\n\nWhere is it heading?\n\nMeteorologists are watching the track of Dorian, trying to predict how close it will come to the United States coastline. As Dorian batters Grand Bahama, it sits only 120 miles (190km) from West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nBut even if the eye of the storm does not make US landfall, tropical storm and hurricane-strength winds could still blast Florida and Georgia within days.\n\nEvacuations have been ordered in some coastal communities of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said the strength of the storm could not be underestimated.\n\n\"This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction. Do not put your life in jeopardy by staying behind when you have a chance to get out,\" he said, urging people to observe evacuation orders when they were issued.\n\nDorian's strength\n\nAt category five, Dorian was the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, with some gusts reaching 200mph (321km/h). It is the fifth Atlantic hurricane to reach the highest category in the last four years.\n\nHurricane Irma in 2017 was also category five and causing widespread damage across the Leeward Islands, Caribbean and Florida keys, damaging roads, buildings, airports and harbours.\n\nGrand Bahama was also hit by category five Hurricane Matthew in 2016 - many residents had yet to fully rebuild their houses before Dorian's arrival.\n\nHow hurricanes happen", "description": "Satellite images, maps and graphics showing where the category four storm will hit and the impact it is expected to have.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E3E/production/_108583811_c50fe8ad-1211-4391-b537-629192e8c99d.jpg"}
