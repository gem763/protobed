And unlike last year\u2019s football World Cup in Russia, when fares rose to over \u00a31,000 return for the short hop from London to Moscow, flight bargains are still widely available.\n\nThe England-France group match in Yokohama was called off ahead of Super Typhoon Hagibis. The organisers said: \u201cHagibis is predicted to be the biggest typhoon of the 2019 season and is highly likely to cause considerable disruption in the Tokyo, Yokohama and city of Toyota areas throughout Saturday, including likely public transport shutdown or disruption.\u201d\n\nBut games involving Scotland and Wales on Sunday elsewhere in Japan are likely to continue \u2013 with the knock-out stages of the tournament beginning on Saturday 19 October.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Rugby World Cup team of round three Show all 16 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

The capital and nearby Yokohama (half-an-hour from Tokyo by train) are the venues for all the remaining matches.\n\nBecause the numbers of fans travelling to Japan is tiny compared with a football World Cup, accommodation prices have remained low. This week rooms in modest business hotels \u2013 akin to a Premier Inn \u2013 were available for \u00a350, even in the capital.\n\n\u201cIf you want to ride that wave, and enjoy the atmosphere, it\u2019s an exciting time for travel to Japan,\u201d said Matthew Joslin of the Japan National Tourism Organisation.\n\n\u201cJust make the most of it. Throw yourself into Japan.\u201d\n\nMatch tickets are likely to become increasingly scarce as the number of remaining games dwindle, but Mr Joslin says enigmatically: \u201cI have heard that there are tickets percolating in certain places.\u201d\n\nFan zones are in operation in all the key venues.\n\nThe Foreign Office is advising fans in and around the Japanese capital: \u201cStay indoors and do not attempt to travel on Saturday.\u201d\n\nJapan Airlines is warning that all flights to the Tokyo airports of Haneda and Narita, as well as Nagoya Chubu and Osaka Kansai are expected to be cancelled or delayed, with further disruption on Sunday.", "description": "Despite the shock cancellation of England\u2019s match against France on Saturday, interest in travelling to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan is strong.
