Authorities expanded the evacuation zone overnight as the fire spread, and again on Sunday morning.\n\nThe Sonoma county sheriff pleaded with residents in the evacuation zone to get out immediately. \u201cYou cannot fight this. Please evacuate,\u201d Mark Essick said.\n\nHundreds of people arrived at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa throughout the night and into Sunday morning. Some came from senior care facilities. More than 300 people slept inside an auditorium filled with cots and wheeled beds. Scores of others stayed in a separate building with their pets.\n\nThe evacuations on Sunday forced some residents who had taken shelter in earlier established evacuation centers to move again, with officials setting up centers an hour\u2019s distance away in neighboring counties \u2013 in one instance, across the bay.\n\nSunday\u2019s evacuation orders also included parts of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 that was devastated by a wildfire two years ago. The Tubbs fire killed more than 20 people and left entire neighborhoods of the city scorched.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A firefighter walks by a house as it burns during the Kincade fire in Healdsburg, California, on Sunday.

His home burned down in the north Bay fires in 2017. \u201cWe just put a new metal roof on the house, he said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I left the last time.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthis time feels worse.\u201d\n\nHis daughter Jessica evacuated the horses at her ranch by the Pepperwood Preserve, which by Sunday was burning in places. She watched a neighbor\u2019s video of the fire on her phone. \u201cThe ranch isn\u2019t on fire yet,\u201d she reported back. \u201cSo far we\u2019re looking good. I\u2019ll be hopeful until they tell me not to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when people would be able to return to their homes. Although winds had slightly eased on Sunday morning, they were expected to remain fierce throughout the day.\n\n'Potentially historic': dangerous winds expected as fires burn across California Read more\n\nA fast-moving fire burning in Vallejo, a community north-east of San Francisco, forced the California Highway Patrol to shut down interstate traffic in both directions on Sunday and threatened the campus of the 1,200 student Maritime Academy. Dramatic footage from the fire shared on networks and social media showed flames raging near the Carquinez bridge.\n\nCraig Rose (@SmokeShowing911) Fire in Vallejo has burnt down to the water.

The seasonal winds, called \u201cel diablo\u201d winds in northern California, tore through Sonoma county at 90mph on Saturday night, tossing embers erratically and making fire containment ever more challenging for responders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the business 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a forecaster in the San Francisco office of the National Weather Service.\n\nA special kind of hell: fires, smoke and heat turn LA into a deadly paradise Read more\n\n\u201cJust the sheer intensity and the sustained duration of the winds. Not only does it carry sparks at least a mile but winds at these speeds pushes embers along the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nAnderson noted that during the 2017 wildfire season, which until that point had been the most destructive on record, gusting winds reached 90mph and lasted for four to six hours. In this case, winds have blown between 80 to 90mph for the past 12 hours, and were expected to continue for through most of the afternoon, he said Sunday morning.\n\nIn an incident that highlighted the ferocity of the blaze, Cal Fire said a firefighter and two civilians were overrun by the flames in Sonoma on Saturday, forcing the firefighter to shield the civilians with his fire shelter. All three were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, Cal Fire said.\n\nConcerns about the winds prompted the utility company PG&E to cut power to more than a million homes in northern California, just two weeks after the company had imposed an earlier round of blackouts.\n\nPG&E said the new blackouts were affecting about a million homes and businesses in 36 counties for 48 hours or longer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Authorities expanded the evacuation zone overnight, as the fire spread.

State officials concluded a PG&E transmission line sparked that fire.\n\nIn southern California, a wildfire on Thursday destroyed 18 structures in the Santa Clarita area north of Los Angeles. Nearly all the 50,000 residents ordered to evacuate because of the Tick fire were allowed back home after Santa Ana winds began to ease.\n\n\u201cIt has become normal for us,\u201d said Brenda Taylor, 46, on Friday after evacuating her home because of the Tick fire. She estimated that her family has had to evacuate eight or nine times due to fires in the last two decades. \u201cThis is life out here,\u201d she said.\n\nSheriff\u2019s officials said human remains were found within the wide burn area, but it\u2019s unclear if the death is connected to the blaze.\n\nThe Tick fire was 55% contained. Winds in southern California are expected to pick up on Sunday night, the weather service said.", "description": "185,000 evacuated as firefighters battle el diablo winds and governor calls state emergency as 2 million left without power", "authors": ["Susie Cagle", "Mario Koran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a98001e7fc868d892f1b38f569901da93ae361/0_159_4557_2735/master/4557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9cfa84cc331e785fe7081083546411ad", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
