Pet mamba around man's neck causes stir at KZN scrapyard", "language": "en", "text": "A man and his pet mamba, caused quite the stir at a local scrapyard in Port Shepstone.\n\nThe man was filmed on Wednesday, with the venomous green mamba around his neck.\n\nIn the video shot by Krushen Pillay, the man is seen casually pushing a bakkie with the snake.\n\n\"At first I thought it was a big rubber snake until I saw it move,\" said Pillay.\n\nThe man told Pillay that the snake was his pet and that he had groomed it since it was young.\n\n\"You can see this man wasn't afraid from the way he was playing with the snake and the way it was moving around him. It was so used to him,\" he said.\n\nPillay said the man told him that he had two more snakes at his home.\n\nVenomous pet snake?\n\nUpon watching the video, Nick Evans, owner of KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, confirmed that the snake is a highly venomous green mamba.\n\nHowever, he said he was concerned about the reptile's condition.\n\n\"In some parts of the world, like in India, snake charmers stitch the mouths closed. It's so sluggish,\" he said.\n\nDespite this, Evans noted that the snake looked bizarrely healthy.\n\nHe cautioned people against keeping mambas as pets.\n\n\"For a member of the public to keep a highly venomous snake is not recommended.\"", "description": "A man and his pet mamba, caused quite the stir at a local scrapyard in Port Shepstone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9462/6f2064d902244616ba143711382e0504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
