He must also agree to receive continued support from a \u201cmental coach\u201d while competing at events, and getting additional help in the offseason from a specialist in behavioral management.\n\nThe ATP said it also looked into comments by Kyrgios at the US Open, where he said the ATP was \u201cpretty corrupt,\u201d but determined the remarks did not constitute a \u201cmajor offense\u201d and hasn\u2019t applied further penalties.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nick Kyrgios has been handed a suspended 16-week ban from the ATP Tour following an investigation into his abusive behavior in a tournament in Cincinnati last month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/switzerland_tennis_laver_cup_75738_c0-165-3962-2475_s1770x1032.jpg?32e9a7c2f1d66c8e0f2029c76c7e76a43b5a186d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
