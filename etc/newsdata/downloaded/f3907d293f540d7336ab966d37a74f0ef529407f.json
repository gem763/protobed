BTC must climb above $8,400 and $8,500 to move back into a positive zone.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nThis past week, we saw a nasty decline from the $8,950 zone in bitcoin against the US Dollar. The price declined heavily and broke the key $8,500 support area. Moreover, there was a close below the $8,500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more losses below the $8,400 and $8,350 support levels. Recently, there was a recovery above the $8,400 level, but the price failed to gain pace above $8,450.\n\nAs a result, there was a fresh decline from the $8,472 high. During the decline, there was a break below a key ascending channel with support near $8,340 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair traded as low as $8,146 and it is currently correcting higher. It broke the $8,200 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,472 high to $8,146 low.\n\nAt the moment, the price is testing the $8,300 area. Besides, it seems like the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,472 high to $8,146 low is acting as a resistance. On the upside, there are many hurdles forming near the $8,350 and $8,400 levels. The key resistance is near the $8,400 level and the 100 hourly SMA. It also coincides with the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,472 high to $8,146 low.\n\nTherefore, a clear close above the $8,400 level might start a decent recovery. The next key resistance is near the $8,500 level, above which the price could test the $8,800 resistance. Conversely, if the price fails to recover above $8,350 or $8,400, it could resume its decline. An immediate support is near the $8,200 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is clearly trading in a bearish zone below $8,400 and the 100 hourly SMA. In the short term, there could be an upside correction, but a break above $8,400 won\u2019t be easy.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is currently losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is slowly climbing towards the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,200 followed by $8,150.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,350, $8,400 and $8,500.", "description": "Bitcoin price is trading in a negative zone below $8,400 against the US Dollar.
