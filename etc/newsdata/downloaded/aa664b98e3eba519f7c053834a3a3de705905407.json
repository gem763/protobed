The last team to win the World Series after losing Games 1 and 2 at home? The 1996 New York Yankees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to feel bad about ourselves. Reset and get ready to play baseball,\u201d Astros veteran right-hander Justin Verlander said. \u201cThey have a great ballclub. We\u2019re not clicking on all cylinders. But I don\u2019t think anybody should go home tonight and feel bad about themselves. We don\u2019t have time for that.\u201d\n\nBut the truth is, in two games in Houston, the Nationals did things to the Astros no team had done all year. They beat Gerrit Cole and Verlander, Houston\u2019s twin aces and the likely top two vote-getters in Cy Young voting; no team all year had beaten them back-to-back. The Astros hadn\u2019t lost back-to-back home games of any kind in nearly six weeks. But the Nationals are different than anything the 2019 Astros had seen before. They forced the Astros to throw extra pitches, pressured them into errors and got deep inside their heads.\n\nHow else to explain Jos\u00e9 Altuve\u2019s ill-fated attempt to steal third in the first inning with a left-handed batter at the plate? How else to explain Manager A.J. Hinch choosing to intentionally walk Nationals phenom Juan Soto in the middle of that seventh-inning debacle, after having steadfastly refused to issue a single intentional pass all season?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re way better than people think,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cObviously, those guys in the middle [of their lineup] get a lot of headlines, but the rest of that lineup, they can hit. They have good approaches. They change their approach. They adjust through the middle of the game. It\u2019s a grind. You have your work cut out for you when you go out there.\u201d\n\nThe Astros now turn to veteran right-hander Zack Greinke, Friday night in Game 3 at Nationals Park, to rescue their cratering season. They acquired Greinke in a blockbuster deal at the July 31 trade deadline with the vision of him starting in a Game 3 of a postseason series and pointing the Astros in the direction of a clinch. They figured a postseason rotation of Cole, Verlander and Greinke \u2014 with two Cy Young Awards, an MVP, four ERA titles and 17 all-star appearances between \u2014 would be nearly unbeatable.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way. For one thing, Greinke hasn\u2019t been the third co-ace the Astros envisioned this postseason, going 0-2 with a 6.43 ERA, having surrendered five homers in his 14 innings. And for another, Game 3 for the Astros is no longer about moving toward a clinch, but simply clinging to survival. In Washington, Greinke will be facing both a hostile environment and a Nationals lineup that has taken down his two more powerful rotation-mates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was somehow fitting that the Astros\u2019 final moments of recognizable Astro-ness on Wednesday night came in the bottom of the sixth, with a runner in scoring position and two chances to get him home. This was the sort of pivot point that had spelled the difference between winning and losing for the Astros all month.\n\nAt the time, they were working Strasburg over, the same way they had with Max Scherzer the night before, running up his pitch count, making him work for every strike and every out. They had the go-ahead runs on base, first and second, one out, and shortstop Carlos Correa at the plate. But Strasburg bore down, getting Correa to hit a broken-bat pop-up to second, then struck out rookie pinch-hitter Kyle Tucker to end the inning. What followed \u2014 the seventh-inning meltdown that blew open the game \u2014 was in the view of some in the Astros clubhouse the worst inning they had played all year.\n\n\u201cTo see it go that way,\u201d Verlander said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel great.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt this point, the Astros\u2019 failures with runners in scoring position is a full-blown crisis: since the start of the ALCS against the New York Yankees, the Astros are hitting just .127 and slugging .317 in those situations. In the regular season, those numbers were .268 and .503.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as saying, \u2018Hey, man, get a hit with a runner in scoring position,\u2019 \u201d Hinch said. \u201cThese guys are getting pitches, we\u2019re having some long at-bats. But we haven\u2019t found the results. So I think that\u2019s been the frustrating part of this series. I\u2019m not going to drag the ALCS into this. This is about the World Series, but whether you want to credit them or whether you want to put the pressure on us, [the Nationals] are winning these at-bats, and that\u2019s the difference in these games.\"\n\nIf the Astros go on to lose this World Series, the sudden disappearance of one of the most potent offenses of all time might be a mystery that is never solved. Those words, \u201cof all time,\u201d are not used lightly. By one advanced metric \u2014 wRC+, or weighted runs created plus, a measure of total offensive value, adjusted for park and league effects \u2014 the 2019 Astros rank second only to the famed \u201cMurderer\u2019s Row\u201d 1927 Yankees among the best offenses in history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros\u2019 .848 OPS (on-base plus slugging) this season led the majors. Essentially, that means the Astros\u2019 lineup in 2019 was like nine Reggie Jacksons (career OPS: .846). At home, the Astros\u2019 OPS this season swelled to .878, better than the career marks of Al Kaline, George Brett, Sammy Sosa or Christian Yelich.\n\nAnd in two games at Minute Maid Park against the Nationals, the Astros have been limited to seven runs and held to a collective OPS of .516.\n\nOne can\u2019t help but wonder whether the Astros are simply worn down by the collective toll of this fall \u2014 not only the five-game Division Series win over the Rays, or the six-game ALCS win over the Yankees, but also the stretch drive of the regular season. Throughout September, the Astros rode their starters hard in an effort to hold off the Yankees and win the most regular-season games, thus earning home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Cole and Verlander never missed a start, owing at least in part to their spirited battle for the Cy Young.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd now, they look like a team running out of fuel. Cole hadn\u2019t lost a decision since May 22, until the Nationals beat him in Game 1. Verlander had given up two or more runs in the first inning just twice in the 2019 regular season, but he has done it three times already this postseason. Third baseman Alex Bregman hadn\u2019t struck out three times in a game since May 27, 2018, until the Nationals did it to him in Game 1.\n\nThe Astros stuck close to their talking points after the Game 2 debacle. They brought up the 2017 ALCS, when they lost three straight to the Yankees \u2014 conveniently leaving out the part about all of those losses coming on the road \u2014 but held on to win the series in seven, then went on to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of teams win 107 games in a year,\u201d Correa said. \u201cThis is a special team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to D.C.,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Altuve said, \u201cand win some games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of baseball left,\u201d Bregman said.\n\n\u201cWe really only have one more opportunity to show what we can do,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to D.C. We can\u2019t wait around.\u201d\n\nBut somewhere deep down, the Astros understood their clearest path to winning this championship was to hold serve at home behind their twin aces, and give themselves some breathing room when the series shifts to Nationals Park.\n\nAnd now, over the past two games, that pathway was obliterated by a Nationals team that must remind the Astros of themselves at their best \u2014 relentless, energized and overflowing with confidence \u2014 if they can even remember what that felt like anymore.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:", "description": "Every quality that made the Astros a force during the regular season has seemingly evaporated in the World Series, leaving the AL champions staggered and searching for answers.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OGrGs8kMmIGHH6bqr0lxZPAH49E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSQ5XVHWBUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
