With Arcade, Giphy wants to get into gaming but with a more bite-sized approach that also plays nice with the open web. That way, the games can freely move across the internet like the best viral GIFs.\n\nArcade has three components. The first is the standard game playing feature. From its web app, which is accessible on desktop browsers or on mobile ones, you can see a series of playlists featuring popular premade games.\n\nGiphy Arcade will let you create a game using templates or remix an existing one\n\nThe experiences range from standard mobile-style endless runners to riffs on arcade classics like Breakout and Centipede. One noticeable difference is the art style: all of Giphy Arcade\u2019s games feature crude internet art pulled from popular GIFs, memes, emoji, and other artifacts of the web and pop culture. And almost every game has a simple one-tap or tap-and-drag mechanic that can be done with a mouse or your finger on a touchscreen.\n\nBut Giphy doesn\u2019t just want people to play its admittedly rudimentary web games. It wants internet users to \u201cremix\u201d them as well, which is Giphy\u2019s term for taking the same ingredients and developing a new twist on the game you just played. That typically means picking new art for the playable characters by searching Giphy\u2019s GIF database, choosing a different moving background image from the available collection, and selecting music from a list of tracks Giphy has created just for Arcade.\n\nYou can also go through the process of creating a game from the ground up, starting with one of eight templates that include some obvious nods to popular mobile and classic arcade titles, like \u201cFloppy Bard\u201d and \u201cBlast \u2018Em Up.\u201d\n\nThe final component to Giphy Arcade is the share function, which the company hopes will help the games created on the platform and the lightweight development tools used to make them spread far and wide. With just a link, anyone will be able to play a game you\u2019ve found on Arcade or created yourself, and that person can then either share it further or remix it first before sending it along to more people. And all of this is done on the web, without requiring you to download a new app.\n\n\u201cWhen exploring what games could look like for Giphy, we knew the experience had to be quick, shareable, and accessible for everyone, including people who don\u2019t necessarily have a history with gaming\u201d Nick Santaniello, a senior product engineer at Giphy, said in a statement. \u201cWith Giphy Arcade, we\u2019ve created an experience that provides not only instant fun for the player, but also a new way to add personalized expression and entertainment to conversations as they\u2019re happening.\u201d\n\nGiphy is partnering with Wendy\u2019s to start, showcasing the brand deals Arcade could foster\n\nThe Giphy Arcade platform is launching today, and it\u2019s doing so with a brand deal in place with fast-food chain Wendy\u2019s. That\u2019s a strong indicator of how the company may be able to monetize this platform in the future, given that it does not intend to sell any games or let users charge for access either.\n\nThe Wendy\u2019s deal will make the company\u2019s logo, tagline, mascot, and signature food items available as game assets users can use to create new Arcade titles or remix existing ones. It\u2019s not hard to imagine this becoming a marketing strategy for other companies to experiment with, so long as Giphy Arcade actually gets the ground.\n\nBut to do that, Giphy needs to make sure its tools don\u2019t go unnoticed and that whatever games do get made on the platform get remixed and shared, so new users can find their way to Arcade and do the same. It\u2019s a tall order, especially on the open web and without any form of login system or traditional social networking infrastructure. But Giphy established itself as a vital tool in the social and messaging spaces by creating the GIF search engine and database other companies weren\u2019t able to do on their own. Perhaps it could do the same for GIF-powered games.", "description": "Giphy has announced the launch of Giphy Arcade, a gaming platform designed to let people play, create, and share mini web games as easily as they would animated GIFs.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hp9r8sUFJ3TqOd1mPVupoD_fys4=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19291700/giphy.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
