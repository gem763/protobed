Victory this weekend could also see the value of England\u2019s shirt deal with O2 soar above the current \u00a39m arrangement.\n\nOwen Farrell is in line to land the biggest deal in English rugby history if he lifts the World Cup\n\n\u2018Being captain of an England World Cup-winning team is a small but exclusive club and highly bankable,\u2019 said Andy Sutherden, whose work led to David Beckham becoming the first global face of Gillette and is now international head of brand consulting at Creative Artists Agency. \u2018If Owen Farrell lifts the World Cup, he will make more than Jonny. If he drops a goal to win the World Cup in the dying seconds, he definitely will.\n\n\u2018The advantage he has is that he\u2019s the captain and will therefore be more visible, which is a pre-requisite for higher value endorsement deals. It all starts with Owen. He is the pin-up. Everyone looks towards the half-backs.\u2019\n\nLarge companies are expected to gravitate towards their potential success, and their commercial value is enhanced by the squad\u2019s diversity.\n\nJason Robinson was the only Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) player in the 2003 team but this squad features 10, including Maro Itoje and Kyle Sinckler.\n\nJonny Wilkinson made millions after his heroics in 2003 but Farrell is expected to make more\n\n\u2018When a company holds a mirror up to its sponsorship, it needs to see a true reflection of its own values and beliefs,\u2019 said Sutherden. \u2018This is where rugby union triumphs. Two tries disallowed last Saturday \u2014 Sam Underhill and Ben Youngs. Nigel Owens speaks to Owen and there\u2019s not a word said. Get on with it. Companies like that show of morals.\n\n\u2018Everyone is talking about diversity and inclusion and we\u2019ve got a squad of 31 who personify that perfectly. Fast forward 16 years from 2003 and one third of the squad are from BAME backgrounds. That is a powerful statistic. Kyle Sinckler could 100 per cent be a Raheem Sterling type figure. He breaks stereotypes.\n\n\u2018Who is to say that rugby union is now only a sport for the middle-class played in certain schools by certain kids? That\u2019s not a new thing, but this is a high-profile stage to make an example of it. You\u2019ve got a handful of players who have written their exploits already. Itoje writes poetry. All of the guys with a distinctive back story are marketable individuals.\n\nThe fly-half's advantage is that he\u2019s the captain and will therefore be more visible\n\n\u2018If England win the World Cup, when the O2 deal expires in 2021 the RFU could reasonably expect \u00a33m a year inflation to \u00a312m, to match what AIG reportedly pay for the All Blacks shirt.\u2019\n\nLong-term financial rewards can be huge, with many of the 2003 World Cup winners still cashing in on their victory 16 years ago. Players will be able to take advantage of sporting endorsements, but the biggest bounty is likely to be for those who can break into the popular culture market.\n\n\u2018The names that have popularity beyond the sport are the players who normally cash in the most,\u2019 said Sutherden. \u2018Joe Marler, for example, could go beyond the sport and break into popular culture. He\u2019s the kind of guy who could appear on quiz shows, chat shows, Saturday night TV, the Jungle or Great British Bake Off. The career after the career is where a lot of the money can be made.\u2019", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY NIK SIMON: England's captain fantastic Owen Farrell is in line to land the biggest deal in English rugby history if he lifts the World Cup on Saturday.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/20/20396014-0-image-a-10_1572468668284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
