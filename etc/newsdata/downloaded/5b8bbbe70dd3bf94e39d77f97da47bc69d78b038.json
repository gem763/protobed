Gavin Newsom brings to mind the old joke about the boy who kills his parents and then begs the judge for mercy because he\u2019s an orphan. Like the shameless child, Gov. Newsom now looks to escape responsibility by scapegoating Big Oil for the state\u2019s exorbitant prices at the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to blame Californians for their own predicament \u2014 after all, they continue to embrace leftist politicians eager to expand the administrative state and to further burden entrepreneurs and job creators. But perhaps Gov. Newsom\u2019s stunt on gasoline prices will finally be too much to bear.\n\nProgressives have long sought to drive up energy prices in order to force a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama didn\u2019t even try to hide it, acknowledging in a 2008 interview that electricity prices would \u201cskyrocket\u201d under his proposals.\n\nThe same tactic applies to gasoline prices. Climate change warriors agitate for all sorts of restrictive and punitive measures against oil and gas producers, which lead to higher prices at the pump, in a calculated effort to move motorists out of their cars and into public transportation or electric vehicles.\n\nCalifornia is ground zero for this approach.\n\nBut Gov. Newsom argues that the state\u2019s gasoline prices \u2014 running about $4.13 a gallon on average \u2014 can\u2019t be explained simply by California\u2019s oppressive regulatory and tax structure. He implies that major oil companies are conspiring to drive prices up even further in order to boost their evil profits.\n\nNever mind that a recently released report by the state Energy Commission found no evidence of any illegal dealings. In addition, the Los Angeles Times reported, the report attributed more than 50 percent of California\u2019s higher costs to the usual suspects, including taxes, the state\u2019s cap-and-trade regulations and a low carbon-fuel standard.\n\nHigher retailer margins accounted for about one-third of the difference. But as The Wall Street Journal noted, that can also be explained by the state\u2019s anti-business climate. \u201cNotably,\u201d the paper editorialized, \u201cthe commission ignores that retail margins include labor costs, utilities, rent and taxes\u201d \u2014 all of which have soared thanks to progressive policies.\n\nGov. Newsom and Democrats in 2017 embraced a higher gasoline tax, and the levy jumped another 15 percent in July to nearly 50 cents a gallon. In fact, California governments make more money off the sale of each gallon than do oil companies and retailers.\n\nHaving pushed for policies that hammer drivers at the pump, Gov. Newsom now wants to blame others for the pain his state\u2019s motorists feel after every fill-up. Surely they\u2019re smart enough to see through this cynical con job.", "description": "Gov.
