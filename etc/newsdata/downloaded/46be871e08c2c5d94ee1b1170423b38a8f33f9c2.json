[SAMSUNG C&T]\n\nBeanpole celebrated its 30th anniversary Tuesday by announcing a very different future. It\u2019s going retro Korean.Samsung C&T\u2019s Beanpole, launched in 1989, said it will jettison the western, preppy styles of the past three decades and take inspiration from Korean styles in the 1960s and 1970s, when fashion changed with the influx of western styles, according to Jung Ku-ho, adviser at Beanpole.The new look has been applied to the spring and summer collection and may go abroad. Samsung C&T exported Beanpole to China, and the fashion company hopes to extend its reach to other countries.\u201cBeanpole tried to find the brand roots from the U.K. and sometimes from the United States,\u201d said Jeong at a press event held in Incheon on Tuesday. Beanpole is known to have taken inspiration from Ralph Lauren and Ivy League preppiness.\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure whether it would be the right move to continue that strategy for the brand and decided to tell our own story by finding our Korean heritage.\u201dThe brand is trying to endure in an era when brands quickly appear and disappear.\u201cJust like humans, a brand also has vitality,\u201d said Park Cheol-kyoo, executive vice president at Samsung C&T. \u201cWe hope to instill life into the brand to make it last over the next decades.\u201dApart from creating a new hangul (Korean alphabet) font for the brand logo, Beanpole changed the design of its stores to reflect Korean architecture from the \u201960s and \u201970s.The existing logo features a man in a top hat and tails riding a penny-farthing. The new logos feature both men and women, relatively younger, in different attire on a redesigned penny-farthing.The casual brand said it has also started to take the eco-friendly movement seriously and is selling clothes made from using recycled materials such as plastic bottles.Beanpole hopes to appeal to a wider age group, especially millennials and Generation Z.Part of that effort includes launching Beanpole\u2019s new line, 890311, which is the date Beanpole was born.Compared to classic Beanpole designs, items in the new line offer a larger variety of colors and retro designs, which young people these days are fond of, according to Jeong. Prices for the line are 10 to 20 percent lower than the usual Beanpole goods.\u201cYoung people these days love retro styles that were the trend before they were born,\u201d said Jeong. \u201cThey seem to love that retro vibe.\u201dBeanpole will open pop-up stores to demonstrate its new look.\u201cIn celebration of Beanpole\u2019s 30th anniversary, we have laid out various plans for brand renewal and plan to continuously evolve the brand,\u201d said Park Nam-young, division leader at Beanpole. \u201cWe hope to secure new customers and also communicate with millennials and Generation Z.\u201dBY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/15192735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
