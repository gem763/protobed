This week, Adobe released a patch for the program that corrected the issue.\n\nIn a forum post, a user reported a \u201creally loud screatching [sic] noise,\u201d that wouldn\u2019t let them turn it off. \u201cAfter it stopped, the speakers were really quiet, and after the next restart they\u2019re clearly blown.\u201d Others chimed in with the same complaints, and posted examples on YouTube.\n\nOn Friday, an Adobe representative confirmed in a reply on the forum that \u201ca small number of users reports an issue in Premiere Pro that could affect the speakers in the latest MacBook Pro,\u201d and pointed to a software patch.\n\nThe patch release notes that it fixed four issues: the loud noise \u201cwhen playing a project and adding an effect,\u201d the screech that occurred when a user switched between EQ presets, audio buzzing \u201cwhen routing audio to multiple track outputs with effects, and buzzing while \u201cplaying silence with an effect on a submix track.\u201d", "description": "Earlier this month, some Adobe Premiere Pro CC users reported that an audio bug blew their MacBook Pro speakers.
