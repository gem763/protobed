Right until his time in Chicago ran out.\n\nThe Cubs will have a new manager next season after Maddon and president of baseball operations Theo Epstein announced Sunday it was time for a change after three years of declining results since the franchise\u2019s historic World Series championship in 2016.\n\nThe situation was finalized when Maddon and Epstein met in Epstein\u2019s hotel room after Saturday\u2019s 8-6 victory at St. Louis, sharing some wine and reminiscing about their wildly successful partnership.\n\nMaddon\u2019s contract expired after Sunday\u2019s season-ending 9-0 loss to the NL Central champion Cardinals.\n\n\u201cChange can help you grow,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cAnd Joe said this change is going to help him grow and I feel it\u2019s going to help the Cubs grow, too.\u201d\n\nThe move begins what could be an active offseason for Chicago, and the 65-year-old Maddon once again becomes one of baseball\u2019s top free agents.\n\n\u201cI want to continue to do this, whatever\u2019s next out there, I want to be able to be on top of that too,\u201d said Maddon, who has used everything from petting zoos to T-shirts with slogans like \u201cEmbrace The Target\u201d and \u201cDo Simple Better\u201d to help his teams over the years.\n\n\u201cAll of it\u2019s been positive, man, and it\u2019s been interesting, entertaining and quite frankly for this time of year, feeling pretty good, feeling pretty eager about everything, so it\u2019s been a good year.\u201d\n\nWhile Maddon is out after five seasons, he is tied to Chicago forever after managing the Cubs to the 2016 championship for the franchise\u2019s first title in 108 years.\n\nChicago also made it to the NL Championship Series in 2015 and 2017, but it lost in the wild-card round last October and tumbled out of the playoff race altogether this year. Weighed down by a puzzling discrepancy between their 51 wins at Wrigley Field and 33 road victories, the Cubs finished third in the NL Central.\n\n\u201cYou look at the home and road splits and what we\u2019ve done on the road \u2026 I mean these are like some really crazy, hard-to-wrap-your-mind-around things,\u201d Maddon said this month. \u201cI don\u2019t know if somebody\u2019s going to dig deeply enough to really figure it out, but it\u2019s really, just to have your mind try to extrapolate what is going on here, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint anything.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs were in position to make the playoffs for much of this season. They had a half-game lead in the NL Central on Aug. 22. They had control of an NL wild card into September.\n\nBut a nine-game slide, including five consecutive one-run losses for the first time since 1915, wiped out their postseason chances and sealed Maddon\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t able to get over the hump,\u201d he said.\n\nPer the Cubs\u2019 request, Maddon employed a more hands-on approach this year, especially on the hitting side, but the lineup was still plagued by inconsistency. There also were surprising fielding and baserunning issues given the Cubs\u2019 strength in those areas since Maddon took over.\n\nWith Maddon gone, the focus turns to Epstein, and the club\u2019s continued inability to develop pitching help for the major league roster. Yu Darvish rediscovered his form after it looked as if the Japanese right-hander might have trouble living up to his $126 million, six-year contract, but reliever Brandon Morrow\u2019s $21 million, two-year deal was a costly mistake.\n\nEven with the disappointing finish each of the past two years, Maddon likely will have plenty of suitors. And there will be a ton of interest in the Cubs\u2019 job.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I don\u2019t want to wait. I\u2019m ready,\u201d Maddon said.\n\nThe last time Maddon was available, Epstein fired Rick Renteria after just one year to create an opening in Chicago.\n\nMaddon\u2019s arrival in November 2014 coincided with the ascent of an impressive wave of prospects. A month after Maddon signed on, Jon Lester joined the Cubs in free agency, and the team took off from there.\n\nChicago won 103 games on its way to the NL Central title three years ago. After eliminating San Francisco and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the playoffs, the Cubs stopped their championship drought by beating the Cleveland Indians in a memorable Game 7 in the World Series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to express kind of how (it) feels. You kind of feel like it could be an end of an era,\u201d said veteran utilityman Ben Zobrist, who played for Maddon in Tampa Bay and Chicago. \u201cWhen I look at my career, he\u2019s at the top. \u2026 Joe\u2019s a special person. Those kind of people, let alone managers, don\u2019t come along very often.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Jeff Melnick contributed to this report from St. Louis.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From the moment Joe Maddon joined the Chicago Cubs, taking the reins in a Wrigleyville bar five years ago, he talked about winning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Cohen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/cubs_pirates_baseball_18858_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
