They were given land at times but at the very least tools and livestock to help begin their new lives in freedom. When former slaves demanded land after the Civil War, they were harking back to this longtime custom, which the rest of the country (with the exception of the abolitionists) had long forgotten. Since the Reconstruction era, the reneged-upon promise of reparations\u2014recompense to African-Americans for centuries of enslavement and racial oppression\u2014has continued to fester like an open sore on the nation\u2019s body politic.\n\nMany Americans dismiss the idea of reparations as economically impractical, legally impossible and politically inflammatory. In the 20th century, however, several countries\u2014most prominently postwar Germany but also the U.S.\u2014have offered significant reparations for past atrocities. Though the issue of reparations for slavery never really died down, especially among African-Americans, the cause was given new life in 2014 by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose landmark essay \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d in the Atlantic has shaped the current debate on redress not just for enslavement but for a century of systematic racial discrimination sanctioned by the state.\n\nAuthor Ta-Nehisi Coates, left, and actor Danny Glover, right, testify about reparations during a hearing before a House subcommittee, Washington, June 19.

George Fox, the founder of the Quaker faith, called for freeing slaves after a term of service and, as early as 1672, argued that they should be compensated for their labor and not sent off \u201cempty handed.\u201d In the 18th century, the Quakers became the first Christian denomination to ban slave-trading and slaveholding among its members, and they were overrepresented in the Revolutionary-era abolition movement. Many heeded Fox\u2019s injunction and gave their freed slaves material support for their new lives.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think the U.S. government can best address the lasting damage done by slavery? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn the New England colonies, which became the hotbed of abolitionism in the 19th century, slaves led the way in demanding redress from the government. An extraordinary 1774 petition by a group of black slaves addressed to the Massachusetts General Court (the state assembly) declared, \u201cGive and grant to us some part of unimproved land, belonging to the province, for a settlement.\u201d\n\nIn 1783, a formerly enslaved woman from Massachusetts, Belinda Sutton, became the first to win reparations for her years in bondage. A striking petition on her behalf to the Massachusetts General Court recounted her abduction from Africa and argued that \u201cby the laws of the land\u201d she had been \u201cdenied the enjoyment of that immense wealth, a part whereof has been accumulated by her own industry, and the whole augmented by her servitude.\u201d The court granted her petition, in part because her enslaver, Isaac Royall Jr. , was a Tory who had resisted American independence. In 1787, Sutton petitioned again and won a pension from his estate. (Royall, her enslaver, made a substantial bequest to Harvard Law School. After student protests over this slaveholding connection, the school removed his crest from its seal in 2016.)\n\nIn March 1788, Belinda Sutton, an African-born woman forced into slavery, petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for three years\u2019 back pension.

The best-known example is Georgetown University, where Jesuits sold 272 slaves in 1838 to save their college. Not only did Georgetown offer a formal apology, it also tracked down the slaves\u2019 descendants to offer them admission. Recently, the university\u2019s students voted overwhelmingly for an increase in fees to pay reparations, and a large endowment has been set up for descendants.\n\nReligious institutions have often taken the lead in reparations for slavery, seeing it as fundamentally a moral question as well as an economic one. Last year, the sisters of the Society of the Sacred Heart, an international Catholic group that owned slaves in Missouri and Louisiana, created a reparations fund. Just this month, the Virginia Theological Seminary, an Episcopalian institution that still has buildings today built by slaves, created a $1.7 million reparations fund for descendants of the enslaved.\n\n\u201c Attempts to repair past harms have ranged from formal apologies to economic indemnification to compensatory programs. \u201d\n\nIn her important 2017 book \u201cReparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade,\u201d the Howard University historian Ana Lucia Araujo shows that attempts to repair past harms have ranged from formal apologies to economic indemnification to compensatory programs. In the U.K., for instance, Glasgow University, a center of 19th-century abolitionist activism, recently created a reparations fund of 20 million pounds after acknowledging that the university had benefited from Scottish slave traders to the tune of more than $100 million (in the dollars of the day). In 2017, All Souls College, Oxford, instituted a fellowship for a student from the West Indies and paid 100,000 pounds to Codrington College in Barbados in partial redress for the 10,000 pounds (worth millions today) that All Souls received to build its library from Christopher Codrington, who had made his fortune in slavery.\n\nIn the U.S., several institutions of higher learning preceded Georgetown in considering their past connections with enslavement. In 2003, President Ruth Simmons of Brown University first commissioned a report on the school\u2019s involvement in slavery and the slave trade, which led Brown to take several measures, including a $10 million endowment to educate disadvantaged children in Providence, R.I., rendering technical assistance to historically black colleges and universities, and funding research on slavery and racial justice. Since then, other universities\u2014including Columbia, Emory, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Virginia\u2014have explored their own institutional histories of benefiting from centuries of human misery, although none of them has offered reparations.\n\nIronically, in considering emancipation, governments were often preoccupied with compensating slaveholders for their loss of human property rather than the enslaved for their stolen labor, bodies and lives. British emancipation compensated slaveholders and reduced freed people to apprenticeship, a liminal state between slavery and freedom. In 1862, when slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia, slaveholders rather than slaves received compensation.\n\n\u2018This Is a White Man's Government\u2019: This 1868 cartoon by Thomas Nast warns that Irish from the North, unreconstructed Southern Confederates and businessmen were uniting to end black suffrage and thwart Reconstruction.

The destruction of slavery during and after the Civil War resulted in the largest confiscation of private property by the state in American history, with the freeing of nearly four million slaves valued at around $3 billion at the time.\n\nPerhaps the most famous episode in the history of reparations came in 1865, when Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman \u2019s famous Field Orders No. 15 divided abandoned and confiscated plantations in low-country South Carolina and Georgia into 40-acre lots for newly freed people and gave each of them a mule. The news of \u201cForty Acres and a Mule\u201d spread like wildfire among the formerly enslaved\u2014only to be dashed within a few months when Andrew Johnson, who became president after Abraham Lincoln \u2019s assassination, returned the Sherman land grants and other lands distributed by the federal Freedmen\u2019s Bureau to former slave-owning planters.\n\n\u201c Freed people in the post-bellum South were soon disenfranchised, segregated and subjected to racial terror. \u201d\n\nThe sense of betrayal lingered among African-Americans, especially after the overthrow of Reconstruction and the failure to rectify the cruelties of racism. Freed people in the post-bellum South were soon disenfranchised, segregated and subjected to racial terror, debt peonage and semi-servitude in the notorious system of \u201cconvict leasing,\u201d all of which made a mockery of black freedom. When Spike Lee started making movies on racial themes in the 1980s, he pointedly named his production company 40 Acres and a Mule.\n\nAfter Reconstruction, former slaves took the lead in demanding compensation. A significant step came in 1896, when Callie House and Isaiah Dickerson founded the first national organization for reparations, known as the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. Despite government persecution, the association marked the start of a reparations movement among African-Americans that has continued until today.\n\nIn 1987, in the wake of the civil-rights movement, black groups and leaders including James Forman founded the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, or N\u2019COBRA. Its current incarnations include grass roots organizations such as the Unpaid Labor Project and the Movement for Black Lives, which call for reparations not just for enslavement but also for its lingering legacies: racial \u201credlining\u201d for insurance and financing, mass incarceration, racism in law enforcement, and the yawning gaps between blacks and whites in wealth, health, education and opportunity.\n\nIt has proven easier for governments to pay reparations for particular historic wrongs than for centuries of what Mr. Coates has called the \u201cquiet plunder\u201d of black labor and wealth. Perhaps the most successful case is West Germany\u2019s 1953 agreement to pay some $845 million (in the dollars of the day) to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany and the newly founded state of Israel as reparations for the Holocaust. (German history also offers a case when reparations failed: Making Germany pay enormous reparations after World War I helped pave the way to World War II.)\n\nThe U.S. government also formally apologized and paid reparations to Japanese American citizens wrongfully interned in camps during World War II\u2014to the tune of $20,000 each\u2014with the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. More recently, the city of Chicago agreed to pay several million dollars in reparations to victims of systematic police brutality and torture.\n\nLindi Bobb, 6, attends a slavery reparations protest in New York City, Aug. 9, 2002.

Nor has the U.S. seriously considered convening a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as South Africa did after the fall of apartheid, to grapple with the legacies of enslavement. As the moral philosopher Susan Neiman notes in her recent book \u201cLearning From the Germans,\u201d while post-Nazi-era Germans have frankly acknowledged the evil that their country had done, unreconstructed Neo-Confederates in America still peddle the mythology of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d and offer what Frederick Douglass called \u201ceulogies of the South and of the traitors.\u201d To make amends for historical wrongs, one must first genuinely acknowledge the harms done.\n\nAs historians of slavery continue to demonstrate the extent to which the economies of the Americas and Europe grew on the backs of black people, a \u201cfully loaded cost accounting\u201d of slavery, in the historian Nell Irvin Painter \u2019s words, might seem too immense. The scale of the challenge has certainly paralyzed any substantial redress for enslavement and its brutal aftermath. Proposals for a Marshall Plan for America\u2019s inner cities have been stillborn. In 1989, Rep. John Conyers introduced a bill to establish a commission to study reparations, which languished despite his reintroducing it year after year.\n\n\u201c Critics of reparations usually look past the enduring deleterious effects of slavery and its brutal aftermath. \u201d\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama showed himself highly attuned to the pragmatic difficulties of pursuing reparations in the face of strong opposition. As he told Mr. Coates, \u201cThe bottom line is that it\u2019s hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.\u201d Critics of reparations usually look past the enduring deleterious effects of slavery and its brutal aftermath, focusing instead on slavery\u2019s end in the 19th century. Last June, right before a House hearing on the issue, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected the idea of present-day compensation: \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.\u201d\n\nStill, activists, journalists and historians have kept the debate alive, and the push for reparations has recently achieved a new visibility in national politics. In Mr. Coates\u2019s congressional testimony this June, he said that African-Americans were still suffering from the aftermath of slavery and urged lawmakers to \u201creject fair-weather patriotism, to say that this nation is both its credits and debits.\u201d As the 2020 campaign heats up, the willingness of several Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, to consider at least some sort of remedy for slavery and ongoing racism have put reparations back on the national agenda.\n\nWhatever specific shape reparations may eventually take, it is a national moral debt that is long overdue. The Constitution\u2019s 13th Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, but Congress is also empowered, as the Supreme Court has ruled, to eliminate the \u201cbadges and incidents of slavery\u201d under whose historical weight so many of the nation\u2019s African-American citizens have groaned for too long.\n\n\u2014Prof. Sinha is the James L. and Shirley A.
