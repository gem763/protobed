It can also fluctuate depending on whether you opt for a newer or older boat to charter.\n\nSome of the popular destinations for South Africans include Seychelles, Thailand, Greece, Croatia, Spain, France, Italy and Holland.\n\nREAD: Chasing the Midnight Sun in Norway\n\nThe master bedroom on the Leopard 50.

When you think about how much a resort costs in Seychelles, this might be a better alternative for big families or friend groups.\n\nFor about 10 people you could sail around the islands with a skipper and no meals included for between R10 000 and R12 000 per person.

Croatia: For four people on a catamaran for a week in September with self-catering and a skipper around the northern ports, you can expect to pay around R15 000 per person.\n\nWhile it varies between destinations, the two-above scenarios just help to show that not only the rich can live that high-seas life.\n\nREAD: You don't have to be a millionaire to sail the Adriatic Sea along the coast of Croatia\n\nJust picture yourself sitting at the edge of the Leopard 50.
