The cloud-based platform covers all stages of the remittance flow - funds top-up, identity verification, blocking suspicious transactions and sending money overseas.\n\nThis eliminates the conventional need for businesses to build their own remittance infrastructure by signing individual bilateral agreements in the recipient countries or relying solely on interbank money transfers - in turn driving down cost and processing time for cross-border remittances, said Rapyd.\n\nThrough its global payments network, Rapyd offers remittances into more than 500 types of local payment methods, including e-wallets, cash pickup, bank transfers and debit cards. Indonesia's Doku wallet and Sri Lanka's mobile payments app eZCash are two such examples.\n\nRapyd said its expansion into Singapore, which follows its partnership with Hong Kong-based TNG Fintech Group in August and OCBC Bank in April, signals its increasing focus on the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"Asia is leading the fintech charge, spurring innovation in the fintech space like no other region,\" said Mr Yarbrough, adding that the firm also has plans to build an engineering centre in Singapore to tap the \"experience and energy of young technologists\" here.\n\nEarlier this month, Rapyd announced that it has raised US$100 million in Series C funding at a valuation approaching US$1 billion, bringing the firm's total venture capital injection to over US$150 million. Its global payments network has reached around four billion consumers.\n\nOther fintech players vying for a share of the region's cross-border payments market include Revolut and TransferWise - both headquartered in London - as well as Singapore startup InstaReM.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - LONDON-BASED fintech startup Rapyd has obtained a remittance licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to scale its digital remittance services in the Asia-Pacific. .
