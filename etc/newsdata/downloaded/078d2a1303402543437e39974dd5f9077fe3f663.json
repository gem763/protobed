Police said hitting the mosque was an accident.\n\nAs the protesters fled, frontliners stayed behind to slow the advance of riot police, setting fire to makeshift barricades. Clashes went on deep into the night.\n\nA Xiaomi and a Best Mart store -- both mainland Chinese businesses -- were set alight.\n\n- Activists attacked -\n\nTensions were running high after the leader of the group organising the weekend rally, Jimmy Sham, was hospitalised after being attacked by unknown assailants wielding hammers earlier in the week.\n\nThen late Saturday, a man handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed in the neck and stomach, reportedly by an assailant who shouted pro-Beijing slogans.\n\nMany on Sunday's march said they wanted to show they were unbowed by the attacks and moves by authorities to ban public gatherings.\n\n\"The more they suppress, the more we resist,\" a 69-year-old demonstrator, who gave her surname as Yeung, told AFP. \"Can police arrest us all, tens of thousands of people?\"\n\nPhilip Tsoi, a self-described frontline protester, said they needed to keep getting numbers out even though many hardcore activists like him had been \"arrested or wounded\" in recent weeks.\n\n\"What I want is a truly democratic government whose leader is elected by Hong Kong people instead of selected by a Communist regime,\" he told AFP.\n\nVigilante violence has mounted on both sides of the ideological divide.\n\nIn recent weeks pro-democracy supporters have badly beaten people who vocally disagree with them -- although those fights tend to be spontaneous outbursts of mob anger during protests.\n\nIn contrast, pro-democracy figures have been attacked in a noticeably more targeted way, with at least eight prominent government critics, including politicians, beaten by unknown assailants since mid-August.\n\nProtesters have labelled the attacks \"white terror\" and accused the city's shadowy organised crime groups of forming an alliance with Beijing supporters.\n\nBeijing has denounced the protests as a foreign-backed plot and condemned attacks on those voicing support for China.\n\nBut it has remained largely silent on the attacks carried out against pro-democracy figures.\n\n- Months of unrest -\n\nHong Kong has now been battered by 20 weeks of protests and with no political solution in sight, clashes have intensified each month.\n\nHardliners have embraced widespread vandalism, while riot police are quick to respond with tear gas, rubber bullets and, more recently, live rounds.\n\nThe rallies were triggered by a now-abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland, but have morphed into wider calls for democracy and police accountability.\n\nProtesters are demanding an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for those arrested and fully free elections, all of which have been rejected by Beijing and Hong Kong's unelected leader Carrie Lam.\n\nEarlier this month, Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks.\n\nThe decision set off a new wave of protests and vandalism that shut down much of the city's transport network.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas Sunday as crowds held an illegal march, with hardcore protesters throwing petrol bombs and trashing businesses to cap a week of anger after recent attacks on pro-democracy demonstrators.
