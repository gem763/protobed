The new Peregrine missile (above) is designed to fit in the weapons bays of stealth fighters, allowing them to carry more missiles than ever before.\n\n\n\nAs stealthy fighter jets, the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II both suffer from a major problem: They must store all of their fuel, sensors, and weapons internally. While previous-generation fighters stored this equipment on the fuselage and wingtips, having a collection of pointy missiles, bombs, and fuel tanks hanging off an aircraft can dramatically increase its radar signature. Fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 store everything internally, particularly weapons, maximizing the ability of their carefully molded shapes to evade radar.\n\nPhoto credit: SMSgt Michael Jackson/DVIDS More\n\nBut that comes at a cost. There\u2019s only so much room inside a jet, and the amount of weapons a plane can carry is limited by the size of its weapons bays. The F-35, for example, has two bays that can carry up to four AMRAAM air-to-air missiles. That\u2019s only half as many missiles as fourth-generation fighters can comfortably carry. Although capable, the AMRAAM is basically a 30-year-old missile designed for the old days when missiles were carried outside the aircraft.\n\nThe new Peregrine missile was revealed earlier this week by Raytheon at the Air Force Association\u2019s National Conference. Peregrine, named after a North American falcon that preys on other birds, is just 6 feet long and weighs 150 pounds. The AMRAAM, by contrast, is 12 feet long and weighs approximately 335 pounds. Peregrine looks very similar to the SM-1/2/3/6 Standard series of naval surface-to-air missiles also manufactured by Raytheon.\n\nAs reported by Aviation Week & Space Technology , Raytheon states that the missile uses a \u201cmultimode autonomous seeker,\u201d which could include both infrared and radar sensors to guide the missile to target. The missile is equipped with a blast fragmentation warhead to down enemy aircraft.\n\nPropulsion is described as described as a \u201cnew, high performance propulsion section\u201d that gives a missile half the size of AMRAAM a slightly better range. The missile is described as having very good maneuverability in the \u201cendgame\u201d stage, giving it the ability to chase down aircraft trying to evade it in the moments before intercept.\n\nMeanwhile, Air Force Magazine reports Peregrine \u201cwill cost \u2018significantly less\u2019 to buy and maintain than the AIM-120 or AIM-9X, and is faster to develop, thanks to ready-made components and additive manufacturing.\u201d That\u2019s important because the cost of missiles, like fighter jets, is skyrocketing: AIM-120C7, the latest version of the AMRAAM was recently sold to Japan and Hungary for between $2 and $2.7 million each including missiles, software, supporting equipment, and contractor field support. If Air Force fighters can suddenly carry many more missiles, the service needs to be able to afford them.\n\nPhoto credit: TSgt John Raven/DVIDS More", "description": "Here's the missile that will seriously boost the fighter jet's firepower.", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aQSqOICBIJIGy3uTVG_j8g--~B/aD0zMTg7dz02Mzc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/64932cd09aa91d5119756e90741e3153", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
