Why won\u2019t Democrats embrace it?", "language": "en", "text": "In our far-from-ideal world, President Trump can\u2019t even acknowledge the problem, and the Democrats who call for immediate action seem to be running from the best solutions.\n\nThe IMF reiterates what economists have long understood: Enacting a carbon tax is \u201cthe single most powerful and efficient tool\u201d because pricing mechanisms \u201cmake it costlier to emit greenhouse gases and allow businesses and individuals to choose how to conserve energy or switch to greener sources through a range of opportunities.\u201d Politicians should favor choice and flexibility over central planning. \u201cPeople and firms will identify which changes in behavior reduce emissions \u2014 for example, purchasing a more efficient refrigerator versus an electric car \u2014 at the lowest cost.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy contrast, \u201cregulations might not leave sufficient flexibility for households and firms to find least-cost options.\u201d Regulators might not foresee or support novel technologies, and intrusive rules \u201cmotivate firms to collude with officials to alter or evade the regulations.\u201d They also provide weak incentives for companies to invest in a wide range of better technology, because only the state\u2019s favored approaches to decarbonizing the economy would be rewarded. For these reasons, regulatory and other alternative approaches cost society some 50 to 100 percent more than a carbon tax for the same environmental benefits.\n\nThe IMF found that the average global price is a paltry $2 per ton of carbon dioxide, while the world requires a $75-per-ton global carbon tax by 2030 to keep warming below the 2-degree Celsius threshold scientists advise. Electricity prices would rise 70 percent on average \u2014 though only 53 percent in the United States \u2014 and gasoline prices 5 percent to 15 percent in most places.\n\nBut that\u2019s the picture before one considers what the money raised by a carbon tax could do. If governments recycled the revenue back to low-income and vulnerable people, and cut economically inefficient taxes \u2014 such as income taxes \u2014 a $50-per-ton carbon tax would feel to the economy more like $20 per ton. The plan would help low-income households and place a higher burden on the upper-income bracket. There could also be money for essential research and development to aid the energy transition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo is this the plan that the Democratic presidential candidates have embraced? If only. Though former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke have cautiously acknowledged the importance of carbon pricing, they are far more specific in their ideas for spending lots of money. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently adopted a regulate-and-spend program. And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would have the federal government establish its own utilities and build its own power-generation facilities, from scratch, according to, yes, a central plan.\n\nThe science does not change because politicians deny that humans are warming the planet. Likewise the economics do not change because politicians find them ideologically or politically inconvenient.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The economic realities of global warming do not change even if politicians find them to be inconvenient.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7ydcOj_Ot0nnc5CGY2NMEmObdaw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JUAOGZWKPMI6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
