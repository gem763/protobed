The changes have mostly gone into effect immediately, with Epic saying players will not need to update the game at all.\n\nIn a post titled \u201cB.R.U.T.E. balance adjustments,\u201d Epic details the substantial nerfs coming to the item, including a reduction in the number of rockets it can fire, the rate it fires those rockets, and a number of other powerful advantages the suit offered players.\n\nThe mech suit first arrived in early August with the launch of Fortnite\u2019s tenth season. Unfortunately, it\u2019s caused nothing but turmoil both in the broader community and the game\u2019s high-profile competitive scene, which received worldwide attention following the successful Fortnite World Cup in New York City in late July. With a new tournament series, the Fortnite Champion Series, currently taking place between now and late September, Epic seems eager to iron out the issues with the B.R.U.T.E. just as the collective outrage from players appeared to reach its apex.\n\nHere are the big changes Epic says are live now:\n\nDecreased the maximum amount of rockets fired by the B.R.U.T.E. in a single charge from 10 to 6.\n\nDecreased the rate at which the rockets are fired from the B.R.U.T.E. by 56%.\n\nDecreased the radius of the B.R.U.T.E.\u2019s rocket explosion by 42%.\n\nIncreased the dash cooldown from 3 seconds to 5 seconds.\n\nDecreased the velocity gained from boosting while in air by 33%.\n\nThe B.R.U.T.E. no longer grants materials to the driver and passenger when stomping or dashing through the environment. (This won\u2019t be arriving right away, Epic says, but after these other changes are in effect.)\n\nDecreased the material cost of using the gunner\u2019s overshield from 200 to 75.\n\nIncreased the Health of the B.R.U.T.E from 1000 to 1250.\n\nEpic gives a little line or two of reasoning for almost all of these changes, and each makes a fair amount of sense. The developer is effectively acknowledging that it did in fact release a game-breaking, overpowered element into play right at the launch of a new competitive e-sports tournament circuit. With these changes, including the reasonable health buff to the mech suit, the item should be slower to operate, less fruitful as a farming vehicle, and less lethal against enemy players.\n\nThe Fortnite community was up in arms over the B.R.U.T.E.\n\nIn addition to all of this, Epic is reducing the spawn rate of the B.R.U.T.E. in all storm circles in normal game modes, while keeping the rate the same in competitive modes, a change it made earlier this month to prevent the mech suit and the controversy surrounding it from entirely consuming the Fortnite Champion Series\u2019 first event last weekend. Epic is also disabling its newly introduced Junk Rift item from the Arena playlist and this upcoming weekend\u2019s Champion Series event until it can fix an audio issue due to be addressed in an upcoming update.\n\nThe changes to the B.R.U.T.E. are largely in line with what the community was hoping for (although some are still clamoring for its removal), and Epic seems to have listened in this regard while maintaining its position that the mech suit should stay in the game. (The company\u2019s thinking is that the suit offers a fun and fresh way to play Fortnite while helping lower the skill gap in less competitive situations.)\n\nThis particular controversy, while nothing new for Fortnite\u2019s ongoing tension between its casual mainstream appeal and its competitive ambitions, was perhaps the most contentious in the game\u2019s two-year history. Numerous streamers, pro players, and even e-sports organizations were pleading with the company to reconsider the mech suit\u2019s capabilities, with many calling openly for its outright removal. While that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening, it\u2019s quite likely these changes will make the device a non-factor in both tournament and casual play for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Fortnite community seems pleased.\n\nFinally...the mechs have been nerfed.\n\n\n\nGood riddance. \u2014 Jack \u201cCouRage\u201d Dunlop (@CouRageJD) August 22, 2019", "description": "Epic Games has heard the feedback loud and clear, and this afternoon the Fortnite developer announced a series of sweeping changes to its newly introduced B.R.U.T.E. mech suit that has had game\u2019s community in open revolt for the last few weeks.
