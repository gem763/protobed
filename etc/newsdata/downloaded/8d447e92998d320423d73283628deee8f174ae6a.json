Baked yatsuhashi, shaped in strips and flavored with cinnamon, are very popular since they have a long shelf-life. However, equally popular is the unbaked form known as nama-yatsuhashi \u751f\u516b\u30c3\u6a4b, typically shaped into triangles. The dough is only lightly flavored, and unlike the baked version, it is filled, most commonly with an \u9921 paste made from azuki beans.\n\nA Long-Standing Kyoto Confectionery Shop\n\nFor over half a century, Otabe has been selling their eponymous brand of nama-yatsuhashi, as well as baked yatsuhashi and other sweets in Kyoto. Now operated by Bijuu Co., Ltd., Otabe is one of Kyoto's long-standing confectionery shops and quite famous in the city. In addition to Western-style cookies and cakes, they offer both plain cinnamon and chocolate-coated baked yatsuhashi, and of course, Otabe filled with various types of an according to the season (for example, now they have chestnut and purple yam versions).\n\nRuby Chocolate Otabe\n\nNow, Otabe is reinventing itself with a new line of Otabe featuring red ruby chocolate. As you may recall when we covered Kit Kat's ruby chocolate debut last year, ruby chocolate is the first new natural color of chocolate in over 80 years, after white chocolate. Nestl\u00e9 struck a deal with the world\u2019s largest cocoa processing company, Barry Callebaut, giving them exclusive rights for six months to the brand new product. Now that this period is over, other companies can also acquire it.\n\nOtabe collaborated with Barry Callebaut to offer a completely new type of Otabe featuring red ruby chocolate.\n\nAfter a long development period in which they tried various recipes and blends, they succeeded in creating a product combining the rich and fruity taste of red chocolate with the delicious chewy texture of nama-yatsuhashi, so they are proud to finally offer their \"Ruby Chocolate Otabe\" to the public.\n\nThe packaging shines with foil printed with a traditional asanoha \u9ebb\u306e\u8449 hemp-leaf pattern, making it a beautiful gift idea.\n\nProduct Information\n\n-- Selling Period: Oct 11 to early May, 2020\n\n-- Name: \u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30b3\u30e9\u306e\u304a\u305f\u3079 | Ruby Chocolate Otabe\n\n-- Price: 660 yen (excl. tax) for box of 10\n\n-- Freshness guaranteed for 9 days from manufacture date\n\n-- Available: Kyoto Station, tourist spots throughout Kyoto City, etc.\n\n-- Website: Otabe\n\nSource: ValuePress Co Ltd\n\nRead more stories from grape Japan\n\n-- Japan\u2019s PlayStation Bento Gives Gamers A Nostalgic Lunchbox\n\n-- Look Dandy in These \u201cJojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind\u201d Neckties\n\n-- New One Piece Figures And Japanese Ink Art Style Glasses Hit Convenience Stores As Lottery Prizes\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "Kyoto is famous for a confectionery known as yatsuhashi \u516b\u30c3\u6a4b, made from glutinous rice flour (joshinko \u4e0a\u65b0\u7c89), sugar and other flavorings.
