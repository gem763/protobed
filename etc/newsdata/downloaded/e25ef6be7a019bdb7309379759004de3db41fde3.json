Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nHathaway told the Evening Standard: \u201cIf you think about the way she is being criticised, it is textbook misogyny, textbook patronising, it is all these things.\n\n\u201cI think one of the best things to focus on about her is she speaks from a place of passion and emotion. She is speaking science to power.\n\n\"I admire her and I am glad to see I am not the only one.\u201d\n\nHathaway said she has \u201ccared about the environment for a really long time\u201d, adding: \u201cWhen I had my son I started to think about consuming things in a different way.\n\n\"I think I was like everyone in that I would just use things and then not think about what happened when I threw it out.\n\n\"I think we all have a responsibility to not just mindlessly follow the path of convenience. And I know that is an incredibly privileged thing to say. That not everyone has a choice, but everyone can do something.\u201d\n\nGreta Thunberg (Getty Images) More\n\nHathaway also praised the film and television industry for making more effort to portray mental health in a different light. She has previously spoken about having anxiety and depression.\n\nThe actor is set to appear alongside Tina Fey, Dev Patel and Andrew Scott in the anticipated Amazon Prime Video series Modern Love, which is based on the New York Times dating and relationships column of the same name.\n\nShe said: \u201cI can\u2019t remember another character I\u2019d come across as an actor or as a viewer [who was a] bipolar woman trying to find love. The inclusion of that story seemed very modern to me. And that can\u2019t be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nShe added that people were now more \u201chonest about who we are and what makes up our life. And that is creating a much greater space for tolerance and acceptance and inclusion.\u201d Her comments come on World Mental Health Day.\n\nModern Love is available on Prime Video from Friday October 18.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\nFatboy Slim mashes up Greta Thunberg's UN speech for live show\n\nPolice probe as mannequin of Greta Thunberg found hanging from bridge\n\nGreta Thunberg changes Twitter bio again... this time to mock Putin", "description": "Anne Hathaway has said critics of climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg display \u201ctextbook misogyny.\"The actress, pictured below, hit out at a backlash against the 16-year-old Swedish activist\u2019s impassioned speech at the United Nations last month, in which she called on world leaders to do more", "authors": ["Lizzie Edmonds"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cDakBoFnUaKfv1I9gku0ng--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/9c121bda34422c21d16772b112b35c5e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
