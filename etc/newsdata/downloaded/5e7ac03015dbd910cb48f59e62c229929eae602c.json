But cutting of the reserve requirement ratio, maybe we\u2019ll look at it,\u201d Diokno said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Kathleen Hays in Washington.\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is trying to boost an economy that grew at its slowest pace in four years in the second quarter. Central bankers globally are making policy more accommodative as trade tensions weigh on growth and manufacturing weakness threatens to spill over into service sectors.\n\nIn a separate interview, the country\u2019s finance secretary said the Philippine economy will probably expand around 6% this year - the low end of its 6%-7% goal -- as government spending ramps up following a delay in passing the budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hitting our spending targets now and we definitely will make a very good effort in catching up,\u201d Carlos Dominguez told Bloomberg Television on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington.\n\nIs the World Economy Sliding Into First Recession Since 2009?\n\nPumping Money\n\nThe Philippines has cut its benchmark rate by a total of 75 basis points this year, after raising it by 175 basis points in 2018. Bangko Sentral approved lowering the reserve requirement ratio by 1 percentage point effective next month, following a total of 2 percentage points in cuts from May to July.\n\n\u201cWe still have several meetings before the end of the year, and it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll cut\u201d the reserve ratio, Diokno said.\n\nEven after the RRR reductions -- a way to pump money into the economy -- the Philippine reserve ratio remains among the highest in the region at 15%, Diokno said.\n\nBangko Sentral has two more rate-setting meetings on the agenda this year, the next on Nov. 14. Policy makers will look at inflation and economic growth in deciding on further easing, Diokno said.\n\nAnnual gains in consumer prices this month could match September\u2019s 0.9%, which means the 2019 forecast average of 2.5% will be within the central bank\u2019s 2%-4% target, he said.\n\nOverseas Bonds\n\nWhile the global economic slowdown and mounting trade tensions pose risks, the Philippines \u201cwill probably be one of the most resilient among emerging economies,\u201d Diokno said.\n\nThe country\u2019s economy likely expanded 6.2%-6.3% last quarter, the central bank chief said. Third-quarter growth data is due Nov. 7.\n\nFinance Secretary Dominguez, who sits on the central bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary board, said the spending catch-up plan will act as a \u201cfiscal stimulus\u201d for the economy. The Transport and Public Works agencies have called for 24-hour construction on infrastructure projects and have split big-ticket projects into smaller contracts so they can be bid out faster.\n\nThe government is lining up a record $27-billion borrowing plan for next year on expectations that the spending program will get back on track. It will keep its plans to raise as much as $3.7 billion offshore, despite seeing \u201chigher-than-expected\u201d interest rates in the market because of U.S.-China trade war uncertainty, Dominguez said.\n\nThe government could offer dollar bonds around January or February 2020, followed by yuan- and euro-denominated debt papers, and then a Samurai offer toward August, he said. No new offshore markets are being considered.\n\n(Adds quote from finance secretary interview in fifth paragraph.)", "description": "Philippine Central Bank Governor Open to Another Reserve Ratio Cut This Year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic58e26cd629f3840ac94cdd70ae1ff2ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
