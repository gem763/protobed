But we\u2019re going to find out who definitively did it, first,\u201d he said in a White House meeting with Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cI\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war.\u201d\n\nThe Saturday attack hit a crucial oil field and forced the Saudis to temporarily halt the production of roughly 5.7 million barrels per day, sending crude prices soaring on Monday.\n\nMr. Trump said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top officials will travel soon to Saudi Arabia, as officials figure out if Tehran was responsible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly looking that way, at this moment,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSoon as we find out definitively, we\u2019ll let you know, but it does look that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you won\u2019t be surprised to see who did it,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIranian government officials have consistently denied responsibility for the drone attacks, while Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen \u2014 who have been locked in a long, bloody civil war with that nation\u2019s Saudi-backed government \u2014 have claimed ownership.\n\nU.S. officials have said that satellite imagery shows almost 20 points of impact consistent with the attack having come from the north \u2014 the direction of Iran or Iraq \u2014 rather than from Yemen on Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border.\n\nAlso Monday, the Saudis said Iranian weapons were used in the attacks.\n\nMr. Trump said the Saudis will have to accept the lion\u2019s share of responsibility for any retaliation.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this, if we decide to do something,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be very much involved, and that includes payment. And they understand that fully.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Trump said he is taking steps to moderate any shocks to the global oil supply.\n\n\u201cWe have the strategic oil reserves, which are massive, and we can release a little bit of that,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
