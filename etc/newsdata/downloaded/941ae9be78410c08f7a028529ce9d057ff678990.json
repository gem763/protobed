The main card airs on pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN 2 and UFC Fight Pass/ESPN+.\n\nUndefeated Vieira (10-0 MMA, 4-0 UFC) hasn\u2019t competed since her split decision win over Cat Zingano in March 2018. She was scheduled to face Tonya Evinger at UFC Fight Night 137 later that year before she was forced out due to a knee injury. UFC 245 will mark a 21-month absence for the top bantamweight contender, who\u2019s on the cusp of title contention.\n\nAldana (11-5 MMA, 4-3 UFC) bounced back from a razor thin decision loss to Raquel Pennington in July with a unanimous decision win over Vanessa Melo at UFC on ESPN+ 17 last month in her home country of Mexico. UFC 245 will mark her fourth fight of 2019, as she looks to spoil Vieira\u2019s perfect record and emerge as a 135-pound title contender.\n\nWith the addition, UFC 245 now includes:\n\nChamp Kamaru Usman vs. Colby Covington \u2013 for welterweight title\n\nChamp Amanda Nunes vs. Germaine de Randamie \u2013 for women\u2019s bantamweight title\n\nChamp Max Holloway vs. Alexander Volkanovski \u2013 for featherweight title\n\nRobbie Lawler vs. Santiago Ponzinibbio\n\nJessica Eye vs. Viviane Araujo\n\nMatt Brown vs. Ben Saunders\n\nOskar Piechota vs. Punahele Soriano\n\nKai Kara-France vs. Brandon Moreno\n\nIrene Aldana vs. Ketlen Vieira", "description": "A matchup between top-ranked bantamweights Ketlen Vieira and Irene Aldana is headed to UFC 245.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ketlen-vieira-cat-zingano-ufc-222.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
