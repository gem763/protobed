Seven runs later, one thing was clear: Washington will need to lean on Scherzer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou just ride him,\u201d catcher Kurt Suzuki said after the Nationals\u2019 10-4 loss Sunday night. \u201cAll the pitching, the whole starting rotation. Those guys have been great for us all year and we just got to keep plugging away.\u201d\n\nHaving Scherzer on the mound \u201cmakes everybody pumped,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMax brings a certain level of intensity that not a lot of guys can bring and I think he just fires everybody up,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cEveryone gets excited.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals may be a playoff team thanks to Scherzer. In the beginning of June, with the team seven games below .500, Scherzer embarked on a winning streak that included some of the best pitching of his storied 12-year career. He won seven straight starts from June 2 to July 6, allowing just five hits over 29 innings and posting a 0.87 earned run average.\n\nAD\n\nIn the middle of it, he fouled a ball off his nose in batting practice, then pitched a day later with a black eye. It was a gem: seven innings, four hits, 10 strikeouts against the rival Phillies. Before the thing healed, he went eight innings in a win against Miami and another eight against Detroit. Washington was 1 1/2 games out of a wild-card spot by the end of June.\n\nAD\n\nAnd since, even while battling injuries and a stretch of rough outings to close the regular season, even after getting roughed up in a start in the single-game wild-card elimination round against Milwaukee, Scherzer has still been the ace in the Nationals\u2019 back pocket.\n\nWashington Manager David Martinez used Scherzer in relief in Game 2 of the series in Los Angeles, handing him the ball in the eighth inning after a Dodgers home run off Sean Doolittle in the seventh. He needed 14 pitches, 11 of them strikes, to mow through three strikeouts and end the inning. Martinez held him out of Game 3 specifically to give him a maximum leash in Game 4, a spot in which the Nationals would either be able to close out the Dodgers or \u2014 now \u2014 hold them off to force a Game 5.\n\nAD\n\nAsked Sunday how many innings he could give Martinez on Monday with a day\u2019s rest, Scherzer responded, \u201ceverything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just a mentality of just going out there with everything on the line,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThe atmospheres I\u2019ve pitched in, here with the wild-card game and then there on the road in Dodger Stadium, I mean, that\u2019s been intense. So you\u2019re going to get the best out of me. And there\u2019s no regular season environment that I can replicate that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPatrick Corbin, Nationals get rocked by Dodgers in sixth inning, lose NLDS Game 3, 10-4\n\nSvrluga: The Nationals\u2019 bullpen moves in Game 3 were a disaster.
