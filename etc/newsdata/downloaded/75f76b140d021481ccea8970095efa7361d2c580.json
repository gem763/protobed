That number is based on the different ways you can use Marriott points, including what's generally the most valuable option: redeeming them for award stays at properties in the Marriott portfolio.\n\nDepending on the cash price of the hotel rooms you're hoping to book, you could get more (or less) value out of your points, but $800 is a good baseline for getting a sense of how far these rewards will take you. A Category 4 Marriott hotel, like the Aloft Cancun or the Hotel Emiliano in Guanajuato \u2014 can you tell I have a Mexico trip on the brain? \u2014 costs 25,000 points per night at the standard (as opposed to peak or off-peak) rate, and Marriott offers a free fifth night when you redeem four nights, so you could get a five-night stay from this welcome bonus.\n\nFor more context, you can check out the Marriott award chart to see how many points you'll need for a free night in every category of hotel.\n\nRead more: The best hotel credit cards\n\nOther Bonvoy Business Amex benefits\n\nThe Bonvoy Business card has a $125 annual fee and doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. It offers 6x points when you make qualifying Marriott purchases; 4x points at US restaurants, on wireless telephone services purchased directly from US service providers, and on US purchases for shipping; and 2x points on all other purchases.\n\nBeyond the rewards, the Bonvoy Business Amex card's biggest benefit is the free award night you get each year after your account anniversary. You can redeem this night at any Marriott property that costs up to 35,000 points per night. If you use this benefit at a hotel where a room costs $125 or more per night, you're effectively getting the annual fee back.\n\nRead more: Marriott Bonvoy Business Amex card review\n\nKeep the October 23 deadline in mind if you're interested in grabbing this welcome bonus!", "description": "The Marriott Bonvoy Business Amex card is offering a 100,000-point welcome bonus, but only until October 23.", "authors": ["Sarah Silbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da76758cc4a0a25dd25774c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
