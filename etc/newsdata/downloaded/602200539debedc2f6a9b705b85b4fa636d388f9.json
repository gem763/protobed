He deposed the Queen from the top of Britain\u2019s rich list many years ago but told an interviewer: \u201cI am an industrialist. I understand machinery. I understand things. I do not understand money. I have no idea how much money I have.\u201d Forbes magazine, though, calculated that he was the world\u2019s 112th richest person, with a net worth of $12bn built on the Tetra Pak fortune that he and his brother Gad inherited from their father, Ruben, in 1983.\n\nThe Tetra Pak empire began in a kitchen in Lund, Sk\u00e5ne, in Sweden\u2019s dairy heartland, in 1944. Ruben Rausing was watching his wife, Elisabeth (nee Varenius), make sausages, pinching the ends shut. That gave him the idea for a sealed triangular pouch that could be a germ-free means of storing milk. Along with a research scientist, Erik Wallenberg, Ruben developed the idea into a rectangular cardboard carton for storing milk, juice, yoghurt and ice-cream. \u201cThe object was to construct a package that would be free from leakage without any special tightening process before being filled,\u201d Wallenberg said. Ruben bought the patent and all rights from Wallenberg for less than \u00a3300.\n\nBy 1952 the first Tetra Pak containers were successfully produced and in a few years Ruben had amassed a business that included bank-note dispensers, water purifiers and paper mills. He brought all his three sons into the family business \u2013 the eldest, Gad, was a chemist, the youngest, Sven, a linguist. It was the middle son, Hans, though, who was the chosen one.\n\nHans, born in Gothenburg, went to the cathedral school in Lund before going on to study economics, statistics and Russian at Lund University, and then following his father\u2019s path to study in the US. \u201c\u2018He was,\u201d Wallenberg recalled, \u201cextremely able and, like his father, single-minded. He believed he was the perfect salesman. I once heard him say he could sell air or water.\u201d\n\nFrom 1950 to 1995 Hans held roles as chief executive and chairman of Tetra Pak, while Gad served initially as deputy managing director. Hans was responsible for Tetra Pak breaking into the Soviet Union, where it became the biggest foreign employer. Today 137bn patented Tetra Paks are sold each year. The Rausings\u2019 success helps explain why early morning Britain no longer rings to the clink of milk bottles.\n\nIf Hans claimed not to understand money, he and Gad were financially astute enough to leave Sweden for Thatcher\u2019s Britain in 1982 to avoid high taxes. Gad bought a vast house in Holland Park, London; Hans purchased a 900-acre estate in the village of Wadhurst in East Sussex where he lived with his wife, M\u00e4rit (nee Norrby), whom he married in 1958, and their three children, Lisbet, Sigrid and Hans Kristian.\n\nThere the Rausings designed and built, with the architect John Outram, a terrazzo and steel one-storey building that he named the New House. At Wadhurst, he raised one of Europe\u2019s largest herds of deer. He also owned a 600-acre wild boar farm in Tenterden, Kent.\n\nThose few journalists invited to Wadhurst Park found the man who topped Britain\u2019s rich list in 1983 humbly squeezing his 6ft 8in frame into a Morris Minor to drive around the estate. Dominic Lawson called him \u201cthe Greta Garbo of business\u201d. Both Hans and Gad eschewed gossip columns and parties.\n\nBusiness journalists struggled, too, to penetrate the Rausings\u2019 empire. Because it was a private company controlled through a Liechtenstein foundation and a Dutch holding group, the firm could avoid publishing annual reports or accounts. In 1991, though, Tetra Pak bought the Swedish agricultural, engineering and food processing group Alfa Laval for \u00a31.5bn.\n\nThough fabulously wealthy, with homes in Sweden, London and Barbados, Hans deprecated the high life: \u201cEither you have 20 mistresses covered with diamonds and a Mercedes 500, or you achieve something with your money. For me it is a passion to try to develop and create industry in different ways.\u201d\n\nIn 1995 Hans sold his share of Tetra Laval to Gad for an estimated $7bn. In 2001, though, he was back in business launching a successor packaging venture, EcoLean, with a container made of about 60% chalk and 40% natural gas. What looked like sibling rivalry to create another multibillion pound packaging business, was rather, Hans claimed, \u201cecologically perfect\u201d.\n\n\u201cNobody else has, so far as I know, imitated an eggshell before, but this is basically an eggshell, only not brittle,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the product is disposed of, it becomes brittle in sunlight and after a month or so it just disintegrates into sand.\u201d Today EcoLean, based in Sk\u00e5ne, has operations in 30 countries.\n\nIn 2006 Rausing received an honorary knighthood in recognition of his philanthropic services. These included a donation of \u00a32.5m to Cambridge University for a maths centre in 1997. His Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project at the University of London supports research, training and archiving of disappearing languages. In 2004, among other donations to the Conservative party, he gave \u00a3198,000 as Michael Howard sought funds to fight the 2005 election.\n\nHis children, who described Rausing as \u201ca loving father and devoted family man\u201d, followed their father in philanthropy. The total value of his family\u2019s donations since 1998 has exceeded \u00a31bn, funding medical research, as well as cultural and environmental projects.\n\nSigrid has written of inheriting great wealth that: \u201cThe pros \u2026 I believe, are largely illusory and can become pathological. An illusory sense of being special and different, the assumption that one is interesting to other people only, or mainly, because of the money and subsequent feelings of isolation.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 she published a memoir, Mayhem, focused on the story of her brother, who became a drug addict in his 20s, and his wife Eva, whom he met in an American rehab clinic, and who was found dead at their home in London in July 2012. She had died two months earlier from what the coroner called the effects of cocaine on a damaged heart.\n\nHans is survived by M\u00e4rit, their children and seven grandchildren.\n\n\u2022 Hans Rausing, entrepreneur and philanthropist, born 25 March 1926; died 30 August 2019", "description": "Businessman behind the Swedish Tetra Pak empire who was one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people", "authors": ["Stuart Jeffries"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f631c5d45bc0f4829184d75994590444015d1f08/71_57_1413_848/master/1413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6e64a505d5cfcb555a1a2b021a2b25b"}
