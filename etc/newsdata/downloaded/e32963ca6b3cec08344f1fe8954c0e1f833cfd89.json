Stewart\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia--Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ.AU) has opted to hold its half-yearly dividend steady but will scale back shareholder franking credits on the payout after a tough year for its main Australian operations.\n\nProfit across the bank, one of the biggest lenders in Australia and in New Zealand, was squeezed in the latest fiscal year by toughened regulatory pressures and another spike in customer compensation charges, as well as global trade tensions and stiff competition at home.\n\nWhile the Australian housing market is showing signs of recovery, ANZ cautioned it expected challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nANZ on Thursday reported its net profit fell by 7% to 5.95 billion Australian dollars (US$4.09 billion) in the 12 months through September from A$6.40 billion the year before. Between the first and second half, profit declined 12% to A$2.78 billion and net interest income slipped 3.5% to A$7.04 billion.\n\nStripping out sold assets, cash earnings--a measure followed by analysts that strips out what the bank considers non-core items such as economic hedges and the revaluation of policy liabilities--were flat for the year at A$6.47 billion as earnings in the Australia division dropped 10% and eased about 4% in New Zealand, offsetting strong growth in the bank's institutional division.\n\nAs a result, Chief Executive Shayne Elliott said the dividend for the second half of the year would be held at A$0.80 a share, but franking would be reduced to 70% from 100% previously. The bank has held the payout steady through four financial years. Australian companies get franking credits when they pay taxes and they are passed down to individual shareholders when dividends are paid, an innovation meant to reduce double-taxing.\n\n\"We're very aware of the impact that it has on our shareholders and we don't take that lightly,\" Mr. Elliott said, adding the reduction in the level of franking was necessary because of the pressure on Australian earnings and after some businesses were solid in the country in recent years.\n\nStill, the CEO said the bank maintained a strong balance sheet, more than met the Australian prudential regulator's target on capital and continued to be profitable, thanks in part to the international, New Zealand and institutional operations.\n\nMr. Elliott said operational improvements made to the Australian home loans business were expected to help restore market share in targeted segments, but record low interest rates and intense competition would continue to impact profitability. Geopolitical tensions would also put pressure on earnings, given ANZ's exposure to global trade, and the bank was awaiting for new regulatory capital settings to be finalized in New Zealand.\n\nUnder Mr. Elliott, who took over as chief executive in 2016 after about four years as finance chief, the bank has tightened its focus on its core franchises in Australia and New Zealand with moves to sell its life insurance businesses in both countries, its pensions and investments businesses, and a number of retail banking and wealth-management operations in Asia.\n\nFor the latest financial year, ANZ said the level of new impaired assets was 5% lower than during the prior year at A$2.01 billion, though the total provision charge was 16% higher at A$795 million.\n\nAs flagged in early October, ANZ booked a further A$559 million charge for customer compensation and remediation programs to lift the annual provision to A$682 million.\n\nWrite to Robb M.
