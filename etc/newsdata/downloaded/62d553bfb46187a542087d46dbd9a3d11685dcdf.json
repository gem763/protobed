I needed chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, then surgery and radiotherapy.\n\nI was also offered screening to establish if the cancer had been caused by a genetic mutation.\n\nI assured my family everything would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. A few weeks into treatment, I learned I had tested positive for BRCA2 \u2013 a similar genetic mutation to the one Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has.\n\nThis meant I needed a different type of chemotherapy, and due to the risk of developing ovarian cancer, doctors would have to \u2018shut down\u2019 my ovaries until I could have them removed.\n\nNext, I had to find out which parent I\u2019d inherited the genetic mutation from.\n\nI insisted on going with Mum for her results. When we heard the word \u2018positive\u2019, she sobbed, saying it was her fault. But I told her it was like blaming herself for giving me brown eyes.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve 2015, I had a double mastectomy and five lymph nodes removed from my left armpit. It was lovely to wake up in 2016, knowing I was free of cancer.\n\nRadiotherapy was a breeze compared to chemo and I was over the moon when my hair grew back. As time passed, I allowed myself to hope I\u2019d beaten cancer forever.\n\nI took up swing dancing and met Richard on a dating website. On our first date, I told him I couldn\u2019t have children, while he said he never wanted to get married. Things couldn\u2019t have been more perfect.\n\nEverything was going brilliantly until last August, when I found a tiny lump on the left side of my neck. When doctors broke the news I had secondary cancer, and that there was no cure, I was so shocked I fainted.\n\nBut my consultant explained there were treatments to keep the cancer at bay for as long as possible and I was put on a trial of the drug Olaparib.\n\nTwo weeks later, Richard whisked me away to a gorgeous hotel in Devon, and stunned me by proposing. We both cried as he slid the ring on to my finger.\n\nI dread the thought of him being a young widower and I\u2019ve given him the opportunity to walk away, but he says he\u2019s going nowhere. I\u2019ve found a very special person.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, the tumours in my chest have vanished. And despite having another lymph node removed recently, I\u2019m doing OK.\n\nI look at my cancer as something like diabetes \u2013 I have to take medication to keep it at bay. I might not live as long as everyone else, but I\u2019ll be all right for a little while.\n\nKnowing that my mum and sister are going to be OK is wonderful.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful that technology has evolved to make this possible.\n\nI hope my niece doesn\u2019t have to go through what we have, but who knows what brilliant treatments will be available when she\u2019s older.\n\nI\u2019m so looking forward to our wedding day later this month, and married life with James. We spent our honeymoon money on a cockapoo puppy called Biscuit, and we adore her.\n\nDuring one low moment, Richard asked me to tell him everything I\u2019d like to do \u2013 from taking my nieces and nephews to a theme park to trying the dog-racing sport Flyball with Biscuit \u2013 and covered a wall in Post-it notes.\n\nWe\u2019re working our way through them, so we\u2019re not focusing on the cancer, but making happy memories.\n\nI felt so guilty for passing on gene\n\nApril\u2019s mum, Sally Fellingham-Huggett, 58, a training course organiser, lives in Brockham, Surrey, with her husband, Jim, 67, a plumber.\n\nDiscovering I was the one who had passed on the BRCA2 gene made me feel terribly guilty.\n\nAs a parent you do everything you can to protect your children. Knowing I\u2019d inherited it from my parents and couldn\u2019t have done anything about it didn\u2019t take away that horrible feeling.\n\nApril being April just kept saying: \u201cMum, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\nHaving my ovaries removed via keyhole surgery was straightforward \u2013 and it turned out to be a lifesaver as a biopsy revealed that my right ovary was emitting rogue cells.\n\nThen, in March this year, I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction after a mammogram revealed early signs of breast cancer. It\u2019s astounding to think that, thanks to this incredible research, my life has been saved twice and it\u2019s given us all more precious time together.\n\nIt\u2019s lovely to see April happy, she is the kindest, loveliest person. I know she worries about leaving people behind, particularly Richard, but he will be looked after by us and will always be our link to her.\n\nNo one deserves this lovely wedding more than them. There won\u2019t be a dry eye in the house.\n\nMy sister is a real inspiration\n\nTeaching assistant Zoe Davies, 33, is April\u2019s older sister. She is married to Lewis, a PE teacher, and they live in Dorking, Surrey, with their three children.\n\nApril\u2019s first diagnosis was a massive shock \u2013 especially because she was so young. They say you go through stages dealing with cancer and there was a time when I was so angry as it was just so cruel. Although Mum went for screening immediately, I spent a year considering my options.\n\nI suffer from health anxiety and had to know what my response would be either way.\n\nEven then, the decision to have a double mastectomy wasn\u2019t straightforward. The genealogist and surgeon couldn\u2019t have been more supportive, but I felt awkward discussing preventative surgery when April never had that option.\n\nI\u2019m looking into a trial where rather than removing the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, surgeons just remove the tubes as it has fewer side effects for pre-menopausal women.\n\nWe\u2019ll give our children the option of being screened when they are older, but I\u2019d never force them into it. I can only support them.\n\nIf April hadn\u2019t found the cancer so early, we could be facing a lot less time with her. She has a lot of options and we\u2019re so proud of how well she is living with this.\n\nShe is a massive inspiration and couldn\u2019t be more loved.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWHAT IS GENETIC SCREENING?\n\nBRCA1 and 2 are the most common inherited altered genes that increase the risk of breast cancer developing.\n\nChildren have a 50% chance of inheriting these genes, but need to be aged 18 before they can undergo a risk assessment.\n\nAnyone with concerns can ask their GP for advice and a referral to a genetic screening centre where experts can establish their risk level.\n\nOptions include regular breast screening, risk-reducing drugs, genetic counselling and genetic testing, plus surgery for people at high risk.\n\nTHINK PINK\n\nRaise money during Breast Cancer Awareness Month with these charitable buys\n\n\u25a0 Diet Coke, 50p (10% to Tickled Pink), Asda\n\n\u25a0 Bra, \u00a332 (with \u00a31 to Against Breast Cancer), Royce Lingerie\n\n\u25a0 PG Tips teabags, \u00a32 (10% to Tickled Pink), Asda\n\n\u25a0 Journal, \u00a324.50 (10% to Pink Ribbon Foundation), penheaven.co.uk\n\n\u25a0 Pyjama set, \u00a335 (20% to Breast Cancer Now), Marks & Spencer\n\n\u25a0 Wash bag, \u00a322 (all proceeds to Breast Cancer Care), breastcancercare.org.uk\n\n* April and her family are supporting Breast Cancer Now\u2019s \u201cWear It Pink\u201d campaign on October 18.
