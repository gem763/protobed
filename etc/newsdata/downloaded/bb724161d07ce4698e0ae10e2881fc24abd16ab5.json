President Donald Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban tried their luck back in 2008, when they turned an MMA apparel company, Affliction, into an actual promotion that the UFC successfully counterprogrammed.\n\nTrump and Cuban dropped the venture, unable to compete with the world's leading mixed martial arts promotion. After two successful Affliction events, a third one went up in flames when one half of the headlining fight tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The promotion folded immediately after that.\n\nBut now, a new league is coming to town, one that is completely different from the product UFC fans have come to know over the years. A promotion that has dominated the Asian MMA market and is closing in on their 100th show.\n\nA NEW PLAYER IN TOWN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nONE Championship, the biggest sports promotion in Asia will be a soon-to-be presence in the US after signing a television deal with TNT Sports late last year, president Chatri Sityodong told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cWe offer a completely, 180 degree, diametrically opposed product to what North American MMA fans are used to seeing (in promotions like UFC and Bellator),\u201d Sityodong told FNB in a phone interview Friday.\n\n\u201cAmerican MMA is a blood sport, it promotes anger\u2026 controversy\u2026 negative energy. What ONE Championship does is offer a very different set of values. Things like respect, honor, humility.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe showcase the best of humanity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a sport that\u2019s become synonymous with the letters UFC, mixed martial arts has always had it's roots in more traditional disciplines, ranging from standup games from Muay Thai, kickboxing and karate to wrestling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nIn the UFC, fans have come to know household names like Conor McGregor and Jon Jones, two of the brightest stars of the sport. But both men have continually found themselves in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Just last week, McGregor made headlines after sucker-punching an elderly man in his native Ireland, all for refusing a drink of McGregor\u2019s whisky brand Proper 12.\n\nBefore that, it was smashing a fan\u2019s cell phone in Miami. Then there was the time where \u201cThe Notorious\u201d and his crew crashed a Brooklyn press conference at the Barclay\u2019s Center, and tossed a metal dolly through a bus window in a melee with future opponent Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\nThings have not faired much better for Jones, who\u2019s litany of scandals have kept him on the sidelines more often than not, over a few failed drug tests and a hit-and-run that saw Jones\u2019 car smash into a pregnant woman\u2019s car, breaking her arm.\n\nOther former UFC fighters have left a permanent black eye on the promotion\u2019s reputation. \u201cWar Machine,\u201d formerly known as Jon Koppenhaver, is currently serving a life sentence in Nevada for nearly beating his ex-girlfriend, Christie Mack, to death, in Aug. 2014. Former UFC light heavyweight Thiago Silva was arrested that same year after bringing a gun to his ex-wife\u2019s new boyfriend\u2019s Florida Jiu-Jitsu studio.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for the 550 fighters under the ONE Championship banner.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find a single scandal with any of our top stars, or any of our fighters for that matter,\u201d Sityodong emphasized. \u201cYou can\u2019t find a single article of any of our athletes getting into trouble, no drugs, no DUIs, no assaults.\u201d\n\nBIG BUSINESS TO BE MADE\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to see ONE Championship make a concerted effort to lure North American fans over to their promotion.\n\nMMA has become big business in the continent over the years, with the UFC being sold to Hollywood powerhouse WME-IMG for $4.025 billion in July 2016. The promotion just recently inked a lucrative deal with ESPN, valued at $7 billion after the ESPN deal, according to UFC president Dana White.\n\nThe five-year ESPN deal alone is worth $1.5 billion.\n\nONE Championship is looking for their piece of that pie after signing a television rights deal with TNT Sports, to air events live in North American TVs, in major North American cities, to offer their MMA product for fans who might be getting turned off from the soap opera the UFC has become. For a company that began in 2011 solely in Asian territories, ONE Championsip has turned a corner over the last year, making the move into the US market an obvious one.\n\nIn October of last year, One Championship announced it had closed a $166 million financing round led by Sequoia Capital, pushing the Asian mixed martial arts promotion's total capital base past $250 million.\n\nThe Singapore-based company is now opening offices in New York City and Los Angeles as they begin to make inroads into the North American MMA market.\n\nCHALLENGING AN INDUSTRY GIANT, TOPPLING A MONOPOLY\n\nThe odds of going toe-to-toe with the UFC and coming out on top may seem steep, but the move has become increasingly organic and more realistic by the month. ONE Championship recently signed former UFC flyweight champion and pound-for-pound great Demetrious \u201cMighty Mouse\u201d Johnson and former UFC lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez last year, with both men making their ONE Championship debuts in March.\n\nSage Northcutt, another name many North American MMA fans have become familiar with thanks to an eight-fight UFC stint, signed with ONE Championship shortly thereafter before making his debut with the promotion in May.\n\n\u201cThe UFC stars who have come over, and a lot of UFC stars have reached out (to us)\u2026 we carefully select those that represent our values. Fighters like Eddie Alvarez, Demetrious Johnson, Sage Northcutt,\u201d Sityodong said. \u201cWe are not interested in loud, brash characters like in western promotions. Our stars are role models, people little boys and girls worldwide can look to as inspiration.\u201d\n\nThe three-year broadcast deal with Turner Sports kicked off on in Dec. 2018, with 24 events scheduled for 2019. The first ONE Championship broadcast set to air in primetime in the US on Oct. 12, and will also commemorate ONE Championship\u2019s 100th event.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Asia-based MMA promotion ONE Championship is taking their brand of mixed martial arts to the US, with president Chatri Sityodong telling FBN North American fans can expect an entirely different product than what they're used to.", "authors": ["Matt Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/ONEFC_stadium.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-08-25"}
