Read this first", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s a visceral commitment to a relationship that means something to you (Picture: The Rock/Ryan Reynolds)\n\nSo, you want to pay someone to stitch ink onto your skin permanently to commemorate a friendship? Terrific.\n\nI absolutely get why you would want to. We have things like weddings and engagement rings and registry gifts and honeymoons to mark the occasion of falling in romantic love with another human being, but we have so few official ways to celebrate the platonic love we have in our lives.\n\nFriendship bracelets? The ones with half a heart on a piece of string? I understand if that\u2019s not enough.\n\nIn the absence of some kind of friendship consolidation ceremony, probably the thing that feels about as monumental as your love for your BFF is getting some ink on your skin.\n\nIt\u2019s a (painful) little ceremony, a way of saying: \u2018I intend to have this person around for the rest of my life\u2019. It\u2019s a visceral commitment to a relationship that means something to you and I think it could be incredible\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m here for it, I really am. And so are a lot of celebrities, as it turns out.\n\nIf you\u2019re really keen on getting inked with your mate, have a little peak at what some famous besties have done to mark their friendship. They actually have some ideas worth checking out, to be honest.\n\nThey\u2019re thoughtful and cute and meaningful, which friendships tattoos should be.\n\nFor example, Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner got the date 07.08.09 tattooed on their forearms because that\u2019s the day they found out they were both cast in Game of Thrones \u2013 the show that would define the beginnings of their careers and, probably even more importantly, where they met.\n\nMaisie Williams and Sophie Turner got the date 07.08.09 tattooed on their forearms because that\u2019s the day they found out they were both cast in Game of Thrones (Picture: E!)\n\nThey\u2019re not going to regret that ever, because that date will always mean something to them.\n\nSame for the main cast members of the TV show Pretty Little Liars, all of whom got the first initial of their character\u2019s name tattooed on the inside of their index finger to commemorate their time on the show as well as their real-life friendship.\n\nMargot Robbie and Cara Delevingne got matching smiley face tattoos on their toes while they were filming Suicide Squad together. Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson got matching bus tattoos to signify where they stayed while on tour with One Direction together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKendall Jenner and Hayley Baldwin got broken hearts on the inside of their fingers \u2013 one in red and one in white ink. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure what the significance of that is\u2026 maybe how they\u2019d feel if they weren\u2019t in one another\u2019s lives?\n\nWhatever, they\u2019re all adorable. I suspect Zayn and Louis may be the only ones who might regret their permanent decision (they allegedly don\u2019t get on anymore) but they\u2019ve got so many other tattoos on their bods, it\u2019s probably not too tragic for them.\n\nTattoos have a long, important history for a lot of cultures and it can be an extremely significant, moving and emotional thing to do.\n\nIt is technically possible to draw over or erase a tattoo, but I believe that\u2019s expensive and painful, so before you book your ink, have a little think. Here\u2019s a few things to ponder.\n\nThink about it first\n\nDon\u2019t do this on a whim. Don\u2019t do this drunk and don\u2019t do this high.\n\nDon\u2019t do this on a dare from someone else. Don\u2019t do this because you want to annoy your parents.\n\nDon\u2019t do this because you\u2019ve been peer-pressured into it because tattoos are cool. Have a real, serious, private think about whether you feel comfortable getting permanently inked and whether it feels right for you.\n\nTalk about it a lot first, do some sketches and make sure you like and trust the artist who is going to do it. Think about the cost and the pain and the permanency. Don\u2019t rush into this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStart small\n\nYou do you, but I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend getting your best friend\u2019s life-size face tattooed on your own. Maybe go small when you get your first tattoo \u2013 like all the celebrities I just mentioned.\n\nTiny tattoos on the inside of a finger, on your wrist or on your hip are fashionable and also very sweet. Especially if this is your first time getting inked, I reckon you could probably start out a bit modest.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s quite nice to have a secret little memento of a friendship that you can hide or show when you like. That said, if you want to get two enormous red lobsters or a giant heart to signify how much you adore this person, who am I to stop you?\n\nJust as long as you feel like you\u2019ve thought it all through.\n\nRemember that friendships end\n\nSometimes, life happens and friendships end \u2013 even the ones we swear we\u2019d never let go. You will be able to heal your heart but what about the great big emblem you have on your skin? There reminding you of that person forever more?\n\nTo protect yourself in the case of a friendship breakup, you could go with something you like anyway: a symbol or an animal or an initial that you could co-opt and make your own if the love between you and your mate fades.\n\nIt could be something that means something to you. Or, really, just something you wouldn\u2019t mind having even if things don\u2019t work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a rough thing to think about, I know, but I don\u2019t want you out there at 80 years old, staring sadly at the little tattoo of your mate\u2019s full name on your wrist, wondering why you committed so hardcore to a friendship that\u2019s gone.\n\nIf you\u2019ve thought about it and you feel as though you still want something that marks your friendship forever, then go forth and get inked.\n\nMay you and your best friend be as hardy and as enduring as that picture on your skin.\n\nMORE: These are the lies Friends told us about friendship\n\nMORE: How to get over an argument with your office bestie\n\nMORE: As Anton showed with Molly-Mae, it\u2019s perfectly fine to unfollow your friends\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Are friendship tattoos ever a good idea?
