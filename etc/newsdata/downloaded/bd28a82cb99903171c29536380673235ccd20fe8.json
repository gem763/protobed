The latest example is former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nA new report by the Office of the Inspector General for the Justice Department found that Comey had written FBI memos, illicitly passed them on to a lawyer friend, who in turn leaked them to a friendly New York Times reporter who had been spreading the Russian conspiracy theory.\n\nWhy? Because Comey was interested in extracting revenge on the man who had fired him, Donald Trump.\n\nComey, the report found, had leaked \u201cinvestigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\u201d\n\nThat outcome, as Comey had admitted to Congress, was to \u201cprompt the appointment of a special counsel\u201d to investigate the president\u2019s alleged conspiracy with the Russian government to win the 2016 election. By doing this, the DOJ inspector general, who is widely considered both meticulous and unbiased, found that Comey had \u201cset a dangerous example\u201d and \u201creleas[ed] sensitive information\u201d to \u201ccreate public pressure for official action.\u201d\n\nIt worked. And by manufacturing an investigation into the president \u2014 one that he didn\u2019t have enough evidence to pursue in an official capacity \u2014 Comey had not only abused his power but plunged the nation into two years of hysterics about Russian interference.\n\nIn the end, Comey\u2019s good friend Robert Mueller, despite his best efforts, couldn\u2019t ferret out a single instance of criminal conspiracy.\n\nIf you want to know why so many Americans believe there\u2019s a \u201cdeep state\u201d working against their interests, look no further than men like Comey. We have growing evidence that senior officials in the FBI and CIA acted as partisan opponents of the duly elected president, abetting and inciting partisan investigations.\n\nAmericans will continue to lose trust in institutions, if leaders keep misappropriating power for political purposes. Comey claimed he leaked his memos because they were of \u201cincredible importance to the Nation, as a whole,\u201d which is what everyone who has ever pursued arbitrary and capricious power says to rationalize their abuse.\n\nDavid Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.", "description": "For nearly three years now, those who promise to save us from the wicked clutches of President Donald Trump have bombarded America with lectures about the \u201crule of law.\u201d Yet, over and over again, these self-styled champions of justice feel free to disregard the law whenever it suits them.
