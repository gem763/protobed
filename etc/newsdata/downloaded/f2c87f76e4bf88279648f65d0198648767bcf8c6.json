The dry air can lead to tightness and irritation, and the lack of moisture in the cabin can cause your skin to overproduce oil and generate breakouts. More than once I\u2019ve touched down, looked in a mirror, and found a brewing cystic pimple on my chin and a scaly red patch on my cheek.\n\nBut canceling my travel plans in order to keep my skin flawless would be excessive, even for me. I used to attempt to prevent in-flight skin issues by piling products onto my face in-flight: I\u2019d tap on snail essence, do a sheet mask, oil my cuticles, and use a lip scrub to get rid of flakiness. Lately, I\u2019ve been finding it\u2019s all too much for me \u2014 especially if it\u2019s an early or late flight and I just want to sit down and pass out. So I decided to quit in-flight treatments entirely and created an intensive preflight treatment; that way, I can get my skin ready before I head to the airport, feeling confident I\u2019ve done everything in my power to prevent breakouts and eczema flare-ups, then put on my neck pillow and drift off to sleep. Below, my go-to four-step routine that protects my skin just as effectively as my in-flight spa did.\n\nDr. Loretta Intense Replenishing Serum This is the serum to use before flights. Though it\u2019s ultra-thick, my skin drinks it up immediately \u2014 after applying it, my face feels smooth and supple. This product includes vitamin E and linoleic acids, both of which are meant to heal and moisturize dry, damaged skin, and antioxidants, meant to protect skin from environmental stressors (like pollution, or, in this case, disgusting plane air). Basically, it locks in good things for your skin and protects it from the bad. Before my flight, I rub half a dropper of this in between my hands and press it all over my face, and when I step off the plane my skin still looks hydrated, nourished, and doesn\u2019t even have a touch of redness or inflammation. $70 at Dermstore Buy\n\nCosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask Then I apply a sleeping pack for an extra boost of nourishment and to ensure my Dr. Loretta is locked in. Sleeping packs, if you don\u2019t know, are like a combination of an evening moisturizer and a mask \u2014 they are ultra-hydrating and include potent brightening, healing, or anti-aging ingredients that you wouldn\u2019t typically find in your evening moisturizer. This one from Cosrx, for instance, is rich and moisturizing and also uses honey (an anti-inflammatory) to combat any kind of redness, acne, or irritation. It\u2019s the perfect treatment for combating and healing breakouts or any kind of skin irritation. This is not an everyday product (it\u2019s an intensive!), but it\u2019s really and truly perfect preflight. $18 at Dermstore Buy\n\nEnsilia CPP Collagen 80% Intensive Eye Cream My under-eyes get extremely puffy, dry, and itchy during and after my flight. It\u2019s a horrible feeling. So before I leave the house, and once my sleeping pack properly absorbs, I really pack on eye cream to ensure that my under-eyes stay hydrated and soothed. I love my trusty Ensilia Eye Cream: It\u2019s so soothing and hydrating (way more hydrating than my Drunk Elephant C Tango, for context, but just as brightening). It has collagen for plumping, shea butter for moisturizing, and niacinamide for brightening \u2014 so your eyes look awake, instead of like dry little slits, when you land. $20 at Soko Glam Buy\n\nBite Beauty Agave+ Nighttime Lip Therapy This is the best lip treatment in the game, period. It\u2019s insanely rich and moisturizing \u2014 way more than Laneige, in my opinion \u2014 and gets rid of (and prevents!) any flakiness, dryness, or tightness. I lather this on before flights so that my lips can soak it up during and are nice and plump when I land. $22 at Sephora Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
