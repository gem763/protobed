Jamie Vardy #9,\" alongside a fist emoji, in an apparent reference to Coleen's bombshell claims that Vardy's Instagram account had been behind the leaking of stories about the Rooneys to a British tabloid.\n\nColeen, wife to Wayne Rooney, posted a lengthy statement on Twitter earlier this month in which she made the claims.\n\nShe concluded the statement with the comment: \"It's...... Rebekah Vardy's account.\"\n\nRebekah has vehemently denied all allegations and has since hired a cyber security expert to clear her name.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFoxes striker Vardy bagged a hat-trick at St Mary's on Friday night as Leicester ran out 9-0 winners over Southampton .\n\nThe result is the biggest away win in Premier League history, and the joint biggest overall.\n\nAfter the match Vardy revealed how Jonny Evans informed his team-mates they could set a new record mid-game.\n\nHe told Kelly Cates on Sky Sports: \"We actually found out we could break the record at 6-0. Jonny Evans came sprinting over to tell us we could get the record if we carry on doing what we're doing.\n\n\"We've gone all the way to the end and managed to do it, but it's a great victory and a great performance from the lads.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it was a complete performance. We know when you've got ten men it can be difficult, but we also knew if we carried on with our game plan we could cause them lots of problems.\n\n\"As you can see from the result, it's credit to the boys and a great win.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked how this team compares to the Leicester team that won the Premier League title, Vardy added: \"I think football-wise it's obviously different - there was a lot of counter-attacking when we won the league.\n\n\"Tonight we showed we can attack, keep the ball really well do it at pace and hurt anyone.\"", "description": "Rebekah Vardy took to Twitter after her husband Jamie netted a hat-trick in Leicester City's 9-0 victory", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Mirrorpix Via Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pride-Of-Sport-Awards-2018-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
