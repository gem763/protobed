I think that it was a suggestion,\" Marc Short told reporters.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Pence has repeatedly supported policies hostile to the LGBT+ community.\n\n\u201cFor all of you who still think our [vice-president] is anti-gay, I point you to his and the Second Lady\u2019s schedule tomorrow where they will join Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his partner Dr Matthew Barrett for lunch in Ireland,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere tweeted.\n\nMr Pence is set to discuss Brexit with both Mr Varadkar and British prime minister Boris Johnson, who the vice-president will meet on Thursday when he flies to London.\n\n\"We will continue to work closely with our partners in Ireland and the United Kingdom to support a Brexit plan that encourages stability and also one that keeps the strong foundation forged by the Good Friday Agreement,\" Mr Pence told reporters after arriving in Ireland.\n\n\"We understand these are complex issues.\"", "description": "Mike Pence has chosen to stay at\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort during a visit to Ireland, despite his official duties all taking place\u00a0on the other side of the country in Dublin.
