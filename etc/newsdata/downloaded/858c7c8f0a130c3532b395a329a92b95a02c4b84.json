I\u2019m worried that they are dangerous \u2014 should I be? And what can I do about them?\n\nA: Skin tags are like \u2018tiny hernias \u2014 small sacks protruding from the skin\u2019, says consultant dermatologist, Dr Nick Lowe (cranleyclinic.com).\n\nThey can happen when the skin becomes less strong and elastic; you can sometimes see them increase with age and during or after pregnancy.\n\nAn anonymous reader, 59, asked British beauty expert Inge van Lotringen for advice on removing skin tags (file image)\n\nThey\u2019re harmless, however they can be unsightly; fortunately, they can be easily snipped off and cauterised with an electrolysis needle (you\u2019ll hardly feel it) or, for bigger ones, using laser.\n\nIt is best to have this done by a dermatologist so as to avoid scars or discolouration.\n\nThis will also ensure that your tags are correctly identified. It is important to check that they are not something more sinister, like pre-cancerous lesions.\n\nYou\u2019re looking at paying from \u00a3100 for this proceedure.\n\nAlternatively, try the Excilor Skin Tag Treatment (\u00a324.99, lloyds pharmacy.com): it lets you safely (and painlessly) cut off the blood supply to your tags until they drop off, using special plasters.\n\nIf your tags are really multiplying, Dr Lowe also advises seeing a specialist for collagen-boosting treatments such as fractional laser (from around \u00a3200) or prescription retinoids.\n\nThese will strengthen and thicken skin\u2019s support structure and minimise the chance of tags forming.\n\nCosmopolitan beauty director Ingeborg van Lotringen (pictured) advised the reader to see a dermatologist to have the skin tags removed\n\nIngeborg van Lotringen is beauty director at Cosmopolitan.
