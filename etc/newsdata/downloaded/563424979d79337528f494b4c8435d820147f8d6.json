This is in Greek English.\n\n\"I'm very well educated. I'm going to university, I got an unconditional offer so there is no way I would write a paragraph like this.\"\n\nHer lawyers say she was told what to write by Cypriot police, led by Detective Sergeant Marios Christou, and the teenager made the statement fearing she would be kidnapped or killed.\n\n\"It doesn't make grammatical sense,\" the teenager said.\n\n\"All the way through there isn't one sentence an English person would write.\"\n\nShe broke down in court as she said she had lied to her mother in a text sent from the police station, when she messaged: \"Trust me, I'm OK.\"\n\nShe told the court: \"I think any child will lie to their parents to tell them they are OK because parents don't stop worrying about their child.\n\n\"If your child had just been raped by 12 Israelis and wouldn't get out of bed and had a throat so swollen she couldn't breathe and was taken to the police station for what she thought was an hour but then went on to be nearly eight hours.\"\n\nIn court\n\nBy Anna Holligan, BBC News\n\nShe stood through hours of intensive cross examination inside the claustrophobic courtroom.\n\nThe only point at which the teenager's composure crumbled was when the prosecutor asked about her relationship with her mother.\n\n\"We're like best friends. She's incredibly strong. She raised me, a single parent. I tell my mum everything.\"\n\nHer mum looked on from the cramped wooden benches.\n\nThe woman also said she had previously suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after an accident, and has been experiencing renewed symptoms following the alleged rape.\n\nShe added that she also had to take eight tablets a day, including HIV prevention medication.\n\n\"After it happened, even if a man was within a metre of me it would make me feel horrible, but they wouldn't make me feel threatened for my life,\" she said, adding that she felt \"vulnerable\" by the way Detective Sergeant Christou \"was approaching me and shouting at me to stop crying\".\n\n\"I felt like I was in danger because he wasn't going by the law, I wasn't allowed a lawyer,\" she added.\n\n\"I immediately assumed corruption and conspiracy so I wouldn't put it past him, I wouldn't be surprised if at that moment he would have kidnapped me and killed me.\"\n\nTwelve young Israelis were arrested in connection with the allegations but were later released and have returned home.\n\nThe woman was granted bail at the end of August, after spending four and a half weeks in prison. She cannot leave the island.\n\nShe could face up to a year in prison and a 1,700 euro (about \u00a31,500) fine if she is found guilty.", "description": "A British teenager accused of lying about being raped told the court she was forced her to retract her claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B8B5/production/_109258274_gettyimages-865188896.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
