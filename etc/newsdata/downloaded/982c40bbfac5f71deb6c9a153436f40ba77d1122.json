It has been estimated that her bills will top \u00a3200,000.\n\nWhen Begum was granted legal aid in April, then defence secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a \u2018shame\u2019 public money was being spent.\n\nThe Tory MP, now the Education Secretary, said: \u2018Quite frankly the British people don\u2019t like it, and quite simply neither do I. People cannot see as to why she is getting legal aid when she turned her back on this country.\u2019\n\nMore than three quarters of claims made to the Legal Aid Agency to appeal against \u2018citizenship deprivation orders\u2019 have been successful. The UK Border is pictured above at Heathrow\n\nHowever, it has now been revealed that of the 118 jihadis, suspected terrorists and criminals who have had their British citizenship revoked in the last three years, 26 have applied for legal aid to fund their fight to return here.\n\nFigures released under Freedom of Information rules show 20 applications have been granted so far.\n\nIn 2014, the government extended the British Nationality Act 1981 to allow people to be made stateless if they have \u2018conducted themselves in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK\u2019.\n\nSince then, a number of Britons who joined Islamic State have been stripped of their citizenship, including \u2018Jihadi Jack\u2019 Letts, who left the UK in 2014, aged 18, to join IS.\n\nThe two British terrorists from the so-called \u2018Beatles\u2019 cell of Islamic State, El Shafee Elsheikh, 31, and Alexanda Kotey, 35, have also lost their passports.\n\nThe news comes after the Mail revealed Begum, 20, was receiving legal aid to fight the decision by then home secretary Sajid Javid, above, to strip her of her British citizenship\n\nAll three would be eligible to apply for legal aid. Taxpayers now face a bill \u2013 which could run into the millions \u2013 as the Special Immigration Appeals Commission hears a string of legal challenges to citizenship deprivation orders.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency was only able to provide costs for completed cases, saying \u00a341,170 of public money had already been spent on a small number of challenges.\n\nThe situation was branded an \u2018outrage\u2019 yesterday by the families of IRA victims, who battled for years to get taxpayer help with their legal bills.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u2018Someone appealing a decision to revoke their British citizenship could have further grounds to challenge it if they did not have access to legal representation, but legal aid is only granted if they meet strict eligibility tests.\u2019", "description": "Taxpayers are footing the bill for one in six extremists who have had their UK passports removed since 2016, figures revealed yesterday.", "authors": ["Rebecca Camber Crime Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197144-0-image-a-18_1572036932932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
