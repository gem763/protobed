Another major Tory donor, Ehud Sheleg, who has given the party almost \u00a33m, was given a knighthood.\n\nOlly Robbins, May\u2019s EU adviser, who was loathed by Brexiters, and George Holingbery, her former parliamentary aide, were both made knight commanders of the order of St Michael and St George. It emerged on Monday that Robbins is to take a sabbatical holding a visiting fellowship at Oxford University before leaving the civil service to join Goldman Sachs\u2019 investment banking division.\n\nJohn Mann, who announced that he was standing down as a Labour MP this week to concentrate full time on his role as the government\u2019s antisemitism tsar, was elevated to the Lords as a non-affiliated peer. May also gave a peerage to Sir Kim Darroch, the former ambassador to Washington, who stepped aside following a row about leaked criticism of US president Donald Trump.\n\nSeveral MPs who have been staunch defenders of May were also rewarded with honours, including Brandon Lewis and Patrick McLoughlin, two former party chairmen, George Hollingbery, her former parliamentary aide, and Charles Walker, a backbencher who decried the party\u2019s treatment of her.\n\nThe lowest honours, British Empire Medals, were given to a Downing Street housekeeper and chef at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s grace-and-favour country retreat.\n\nIan Lavery, chairman of the Labour party, said it came as \u201cno surprise that big Tory donors and No 10 cronies are being honoured yet again\u201d. \u201cThe Tories only care about looking after their own and will only stand up for the wealthy few who fund them,\u201d he said.\n\nPete Wishart, a senior SNP MP, accused May of \u201chanding out peerages like sweeties to the same Tory advisers who got us into this Brexit mess\u201d. He said it was the \u201cworst kind of cronyism, and demonstrates everything that is wrong with the broken Westminster system.\n\n\n\n\u201cWestminster is not working for Scotland. The House of Lords should have been abolished decades ago and the whole rotten system is in desperate need of reform.\u201d\n\nA source close to May\u2019s former administration stressed that the ex-prime minister has had a long political career and that people from different walks of public life were honoured in the list, not just ex-advisers.\n\nLabour\u2019s nominations for new peers include Christine Blower, a former general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, John Hendy, an honorary professor at University College London, and Debbie Wilcox, the leader of Newport city council and Welsh local government association. The Green party put forward Natalie Bennett, the former party leader.\n\nIn other appointments, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, becomes a dame, while Lady Justice Hallett, vice-president of the court of appeal criminal division, becomes a life peer.\n\nSir Simon Woolley, the founder of operation Black Vote, and Ruth Hunt, the ex-chief executive of Stonewall, were also made crossbench life peers.", "description": "Decision to give CBEs to her two controversial former advisers and party donors is condemned", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391f41f534d372853a9b5118068f809c71cf6de4/0_8_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2dace23b14940d882921eac4a7cd3441", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
