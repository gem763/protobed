The company is China's latest potash producer but also provides the liquid magnesium that Magontec needs to make the alloy ingots it sells to automakers and other customers. The state-owned company owns a 120-square-kilometre salt lake in Golmud, a remote city on the Tibetan plateau\n\nMagontec owns a cast house which pipes liquid magnesium alloy between furnaces and casting belts on an industrial estate owned by QSLG. The facility opened in April last year.\n\n\"As far as Magontec is concerned, it has stable other sources of cash and income and I'm sure that will see us through a difficult stage,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\n'Zombie' enterprises\n\nQSLIC and Magontec teamed up in in 2013 and the Chinese company owns 29 per cent in the ASX-listed firm after being given Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval to cross the 19.9 per cent threshold which usually triggers a takeover. Mr Andrews said he was confident a new owner would takeover the company's liabilities and retain its stake in Magontec.\n\nChina has ordered many of highly-leveraged state-owned enterprises to cut debt under a restructuring program. While under-performing \u201czombie\u201d enterprises are being shut down, others that are crucial to the country\u2019s economy are being merged, restructured or salvaged with injections of private capital.\n\nMagontec's cast house has the capacity to produce 60,000 tonnes a year which would potentially make it the biggest in the world. However, its factory has been operating at low volumes since opening because QSLG was unable to produce the 1000 tonnes of supply per month that Magontec needs for the operation to break even.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Andrews said it was currently producing nearly 800 tonnes a month with liquid magnesium from other sources and volumes would grow.\n\nOn Sept 30, QSLIC issued a notice of bankruptcy with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange where it is listed and had applied for a restructuring with a Chinese court. A report in the Beijing News said Australian law firm King & Wood Mallesons was working on the restructure which is being headed by a senior government official Wang Liming, the vice-governor of Qinhai Province.\n\nQinghai Salt Lake Magnesium had a total debt of 42.3 billion yuan ($8.3 billion) and lost 7.9 billion yuan in 2017 and 2018 combined, according to stock exchange filings.\n\nMagnesium is a lightweight metal most commonly used to make cars. China dominates global production at a time when prices are rising due to growing demand for lighter materials in electric vehicles and batteries. Demand has also increased as China shuts down labour-intensive and polluting factories.", "description": "Australia's Magontec is confident problems facing its debt-laden Chinese partner Qinghai Salt Lake Industry will be resolved.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_278%2C$y_74/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cffb828c745766184c20b8348e9f8d852ea5ae12", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
