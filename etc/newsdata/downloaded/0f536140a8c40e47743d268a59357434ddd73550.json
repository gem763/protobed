In some cases, that means investing in highly trained super-dogs that cost more than a house. With a single command, these four-legged bodyguards can go from cute and cuddly to a bad guy's worst nightmare. The price of this unique protection can be as much as $230,000. \"Our clients range from executives, to professional athletes and lots of women who are home alone quite a bit,\" says November Holley, president of Harrison K-9, an Aiken, South Carolina-based company that imports and sells \"executive protection dogs,\" as she refers to them. The pricey breed is called the European German Shepherd, and they are bred and certified in Germany to optimize guarding skills. In fact, it's the breed commonly used in law enforcement. After about two years of daily training in Germany, Harrison K-9 imports the elite guard dogs to the U.S. The company hand-selects each pooch for obedience, the ability to track scents, response to on-command attack cues and more. The animals than receive six to 12 more months of rigorous training on the ground in Aiken.\n\nHarrison K-9 President November Holley.

It is a communication skill set that can take years to develop, and it's required before a dog can be placed in a client's home.\n\nA Harrison K-9 trainer works with an executive protection dog.

[Julia] placed in the top 50 dogs in the world.\"\n\nHarrison K-9's most expensive dog ever sold, Julia, who's purchase price was $230,000.

Holley says the company is also seeing demand grow outside of the U.S. This year alone, six of her dogs have gone to families in Mexico.\n\nHardy ($47,000) and Happy ($42,000) two Harrison K-9 dogs headed to Guadalajara, Mexico to protect a wealthy family.

For instance, if a video monitoring system cannot surveil every corner of an estate, the protection dogs can fill the gaps. \"A bad guy, he can hide from the video camera and you won't see him, but the dog \u2014 he'll know right away and get him,\" says Holley. \"The dog isn't going to be fooled.\"\n\nA trainer being chased during an exercise with a Harrsion K-9 protection dog.

Over the years she's spent north of $300,000 on six dogs.\n\nKauffman in a private jet with her protection canine Valdemar.

Creepy guys recognized me, and I didn't want anything to happen \u2026instead of an alarm system, I got a portable security system I could take with me.\" Her current bodyguard and best friend is an all-black protection dog named Valdemar. \"Their breeding and temperament is so stable, you can literally put them in any environment,\" even on the private jets she and her fianc\u00e9 use to travel, Kauffman says. \"They are more intuitive than any dog, you just don't have to worry.\"\n\nHarrison K-9 client Kauffman with her security dog.

Michelle Wilson Gall is a prime example. At 16, she fell victim to a car-jacking in Los Angeles; after the scary crime, her dad bought her a protection dog. Gall has since gone on to purchase two security dogs herself from Harrison K-9 and she credits her latest pup, named Scarlet, with saving her life after nearly being assaulted in an elevator.\n\nScarlet in the passenger seat of Gall's all-terrain vehicle.

[The assailant] kept coming toward me, and immediately she grabbed him and just kept shaking.\" Gall says Scarlet is trained to bite and latch on to the assailant's arm and not let go until she gives the command. \"I gave her the 'let go' command when we got to our floor and ran out; the cops later got him,\" Gall tells CNBC.\n\nGall's security canines Scarlet and Nero.
