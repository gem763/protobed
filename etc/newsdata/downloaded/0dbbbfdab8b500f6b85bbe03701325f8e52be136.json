REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nHe will take over early next year from outgoing CFO Paul Richardson at WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising group, which is still trying to recover after a string of profit warnings. Last month it appointed Keith Weed, the marketing head of Unilever, to its board.\n\nRogers had been seen by analysts as the favorite internal candidate to succeed Mike Coupe as chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s in due course.\n\nHe has held several senior posts at the supermarket group over the years, including chief financial officer from 2010 until 2016. He has also worked in China, India, Japan, South Africa, the United States and throughout Europe.\n\nShore Capital analyst Clive Black said Rogers\u2019 move to WPP could be a sign that Coupe is staying put.\n\n\u201cTo our minds, Rogers was the prime internal candidate to replace Mike Coupe... should the incumbent boss wish to hang up his boots. With this announcement, it\u2019s maybe the clearest smoke signal yet that Coupe is going nowhere,\u201d Black said.\n\nCoupe, CEO since 2014, has been under pressure since Britain\u2019s competition regulator in April blocked Sainsbury\u2019s 7.3 billion pound ($8.97 billion) agreed bid for Walmart-owned rival Asda. That pressure has been compounded by a 30% drop in Sainsbury\u2019s share price over the last year.\n\nLast week Coupe reaffirmed his commitment to leading Sainsbury\u2019s, saying a major investor event he hosted was not a beauty contest for his potential replacement.\n\nShares in WPP were up 0.8% by 0916 GMT after news of Rogers\u2019 appointment. Sainsbury\u2019s shares were up 1%.\n\nGROWTH STRATEGY\n\n\u201cHis priority will be to lead a finance function that best fosters investment in creativity, technology and talent in support of WPP\u2019s new strategy for growth,\u201d WPP CEO Mark Read said of Rogers\u2019 appointment.\n\nRogers will be paid an annual salary of 740,000 pounds and will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 225% of salary, a long-term incentive award of 300% of salary plus other benefits. He will also receive compensation for share-based and cash incentives he will forfeit on his exit from Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\n\u201cJoining WPP was an opportunity impossible to resist,\u201d he said.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s said Rogers will leave the business on Oct. 31. It does not plan to replace him as its strategy is to bring the Argos and Sainsbury\u2019s businesses closer together.\n\nIt said Argos\u2019s retail and logistics teams will report into Simon Roberts, the group\u2019s retail and operations director, and Argos\u2019s commercial team will report into Paul Mills-Hicks, its commercial director.\n\nRoberts and Mills-Hicks are also seen as contenders for Coupe\u2019s job, along with finance chief Kevin O\u2019Byrne.", "description": "Advertising group WPP has poached John Rogers, the boss of Sainsbury's Argos business and previously seen as a frontrunner to be the British supermarket group's next CEO, as its new finance chief.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435787608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9021O", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
