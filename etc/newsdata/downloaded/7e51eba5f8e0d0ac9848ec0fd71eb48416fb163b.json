Trump tweeted that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, hinting at a potential response over the attack. Oil prices are back below $60 after gapping higher over 12% today. China data came in weaker than expected, with urban investments slowing to 5.5% YoY (weakest in 12 months), industrial output falling to 4.4% (weakest since 2002) and retail sales felling to 7.5% versus 7.9% expected. This is all despite further stimulus earlier this year, which will no doubt spur further calls for yet more stimulus. is the strongest major, supported by higher prices. JPY is the second strongest major from safe-haven flows, seeing gap to a 2-day low and trade back beneath April\u2019s bearish trendline. GBP is today\u2019s weakest major, although remains near Friday\u2019s highs. Asian Cash Indices % Change Despite the weekend drones\u2019 attack on Saud Arabia\u2019s oil production that has sent the futures to spike close to 10% in today\u2019s Asian session, the overall performance seen so far on Asian stock markets have appeared to be quite muted despite an increase in Middle East\u2019s geopolitical risk. U.S. has put the blame on Iran for the attacks and President Trump tweeted with a \u201clock and loaded\u201d response that hinted a potential retaliation towards Iran. Also, from China for Aug came in below expectation at 4.4% y/y versus consensus of 5.2% y/y. It has continued to decline from Jul data of 4.8% y/y that has led to a 3rd consecutive month of slower growth from the negative effects of the on-going U.S-China trade tension. The worst performer so far as at today\u2019s Asia mid-session is Hong Kong\u2019s where it has dropped by -1.00%. The weaker sentiment seen in the Hang Seng Index versus its Asian peers is likely due to localised factors. Firstly, the negative spill-over effect from another bout of violent weekend clashes between police and anti-government protestors where mass protests have entered the 15th week. Secondly, London Stock Exchange (LSE) has rejected Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) US$39 billion takeover bid. Despite HKSE\u2019s refusal to give up on its bid for LSE, shares of HKSE has dropped by -2.7% to hit a 4-week low of 234.40 as seen today. S&P 500 E-mini has gapped down in today\u2019s Asian open session and traded lower to print a current intraday low of 2983; a drop of -0.86%. Right now, as at today\u2019s Asian mid-session, it has recouped some of its earlier losses to trade at 2990; a current intraday drop of -0.61%. Up Next: Data is light for the US session (and non-existent for the European). And with trade tensions taking a back seat, it\u2019s any update or knock-on effect from the weekends oil plant attack which could be a key driver for markets.
