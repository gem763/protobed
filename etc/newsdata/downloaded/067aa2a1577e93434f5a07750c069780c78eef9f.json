The steps it has taken so far are quickly reversible and don\u2019t substantially change its ability to produce a nuclear weapon in the near term.\n\nBut the brinkmanship has added to already high tensions between Iran and the U.S. in recent months after a series of incidents, including attacks on commercial ships, in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn early July\u2014when Iran first began to breach other limits imposed by the deal\u2014Iran said it would give European countries two months to do more to offset the impact of the sanctions the U.S. reimposed after pulling out of the multinational accord last year.\n\nHolding to that deadline, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on Thursday sent a letter to the European Union\u2019s foreign-policy chief, Federica Mogherini, outlining Tehran\u2019s latest step away from the nuclear deal, according to his ministry.\n\nTwo Paths to a Nuclear Bomb Iran has historically pursued work on both uranium- and plutonium-weapons programs, Western officials say. The 2015 nuclear deal set temporary limits on a wide range of Iran's nuclear work and committed Tehran to never work on nuclear weapons. Here's how these bombs are built and how far down those paths Iran has previously gone. Creating weapons-grade nuclear fuel Uranium Plutonium Low-grade uranium ore is mined and chemically treated to produce a concentrated yellowcake. After a conversion process, it is fed into centrifuges. Heavy-water reactors produce plutonium as a waste product. Iran never finished its Arak heavy-water reactor so it never produced plutonium. Under the 2015 deal, it agreed to remove the Arak reactor core and build one that would produce less plutonium. 1 1 Deuterium oxide Uranium hexaflouride Uranium ore Yellowcake Natural uranium Centrifuges are set up in cascades to enrich the uranium. The sophisticated process can take years to establish. Iran produced around 20,000 basic centrifuges\u2014IR-1s and IR-2ms\u2014but is doing research on more advanced machines. 2 Plutonium waste Pressurized heavy-water reactor Control rods Centrifuges Pressurizer Steam generator 6.9 ft 5.2 Steel pressure vessel IR-1 IR-2M Water Fuel Enriching uranium to 5% is the most time-consuming part of producing weapons-grade material. Iran on Monday exceeded its permitted 300-kg stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. 3 To create pure plutonium, the plutonium waste is chemically separated and extracted from radioactive spent-fuel assemblies at a reprocessing plant. 2 5% enriched uranium It takes roughly 200 kg to 250 kg of 20% enriched uranium to produce the 25 kg of 90% enriched uranium, the amount needed for a bomb. Iran has reached 20% purity in the past but has never enriched above that level. The enriched uranium is converted to uranium metal for weapon use. 4 Reprocessing plant Pure plutonium The pure plutonium is melted into a liquid form that is poured into a mold designed for use in a nuclear weapon. 3 20% 90% Pure plutonium Plutonium liquid Weapon mold 25kg 200-250 kg Weaponizing nuclear fuel Deploying the nuclear fuel in a weapon presents technical challenges, many of which Iran isn\u2019t believed to have mastered. Detonating the weapon requires a fission reaction. The nuclear payload must be attached to a missile, and the payload must be able to withstand reentry through through earth's atmosphere as it descends to its target.

He said Iran\u2019s move was in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the Europeans\u2019 subsequent inability to cushion Iran from the effect of renewed U.S. sanctions.\n\nIran said it would inform the United Nations\u2019 atomic agency on the details of its decision on Friday. Iran is expected to start expanding its research activities on Saturday, Iranian officials have indicated.\n\nIran has already pushed through the deal\u2019s 300-kilogram limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium. It is also producing uranium of a purity above 3.67%, the cap imposed by the accord. Uranium enriched to around 90% purity can be used to fuel an atomic bomb.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ms. Mogherini\u2019s office. The EU chairs the dispute-settlement body that helps oversee the accord.\n\nThe U.K., which along with France, Germany, Russia, China and the U.S. negotiated the 2015 agreement with Iran, said it was deeply concerned. \u201cThis third step away from its commitments under the nuclear deal is particularly disappointing at a time when we and our European and international partners are working hard to de-escalate tensions with Iran,\u201d the foreign office said in a statement.\n\nThe focus is now likely to shift to this month\u2019s U.N. General Assembly meeting, where President Trump has said he might meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nA meeting between the two leaders\u2014which would be the first if its kind since Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution\u2014could open the doors for talks between the two countries and lessen fears of a military conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIranian leaders have demanded relief from U.S. sanctions before any such meeting, while the Trump administration has said it would consider lifting sanctions only after a new agreement is in place. Washington wants to tighten nuclear restraints on Tehran and get it to back off from what the U.S. sees as Iran\u2019s aggression against regional foes.\n\nWith Iran\u2019s economy locked in a deep recession because of the sanctions, U.S. officials say they believe Iran could come back to the negotiating table in the coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say it could take Iran years to develop and mass-produce more advanced centrifuges, despite its now having said it would escalate work to that end. Iran has struggled in the past to mass-produce top-notch versions even of first-generation centrifuges of a type developed by Western countries decades ago.\n\nOnce Iran does produce advanced centrifuges, it could enrich uranium at far faster levels than it can with the centrifuges it currently uses. That would gut a central intent of the nuclear accord: ensuring Iran would need at least a year to amass enough nuclear fuel for one atomic weapon. Deploying IR-6 machines in sufficient numbers to enrich uranium could mean Iran could reach that so-called breakout capability in a couple of months.\n\nEuropean officials have repeatedly urged Iran to get back in line with the nuclear agreement. But they have so far avoided steps that could trigger the accord\u2019s collapse, such as launching a time-limited dispute-resolution mechanism that could lead to a vote on the U.N. Security Council reimposing international sanctions on Iran. They have also repeatedly urged Washington to return to the nuclear deal and lift its sanctions.\n\nFrench officials said this week they are continuing to work on their proposal aimed at winning Tehran some sanctions relief in exchange for Iranian steps to curtail their nuclear activities and lower tensions in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nUnder the nuclear deal, Iran has been allowed to continue some research work on more advanced centrifuges, including machines as advanced as IR-6s and IR-8s, but such work is heavily constrained. Iran is only authorized to feed a handful of machines with uranium to test how they work. The deal starts to lift constraints on Iran\u2019s research work in 2024.\n\nThe country is also banned under the deal from carrying out other types of research, for example on uranium and plutonium, materials that can be used in nuclear weapons. It isn\u2019t clear whether Iran also intends to ignore these non-centrifuge constraints.\n\nWrite to Isabel Coles at isabel.coles@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "description": "Iran said it would abandon constraints on nuclear research set out in the 2015 nuclear deal, in another violation of the accord that raises the risk of its collapse as Europe pursues efforts to salvage it with sanctions relief for Tehran.", "authors": ["Isabel Coles In Beirut", "Laurence Norman In Brussels", "Isabel Coles", "Laurence Norman", "Isabel.Coles Wsj.Com", "Laurence.Norman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104493/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
