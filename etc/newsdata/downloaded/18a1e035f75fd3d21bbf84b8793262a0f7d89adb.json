I know they will welcome this commitment by Mauricio.\u201d\n\nSpurs do not feel the need to give Pochettino any vote of confidence or public backing, as they view the current situation far off reaching any sort of crisis point or need for intervention.\n\nLevy is confident Tottenham can still qualify from Group B of the Champions League and that Pochettinco\u2019s side remain more than capable of once again finishing inside the top four of the Premier League.\n\nPochettino is determined to get Tottenham\u2019s season back on track as quickly as possible, following the Bayern embarrassment and the Carabao Cup defeat to Colchester United.\n\nThe Argentine was pleased with how his team performed in the first half on Tuesday night and sees the forthcoming run of games as a chance to put things right.\n\nHaving beaten Southampton with 10 men last weekend, Spurs travel to Brighton before entertaining Watford after the international break, with the target very much to make it three League wins from three.\n\nThey then entertain Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League and a victory would most likely see them move back into second place in Group B, behind Bayern.\n\nPochettino was on Wednesday expected to make his players watch the horror show that was the final seven minutes against Bayern, when the team collapsed and conceded three goals.\n\nFingers have been pointed at the Tottenham players whose contracts are running down or wanted to leave last summer, but Toby Alderweireld, who is in the final 12 months of his deal, dismissed questions over the squad\u2019s commitment.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing to do with this,\u201d said Alderweireld. \u201cNothing, nothing. I think sometimes it's a shame that nobody can see the work ethic everybody brings to this club. Everybody's hungry and wants to work hard.\n\n\u201cWe know the results are not the best. We're not against the press and, of course, things will be critical. After tonight things will be critical and that's part of top sports, you know, the sport of football. Sometimes you're up there and sometimes you're in the corner where you get slapped. But you have to fight a way out of the corner. And that's the moment we\u2019re in now.\u201d\n\nInspired by former Arsenal man Serge Gnabry Bayern ran riot at Tottenham Credit: Getty Images\n\nSubstitute Erik Lamela and Serge Aurier appeared to exchange words as Spurs fell apart against Bayern, but Alderweirled has called on his team-mates to stick together as they attempt to put things right.\n\n\u201cOf course, it wasn't our best performance,\u201d said Alderwerield. \u201cDon't get me wrong. But we have to stick together now in this, it's not someone to blame. Everybody makes mistakes, but we have to pick ourselves up and try to be to come out as a team.\n\n\u201cWe will talk and then we will prepare ourselves the best way possible for Saturday (against Brighton) because that\u2019s the next game and the best way to get us out of the situation is to win the next game and then try to improve and it's not easy.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to lie, this is a big loss, we feel the pain, everyone in the dressing room was just quiet. Everyone feels the pain, so it's not easy, but we have to work hard. And there are highs and lows, and now we are we're down there you know. The only way up is to work.\n\n\u201cYou can sit there and keep saying we are unlucky, but no, it's all our responsibility and we work hard. But I think that's not a problem to work hard. Everybody is doing the best they can to perform the best way possible. We just focus on the things we have to do and try to get out of this corner.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s job is not under threat as he plots how to\u00a0 revive his humiliated Tottenham Hotspur players after their Champions\u00a0 League thrashing at the hands of Bayern Munich.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9SS7WNW_lQgvvv4awyyZwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NMY1E4hqi.pbtmxORD5qOg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/71985aeea026cd5aebc127832e062e01"}
