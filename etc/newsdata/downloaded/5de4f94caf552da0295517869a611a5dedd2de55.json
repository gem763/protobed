Obeticholic acid, or OCA, is already approved in primary biliary cholangitis, a rare liver disease, which provides the company with steady revenue but is limited to a small patient population. Intercept\u2019s valuation depends heavily on OCA\u2019s potential in NASH.\n\nNASH is a common but serious liver disorder linked to obesity and diabetes, with limited treatment options. Liver fat buildup leads to fibrosis, the thickening and scarring of liver tissue, which could progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, heart disease, and death. OCA has shown impressive efficacy in improving fibrosis in phase 3 trials, but its side effect profile, which includes severe itching and increased bad cholesterol, leaves room for competition down the road. However, given its advanced stage in the pipeline, Intercept has a high likelihood of being first to the lucrative NASH market in 2020.", "description": "But the pipeline of competing drugs is full, so we don\u2019t see a moat for the biotech.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltf5c9f6de4daaa773/5cb4f480fe8386be234ac8fb/QuarterEndReview_Sectors_Bars_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
