CNN stood by its reporting, which a CIA spokeswoman labeled as \u201cmisguided speculation\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reporting is materially inaccurate,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mr. Trump\u2019s first CIA chief, told reporters at a White House briefing. \u201cAnd you should know, as the former CIA director, I don\u2019t talk about things like this very often.\u201d\n\nBut many intelligence insiders were more upset about the airing of the report in the first place, and the impact it may have on future undercover operations. Some said the motivation of the leakers appeared to be first and foremost to damage Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIf the story is true, the sources who leaked it, whoever they are, should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief. \u201cSomething like this is out of bounds because it blows a story into the open that is not verified, fueled by speculation, and could ultimately and dangerously expose classified U.S. intelligence gathering methods and sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cJournalists wouldn\u2019t have this story if someone wasn\u2019t leaking it,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are leakers who are giving out classified information that is not in the realm of what people should be talking about, because it puts people [who are] behind enemy lines, who are sources to American intelligence, into a place where they\u2019re saying, \u2018What the heck am I doing working for with Washington? Am I going to be found out and have my own information put through a political meat grinder like this?\u2019\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Blow to intel: U.S. removed longtime CIA informant from Russia in 2017\n\nStephen Slick, a former CIA Clandestine Service officer who heads the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Times that \u201cno one with knowledge of these events should be discussing them and no one without knowledge should be speculating about them.\u201d\n\nDavid Maxwell, a retired U.S. Special Forces officer with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington, argued that any current or former officials leaking about intelligence operations are \u201cnot only breaking the law, but are truly unpatriotic.\u201d\n\nCIA denial\n\nIn a rare public denial, the CIA Tuesday disputed key parts of the CNN account.\n\n\u201cMisguided speculation that the President\u2019s handling of our nation\u2019s most sensitive intelligence \u2014 which he has access to each and every day \u2014 drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate,\u201d said CIA Director of Public Affairs Brittany Bramell.\n\n\u201cCNN\u2019s narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the criticism, Mr. Maxwell also suggested the controversy could have \u201csome positive benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this report is any way true, the U.S. intelligence community made a decision to protect an asset in a very extreme way. We did not leave this important asset out in the cold,\u201d he told The Times in an interview. \u201cIt demonstrates our commitment to American values and that it you serve the U.S., you will be protected. \u2026This also sends a powerful message to those who are being recruited to spy for the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut while there may be \u201cpositive benefits,\u201d Mr. Maxwell added, \u201cit still pains me that American officials or former American officials would put partisan politics above U.S. national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir efforts to bring political harm to the president may cause greater harm to our national security. And, given the current state of politics, they will likely not achieve the effects they desire as [President Trump] sure appears to be like a \u2018Teflon man\u2019 concerning any kind of scandal \u2014 nothing sticks to him.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s report on the alleged CIA extraction claimed the agency had received intelligence on the Kremlin for more than a decade from the informant in Russia, including \u201cimages of documents\u201d on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s desk.\n\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday that the informant became one of the CIA\u2019s most important \u2014 and highly protected \u2014 assets as American officials began to realize that Russia was trying to sabotage the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Russian agent was brought out of Russia sometime after a fateful May 2017 meeting Mr. Trump held with Russia\u2019s foreign minister ambassador, in which critics the president inadvertently disclosed classified information on U.S. intelligence findings.\n\nRussian officials were dismissive of the CNN account, while Russian news outlets and government officials published the name of the onetime Putin government official said to now be living in the U.S.\n\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the government-run TASS news service that \u201cno one shared any state or even non-state secrets with anyone during\u201d the May 2017 Oval Office meeting.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday that \u201cspeculations in U.S. media outlets\u201d was amounting to \u201ca kind of pulp fiction.\u201d He confirmed to reporters that the suspected U.S. informant had once worked in the Putin government, but said he was fired in the 2016 to 2017 time frame \u201cthrough an internal instruction.\u201d\n\nMr. Lavrov claimed he knew nothing of the suspected spy.\n\n\u201cI have never seen him, I have never met him, and I have neither kept track of his career nor his movements,\u201d the Russian foreign minister said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
