In at least three instances the video shows the suspect pointing a gun directly at a victim only for the weapon to jam.\n\nCalling himself a \u201closer\u201d, at one point he says: \u201cI have certainly managed to prove how absurd improvised weapons are.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s chief federal prosecutor Peter Frank said on Thursday that the suspect wanted to carry out a \u201cmassacre\u201d and had about four kilograms of explosives in his car.\n\nA mission statement that the suspect uploaded to Kohlchan \u2013 the German message board equivalent of 4chan \u2013 where it was later found by researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Extremism at King\u2019s College, London, appears to confirm the use of homemade firearms built according to plans released by a British pro-gun activist from West Yorkshire.\n\nPhilip Luty, who believed British gun control laws were \u201cfascist\u201d, devoted his life to publicising blueprints for making firearms from easy-to-obtain materials, with the goal of allowing private citizens around the world to flout gun restrictions by building weapons at home.\n\nWhen he died of cancer in 2011, Luty, 46, was facing three terrorism charges for manuals he had published explaining how to build firearms, including a 9mm submachine gun, according to the Yorkshire Evening Post.\n\nThe Halle suspect, named by media as 27-year-old German citizen Stephan Balliet, appears to have used one of these home-made Luty submachine guns, as well as other homemade guns and hand grenades, according to the Kohlchan documents.\n\nA screenshot of a video shows the gunman firing a weapon. Photograph: Andreas Splett/EPA\n\nThe documents suggest he used homemade guns intentionally, with the goal of \u201cshowing the viability of improvised guns\u201d for people who want to carry out terror attacks but who do not have access to commercially made weapons.\n\nThe footage of the shooting suggests the homemade guns malfunctioned, which may have helped prevent more murders. After attacks on both a synagogue and a kebab shop, according to the livestreamed footage, the gunman said: \u201cSorry, guys, the fucking Luty is shit!\u201d\n\nBoth the documents and the livestreamed footage suggest the gunman was a white nationalist, and that he hoped his attack would inspire other white people to kill more Jewish people, as well as other people he perceived as enemies of the white race, including Muslim people, black people, anti-fascists, and communists.\n\nThe mission statement also shows that he deliberately chose to carry out his rampage on Yom Kippur but was wary of the synagogue being heavily secured, and considered attacking a mosque or an \u201cantifa culture centre\u201d.\n\nGermany has strict gun laws and rigorous procedures for buying weapons, but it also has very high rates of private gun ownership.\n\nWhile German authorities have not yet confirmed the types of weapons used in the attack, some arms experts online said it was clear from images of the weapons used in the attack that at least one of the guns was built from a distinctive Luty submachine blueprint.\n\nLuty, described as a \u201cloner\u201d who lived with his parents, was sentenced to four years in prison in 1998 for building a prohibited weapon, a submachine gun, and for illegal possession of ammunition, the Sunday Telegraph reported.\n\nBut he continued what he called his \u201cno compromise stance on gun rights issues\u201d, and went on to publish multiple books with an American publisher describing how to make homemade guns.\n\nIn 2009, armed anti-terrorism officers raided his home, and he faced new terrorism charges related to \u201cmaking a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism\u201d, the Yorkshire Evening Post reported.\n\nThe Metropolitan police and police in West Yorkshire both declined to comment on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn Germany, the head of the Central Council of Jews criticised police services on Thursday for having been slow to come to the rescue of the besieged worshippers inside the Halle synagogue.\n\n\u201cIt is scandalous that the synagogue in Halle was not protected by police on a holy day like Yom Kippur,\u201d said Josef Schuster.\n\nThe Twitch video, reviewed by the Guardian, suggests that the attacker was on the street outside the synagogue for more than five minutes, during which time he shot and killed a passerby, without being approached by law enforcement.\n\nAfter a visit to the synagogue on Thursday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Germans needed to united against extremism.\n\n\u201cToday is a day of shame and disgrace,\u201d Steinmeier said. \u201cI\u2019m very sure the overwhelming majority of this society in Germany wants Jewish life to be part of this country ... We must stand together long-term against violence like we experienced here yesterday. We must protect Jewish life.\u201d", "description": "Jammed%20homemade%20guns%20appeared%20to%20stop%20Halle%20attacker%20killing%20more%20%7C%20Germany%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann", "Lois Beckett"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
