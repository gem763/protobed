(Metalectrique)\n\nAccording to Jackson, the breakthrough came with developing a new kind of electrolyte that works with much lower-purity metal \u2013 including recycled drinks cans. The formula, which is top secret, is the key to his device.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnically, it should be described as a fuel cell, not a battery. Either way, it is so light and powerful that it could now be set to revolutionise low-carbon transport, because it supplies so much energy.\n\nThe power to travel up to 1,500 miles on a single charge would make it four times more effective than the most expensive model currently on the road.\n\nA look at how the new battery could change motoring (Graphic: Mail on Sunday)\n\nHe says it has taken so long do develop the battery because he faced obstruction from the established motor industry.\n\n\u2018It has been a tough battle but I\u2019m finally making progress. From every logical standpoint, this is the way to go,\u2019 he said.", "description": "The new kind of electric battery could revolutionise electric transportation", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90986775_1571666424.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
