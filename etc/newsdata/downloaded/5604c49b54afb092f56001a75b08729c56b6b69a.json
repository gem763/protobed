The pontiff has spoken about a desire in his youth to serve as a missionary in Asia, but he never got the opportunity with the Jesuits.\n\nHis visit will highlight two countries in Asia where miniscule Catholic populations live in peace with non-Christian majorities. The Catholic Church makes up less than 1 percent of the population in both Japan and Thailand \u2013 each country has about the same number of non-Christians \u2013 yet the Church is known for its outsized influence in areas of social welfare and education both in the G7 member Japan and still developing Thailand.\n\nThailand is majority Buddhist, and the Christian population is concentrated in the poorer rural areas, especially among the country\u2019s ethnic minorities. The religious background of the Japanese is eclectic \u2013 most would identify with the indigenous Shinto religion, although a third of the country says they are Buddhist, which has also left its imprint on Shinto beliefs.\n\nFrancis will want to hold these two countries up as models for their neighbors, where the \u201cunholy trinity\u201d of the Aid to the Church in Need report says that the religious majority often sees the continent\u2019s Christian population as a threat to their power.\n\nAnti-Christian persecution has long been a problem in authoritarian communist countries in the region: North Korea is considered to be the worst place on Earth to be a Christian, and the communist parties in China and Vietnam try to keep their local churches under the thumbs of apparatchiks.\n\nHowever, anti-Christian persecution is moving beyond the Cold War hot spots to new frontiers.\n\nIslamism, once most prominent in the Middle East and North Africa, is growing in Asia. Even the Philippines \u2013 one of only two majority-Catholic countries in the region, the other being East Timor \u2013 has seen an upsurge in violence after a relative calm following a peace deal with the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front.\n\nThe militant group Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with the Islamic State group, set off two bombs in the Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Jolo in January, killing 20 people and injuring 100 others.\n\nOf course, the most famous prominent Islamist attack was the Easter bombings in Sri Lanka which left over 250 people dead, and 500 others injured. Sri Lanka is a majority Buddhist country with a large Hindu minority, split largely along ethnic lines. That Islamist groups were able to organize such a complicated operation in the country was a testament that they are increasingly able to operate outside of the Muslim-majority countries where they have been most active against Christians, such as Pakistan.\n\nThe rise of nationalism in Asia \u2013 often with a religious component \u2013 is most prominent in India, where the Hindu BJP party just won reelection by an overwhelming majority. Christians and other religious minorities often suffer discrimination and harassment, made worse by the fact that most Christians come from the more marginalized members of Hinduism\u2019s caste system.\n\nMyanmar, which elected its first civilian government in decades in 2015, has seen an upsurge of Burmese nationalism, with a strong backing by the country\u2019s Buddhist establishment. Although the Muslim Rohingya community has suffered the most, the government is still warring with militias from ethnic minorities that are predominantly Christian.\n\nThis is where Francis\u2019s trip itinerary could prove to be a masterstroke.\n\nThailand has seen an upsurge of nationalism in recent years, but it hasn\u2019t really targeted religious minorities.\n\nJapan is a country which saw horrible anti-Catholic persecution in the 17th century, which was featured in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2016 film \u201cSilence,\u201d based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Japanese author Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d.\n\nIt has over the past decade or so seen the rise of populist politicians, and although Japanese conservatism is often intertwined with Shintoism, it has not targeted the country\u2019s Catholic minority.\n\nIn fact, the conservative deputy prime minister of Japan, Tar\u014d As\u014d, is a Catholic. As\u014d even served as prime minister himself for a year a decade ago.\n\nProof that the \u201cunholy trinity\u201d attacking Christians \u2013 with a little luck \u2013 can be defeated.\n\nFollow Charles Collins on Twitter: @CharlesinRome\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
