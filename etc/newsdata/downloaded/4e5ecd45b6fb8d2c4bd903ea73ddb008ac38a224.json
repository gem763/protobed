He used to be a waiter at Beefcakes in Illovo. In addition to that he has screen experience too he has appeared in over 23 international commercials.\n\n2. A BIG HIT WITH THE DATERS\n\nWe had to ask the staff if they got hit on by any of the daters. Travis shared that Batsile was a big hit.\n\n\"They wanted to use him as a backdrop just in case their dates didn't go well.\"\n\n3. A DRINKS CHALLENGE\n\nTravis, who currently holds the title of South Africa's 'Bartender of the Year.' With over 20 years of experience, he set himself a challenge to know how to make as many drinks as possible. He learned how to make over 100 drinks.\n\n\"I didn't want anyone to order something that I couldn't make,\" says Travis.\n\n4. A PROPOSAL?\n\nWithout giving too much away, the cast says there will also be a 'proposal' of sorts in one of the episodes.\n\n\"For anyone and everyone who is going to be watching First Dates are going to see some colourful people, some bubbly personalities. It is definitely going to be something to look out for, and I am looking forward to catching it too, says Batsile.\n\n5. A CHANCE AT LOVE\n\nWhen asked if it is possible to find love on the show like this the cast give a resounding yes.\n\nAsh shares: \"This is a face to face date, which I think is so important when you're wanting to put yourself out there, as opposed to being on all the online dating sites. If you're genuine, and you want to find love, I think you can because you're getting to meet someone in person, and not who they have created themselves to be.\"\n\nAsh, who is currently single, was so inspired by the show that she even went on a date recently\u2026\n\n(Photos supplied: BBC)", "description": "The cast of 'First Dates SA' give us some juicy details about the new reality dating show.", "authors": ["Leandra Engelbrecht"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9479/06b8411e073a4cf097a207bdfe67e7e8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
