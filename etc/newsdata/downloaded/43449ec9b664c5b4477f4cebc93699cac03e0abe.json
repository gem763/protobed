Trainer battles were only added late last year, but the game is slowly gaining more and more features and it looks like next year is going to be particularly big.\n\nDespite what you might imagine, Pok\u00e9mon Go is currently more popular than at any time since it was first released and that\u2019s unlikely to change once online battles are an option.\n\nTo that end, developer Niantic has announced Go Battle League, which seems to be exactly what it sounds like. Except the catch is that you will still have to outside and walk if you want to get a match.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen do Pok\u00e9mon Go online battles start?\n\nThe blog announcing Go Battle League is very short, and purposefully vague, but it implies that you\u2019ll have to use Pok\u00e9mon Go outside a set amount in order to earn entry to the league.\n\nAfter that you\u2019ll be able to \u2018battle opponents from around the globe through an online matching system and rise in the ranks of the league\u2019.\n\nWhat Niantic are trying to avoid is a situation where players just sit at home battling online, although it remains to be seen exactly how much prior exercise is going to be demanded of you.\n\nThe only start date for Go Battle League is \u2018early\u2019 2020, but a new Dev Insights video is promised soon that will go into more detail and hopefully nail down a date.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Go Halloween event has costumed Pikachu, Squirtle, and more\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon Go first global ticketed event costs \u00a38 to catch Regigigas\n\nMORE: Pok\u00e9mon GO is getting its first batch of Gen 5 pok\u00e9mon", "description": "Ranked matchmaking will arrive in Pok\u00e9mon Go early next year, allowing for online battle for the first time, but there is a catch\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gobattleleague-announcement-fbd9_1571758893.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
