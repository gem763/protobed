For years murders were solved, cases were closed but now, and only now, we\u2019ve realised the story we were told had more than one side.\n\nSally Challen was one a \u2018scorned wife who killed her husband with a hammer\u2019 because he didn\u2019t want to be with her anymore. Now she\u2019s the victim of coercive control.\n\nSky Crime launched this week and among the first of its major new investigations is HBO\u2019s I Love You, Now Die, following the infamous 2014 suicide of 18-year-old Conrad Roy, who was encouraged to end his life by girlfriend Michelle Carter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarter was a public monster. \u2018Drink bleach\u2019 and \u2018Hang yourself jump off a building stab yourself idk theres (Sic.) lots of ways,\u2019 are just two of many messages from Carter found on Roy\u2019s phone. How could she not be to blame for his death?\n\nI Love You, Now Die confronts the hazy guilt. Where does the fault lie?\n\nIn episode one, Roy\u2019s family recall his final days, his relationship with Carter and her involvement after he was found suffocated in the driver\u2019s seat of his car. Initially, it appears there\u2019s little to speculate \u2013 Carter lied about her knowledge of Roy\u2019s plans, his whereabouts and set up a fundraiser in her hometown \u2013 not his \u2013 because on the surface she was enjoying the attention. \u2018I\u2019m like famous now haha,\u2019 she wrote to one friend.\n\nDuring the 2017 trial, the media painted a similar picture.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEpisode two, however, reveals Carter and Roy\u2019s relationship was more disturbing than we knew, and the toxic texts were mutual.\n\nThroughout their 18-month relationship, Roy sent images of nooses and guns with captions such as \u2018f**k you b***h.\u2019 She urged him to seek help, pleaded with Roy to find another solution until she flipped and suddenly began to encourage him a few months before it was all over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI Love You, Now Die examines Carter\u2019s relatively unreported use of drugs prescribed by her doctors to combat mental health, and the dangerous game of online dating \u2013 painting a picture of a person who doesn\u2019t really exist.\n\nConsultant Forensic Psychologist Kerry Daynes spoke to press including Metro.co.uk at the launch of Sky Cime to explain the vitality of exploring these complex narratives, which have otherwise suffered from one-dimensional reporting.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s\u2019 what our audience wants,\u2019 said Daynes. \u2018Gone are the days when true crime was the Pot Noodle of television, something you\u2019d watch at 2am in the morning and it was bad guy doing something terrible to the ideal victim.\n\nMichelle Carter was sentenced for the death of Conrad Roy (Picture: AP)\n\n\u2018I think it perpetuates stereotypes which are harmful in the real world. We live in a world where juries are reluctant to convict ordinary-looking men of rape and don\u2019t believe victims when they come forward. Victims of sexual assault don\u2019t want to come forward in fear of not being believed.\u2019\n\nArguably the true crime phenomenon was born in Serial, which was later followed by the documentary The Case of Adnan Syed. Syed has been incarcerated since February 2000 and is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of Hae Min Lee, his girlfriend.\n\nSince then, the armchair detective in all of us is determined to join the case as if we have even the slightest clue of what we\u2019re on about. But through similar true crime series, thousands of witnesses who have never spoken out before have come forward, while social media has meant new evidence is falling into the right hands like never before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When we tell these stories which force us to think more seriously \u2013 real people involved,\u2019 Daynes continued. \u2018They\u2019re thinking about the people involved in those offenses and asking what does that say about us in society and it\u2019s what people want \u2013 more complex, challenging stories.\u2019\n\nI Love You, Now Die is certainly a complex, challenging story. And one you thought you knew if it wasn\u2019t for the true crime documentary.\n\nI Love You, Now Die premieres this Sunday on Sky Crime and will be available on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
