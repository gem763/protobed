However management have stated that they plan to continue reinvesting cash flow and profits into the business over the next few years to drive revenue growth,\" Mr Piper said.\n\n\"We agree with this strategy given the fragmented and underpenetrated nature of the online furniture and homewares market \u2013 4 to 5 per cent versus 15 per cent in the UK and US.\"", "description": "Temple & Webster has been immune from the housing  downturn, with sales soaring 45 per cent in the year to date.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5734%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1151%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/37161ac84ccb5935108634857e8ff1256b80beb7", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
