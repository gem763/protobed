They passed the win mark of the 1953 \u201cBoys of Summer\u201d team based in Brooklyn that included Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider and other Hall of Famers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a moment to appreciate what we did as an organization. We\u2019re talking about the regular season and all those great teams in Dodgers history,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt takes a lot to accomplish what we accomplished as a group, as an organization, and there\u2019s a lot to be said for that. So very proud of everyone top to bottom. It\u2019s something that no one can take away from us and it speaks to the character, the work ethic, the talent, just the togetherness of everyone, so very proud.\u201d\n\nChants of \u201cBochy! Bochy!\u201d greeted him during introductions and son and former Giants pitcher Brett threw out the ceremonial first pitch to his ex-catcher father. Bochy held his grandson in the dugout before the game, too. Fans stood and cheered \u201cBochy!\u201d again once the final out was made and a postgame ceremony ensued.\n\nThe 64-year-old Bochy, who guided the Giants to World Series championships in 2010, \u201812 and \u201814, waved and tipped his cap from the dugout before the game before doing some stretches against the back of the railing taking it all in as he promised to do from the start of the final week.\n\nBochy finishes 2003-2029 in 4,032 games as a manager over 25 seasons, the first 12 with San Diego before 13 in San Francisco. He went 1,052-1,054 with the Giants, who wound up 77-85 in his final year and with four more wins than last season.\n\nLefty Rich Hill worked three scoreless innings allowing one hit in his 13th start of the season for the Dodgers. Dustin May (2-3) pitched a perfect fourth for the win.\n\nA smiling Tim Lincecum was among the former players on hand for Bochy\u2019s farewell festivities. Lincecum, a two-time NL Cy Young Award winner with a pair of no-hitters, didn\u2019t want to immediately reflect on Bochy.\n\nThe Giants attempted to make the loudest foghorn call the Bay Area has experienced by having fans turn their phones into a foghorn through the ballpark app or on the team\u2019s website.\n\nKERSHAW TUNEUP\n\nClayton Kershaw pitched the bottom of the fifth in a playoff tuneup, getting one strikeout in a 1-2-3 inning. He pitched in relief for the first time since Sept. 22, 2009.\n\nKershaw tipped his cap to Bochy, and the manager did so back.\n\nManager Dave Roberts said the Dodgers are still discussing their Division Series rotation.\n\nBUMGARNER\u2019S FAREWELL?\n\nBochy promised MadBum would have his spikes on.\n\nMadison Bumgarner, who didn\u2019t pitch Sunday as had been originally planned, drew a rousing standing ovation before lining out as a pinch-hitter with two outs in the fifth against Kershaw.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s big lefty tipped and waved his batting helmet in every direction to acknowledge the fans in what might have been his final moment in a Giants uniform.\n\nThe 2014 World Series MVP can become a free agent, so Tuesday might have been his final start for the Giants. He is wrapping up a contract singed in April 2012 that included a $12 million contract option this year, and the Giants opted not to deal him at the trade deadline.\n\nRight-hander Dereck Rodriguez (6-11) started in Bumgarner\u2019s slot.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nSan Francisco drew 2,707,760 fans in 2019, lowest home attendance in the ballpark\u2019s 20-year history. It\u2019s also the Giants\u2019 first time not reaching 3 million in attendance at home since 2008 and \u201809 and down from their 3,156,185 last year.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDodgers: RHP Joe Kelly, who hadn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 18 because of what the Dodgers called an overall body issue, recorded two outs in the sixth. \u2026 LF A.J. Pollock returned to the lineup after sitting out Saturday with a left knee bruise he injured when hit by a pitch during Friday\u2019s 9-2 win. \u2026 3B Justin Turner missed his fifth straight game with back tightness but will get simulated work done during Tuesday\u2019s workout day back home ahead of the Division Series.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeven-time reigning NL West champion Los Angeles will hold a workout day Tuesday before opening the Division Series at Dodger Stadium against the wild card winner.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bruce Bochy bid an emotional farewell following 2 1/2 decades in what is certainly Hall of Fame managerial career, finishing with a 9-0 defeat to the mighty Dodgers on his last day Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/dodgers_giants_baseball_04137_c0-157-3759-2348_s1770x1032.jpg?72264591c3195a8c5dea572178ff17f8010814b5", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
