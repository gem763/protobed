(AP) - An appeals court has upheld the capital murder conviction and death sentence of a New Orleans man condemned to die for a contract killing in west Alabama.\n\nThe Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals turned away a challenge by death row inmate Sherman Collins on Friday.\n\nThe 43-year-old Collins was convicted in the shooting death of Detrick Bell in Sumter County in 2012. Evidence showed he was hired to kill Bell, who was shot to death at a small-town rap concert.\n\nCollins claimed the judge who sentenced him to die didn\u2019t give enough consideration to his rough childhood and lack of a father figure.\n\nThe court turned away that challenge. It also ruled that the death penalty for Collins wasn\u2019t out of line with the sentence in similar cases.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An appeals court has upheld the capital murder conviction and death sentence of a New Orleans man condemned to die for a contract killing in west Alabama.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
