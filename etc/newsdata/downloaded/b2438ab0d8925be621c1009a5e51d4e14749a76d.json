Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBen: The Fed announced that it would cut interest rates by a quarter point today. What is it hoping to accomplish with this adjustment, and why did stocks fall after the news was announced?\n\nJosh: Stocks fell after the announcement but they rebounded through and after Fed chair Jay Powell\u2019s press conference, ending up actually a little higher than they\u2019d been before.\n\nI think stocks fell because the announcement was more hawkish than market participants had expected. Ten of the 17 participants on the Federal Open Market Committee indicated they did not think an additional rate cut would be appropriate this year. The expectation had generally been that we\u2019ll get one more rate cut, in December, so that divide on the committee was a surprise and you saw bond yields rise, as investors adjusted to the significant possibility this was the last rate cut of the year. Less expected easing of interest rates tends to be negative for stocks.\n\nBut then the market rebounded, I think in part because Fed chair Jay Powell sounded marginally more dovish at the press conference than in the statement. He was not very dovish though: He stubbornly refused to tip his hand about whether the Fed would cut rates a third time later this year, emphasizing that the Fed will make an appropriate decision based on the economic and financial information that\u2019s available at the time.\n\nI think partly he\u2019s keeping his options open because the economic outlook could change, in either direction. Maybe growth worries will ease and inflation signals will pick up in the next three months, and he\u2019ll have an easy case to make about why the Fed isn\u2019t cutting again. Or maybe troubles will increase and a cut will be obviously correct. He\u2019s right that he can\u2019t exactly predict now what will be appropriate in December.\n\nOn the other hand, he may need to keep his options open simply because the committee is divided. He doesn\u2019t just speak for himself, he speaks for the whole organization that has to make decisions together. And today\u2019s decision had dissents in both directions for the first time in six years. One regional Fed bank president wanted to cut rates by a half point instead of a quarter; two others didn\u2019t want to cut rates at all.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to make commitments on behalf of a group where you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll be able to get its members to agree to.\n\nBen: President Trump quickly attacked Powell, tweeting: \u201cJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\u201d Trump wanted the Fed to cut rates to zero or even beyond. His views on this issue have not been as outlier-ish as in other areas; is there a case to be made that he\u2019s right here?\n\nJosh: There are two separate complaints here that I think should be considered separately. On \u201cno guts, no sense, no vision,\u201d Trump basically means the Fed should be cutting rates more. There are people who agree with him on this (including St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, who\u2019s a voting member of the FOMC and dissented from today\u2019s decision and said the cut should have been a half-point).\n\nThe argument for this view is essentially that inflation remains below target and the labor market is not as tight as it looks (the unemployment rate is low but that doesn\u2019t count people out of the labor force who could be drawn back in if the job market were hotter) so the Fed is not meeting its dual mandate of full employment and stable prices, and would better do so by raising prices.\n\nA related argument is that the economy faces risks that are suppressing business investment and a bold move by the Fed \u2014 a big rate cut \u2014 would boost confidence and investment and quite possibly avoid the need to cut rates more later.\n\nHis other complaint is about Powell \u201ca terrible communicator.\u201d He could mean a couple of things here. Investment manager Josh Brown was speculating on CNBC that Trump simply finds Powell to be boring \u2014 that he wishes he were more captivating on television. Maybe Trump thinks his statements would then have more positive effects on the market.\n\nBen: I for one kind of want my Fed chair to be boring.\n\nJosh: But the other problem with Jay Powell\u2019s communication is he\u2019s sometimes been unclear. We especially saw this last December, when Powell spooked markets by sending a signal that the Fed was likely to keep raising interest rates even if the markets continued to weaken. It quickly became clear Powell had not meant to send such a strong signal in that direction and he had to make more statements to clean up his mess. All those comments moved the markets around a lot in a way Powell had not intended.\n\nFed chairs used to do four press conferences a year, but Powell has increased that to eight, one after every FOMC meeting. That gives him more opportunities to accidentally send the wrong signal to the markets through his comments. But it seems like he has gotten more careful. Powell is speaking more repetitively, leaning on talking points like that the Fed will be \u201cdata dependent\u201d \u2014 that is, he can\u2019t tell you now exactly what they\u2019ll do about rates because it depends on what happens in the future. Today\u2019s press conference was quite boring \u2014 as it should be.\n\nBen: In his remarks, Powell cited trade as one area of global instability, in his mild way \u2014 he said that \u201ctrade policy tensions have waxed and waned,\u201d and spoke of \u201celevated uncertainty.\u201d Can this be read at all as a rebuke or warning to Trump, or is he just stating the facts of the matter?\n\nJosh: Powell certainly hopes it is not read as a rebuke about Trump. This is a topic about which he\u2019s been clear and consistent \u2014 the Fed is not responsible for trade policy and it doesn\u2019t say which trade policies are good or bad. But it does take into account how trade policy changes will affect the economy, and those effects on the economy may change the proper course of monetary policy. Specifically, he noted that trade policy disruptions appear to be discouraging business investment and manufacturing output. Those are some of the weakness aspects that have put rate cuts on the menu.\n\nBen: Would you say that today\u2019s decision changes the short-term economic outlook in any substantial way?\n\nJosh: Not a great deal, no. I think today\u2019s statement made clear a third rate cut is somewhat less likely than we thought. But I also think we were never likely to get more than three rate cuts (assuming economic performance remains about where it is). Powell keeps referencing past \u201cmid-cycle adjustments\u201d from 1995-96 and 1998 as models for what the Fed is trying to do with this round of rate cuts. In each of those two prior cases, there was a total of 75 basis points worth of rate cuts, equivalent to three of these 25-basis point cuts.\n\nBen: Lastly, do you think Trump\u2019s harping on how the Fed is blowing this is at all effective, either in terms of changing the agency\u2019s thinking or in terms of letting himself off the hook for economic problems he helped create?\n\nJosh: I don\u2019t think so. As I\u2019ve written a few times, if you look at when the Fed has changed its stance over the last year, it appears to have been reacting each time to either market turmoil or economic events. To the extent the president has been moving Fed policy, he has been doing so by causing economic events \u2014 that is, by ratcheting up the trade war in a way that harms the economic outlook.\n\nAs for whether it\u2019s effective in convincing people that economic problems are someone else\u2019s fault, I don\u2019t know, but I doubt it. People care a lot about interest rates, inasmuch as they care about mortgage rates. But I don\u2019t think that many voters closely follow the Fed and understand how independent it is from the president. Historically, presidents get excessive credit and blame for economic performance and I suspect that remains true.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut interest rates by a quarter point \u2013 and President Trump\u2019s ongoing criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/18-jerome-powell.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
