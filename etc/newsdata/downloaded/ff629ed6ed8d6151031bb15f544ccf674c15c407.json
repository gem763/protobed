Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., questions FBI Assistant Director of the Counterterrorism Division Michael McGarrity, during a House Oversight and Reform Civil Rights and Civil Liberties subcommittee hearing, Tuesday, June 4, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the \u201creport\u201d from the New York Times over the weekend about an old-turned-new sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a number of high-profile Democratic politicians and candidates for president weighed in and demanded his impeachment.\n\nThis in spite of the fact that the correction the paper issued hours after they were first alerted to it by conservative new media noted that the alleged victim does not even recall the alleged incident.\n\nThis is also in spite of the fact that the person who made the allegation originally is a Clinton-era liberal lawyer who has a vested interest in destroying Kavanaugh (which naturally calls into question the lawyer\u2019s motivations):\n\nWe won\u2019t even dwell on the fact that it was a liberal lawyer\u2014one who happened to have been pitted against Kavanaugh during the Bill Clinton impeachment hearings\u2014who opportunistically claims to have recalled this 35-year-old incident and reported it to the FBI.\n\nAs we all know, facts don\u2019t care about your feelings, but Democrats don\u2019t care about the facts. So the beat rolled on well into Monday with more Democrats lining up to board the \u201cImpeach Kavanaugh\u201d train, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY).\n\nApparently AOC didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity to insert herself into the debate, and she did so by posting a video clip of her during her 2018 campaign trashing highly educated \u201crich\u201d men like Kavanaugh who she claimed \u201cbelieved\u201d they could get away with sexual assault.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not odd for Ocasio-Cortez to go the narcissistic route by making herself a focal point of any debate, what was odd about her tweets this morning about Kavanaugh is that she initially deleted the first one:\n\n11 minutes after jtLOL noted she had deleted her original tweet, AOC reposted an identical one:\n\nThis was almost a year ago. It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat. Because sexual assault isn\u2019t a crime of passion \u2013 it\u2019s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached.pic.twitter.com/9PhrgeYuHv \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 16, 2019\n\nShe followed up with another one from that same speech, because AOC has rarely seen a video of herself that she didn\u2019t like.\n\nBut why did she delete her first tweet initially? This explanation from Free Beacon\u2019s Alex Griswold is the only one that makes sense:\n\nThe AOC delete-and-repost is definitely a case of her seeing the NYT correction, but then realizing that the party line was already set, so screw it, we're running with it. \u2014 Alex \"Corn Pop\" Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) September 16, 2019\n\nYep. Might as well roll with it. Gotta get those RTSs, likes, and all the media attention that goes along with them.\n\nIn any event, no matter the reason for deleting and reposting, Ocasio-Cortez got dunked in the comments:\n\nREAD: NYT update included significant detail, several friends of alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time the alleged victim refused to be interviewed & has made no comment about the episode. \u2014 Art Zeigler (@artzeigler) September 16, 2019\n\nYou should have stuck with your decision to delete this tweet, @AOC. You were credibly accused of campaign finance violations just a few months ago By your own logic you should be expelled from the House pic.twitter.com/YjzJGzceXF \u2014 Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) September 16, 2019\n\n\"Credibly.\" You might want to check out the Corrections section of the NYT. \u2014 Beau Geste (@BeauGeste11) September 16, 2019\n\nYou were right to delete the first time. \u2014 Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) September 16, 2019\n\n\u201cCredibly\u201d???
