Mercury Retrograde is a common planetary phenomenon which occurs when Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, appears to move 'backwards' - east to west rather than west to east - across the sky. This apparent reversal in Mercury's orbit is actually just an illusion to people viewing it from Earth. The event was first written about in British astrology circles as far back as the mid-18th century, during a time when spiritualism and the stars were a huge craze. Because the Roman god Mercury was said to govern travel, business, personal wealth and communication, astrologers linked the planet Mercury to those areas as well. The significance of the event has become so exaggerated today that it's blamed for everything from missed flights and crashed computers to workplace tensions and broken household appliances. Mercury becomes Retrograde three or four times a year, for about three weeks at a time.

You're prone to misunderstandings and wrong assumptions about finances and long-term agreements at the moment.\n\n'You may also be paranoid over what you think others are thinking, even if you normally take people at face value. This can make you feel that people have bad intentions when their words and actions are actually quite innocent.'\n\nSolution: Be careful with your words and try to avoid saying something you will later regret.\n\nTry not to confuse innocent friendliness with flirting or sexual innuendo \u2013 your own attempts to flirt can come off wrong.\n\nSex may be confusing or fraught with misunderstandings, so double-check the recipient before you send any pictures or texts.\n\nTAURUS (20 APRIL \u2013 20 MAY) - LEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile many signs will cause their own drama this Retrograde, Kelli said Taurus is more likely to get caught in the cross fire of other people's mistakes.\n\n'It's not you - it's them! The confusion, miscommunication and miscalculations of others become your problem during this Retrograde,' she said.\n\n'Even when it is actually you, you'll deny it and insist the other person is confused.\n\n'This is particularly true in your close relationships, but don't be too ready to accept the blame from others either. They're not always right.\n\n'There's also the possibility that you'll encounter some legal issues.'\n\nSolution: Don't make a decision or file any legal documents during this period if you can avoid it, and unless you're a lawyer, don't do the work yourself.\n\nGEMINI (21 MAY \u2013 20 JUNE) - ILLNESS\n\nGemini is in for a rough ride all round this Mercury Retrograde, with trouble brewing in areas from health to daily routine.\n\n'You may develop a sudden cold or allergy problem, perhaps an irritable stomach or nervous tic. Your routine is likely to be disrupted by small, nagging things that drive you nuts, like being two minutes late to work,' Kelli said.\n\n'Superiors may miscommunicate or miscalculate and not only blame you, but expect you to fix their mistakes.\n\n'Likewise, the people who work for you may either forget to tell you important things before it's too late.'\n\nSolution: Establish a clear line of communication up and down the chain of command to avoid serious blunders.\n\n\n\nCANCER (21 JUNE \u2013 22 JULY) - MISUNDERSTANDINGS\n\nDuring Mercury Retrograde, Cancer may struggle to communicate clearly, particularly with family members.\n\n'It's likely going to be difficult for you to express yourself without being misunderstood.\n\n'This Mercury Retrograde will particularly affect your creative verbal output \u2013 you may not be able to find the right words or time your jokes as you normally would.\n\n'You may simply feel as if you can't create art or be social with your friends in the same way, as if you're doomed to screw up. Relationships with children may also be affected, and misunderstandings are likely.\n\nSolution: Don't let a temper tantrum bring you down, and don't have one of your own.\n\nUse this energy to understand yourself better.\n\nLEO (23 JULY \u2013 22 AUGUST) - HOUSEHOLD DRAMA\n\nKelli said Leo should anticipate household chaos throughout Retrograde, with broken appliances and domestic disagreements looming on the horizon.\n\n'Miscommunications in the home will cause a comedy of errors that probably won't bring laughter, at least not now,' she said.\n\n'Household appliances may suddenly break and family members may misunderstand each other, leading them to forego getting together or engaging in family traditions.\n\n'There could also be issues with real estate and household expenses.'\n\nSolution: Create a budget and start putting money away, or better yet \u2013 pay the bills now.\n\nIt's also probably best to wait to have any house guests until the Retrograde passes, as things you want to keep in the family may be exposed to an audience that's dying for some hot, juicy gossip.\n\nKelli said Leo should anticipate household chaos throughout Retrograde, with broken appliances and domestic disagreements looming on the horizon (stock image)\n\nVIRGO (23 AUGUST \u2013 22 SEPTEMBER) - MISCOMMUNICATION\n\nAccording to Kelli, Virgo is set to experience the most interesting Retrograde of all the zodiac signs.\n\n'It will likely affect your communication and thought process more than others. Everything from your everyday good morning greetings, to your texts to your spouse or sweetheart will be affected,' she said.\n\n'In particular, you may accidentally say what you're actually thinking and not what you're supposed to say.\n\n'Even if you usually have a strong filter, it will feel as if it's cracked and leaking now, and the harder you try to be polite and objective, the more outrageous and personal it becomes.\n\nSolution: Blame Mercury Retrograde when you're forced to apologise (even when you're not really sorry).\n\nLIBRA (23 SEPTEMBER \u2013 22 OCTOBER) - MATERIAL LOSS\n\nLibra is likely to lose something expensive this Retrograde, so Kelli said it's important to keep your most valued possessions close.\n\n'Be particularly careful with important things like your mobile phone, wallet, and credit cards, especially when taking a taxi or public transportation,' she said.\n\n'Likewise, personal gadgets may malfunction. Possessiveness, particularly of your ideas, is likely, even though they may not be nearly as original, provocative, or valuable as you think.\n\n'Moreover, you may find it difficult to convince others of your skills and talents \u2013 what you say about yourself comes across as bragging.'\n\nSolution: Let someone else talk you up or write your Tinder profile for you until the Retrograde ends.\n\nMercury Retrograde will affect Virgo's communication in all aspects of life, and may cause them to speak their mind without intending to (stock image)\n\nSCORPIO (23 OCTOBER \u2013 21 NOVEMBER) - AN EASY RIDE\n\nWith Mercury Retrograde happening right in the midst of Scorpio season, Kelli said the scorpion is in for a relatively easy ride because they are used to intense energy.\n\n'This Mercury Retrograde in your sign could go one of two ways: it could be a total nightmare, or the best thing that's happen to you in a while, depending on how you handle the energy,' she said.\n\n'You're comfortable with the Scorpio energy that's driving others to inadvertently reveal their dark sides.'\n\nSolution: You know what you're seeing, and how to use that to your advantage.\n\nYou may be just as confused and foggy as everyone else, but you know how to fake control, and others look to you to be their beacon of light in the fog.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (22 NOVEMBER \u2013 21 DECEMBER) - SPILLING SECRETS\n\nSagittarius is likely to get loose lipped this Retrograde and reveal secrets they never intended to.\n\n'You might actually deny that Retrograde is affecting you at all, even though it's clear to everyone else that you're making mistakes and suffering mishaps,' she said.\n\n'You're likely to become so wrapped up in denying problems that denial becomes your obsession - you need to prove that you're the one who's okay and has complete control.\n\n'This makes you the most likely of all the signs to slip and reveal personal secrets, even more than you do normally. Then you may compensate by telling some exaggerated, obvious lie, with no in between \u2013 and you're a notoriously bad liar.'\n\nSolution: Kelli's advice for Sagittarius is to talk less and listen more, or best of all - avoid talking full stop.\n\nCAPRICORN (22 DECEMBER \u2013 19 JANUARY) - DISAGREEMENTS AT WORK\n\nKelli warned that Capricorn is in for weeks of workplace disagreements this Retrograde.\n\n'Miscommunication among your colleagues is likely, and it will affect you. Even if it's your fault, you may think it's the world you're in that's wrong, and not you,' she said.\n\n'You could find yourself left out of social events with friends or co-workers, and while it may all be because of unclear communication during a Mercury Retrograde, you may begin to wonder if these people ever liked you at all.'\n\nSolution: Suck it up and socialise, even if you secretly feel everyone is out to get you - at least you can forget why you're so upset for a while.\n\nCapricorn and Aquarius should prepare for workplace tensions and disagreements with colleagues for the duration of Retrograde (stock image)\n\nAQUARIUS (20 JANUARY \u2013 18 FEBRUARY) - CAREER PROBLEMS\n\nAccording to Kelli, Aquarius is also likely to struggle professionally throughout this Mercury Retrograde.\n\n'Don't make any career moves until after November 20 - there will be errors on your resume, you'll apply to the wrong job, or say the wrong thing during an interview,' she said.\n\n'Even if you're not job hunting, this retrograde can seriously affect your reputation, and even if you're in a managerial position, you still run a risk.'\n\nSolution: Run your decisions by someone else, like a Scorpio, first.\n\nDon't make any dirty jokes or shocking statements at work, even if you think you're in front of the right audience.\n\nYou'll take it too far, or others will read into your words looking for a reason to be angry.\n\nPISCES (19 FEBRUARY \u2013 20 MARCH) - UNCERTAINTY\n\nKelli said this Retrograde may prompt an existential crisis for Pisces, particularly in the areas of religion and higher education.\n\n'If you're in college, you may suddenly be unsure of your career path, and if you're religious, you may question your faith.\n\n'You could also have difficulty separating what you feel from the facts in front of you, and you may find your psychic abilities enhanced - except when you really want the extra ability,' she said.\n\nSolution: Taking time alone to wander around aimlessly can help relieve confusion and create much-needed perspective.", "description": "Australian astrologer Kelli Fox, FEMAIL's resident zodiac expert, revealed what the upcoming Mercury Retrograde means for every star sign - and it appears to be chaos and confusion all round.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20303822-0-image-a-2_1572305000733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
