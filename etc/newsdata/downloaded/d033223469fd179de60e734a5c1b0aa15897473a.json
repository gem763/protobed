His former partner blasted his latest sentence as 'lenient'\n\n'I am trying to get my head around why the courts would hand out such a lenient sentence,' the woman who cannot be identified told the West Australian.\n\n'I find it absolutely disgraceful. I feel the lenient sentence condones sexual violence towards children.'\n\nWood, a father-of-three with a history of abusing methamphetamine, was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years meaning he could be out on the streets by 2023.\n\n'Do (the courts) think he will no longer offend once he is off the drugs?' The woman asked.\n\n'And more importantly, in four to six years he will be released and will get to live a normal life again. Do the courts think the victims will?'\n\nThe District Court of Western Australia heard earlier this month how Wood attacked a 15-year-old girl as she jogged through Mount Lawley, Perth, in the early hours of the morning in August 2017.\n\nWood had been standing in a laneway before grabbing the girl from behind as she walked past.\n\nSerial child rapist Sean Wood was sentenced to six years' jail with a non-parole period of four years at the District Court of Western Australia on October 2 for attacking two more children\n\nHe smothered her mouth with his hand and told her he would kill her if she screamed, and dragged her to a parked car which he had left running nearby.\n\nThe girl bit his hand and fled before he could sexually assault her.\n\nMonths later, Wood had been in a car with three children when he insisted a nine-year-old girl perform oral sex on him.\n\nShe refused and tried to escape to the rear seat with her sisters but Wood slapped her and sexually assaulted her.\n\nThe girl was taken to Perth Children's Hospital for treatment to injuries from the attack after complaining to her mother.\n\nIn sentencing, Chief Judge Kevin Sleight, said that Wood, who had mental health issues and had himself been abused, had apologised to all of his victims - but they were 'hollow apologies'.\n\nSean Wood was originally dubbed Western Australia's 'DNA rapist' as he was jailed in 1990 for the 1989 rape of a Perth teenager on DNA evidence.\n\nThe young woman had been waiting for a bus when Wood attacked her in circumstances similar to those of Mount Lawley.\n\nIt had been the first time WA Police used DNA technology to identify a rapist.\n\nDNA testing is now commonly used to solve sexual assault cases.\n\nWood's DNA was also found on the clothes of the 15-year-old girl he grabbed in Mount Lawley, an attack which he had initially denied to police.", "description": "The former partner of a convicted child rapist  has slammed his most recent six-year jail term, saying it 'condones sexual violence towards children'.", "authors": ["Alison Bevege For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/04/19974240-0-image-a-43_1571627652075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
