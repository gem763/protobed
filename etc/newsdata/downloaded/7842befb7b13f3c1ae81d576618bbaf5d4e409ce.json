She couldn\u2019t remember where it happened, when it happened, or how she arrived at or departed from the party. None of the four alleged witnesses she eventually named, including one of her closest lifelong friends, corroborated her accusations. Prior to airing her allegations with the media, she scrubbed her entire social media history that indicated she was a liberal activist.\n\nTo this day, there is zero evidence beyond her claims that the alleged assault ever happened. One detail, however, remains particularly intriguing. The Blasey family stayed conspicuously silent about the veracity of her allegations. A public letter of support for Ford that began \u201cAs members of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s family . . .\u201d wasn\u2019t signed by a single blood relative. Reached for comment by the Washington Post, her father simply said, \u201cI think all of the Blasey family would support her. I think her record stands for itself. Her schooling, her jobs and so on,\u201d before hanging up.\n\nPrivately, however, it appears the Blasey family had significant doubts about what Ford was trying to accomplish by coming forward and making unsubstantiated allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Within days of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, a fascinating encounter took place. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s father was approached by Ford\u2019s father at the golf club where they are both members.\n\nRalph Blasey, Ford\u2019s father, went out of his way to offer to Ed Kavanaugh his support of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation that took place at Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed,\u201d Ralph Blasey told Ed Kavanaugh, shaking his hand. Blasey added that the ordeal had been tough for both families.\n\nThe encounter immediately caused a stir at the close-knit private golf club as staff and members shared the news. The conversation between the two men echoed a letter that Blasey had previously sent to the elder Kavanaugh. Neither man returned requests for comment about the exchanges.\n\nBlasey never explicitly addressed the credibility of his daughter\u2019s allegations, but he presumably wouldn\u2019t have supported the nomination of a man he believed tried to rape his daughter.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Ford\u2019s father. The national drama played out on a decidedly local scale as the D.C.-based family and friends of Ford\u2019s quietly apologized to friends and family of Kavanaugh, even as the toxic political environment made it punitive for them to speak up publicly.\n\nOne friend who was subjected to both public scrutiny and private pressure because she cast doubt on Ford\u2019s story was Leland Keyser, one of Ford\u2019s closest friends at the time of the alleged attack. Keyser wanted to support her but nevertheless had no recollection of the event.\n\nKeyser\u2019s son noted on a GoFundMe page for his mother that she put \u201ceverything in her life at risk\u201d in order to tell the truth about Ford\u2019s allegations. Son Alex Beckel wrote that his mom \u201cresisted immense personal pressure and courageously came forward with the truth,\u201d adding that she \u201cstood up and did what was right when she had everything to lose and nothing to gain.\u201d\n\nWhile there was no evidence to support Ford\u2019s claim other than her testimony, some believed her because they said she would have no motivation to lie. Critics point to the nearly $1 million she raised in GoFundMe accounts and the honors that Sports Illustrated and Time Magazine bestowed on her. New books featuring her cooperation downplay the copious problems with her account.\n\nSo what was the point of the cavalcade of unsubstantiated allegations? Ford\u2019s attorney Debra Katz offered not so much a hint as a confession. Ford testified that she had no political motivation. But in remarks captured on video, Katz admitted that Ford\u2019s allegations against Kavanaugh were at least in part driven by fear he might not sufficiently support unregulated abortion on the court.\n\n\u201cWe were going to have a conservative\u201d justice, she said, \u201cbut he will always have an asterisk next to his name\u201d that will discredit any decision he makes regarding abortion. What\u2019s more, she added, \u201cthat is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d\n\nMollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino are the authors of the best seller Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.", "description": "Christine Blasey Ford's father repeatedly expressed to Brett Kavanaugh's father his support of Kavanugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway", "Carrie Severino"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBF2.jpg"}
