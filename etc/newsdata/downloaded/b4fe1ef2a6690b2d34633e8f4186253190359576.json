Anti-racism charity Kick It Out believe that Uefa has \u201cmissed an an opportunity to send an uncompromising message on racism and discrimination\u201d.\n\nEngland Under-21 coach Michael Johnson described the punishment as a \u201cjoke\u201d and said that a \u201clack of diversity means lack of understanding and empathy\u201d.\n\nAs well as the racist behaviour of fans, the Bulgarian Football Union was charged over the disruption of the national anthem and throwing objects. England\u2019s Football Association was also fined \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,300) over England fans booing the Bulgaria national anthem and is still answering an additional charge over insufficient numbers of travelling stewards. Although Bulgaria were ordered to play their next two matches behind closed doors, one of those games will be suspended during a probationary period of two years.", "description": "Uefa has been urged to overhaul its entire disciplinary response to racism following the \u201cjoke\u201d decision to fine Bulgaria \u20ac75,000 (\u00a365,000) and order them to play only one game behind closed doors after their fans racially abused England players.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000213034805-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
