The trailer for Hulu\u2019s limited series Looking for Alaska reeks of melancholy teen spirit, the kind that comes along with being obsessed over literature and also people who would never actually talk to you. \u201cEven when your heart breaks, you have to find a way to keep living,\u201d Alaska Young (Kristine Froseth), our mysterious titular character, says in a an equally mysterious voice-over.\n\nBased on John Green\u2019s best-selling novel, the series follows Miles \u201cPudge\u201d Halter (Charlie Plummer), who loves to read the last sentences of books and is definitely not equipped to deal with the challenge of adjusting to a new school and also dealing with a sudden tragedy. The rest of the cast includes Denny Love, Jay Lee, Landry Bender, Sofia Vassilieva, Uriah Shelton, and Jordan Connor. Ron Cephas Jones (This Is Us) and Timothy Simons (Veep) also star. Looking for Alaska premieres on October 18, just in time to watch it with a Pumpkin Spice Latte instead of studying for the SATs.", "description": "Watch the trailer for Looking for Alaska, based on the book by John Green (The Fault in Our Stars).", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-looking-for-alaska.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
