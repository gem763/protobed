COWBOYS SUCK!\u201d at Michael Irvin on an NFL Network set at Lambeau Field is so beautiful and so on brand. pic.twitter.com/VYs2hFRhDW \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) September 27, 2019\n\nThe fans started with a \u201cCowboys suck\u201d chant while Irvin sat on the set. They took it even further when Carson Wentz joined the crew for a live postgame interview.\n\nWentz can\u2019t even get through a thought and acknowledged \u201cmy fans,\u201d who were packed into the section directly in front of the crew.\n\nEagles fans are undefeated. pic.twitter.com/arT0lJ3j2N \u2014 Dennis Chambers (@DennisChambers_) September 27, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nLater in the seven-minute interview, fans booed as Irvin asked Wentz if it was a statement game and they continued \u201cDallas sucks\u201d chants as the quarterback answered. They transitioned to \u201cCarson Wentz\u201d chants and \u201cMVP\u201d with more booing as Irvin could barely be heard on the TV mics.\n\nThe Eagles (2-2) kept pace with the Cowboys (3-0) in the NFC East standings with the win over previously undefeated Green Bay. The Packers had a chance to tie the game late, but the Eagles\u2019 defense held four times on the 1-yard line and Nigel Bradham picked off a pass with 30 second left.\n\nWentz had only 160 passing yards, but threw three touchdowns with zero interceptions. Excited about a win, he also got a good laugh from his similarly exuberant fans.\n\nThough we\u2019d like to say it\u2019s peak Philadelphia ... it\u2019s probably not.\n\n[H/T For the Win]\n\nCarson Wentz and the Philadelphia Eagles' fans do what they can.
