All new cars in the EU must be compliant in 2021.\n\nFor Honda, declining demand for diesel vehicles and tougher emissions regulations have clouded its manufacturing prospects in Europe.\n\nHonda said in February it would close its only British car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs.\n\nJapan's No. 3 automaker has said it would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10% and redirecting those savings toward advanced research and development.", "description": "Honda to cease diesel vehicle sales in Europe by 2021", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8M1TI_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
