Fetzer has made similar claims on his website.\n\nA judge ruled in June that Pozner was defamed by claims made in the book, including that he fabricated copies of his son's death certificate, the AP reported. (Pozner filed a defamation lawsuit against the book's other author, Mike Palecek, but it was dismissed, according to court records. Palecek reportedly reached an out of court settlement with Pozner last month.)\n\nFetzer maintained his position Tuesday in a statement to ABC News, calling those who died in the shooting \"alleged 'victims'\" who had their death certificates fabricated. He also said the law was used against him \"as an instrument of oppression.\"\n\nHe plans to appeal.\n\nPHOTO: Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Dec. 15, 2012.

This award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr. Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror.\"\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Pozner said he hopes the court's decision will help other victims \"of Mr. Fetzer and other conspiracy theorists like him who use the internet to harass and defame\" to pursue legal action.\n\nEmily Feinstein, one of Pozner's attorneys, said the team was very pleased with the outcome. She also applauded Pozner's courage for testifying in the two-day trial, which was attended by many supporters of Fetzer.\n\n\"I can't even imagine how hard it was for our client,\" Feinstein said.\n\n(MORE: Infowars' Alex Jones ordered to undergo sworn deposition in Sandy Hook lawsuit )\n\nPozner created his nonprofit, HONR Network, to end the continued harassment he said he faced online from people claiming Sandy Hook was a hoax.\n\n\"Our work at [HONR Network] helping protect the families of victims and survivors of mass casualty incidents ... from these online predators continues, however this ruling empowers victims and furthers our mission to better protect victims off and online,\" Pozner said.\n\nIt is not the first case the courts have seen in regard to Sandy Hook conspiracy claims.\n\nControversial InfoWars radio host Alex Jones was ordered by a Connecticut judge to pay some of the legal fees of a Sandy Hook relative whose lawyer he verbally attacked on his web show, the AP reported.", "description": "A Wisconsin man who claimed that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting never happened was ordered to pay $450,000 to the father of a boy killed in the massacre.
