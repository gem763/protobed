She never liked anybody. She never asked to see the children.\n\n\u2018But I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t meet her because she would have criticised them, like she criticised me. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She\u2019s a sociopath.\u2019\n\nBefore his mum passed away just two years ago, the pair reconciled their relationship \u2013 however, Elton claims that things never changed.\n\nHe said she never met his two sons (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe star broke off connections when Sheila allegedly hit out at David Furnish (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018The only thing that changed was I didn\u2019t lose my temper,\u2019 he stated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I knew what was coming, and I let her get on with it. And I just said, \u201cI love you, Mum,\u201d and she said, \u201cI love you, too. I don\u2019t like you, but I love you. But I don\u2019t like you.\u201d\u2018\n\nThe iconic rock star has written about Sheila in his upcoming autobiography, Me: Elton John, and explained one time she hit out at his man.\n\nIn a heated row, the father-of-two claims she referred to David as a \u2018f**king thing\u2019 and it was enough to stop him from speaking to her for several years.\n\nThe Rocketman has written about his relationship with his mum in his memoir (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe mother and son duo had been arguing about Elton\u2019s former PA Bob Halley, after Bob decided to quit.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, the Amoreena singer said: \u2018Mum was absolutely livid when she heard Bob had left \u2014 they\u2019d always got on well.\n\n\u2018She didn\u2019t want to hear my version of events, and told me that Bob had been more of a son to her than I\u2019d ever been.\u2019\n\nElton says his mum then took aim at David, telling him: \u2018You care more about that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that exchange, the pair were no longer on speaking terms and Elton didn\u2019t invite his mum to his wedding when he and David married in 2014.\n\nSir Elton John\u2019s official autobiography, Me: Elton John, is set for release on 15 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
