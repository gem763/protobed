In exchange, Trump said China agreed to buy as much as $50 billion of American farm goods. Details of other possible agreements weren\u2019t immediately released.\n\nThe bruising battle over China\u2019s trade surplus and technology ambitions has disrupted global trade. Economists warn a final settlement might take years to negotiate. Despite that, financial markets rise ahead of each round of talks and fall back when no progress is reported.\n\nCompanies acknowledged Friday\u2019s agreement was a modest step and appealed to both governments to step up efforts to end the fight that is battering manufacturers and farmers.\n\nWashington still is planning a Dec. 15 tariff hike on $160 billion of smartphones and other imports. Before then, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend an economic conference in Chile in mid-November. That is raising hopes a face-to-face meeting might produce progress.\n\n\u201cTaking tariffs out of the equation for at last the next two months will give space for substantive negotiations,\u201d said Jake Parker, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group.\n\nTrump said Friday\u2019s deal has yet to be put down on paper but said, \u201cWe should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s government welcomed \u201csubstantial progress\u201d but gave no details of possible agreements.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a victory, but it eases the situation,\u201d said economist Yu Chunhai at Renmin University in Beijing. He said both sides want to restore business and consumer confidence.\n\nRead: A little more sun is shining on a cloudy U.S. economy, but the skies aren\u2019t all clear yet\n\nThere was no word of agreements on the core issues that sparked the dispute. Those include U.S. pressure on Beijing to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics, electric cars and other technologies.\n\n\u201cThere remains significant work ahead to address many of the most important U.S. trade and investment priorities,\u201d Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Still, he called Friday\u2019s announcement a \u201cray of hope.\u201d\n\nWashington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say China\u2019s plans violate its market-opening obligations and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Chinese leaders see those tactics as the surest path to prosperity and global influence.\n\n\u201cWith the key structural issues no closer to being resolved, we suspect that a mini deal would, at best, simply delay a breakdown in the negotiations,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard and Martin Lynge Rasmussen of Capital Economics.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement also made no mention of commitments by Beijing in sensitive areas including subsidies to industry and cyber security, or the status of telecom equipment giant Huawei, which faces damaging U.S. sanctions.\n\nTrump imposed curbs in May on sales of American components and technology to Huawei Technologies Ltd., China\u2019s first global tech brand. Trump has said he is willing to use Huawei, one of the biggest global makers of smartphones and network switching gear, as a bargaining chip in the trade talks.\n\n\u201cThe two sides will now return to a \u2018muddle through\u2019 strategy that avoids further tariff escalation but may not substantially reduce tensions,\u201d Michael Hirson and Kelsey Broderick of Eurasia Group wrote in a report. \u201cBoth the U.S. and China are likely to continue targeting each other through non-tariff measures, such as investment restrictions and regulatory barriers, which will be highly disruptive.\u201d\n\nTit-for-tat tariff hikes by both sides have raised costs for producers and consumers. Some companies are shifting production and supply lines out of China to avoid the U.S. tariffs, suggesting they expect the sanctions to stay in place for an extended period.\n\nChina\u2019s exports to the United States, its biggest foreign market, have plunged, adding to pressure on Xi\u2019s government to shore up cooling economic growth and avoid politically dangerous job losses.\n\nThe looming Dec. 15 tariff hike leaves a \u201cblack cloud\u201d over Apple Inc. and other tech companies with factories or customers in China, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a report. He said it would be a \u201cgut punch\u201d if it goes ahead.\n\nU.S. complaints about Chinese technology policies, cyber spying and protection of patents and other intellectual property \u201cwill be the focus of tech investors,\u201d said Ives.\n\nAnother potential stumbling block is how to enforce any agreement.\n\nTalks broke down in May over Beijing\u2019s insistence that Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs had to be lifted once a deal took effect. Washington says some must remain in place to ensure Chinese compliance. Trump and Xi agreed in June to resume negotiations but there have been no breakthroughs.\n\nDespite that, Beijing has gone ahead with other industry-opening initiatives aimed at making China\u2019s economy more competitive and productive. None, however, addresses Trump\u2019s complaints and business groups say they have had little impact on foreign companies.\n\nOn Friday, regulators announced a timetable for an initiative announced in 2017 to abolish limits on foreign ownership of some financial businesses. That starts with futures traders Jan. 1 and extends to securities firms and mutual fund managers later in the year.\n\n\u201cEven if it is not a new liberalization or something that hasn\u2019t been announced before, it is still positive to have a date on the horizon for when companies can apply,\u201d said Parker of the USCBC.\n\nU.S. stocks notched significant gains Friday, though they closed off session highs, after the reports that the U.S. and China had reached an agreement to ease trade tensions that includes the elimination of at least some planned tariffs.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% rose 319.92 points, or 1.2%, to 26,816.59, the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.09% advanced 32.14 points, or 1.1%, to 2,970.27, while Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.34% gained 106.26 points, or 1.3%, to 8,057.04.\n\nAt session highs, the Dow had risen 517.30 points, or 2%, the S&P 500 had gained 55.15 points, or 1.9%, while the Nasdaq had added 165.01 points, or 2.1%.\n\nFor the week, the Dow rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq added 0.6% and 0.9% respectively.\n\nSee also: Dow closes 300 points higher after U.S.-China trade truce", "description": "Companies have welcomed a U.S.-Chinese trade truce as a possible step toward breaking a deadlock in a 15-month-old tariff war, while economists caution there...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT189_trade__ZG_20191012105012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
