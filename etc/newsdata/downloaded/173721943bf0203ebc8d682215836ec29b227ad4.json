That last upgrade means the new Assistant can launch and return answers to queries much faster than before.

It\u2019s able to register follow-up queries and produce results in what feels like no more than a second or two.\n\nDeveloping...", "description": "Google has announced the second-generation version of its Google Assistant software, which promises new capabilities and a noticeable boost to speed.
