The move is effective from September 16 with the additional targeted cut taking place on October 15 and November 15.\n\nIt added that it would mean 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) of liquidity being released into the world's second-largest economy. The move was the third action of its kind this year and the seventh since early 2008, according to Reuters.\n\nThe ratio refers to the amount of money that banks must hold in their coffers as a proportion of their total deposits. Lowering the required amount will increase the supply of money that banks can lend to businesses and individuals, and therefore cutting borrowing costs.", "description": "China's People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced Friday that it was reducing the amount of funds banks have to hold in reserve, an effort to further stimulate the economy.", "authors": ["Matt Clinch"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104344624-RTX2HW2H.jpg?v=1550728902", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
