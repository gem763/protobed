If you can't make the event, you can stream the whole thing here at CBCMusic.ca/polaris.\n\nThis year's live-stream will be joining the gala in progress. That means that while the event will start at 7 p.m. ET, the online stream will start at 8:45 p.m. (5:45 p.m. PT).\n\nCBC Music is doing this to deliver you all of the performances while eliminating the artist changeovers. But don't worry, the winner announcement will be live.\n\nThis year, nine of the 10 shortlisted acts will perform: Pup, Les Louanges, Marie Davidson, Haviah Mighty, Snotty Nose Rez Kids, Shad, Fet.Nat, Elisapie and Dominique Fils-Aim\u00e9. Jessie Reyez, the final nominee, will be in attendance but will not be performing. They are all up for the $50,000 grand prize.\n\nPrevious winners of the Polaris Music Prize include Arcade Fire, Tanya Tagaq, Kaytranada, Buffy Sainte-Marie and last year's winner, Jeremy Dutcher, who will return to the stage to announce this year's winner.\n\nJeremy Dutcher's 'Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa', is awarded the 2018 Polaris Music Prize. 8:53\n\nFor all of CBC Music's coverage of the Polaris Music Prize, head to CBCMusic.ca/polaris.", "description": "CBC Music's Raina Douris will host the event this year at the Carlu in Toronto.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5090666.1554827769!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/polaris.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
