But he remained defiant, saying he would not be stepping aside.\n\n\"I will not be bowing to their demands. If they want to refer something to ICAC then good on them ... go for it,\" he said.\n\nICAC has just finished six weeks of public hearings into that donation and on Wednesday was asked by a bloc of Ryde's Liberal, Green and Independent councillors to investigate the Yuhu planning decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by the revelations,\u201d said Liberal councillor Trenton Brown.\n\nHe has written to the general manager seeking an extraordinary meeting of council to have the matter referred to ICAC and for the Mr Laxale and Mr Zhou to stand aside while that process runs its course.\n\nMr Brown is also seeking to have the planning approval set aside until any ICAC investigation has been completed and to compel council staff to fully co-operate with the corruption watchdog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he would move three motions to that effect at an extraordinary council meeting scheduled for November 12.\n\nCity of Ryde councillor Trenton Brown, in Sydney on Wednesday, intends to refer the matter to ICAC. Sam Mooy\n\n\u201cI want to make sure no one can profit from a decision where there may have been wrong-doing,\u201d Mr Brown said.\n\nIndependent councillor Ray Maggio and the Greens' Christopher Gordon have indicated they will support any referral to ICAC. That would comprise six of 10 votes, as Mr Laxale and Mr Zhou would most likely be unable to participate as the matter concerns them.\n\nNSW Labor leader Jodi McKay cancelled a media event with Mr Laxale on Wednesday morning, fearing she may be dragged into the controversy.\n\nMr Laxale said the event had been \"postponed\". Mr Zhou is overseas.\n\nHuang links\n\nMr Laxale, Mr Zhou and Mr Huang all attended the NSW Friends of Labor dinner in 2015. This led to an illegal $100,000 donation, which is alleged to have been made in cash and delivered by Mr Huang to the ALP's headquarters in an Aldi shopping bag. Mr Huang denies this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Huang is also fighting the tax office, which is seeking $141 million in unpaid liabilities from the property developer.\n\nMr Zhou formed part of Ryde Council\u2019s oversight for the Yuhu proposal, but absented himself from the critical vote on May 28 citing a \u201cless than significant non-pecuniary interest\u201d.\n\nHe told council he \u201cknows Mr Huang Xiangmo as a Chinese Community Leader\" whose family owned Yuhu Group.\n\nRyde deputy mayor Simon Zhou, left, with controversial Chinese political donor Huang Xiangmo.\n\nMr Zhou failed to mention he had held a $4 million shareholding in a separate Yuhu company, which owns the $82 million Pymble Corporate Centre \u2013 a low-rise office complex on Sydney\u2019s north shore.\n\nThat shareholding would not have increased in value because of the Eastwood Plaza decision, but his failure to disclose the mutual shareholding with Mr Huang may breach disclosure requirements under the Local Government Act and the Code of Conduct for local councils.\n\nOn Wednesday, the general manager of Ryde Council, George Dedes, referred this potential breach to the Office of Local Government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said this was the \"appropriate authority\" as the matters raised by the Financial Review related to disclosure of a councillor's pecuniary interests.\n\nMr Zhou has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was just \"quietly doing my job\u201d.\n\nThe Yuhu motion in May was carried by seven votes to four, as the other independent, Mr Maggio, also gave his support. That means it would have passed even without Mr Zhou's absence.\n\nMr Maggio told the Financial Review if Mr Zhou had disclosed his financial links with Mr Huang or Yuhu, he would have voted against the motion.", "description": "The NSW corruption watchdog has been asked to investigate a planning decision which could deliver a $135 million windfall for the Chinese billionaire.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_62%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7241cde28f6c67c436696a80e861c7f4909008a7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
