(Jim Havard/Flickr)\n\nAlthough today was certainly an improvement over yesterday, humidity remained on the uncomfortable side, so it wasn\u2019t exactly ideal. The front that slid through the area last night continues to head farther south through tomorrow, which means we get deeper into more pleasant air over time.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Skies may continue to clear for a while into the evening, but they should tend to thicken into the night. Some patchy fog or drizzle isn\u2019t impossible, especially the farther north and east one goes. Winds are turning all sorts of ways. As the next front approaches, they may become southeast for a while, before flipping to come from the northwest after midnight. By dawn, skies are clearing and winds are gusty as drier air spreads into the area. Lows are mainly in the upper 50s and lower 60s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Friday): Sunshine dominates as cool, dry air continues to filter into the region. Highs should mainly head for the mid-70s, with perhaps some upper 70s in spots in the city. Winds are out of the northwest around 10 to 20 mph, with some higher gusts.\n\nSee David Streit\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

It wouldn\u2019t even be shocking if there are a few spots in the upper 30s north and west. Fall is imminent!\n\nI know it was 98 degrees in DC yesterday but are you ready for this kind of chill Saturday morning? pic.twitter.com/3xS1JTdruW \u2014 Alex Liggitt (@ABC7Alex) October 3, 2019\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
