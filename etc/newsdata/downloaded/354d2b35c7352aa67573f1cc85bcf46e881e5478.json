You can fall into a trap where you want it so much it\u2019s all you ever think about and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s more chaotic now, but that means I enjoy it a lot more. When we go to training camps and Albie comes with me, it gives me that chance to step away and be me.\n\n\u201cThat was something missing before Rio.\u201d\n\nKenny will be aiming to keep the Olympic team pursuit and omnium titles she won in both London and Rio next year, but also wants to earn selection for the Madison, new to the women\u2019s Olympic programme in Tokyo.\n\nKenny and Elinor Barker, who will ride together at Six Day London, were part of Britain\u00b4s victorious team pursuit squad in Rio (David Davies/PA)\n\nGetting the nod will be as much about form as it is about finding the right partnership, with Britain experimenting with different duos at a number of events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny one because it\u2019s about the connection you have with the other rider,\u201d added Kenny, who is due to partner fellow Olympic champion Elinor Barker when she races at the Phynova Six Day London at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about being the best two people. You need to have a relationship, you need to know how they react and change and we\u2019ve been learning that over the summer.\u201d\n\nSix Day London will see the competition for Madison places played out on the track with Katie Archibald partnering Neah Evans and Emily Nelson riding with Manon Lloyd as the British team turn up en masse.\n\n\u201cWhen all the endurance girls do it, the standard is so high,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a race that\u2019s more laid back. You\u2019re racing in the dark with lights over your bike so it takes some of the seriousness out of it.\n\n\u201cThough you\u2019re still getting points for your Olympic qualification, it\u2019s such a different environment to the intensity of a World Cup or the World Championships.\u201d\n\nBefore London come the European Championships in Apeldoorn next week, where Kenny and Great Britain are hoping to put right much of went wrong in a disappointing display at this year\u2019s World Championships in March.\n\nResults in Pruszkow raised questions about whether British Cycling\u2019s \u2018medal factory\u2019 was nearing the end of the production line, but Kenny said there were not too many concerns within the programme.\n\nWith @LauraKenny31 confirmed the full women's field is now set for Six Day London!\u2063https://t.co/IBcnTirKzz pic.twitter.com/5GJh4sGTr3 \u2014 Six Day (@sixdaycycling) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cExpectations come from how much success we\u2019ve had in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Pruszkow the men\u2019s pursuit team did the quickest time they\u2019ve ever done but it\u2019s just that Australia went quicker.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s tricky but we\u2019ve been there before and I\u2019m sure we can get through it again.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, that was the first World Championships where we didn\u2019t win the women\u2019s team pursuit (since before the London Games) and everybody thought, \u2018What on earth?\u2019 but we still went on to win the Olympics so I\u2019m not worried.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just as though, because the Worlds didn\u2019t go to plan you throw it out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got targets along the way, stepping stones, and if you\u2019ve bought into the training plan you can still feel pretty confident.\u201d", "description": "It is now two years since the 27-year-old became mum to Albie and coming up to 18 months since she returned to racing.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/wire-19442846-1570539245-257_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
