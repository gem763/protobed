Although growers are beginning to cultivate the plant throughout the state, residents still can\u2019t legally purchase medical marijuana in Utah, forcing them to drive several hours to states where the drug is legal or turn to the black market.\n\nMitch Hill, 48, began using medical marijuana two months ago to treat the severe back pain he\u2019s dealt with for 10 years. It took Hill six months and three doctors to obtain a signed recommendation letter.\n\n\u201cOur family doctor didn\u2019t even want to talk about it, they wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d said Hill, a construction superintendent from the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan.\n\nHill drives five hours to the nearest dispensary in Colorado a few times a month to purchase medical marijuana.\n\nJuggling work, children and his throbbing back, the trip is \u201ca massive pain in the butt,\u201d he said.\n\nHe turned to marijuana because he said opioids and other painkillers turned him into a \u201cwalking zombie,\u201d feeling groggy, fatigued and nauseous. Medical marijuana helps his pain dissipate and relax, Hill said. He\u2019s able to be more productive in his job and take care of his children.\n\n\u201cThe letter has been a great thing for our family,\u201d Hill said.\n\nState health officials aren\u2019t tracking how many people have doctor\u2019s letters allowing them to use medical marijuana, but it appears there are thousands at least based on information from major medical providers and advocates.\n\nThe letters are a \u201cstop-gap measure\u201d before the state\u2019s official medical marijuana program is launched, Evan Vickers, the Senate Republican Majority Leader, said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to try and give patients access to the medication as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the formal program will make it much easier for people to get and use medical marijuana, eliminating trips to neighboring states and long searches for willing doctors.\n\nPatients must meet a list of qualifying conditions_cancer, chronic pain and epilepsy are among the most common- and have the product in the correct dosage. Under the current law, this would likely be an oil or capsule. Next year, patients must still follow the dosage requirements but can appeal to a board of medical providers if they don\u2019t meet one of the qualifying conditions.\n\nUtah is one of at least nine states that allowed recommendation letters to protect unregistered patients, according to data from the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington-based group that advocates for legalization.\n\nChris Lindsey, senior legislative counsel with the Marijuana Policy Project, said the states dealt with similar legal challenges and called the letters a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt helps sick people get relief, but it can create a false sense of security,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving a controlled substance across state lines is still against federal law, and then it\u2019s up to the patients to defend themselves in court.\u201d\n\nMarijuana is banned at the federal level, though a congressional amendment blocks the Justice Department from interfering with states\u2019 medical marijuana programs.\n\nPatients are putting themselves at potential risk of being arrested for drug-related crimes, advocates said, but it is unclear if law enforcement agencies are citing patients who have letters.\n\nSalt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, the prosecutor in Utah\u2019s most populated county, said he sees the letter as a critical legal tool in deciding whether to press charges in drug-related crimes.\n\n\u201cI have zero desire to prosecute a patient in need for possessing medical cannabis, and I\u2019ve advised prosecutors the same,\u201d Gill said.\n\nAmong Utah\u2019s doctors, the letters have received strong, mixed reactions.\n\nIntermountain Healthcare, the state\u2019s largest health provider, began allowing its doctors to write letters in February. While some doctors applauded the move, others said they aren\u2019t comfortable writing the letters, citing lack of research into medical cannabis and its federally illegal status, said Mark Briesacher, the hospital\u2019s chief physician executive.\n\nA growing national outbreak of lung damage linked to unregulated vaping products containing marijuana\u2019s high-inducing ingredient THC have further compounded concerns, he said. In Utah, one person died from a vaping-related injury.\n\nStenquist expressed frustration with the challenges Utah\u2019s medical cannabis program has faced but said she\u2019s hopeful for a smooth rollout next year.\n\n\u201cPatients don\u2019t want to break the law, they\u2019re just trying to get access to medication,\u2019 she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As Utah prepares to launch its medical marijuana program next year, residents who want to use the drug in the meantime are encountering skeptical doctors and the quandary of where to get the plant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Morgan Smith"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
