The Dodgers had five hits and the Padres only three.\n\nMuncy\u2019s hit broke up a duel between Kershaw (16-5) and Joey Lucchesi (10-10).\n\nKershaw allowed two hits, struck out seven and walked one.

Rougned Odor added his 29th homer later in the inning.\n\nMinor (14-10) started the day needing nine strikeouts to reach 200, and he struck out six of his first 11 batters.

In the ninth, Sandy Le\u00f3n flied out before Chris Owings popped up a 1-1 pitch. First baseman Ronald Guzm\u00e1n was coming in to make the catch but then heard Minor and catcher Jose Trevino shouting at him to let the ball drop to the ground.
