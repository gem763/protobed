How do you think they get there?", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nSo far this bloody year, about 450 people have been hit by gunfire in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThey were executed, injured or they killed themselves, according to the incidents gathered by the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nAmong the victims: 11-year-old Karon Brown, who was shot dead in Southeast Washington in July. Brothers Roy\u2019Ale and Roy\u2019Nal Hill, 12 and 13, who were injured in separate attacks; Roy\u2019Nal was left paralyzed. Just this past weekend, a 14-year-old girl was wounded by bullets when she bent over to tie her shoe outside a grocery store in Shaw.\n\nAll these guns \u2014 Glocks, Berettas, Walthers galore \u2014 are seized every year in a city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation.\n\nThat\u2019s what the gun folks like to point out, when they argue that gun laws don\u2019t work, right?\n\nBut the answer, my friends who would prefer not to get shot, is not really in D.C.\n\nIt\u2019s in Virginia.\n\nVirginia is the Wild West just one traffic-choked bridge away from America\u2019s seat of power. And it\u2019s the source of most of the guns that flood the District\u2019s streets.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, the guns come from Virginia,\u201d said D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6). \u201cMaryland is number two, but not that many come from there.\u201d\n\nThere were 538 guns seized in the District that came from Virginia in 2017. Last year, it was 599, Allen said. This year, it will be even more.\n\nBut good luck with tackling that.\n\nAllen held a hearing on gun violence last week. The agencies responsible for everything that has to do with trafficking guns \u2014 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia \u2014 said \u201cno thanks\u201d and didn\u2019t testify, despite Allen\u2019s requests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. As a local official I am held accountable by my constituents,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is zero accountability when the U.S. attorney\u2019s office won\u2019t do the council the courtesy of testifying before us.\u201d\n\nRemember, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office \u2014 the place responsible for all prosecution of gun-related crimes in the District \u2014 is headed by Jesse Liu, who was appointed by President Trump to be the chief prosecutor in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n[A prosecutor won\u2019t do her job, so bigots are getting away with hate in D.C.]\n\n\u201cThe U.S. attorney doesn\u2019t answer to us, doesn\u2019t represent us,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe U.S. attorney represents the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nThis is the same U.S. attorney who has prosecuted zero hate crimes in the District, even though the city had a record year for hate in 2018 \u2014 with 204 crimes reported.\n\nSpokeswoman Kadia Koroma said the office has sent in testimony and someone from their office sat in the audience, \u201cwhich is the same thing.\u201d\n\nNot really, Allen said. He didn\u2019t get to ask them about prosecutions, trends, what happens to the guns after a case, how are they tracking the trafficking? \u201cIt\u2019s a black hole,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019re getting a good idea of how they get to D.C., though.\n\n[He put 224 guns on the street in D.C.]\n\nLiu\u2019s eastern Virginia counterpart at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, G. Zachary Terwilliger, is prosecuting the gun runners.\n\nFrom July to September, the office arrested four separate gun traffickers who bought dozens of guns in the free-for-all that is Virginia, some of which were later seized in the District.\n\nOne of their favorite games is to get women to buy the guns for them.\n\nJoni Maria Metcalf, 34, has been in trouble with the law before, according to the court cases showing she tangled with rent-to-own companies for allegedly keeping furniture she was renting.\n\nSo she found a way to earn some cash by buying guns as a straw purchaser for her boyfriend and his friend. She pleaded guilty to this in court last month, after the friend was found with one of the illegal guns in the District, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nVirginia voters know it\u2019s a mess. Coming up to the Nov. 5 election, gun violence is the No. 1 issue for 3 out of 4 voters questioned in a Washington Post-Schar School poll released last week\n\nOf course, it is. After the mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building in May and the lingering stain of the Virginia Tech slaughter in 2007, no gun access has been restricted and no governing body has shown it gives a fig.\n\nWhen state lawmakers finally announced a huge hearing on gun violence, after the Virginia Beach shooting, hundreds gathered for the historic sessions. They ended it in 90 minutes.\n\n[The moms want revenge after they went to Virginia and nothing happened.]\n\nSo here\u2019s the weird reality, D.C.\n\nAnd it may be controversial to say this, but get in there and influence Virginia\u2019s election.\n\nShout, yell, volunteer with gun safety groups, do everything (but ask Ukraine for help) to convince our neighbors that they have the power to make their state \u2014 and our nation\u2019s capital \u2014 safer.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only way to end gun violence, but it is the best way to end the guns.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "Many of the weapons are coming from Virginia.
