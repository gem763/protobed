School officials removed the student from class and found a gun in his pocket.\n\nPolice with the North East Independent School District arrested the student, who Cerroni wrote \u201cwill face serious disciplinary consequences.\u201d North East\u2019s police officers \u2015 or \u201cpeace officers\u201d \u2015 are trained police who are licensed to arrest individuals violating local, state and federal laws on campus.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the students who came forward and alerted the school,\u201d the principal wrote. \u201cWe are treating this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and we will not tolerate any inappropriate items at our school. Please take a moment to talk with your child about the importance of talking to an adult or reporting anything they believe is inappropriate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the student is currently in custody and how he obtained the gun. The letter did not mention the student\u2019s name or age, but used male pronouns to reference him. The firearm was a loaded 9 mm gun, according to WOAI-TV.\n\nThursday\u2019s arrest came less than a month after five children in Texas were shot in four separate incidents over one weekend. Those shootings highlighted the state\u2019s already existing gun violence problem, specifically with youth. Texas leads the nation in unintentional shootings by children, according to a report by the Houston Chronicle. Almost 200,000 children in Texas live in homes with unlocked, loaded guns, the Brady Campaign reported.\n\nData from gun violence prevention group Everytown for Gun Safety shows that Texas had 25 unintentional shootings involving children who found a loaded firearm last year. The state had already seen at least 24 such shootings this year with several months remaining, according to Everytown\u2019s #NotAnAccident index, which tracks unintentional shootings nationwide.\n\nAs of September, it\u2019s even easier to carry guns in the state\u2019s churches and schools, after Texas lawmakers passed several bills in May that were later signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association for supporting gun rights. Those bills loosened the state\u2019s already lax gun laws.\n\nThe Texas laws that went into effect last month came after the state experienced two mass shootings within less than a month. A gunman killed 22 people and injured dozens more at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. Weeks later, another gunman went on a shooting spree in the Texas cities of Midland and Odessa, killing seven and wounding more than 20. The state also experienced two other mass shootings in recent history: at the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church in 2017 that left 26 dead, and at Santa Fe High School in 2018 that left 10 dead.", "description": "The incident at a San Antonio middle school highlights the state's youth gun violence issue, with Texas leading the U.S. in unintentional shootings by ch...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9fab50210000b908accb51.jpeg?cache=2e8lzzeru9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
