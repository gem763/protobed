It says the Eastern Cape has the greatest school infrastructure backlog in the country.\n\nIn a statement, EE said currently more than 2 000 schools in the province still have pit latrines; 197 have no access to water; 53 have no form of sanitation.\n\nAbout 20 learners share one Maths Literacy textbook at Charles Morgan School near King William\u2019s Town in the Eastern Cape, according to grade 11 learner Sibulele Mantye, who joined the picket. There are 60 learners in his class, he said.\n\nMantye said his school has only one teacher for Maths Literacy and she has to teach three grades.\n\nHe said in his school most toilets have broken seats and have no doors; learners relieve themselves in an open field near the school.\n\n\"Parents tried to raise money to fix some of the toilets but that didn\u2019t help much because most parents did not contribute since they are unemployed,\" he said.\n\nGcina Mtya from Qonce High, also in King William\u2019s Town, said the school was short of classrooms. GroundUp wrote about conditions in Qonce in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\"Our voices are not heard and that is very frustrating,\" said Mtya.\n\nA memorandum was handed to Baphelele Mhlaba, Chief of Staff to Premier Oscar Mabuyane, who promised to deliver it to the Premier\u2019s office.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Equal Education wants the R4.3m saved at this year\u2019s official opening of the Eastern Cape Legislature to be allocated to fixing schools.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9054/eb3cfef6a0a3476787528d2671d66a33.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-29"}
