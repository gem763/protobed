Matt Gaetz files ethics complaint against Schiff, cites 'unprofessional and divisive' conduct", "language": "en", "text": "Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz filed an ethics complaint against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Wednesday, citing \u201crules broken\u201d and \u201cfalse statements\u201d as Schiff plays a starring role in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nGaetz sent a letter Wednesday to the House Ethics Committee urging the panel to open an official investigation into Schiff, accusing the Democrat of improper conduct during the impeachment inquiry and the Russia investigation.\n\nFOP ACCUSES CONGRESS OF VIOLATING DUE PROCESS \u2018TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS' AMID IMPEACHMENT DEBATE\n\n\u201cToday I filed an ethics complaint against @RepAdamSchiff for: Distorting @POTUS\u2019s call with President Zelensky; Lying to the public about \u2018Russian Collusion;\u2019 Blocking Members of Congress from attending impeachment depositions,\u201d Gaetz tweeted. \u201cSchiff must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nPatrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff, hit back at the Republican congressman, saying in a statement provided to Fox News, \"We don\u2019t think anyone takes Mr. Gaetz seriously, especially on the subject of ethics.\"\n\nIn his letter to the Ethics Committee, Gaetz took issue with Schiff\u2019s behavior during an Intelligence Committee hearing last month, saying the California Democrat \u201cgave a wildly-inaccurate and distorted \u2018retelling\u2019\u201d of the highly-controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this summer.\n\nGaetz said Schiff was \u201cgrossly misrepresenting the content of the call to the American people\" and argued Schiff's \u201cbizarre distortion\u201d of the call was in violation of House rules.\n\n\u201cThis behavior does not \u2018reflect credibility on the House,\u2019 nor does it follow \u2018the spirit and the letter of the Rules of the House,\u2019\u201d Gaetz wrote. \u201cIt is incumbent on Members of Congress to be accurate and honest to the American people, and Chairman Schiff has been neither.\u201d\n\nHe added that Schiff\u2019s actions were a \u201cblatant and clear-cut violation\u201d of precedent, which he cited as specifically \u201cprohibiting making \u2018accusations that the President has committed a crime,\u2019 or claiming \u2018that the President has done something illegal.\u2019\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Schiff\u2019s behavior cannot be construed as an \u2018honest mistake,\u2019 as it is long-standing and habitual,\u201d Gaetz said, noting that the Intelligence Committee chairman claimed throughout the Russia investigation that he had \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d that Trump and his campaign were \u201ccolluding\u201d with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFormer Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, though, stated the contrary\u2014that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy\u201d with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in 2016.\n\n\u201cMr. Schiff\u2019s unprofessional and divisive behavior has caused conflict within the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,\u201d Gaetz wrote, recalling earlier this year when all Republican lawmakers on the panel signed a letter calling for his immediate resignation.\n\nGaetz\u2019s formal complaint to the Ethics Committee comes after other run-ins with Schiff and Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry this month.\n\nLast week, Gaetz was among the approximately 30 House Republicans who stormed a closed-door session connected to the impeachment inquiry, prompting Schiff to suspend the proceedings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGaetz, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was also kicked out of another session earlier this month as former deputy assistant to the president Fiona Hill answered questions behind closed doors. Gaetz was told he could not attend because he is not part of the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the investigation along with the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees.\n\nThis week, Pelosi announced the House would formalize and establish the parameters of the Trump impeachment inquiry with a vote expected to be held on Thursday.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\n\nSchiff has responded to attacks from Republicans by accusing them of lacking \"courage.\"\n\n\"It will be said of House Republicans, When they found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history, They consoled themselves by attacking those who did,\" Schiff said on Twitter earlier this month.\n\nThe Republican strategy, thus far, has been to blast the way in which Democrats have handled the impeachment process. On Wednesday, Trump weighed in, reportedly encouraging GOP lawmakers to, instead, \"go after the details\" of the case -- something Schiff highlighted.\n\n\"Trump has urged Republicans to focus on the substance in the impeachment inquiry, not the process. I can confirm our focus will continue to be on the President\u2019s own words and misconduct. Glad we all agree,\" Schiff tweeted Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tea Party Patriots, a conservative organization, filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi on Wednesday to the Office of Congressional Ethics, claiming the speaker has demonstrated \u201cmultiple violations\u201d of House conduct in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe group argued that Pelosi has \u201cweaponized\u201d impeachment and \u201cabused her power as Speaker of the House of Representatives,\u201d and claimed she is \u201cunfit\u201d to serve.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "Florida Republican Rep.
