Their machines look nothing like a regular computer. They are large cylinders of metal and twisted wires that are dropped into stainless steel refrigerators. You send information to the machine, as you would to a traditional computer chip, and receive calculations in return.\n\nGoogle\u2019s paper became a bit of an internet mystery after it was published and then quickly unpublished online in late September. That brief appearance was enough to raise the hackles of researchers at competing companies who believe the Silicon Valley giant is inflating its accomplishment.\n\nOn Monday, IBM fired a pre-emptive shot with a blog post disputing Google\u2019s claim that its quantum calculation could not be performed by a traditional computer. The calculation, IBM argued, could theoretically be run on a current computer in less than two and a half days \u2014 not 10,000 years.\n\n\u201cThis is not about final and absolute dominance over classical computers,\u201d said Dario Gil, who heads the IBM research lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., where the company is building its own quantum computers.\n\nOther researchers dismissed the milestone because the calculation was notably esoteric. It generated random numbers using a quantum experiment that can\u2019t necessarily be applied to other things.\n\nThough IBM disputed that Google had really accomplished all that much, Dr. Gil argued that quantum computers were indeed getting closer to reality. \u201cBy 2020, we will be able to use them for commercial and scientific advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nLike much of the cutting-edge work being done in corporate research labs, Google\u2019s quantum effort has its roots in academia. In 2014, Google hired a team of physicists who had spent the previous several years working on quantum computing at the University of California, Santa Barbara.", "description": "Scientists at a company lab said they had taken a big step toward creating a machine that would make today\u2019s supercomputers look like toys.", "authors": ["Cade Metz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/business/23quantum-promo/23quantum-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
