O/NASIANAP\n\n- The deal came a few days after YNCC had bought open-specification naphtha at a premium of about $10, the highest price the petrochemical maker had paid since May 2018.\n\n- Although Saudi has said that it would fully restore lost oil production by the end of this month following attacks on two of its oil facilities, industry sources were not convinced that supplies of oil products would normalise in such a short time. Saudi Aramco has so far bought over 400,000 tonnes gasoline and at least 120,000 tonnes of naphtha from Europe. O/NAPARB\n\n- The kingdom's demand for oil products has driven the Asian monthly refining margins to a two-year high this month. TENDERS: India's IOC sold 35,000 tonnes of naphtha for Oct. 5-7 loading from Chennai to Vitol, industry sources said, but the premiums were not known.\n\n- BPCL and MRPL have outstanding tender to sell a total of 100,000 tonnes of naphtha for October loading through tenders due to be awarded this week.
