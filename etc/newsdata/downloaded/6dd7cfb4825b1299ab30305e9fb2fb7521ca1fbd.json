Sanchez took a no-hitter into the eighth inning, walked one and struck out five. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nSports columnist\n\nAmong the perfect ways for the Washington Nationals to open their first appearance in the National League Championship Series, if you\u2019re holding a ticket saying, \u201cAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez takes no-hitter into the eighth,\u201d please report to the window to collect your winnings. And bring a dump truck. That ticket for the Nats to win the pennant? Put it in a safe place.\n\nS\u00e1nchez was the star of a 2-0 Game 1 victory for the Nats over the St. Louis Cardinals at sold-out Busch Stadium, where the locals pride themselves on teaching folks about baseball \u2014 and instead were schooled themselves. The specifics of what S\u00e1nchez did are important, and we will get to them. What matters more: The Nats took the first game and swung the series in their favor \u2014 heavily.\n\n\u201cBy no means are we thinking we\u2019re sitting pretty,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said.\n\nFine. Forgive those of us who do.\n\n[An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez\u2019s near-no-hitter gives Nationals 2-0 win over Cardinals in Game 1 of NLCS]\n\nHere\u2019s the grocery list of items that worked against the Nats on Friday: Daniel Hudson, their most-of-the-time closer, was in Arizona, placed on the paternity list after the birth of his third child earlier Friday \u2014 leaving a dangerous hole in the back end of Washington\u2019s bullpen, if only for a day. Kurt Suzuki, their most-of-the-time starting catcher, was still being monitored after he suffered a head injury when he was hit by a pitch in Game 5 of the division series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Victor Robles, their starting center fielder, sat for a fourth straight game with a hamstring issue, forcing Michael A. Taylor into the lineup.\n\nAnd S\u00e1nchez, what amounts to the \u201cweak link\u201d of the rotation, was on the mound. He made himself into a strength. He didn\u2019t allow a hit until his 103rd pitch, when there were two outs in the eighth and pinch hitter Jose Martinez lined a clean single to center. He had people buzzing about Don Larsen and Roy Halladay even as the Nats clung to a narrow lead. His final line: 7\u2154 innings pitched, one hit, no runs, one walk, five strikeouts and two hit batters.\n\nPut him behind Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin \u2014 all spent after the Dodgers series. That\u2019s just fine.\n\n\u201cI think the rotation that I\u2019m in right now is really special,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201c. . . Every time I get the ball, I want to be competitive for those guys.\u201d\n\nThese are long series, and none has gone seven games without someone being down 0-1. But think of the Cardinals\u2019 task at the moment: They must win four of the next six games, and four of those games will be started by either Scherzer or Strasburg. If the Cardinals could beat each of those guys once, which is completely doable, then to win the series they also would have to take care of games started by Corbin, the dangerous lefty, and S\u00e1nchez, who just plowed through them.\n\nAdd some more ingredients: Hudson will be back for Saturday\u2019s Game 2, and they survived without having to use their suspect relievers, who are many, because S\u00e1nchez went so deep and Sean Doolittle got the final four outs without incident.\n\nWhat\u2019s more: The out-of-the-box thinking of the wild-card game and the division series \u2014 in which Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin all made relief appearances \u2014 has now been placed squarely back in the box. A five-game series has two off days in seven days. A seven-game series has two off days in nine days. Welcome back to a normal rotation \u2014 the Nats\u2019 strength since, it seems, the beginning of time.\n\n\u201cStarting pitching has been our backbone,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said. \u201cThat\u2019s been our bread and butter.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the knife. Slather it on and figure out what\u2019s ahead. Scherzer will start Game 2 (on full rest), Strasburg will start Game 3 (on full rest), Scherzer would start a Game 6 (on full rest) and Strasburg would be teed up for a Game 7 \u2014 on six days\u2019 rest. That doesn\u2019t even account for Corbin and S\u00e1nchez \u2014 with one run allowed in 12\u2153 postseason innings \u2014 in Games 4 and 5.\n\nEven if 23 of the 33 teams that have opened a best-of-seven NLCS have gone on to win it, the Nats are guaranteed nothing. But sit around a table in West Palm Beach, Fla., in February and map out a scenario that says, \u201cYou\u2019re up a game in the NLCS, and you have Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg four times in the remaining six games, and neither has to go on short rest.\u201d Ownership, the front office, the coaching staff, the players, the cook and the janitors \u2014 they would all take it.\n\nAnd because S\u00e1nchez toyed with the Cardinals, the series is tilted in their favor. Their strength is still to come. Not that they will allow that.\n\n\u201cAt no point do we think any of these games are going to be easy,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nIn a way, given the Nats\u2019 recent come-from-behind October stresses, Friday kind of was. What amounted for Cardinals\u2019 \u201crallies\u201d: a one-out walk to Kolten Wong in the fourth; a hit batsman, pinch hitter Randy Arozarena, with one out in the sixth; and another hit batsman, Yadier Molina with an 0-2, 66-mph floater, in the seventh. In an era defined by velocity, this was artistry, lousy contact that produced lazy flyballs. Look for the sensational defensive play that preserved the bid? For seven innings, there really isn\u2019t one, unless you count Anthony Rendon charging Matt Carpenter\u2019s shift-beating bunt in the fifth. Stressful? Eh, it was kind of routine.\n\nAnd then the 35-year-old first baseman \u2014 channeling Ryan Zimmerman circa 2009, when he played Gold Glove-caliber third base \u2014 dove to his right, his body parallel to the ground, to snare Tommy Edman\u2019s scorched liner to open the eighth. Put an asterisk near that one.\n\nThis was all S\u00e1nchez, doing what he does at the highest level.\n\n\u201cHis ability to change speeds, it\u2019s probably one of the best in the game,\u201d said Scherzer, a teammate for two years in Detroit before S\u00e1nchez rejoined him in Washington this season. \u201cThe way he can change speeds \u2014 even on his change-up.\u201d\n\nAnd Scherzer laughed. So much of this remarkable rotation is built on power. The fastballs of Scherzer and Strasburg, in so many ways, set the tone for this team because everything else plays off them \u2014 Scherzer\u2019s four-pitch arsenal, Strasburg\u2019s disappearing change-up, etc. Corbin might not be as viscerally overpowering, but he has a wipeout slider. Thus, here are the NL ranks of Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin in strikeouts this season: second, third and fourth, respectively.\n\nScherzer, though, believes that any pitcher would do well to watch S\u00e1nchez. Yeah, so what if that fastball tops out at about 91 mph? Get back to what he can do with that change when he slows it, as Scherzer said, \u201call the way down.\u201d\n\n[When it comes to World Series droughts, D.C. is a special place for suffering]\n\n\u201cWe call it the butterfly,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cHe can throw a butterfly in there, and . . . just every hitter waves at it. That\u2019s what makes him such a treat to watch. I really feel like every pitcher can learn from him because of the way he puts his pitches together and the way he can change speeds.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of the Game 2 starter \u2014 who has won three Cy Youngs \u2014 about the Game 1 starter, who any opponent would have to consider vulnerable when stacked up against the rest. And yet he completely mastered the Cardinals.\n\nThe last time the St. Louis offense was seen \u2014 which would be Wednesday in a Game 5 victory over Atlanta \u2014 it was scoring 10 runs in the first inning. On Friday, there were innings they didn\u2019t see 10 pitches.\n\n\u201cEvery pitch meant something,\u201d catcher Yan Gomes said. \u201cWe were setting up for something else.\u201d\n\nWhat they\u2019re set up for now is the rest of the series. An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez fit himself in with the strength of this team. But the real strength is still to come.", "description": "After stealing Game 1 of the series, Washington has Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg lined up for Games 2 and 3.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "October At Am", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qCx_3osSw-5SucKcIw7_uCDaTiA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JUFSJGXMTUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
