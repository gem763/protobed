Bloomberg reported that at one point, these human workers were responsible for reviewing and annotating roughly 150 security snippets of up to 30 seconds in length each day that they worked.\n\nTwo sources who spoke with Bloomberg told the outlet that some clips depicted private imagery, such as what Bloomberg described as \u201crare instances of people having sex.\u201d An Amazon spokesperson told Gizmodo that reviewed clips are submitted either through employee trials or customer feedback submissions for improving the service.\n\n\u201cUsing the \u2018feedback\u2019 option in the Cloud Cam app, customers are able to share a specific clip with Amazon to improve the service,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhen a customer chooses to share a clip, it may get annotated and used for supervised learning to improve the accuracy of Cloud Cam\u2019s computer vision systems. For example, supervised learning helps Cloud Cam better distinguish different types of motion so we can provide more accurate alerts to customers.\u201d\n\nWhat Amazon describes sounds like one of those vague prompts you see on a PC that asks if you\u2019d like to share data to improve the service after it encountered a problem. When Gizmodo asked Amazon to clarify why a user would voluntarily choose to share a clip with the online retail giant, a spokesperson told us:\n\nEvery clip surfaced to a Cloud Cam customer has the \u201cSend Feedback\u201d button at the bottom (screenshot below). Customers typically send clips for feedback if there was something wrong with it, i.e. if they got a motion detection alert but the clip doesn\u2019t contain any motion, or the resolution of the clip isn\u2019t satisfactory.\n\nSo to be clear, customers are sharing clips for troubleshooting purposes, but they aren\u2019t necessarily aware of what happens with that clip after doing so.\n\nMore troubling, however, is an accusation from one source who spoke with Bloomberg that some of these human workers tasked with annotating the clips may be sharing them with members outside of their restricted teams, despite the fact that reviews happen in a restricted area that prohibits phones.\n\nWhen asked about this, a spokesperson told Gizmodo by email that Amazon\u2019s rules \u201cstrictly prohibit employee access to or use of video clips submitted for troubleshooting, and have a zero tolerance policy for about of our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe treat this information with the highest confidentiality, and have strict technical and operational safeguards in place to protect it including use of secured facilities and multi-factor authentication to restrict access, service encryption, and audits of our control environment,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson claimed that the company informs customers in prompts that \u201cclips will be used to help improve Cloud Cam.\u201d The spokesperson also pointed to a Cloud Cam FAQ page also cited by Bloomberg that contains seemingly cleverly crafted language about who can see Cloud Cam clips.\n\nAccording to that page (emphasis ours), \u201cOnly you or people you have shared your account information with can view your clips, unless you choose to submit a clip to us directly for troubleshooting. Customers can also choose to share clips via email or social media.\u201d\n\nCloud Cams are not the only devices the company owns that have been accused of watching or listening in on unsuspecting customers. Bloomberg previously reported in April that Amazon workers are listening to and annotating Alexa recordings and sometimes share them in private chat rooms for purposes of help or humour.\n\nReviews of both Alexa recordings and Cloud Cam recordings are intended to improve its algorithms and the functionality of its AI. Back in April, a spokesperson for the company said Amazon only annotates \u201can extremely small sample of Alexa voice recordings in order [to] improve the customer experience.\u201d With respect to Cloud Cam reviews, a spokesperson told Gizmodo a small fraction of one per cent of footage gets submitted for feedback.\n\n\u201cWe take privacy seriously and put Cloud Cam customers in control of their video clips,\u201d the Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOnly customers can view their clips, and they can delete them at any time by visiting the Manage My Content and Devices page.\u201d OK.\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not just Amazon who\u2019s been accused of allowing human workers to listen in on whatever is going on in your home. Motherboard has reported that both Xbox recordings and Skype calls are reviewed by human contractors. Apple, too, was accused of capturing sensitive recordings that contractors had access to.\n\nThe fact is these systems just aren\u2019t ready for primetime and need human intervention to function and improve \u2014 a fact that tech companies have successfully downplayed in favour of appearing to be magical wizards of innovation.", "description": "Recordings from yet another Amazon-owned smart home device are being reviewed by a team of human workers, again raising concerns that audio and video captured by such devices may not be as private as some customers might assume....", "authors": ["Matt Novak", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/pva6i8vonsy7nj3yk7dm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
