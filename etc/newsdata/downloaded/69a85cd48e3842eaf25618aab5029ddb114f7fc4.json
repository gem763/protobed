REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nTens of thousands of protesters staged demonstrations during recent holidays, including in downtown Seoul on Wednesday, and more gatherings are planned for Saturday.\n\nCritics of liberal President Moon Jae-in routinely stage demonstrations in downtown Seoul but corruption allegations against justice minister Cho Kuk\u2019s family have galvanized conservative groups after the political disaster of Park\u2019s impeachment over a bribery scandal.\n\nHowever, the latest corruption scandal has also led to major demonstrations from the other end of the political spectrum, many of whom participated in the 2016-2017 candlelight protests against Park. They see the investigation into Cho as politically motivated and are calling on the Moon administration to follow through with promised reforms.\n\nThe reforms include more oversight of prosecutors\u2019 investigations, barring overly prolonged or late interrogations, and limiting investigations from spilling over into other probes, according to the Justice Ministry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never been to a protest before last Thursday,\u201d 34-year-old Lee Soo-min, a mother of one from eastern Seoul, told Reuters while attending an opposition rally on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBut I got so angry over what a hypocrite Cho is,\u201d she said while holding a sign calling for Cho to resign. \u201cMoon is not listening to anyone except his supporters.\u201d\n\nDIFFERING VIEWS\n\nThe scandal has broadened into a wider political clash, said Shin Jin-wook, a professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.\n\n\u201cThe Minister Cho and prosecution reform issue became a catalyst for people to take collective action because it overlapped with older issues, such as differing views on national security, the economy, and politics,\u201d Shin said.\n\n\u201cBut because of the diverse views even within each camp, it\u2019s still unclear what direction national opinion will take going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nMoon already faces public discontent over a sluggish economy and stalled diplomacy with North Korea and the Cho scandal has helped keep his approval numbers near historic lows.\n\nHis approval rating stood at 43%, according to a Gallup Korea survey conducted on Oct. 8 and 10.\n\nAnother survey conducted earlier this week by pollster Realmeter put Moon\u2019s approval rating at 42.5 percent, the lowest the firm had registered since Moon became president.\n\nMoon has continued to back Cho and told senior aides on Monday that although \u201cpublic opinion can be divided on political issues, I do not think that means that national opinion is divided\u201d.\n\nCho\u2019s family is facing probes into irregular investments and his children\u2019s\u2019 favorable treatment in university admission.\n\nProsecutors summoned Cho\u2019s wife for questioning for the fourth time on Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\nCho has not denied the allegations against his family members but apologized for disappointing the people and said on Tuesday he was still committed to reforming the prosecutors office.\n\n\u201cI will carry out my duty until the last moment I am in this position,\u201d he told a news briefing.", "description": "A growing corruption scandal over a new justice minister is bringing South Koreans from across the political spectrum out into the streets in numbers rarely seen since candlelight protests helped bring down former leader Park Geun-hye in 2017.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439944870&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B062", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
