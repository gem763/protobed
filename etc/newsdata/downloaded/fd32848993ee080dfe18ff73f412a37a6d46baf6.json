This one-time gadfly of all gadflies moved right into the center of American politics and shifted his party wholesale in his direction.\n\nStill, Sanders\u2019 health crisis \u2014 and it is a crisis, no matter what spin his people may want to put on it \u2014 may mark the first real turning point in the battle over the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe race has been remarkably static throughout 2019, featuring a Joe Biden lead followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in second and third place. This has been true both nationally and in the four crucial early states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina).\n\nThe last few weeks have seen Warren moving upward in the polls and Biden moving slightly downward. This has led to talk of a Warren surge and a Biden collapse, both of which are wild over-characterizations of relatively modest shifts. What we might see now is an end to the modesty.\n\nIt has been said that Biden is running as the key moderate in the race and has benefitted from the fact that Warren and Sanders have been splitting the support of the party\u2019s leftist activists.\n\nIn the RealClearPolitics average, Biden is at 26% nationally \u2014 while Warren and Sanders added together get 41%.\n\nTen days ago, Biden was at 30 with Sanders/Warren adding up to 35, so you can see how the winds have been gently blowing voters away from Biden and mostly toward Warren.\n\nIf Sanders either finds it necessary to end his bid or continues it with his heart problems overshadowing his future, even his most loyal voters will have to look elsewhere. And the RealClearPolitics average puts them at 16.7% of the Democratic electorate.\n\nIt is doubtful they will look first to Biden. He is the establishment guy. Bernie is the anti-establishment guy who made his national bones facing down Hillary Clinton for being a corporatist shill.\n\nHow can Biden look any better in their eyes, especially when he has been explicitly differentiating himself from his party\u2019s leftist candidates by opposing single-payer health care?\n\nNor is there any reason to \u00adbelieve they will be tempted by dark horses like Pete Buttigieg, the one candidate in the lower tier who seems to have any kind of a shot right now in one of the early states. His generally graceful and understated tone is like a negative image of Bernie\u2019s raging passion when he speaks of, well, just about anything.\n\nThe Bernie voters who are with him ideologically really only have one place to turn, and that\u2019s to Elizabeth Warren. She isn\u2019t quite as left-wing as he is, but she is close enough for horseshoes.\n\nNor does she have his weird outsider appeal to disaffected young radicals, given her decades within the Holy of Liberal Holies as a tenured faculty member at the Harvard Law School.\n\nBut even if only 50% of his supporters move into Warren\u2019s camp, it would be enough to propel Warren into a national lead outside the margin of error and give her pride of place in Iowa and New Hampshire both.\n\nBiden\u2019s hope at that point would be African American voters, who prefer him over Warren in massive numbers. Bernie Sanders\u2019 inability to make headway with those voters in 2016 is what kept him from overtaking Clinton and seizing the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe problem for Biden is that at this point in the race, in September 2015, Hillary Clinton was 25 points up on Sanders \u2014 a gap he closed to a single point by April 2016.\n\nRight now, Warren is only 2 points behind Biden nationally. If she makes Sanders-like gains in the next couple of months, she will leave him in the dust, African American voters or no.\n\nBernie Sanders should live to 120 (as long as it isn\u2019t at my Passover seder). But his candidacy may not survive this. And if it doesn\u2019t, the race is Elizabeth Warren\u2019s to lose.\n\njpodhoretz@gmail.com", "description": "Wednesday\u2019s news that Sanders has had to suspend his campaign activities following the \u00adinsertion of two stents into his heart in no way mitigates his \u00adastounding achievement since 2015.", "authors": ["John Podhoretz", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/elizabeth-warren-2020.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"}
