Under the U.S.-brokered cease-fire set to expire mid-day Tuesday, the Kurdish fighters agreed to pull back deeper into Syria and Turkey agreed to stop its assault.\n\nErdogan said Tuesday that 1,300 Syrian Kurdish fighters had yet to vacate a stretch of the border, as required under the deal. But a senior Kurdish official, Redur Khalil, said Monday that his forces were preparing to complete the withdrawal. Khalil also called for an international mechanism to protect Kurdish civilians who want to stay in their towns after the Kurdish fighters leave.\n\nErdogan warned Tuesday that if the Kurdish fighters do not withdraw, \u201cour offensive will continue from where it left off, with a much greater determination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no place for the (Kurdish fighters) in Syria\u2019s future. We hope that with Russia\u2019s cooperation, we will rid the region of separatist terror,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia has stepped into the void left by America's withdrawal, offering to patrol the border region and serve as a buffer between the Kurds and the Turks. The Kurds are hoping Russian and Syrian forces can keep Turkey's military at bay and help them maintain some autonomy in the region they carved out for themselves during Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nPutin is a staunch ally of Syria's brutal president, Bashar al-Assad, who has used chemical weapons to attack his own people amid Syria's horrific civil war.\n\nWhile Erdogan and Putin met in Sochi, a Russian resort town, to discuss the Syrian crisis, the Trump administration continued to send mixed signals about its policy and next steps. Trump has zigzagged between ordering a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, to announcing he would leave a residual force there.\n\nTrump said Monday that a \"small\" number of U.S. troops will remain in Syria, a shift that came amid blistering criticism from lawmakers in both parties who have denounced his previous decision to withdraw American forces.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get out of wars. We may have to get in wars, too,\u201d Trump said during a rambling, 70-minute Cabinet meeting on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump's top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said \"some progress has certainly been made\" to stop the Turkey-Kurdish conflict but conceded that the outcome remained unclear.\n\n\"The success of the outcome there is not yet fully determined,\" Pompeo said during a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nHe did not say what the Trump administration would do to keep the cease-fire in place.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "Amid a U.S. military withdrawal from Syria, the Trump administration's ability to address the Syria crisis seemed dramatically diminished.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/22/USAT/7a98e3ab-647d-4bed-af18-2e6788509749-EPA_epaselect_RUSSIA_TURKEY_DIPLOMACY_SYRIA.JPG?crop=2285,3047,x0,y7&width=2273&height=3047&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
