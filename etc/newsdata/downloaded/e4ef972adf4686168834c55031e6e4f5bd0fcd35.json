Opposing positions have been referred to as an \u201cEast vs. West\u201d conflict of national interests, or as a fight between alleged profit-seekers looking to benefit from \u201csocial dumping\u201d against claimed defenders of transport safety and workers\u2019 rights.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the likely impacts of the mobility package on Europe\u2019s road transport system, and that is exactly what I set out to do. My study is based on three sources: A quantitative analysis of the border-crossing road transport activities across Europe; a thorough review of the ongoing political and legal process; and interviews with executives at 25 leading international truckload service providers from 10 European countries. Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nEurope\u2019s irreplaceable 600,000 trucks\n\nThe European border-crossing road transport industry operates more than 600,000 heavy-duty trucks \u2014 equal to 740,000 international driver jobs (all estimated on a full-time-equivalent basis). On average, each of these trucks moves a 16-ton load every other workday over an average distance of 627 kilometers. That comes to about 300,000 border-crossing full truckload departures every workday, keeping the European Union\u2019s factories running, and supplying 500 million European consumers. In the immediate future at least, these cannot be replaced.\n\nThe divide over driver demand and supply\n\nTwo-thirds of all border-crossing truckloads travel between the EU\u2019s most industrialized and economically mature countries: Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy and the UK. In other words, two-thirds of the work of 740,000 international truck drivers is done inside the red banana-like region illustrated in the graph. However, a very large share of those drivers live in the European periphery.\n\nThis is important because the divide over supply and demand for European drivers is the root cause of disagreements over the mobility package between Europe\u2019s shipper, politicians, media, and, last not least, the road transport operators.\n\nThe road transport system\u2019s two futures\n\nEurope\u2019s road transport system faces two possible futures, depending on what the final Mobility Package I looks like, the study found.\n\nIf the proposals now before the Commission and European Parliament are implemented fully and quickly, industry executives agreed almost unanimously that it would cause extremely undesirable consequences.\n\nFull enforcement of the off-cabin rest regulation, requiring 45-hour rest periods during extended trip cycles, will not be feasible, they said in interviews. It would require tens of thousands of stationary sleeping facilities, like hotels, with safe nearby truck parking spaces \u2014 and they\u2019re just not physically available, and won\u2019t be for years. Drivers will be forced to circumvent the regulation by seeking semi-legal and undesirable substitutes, like putting up container and tent facilities, or using fake addresses for private hosts. Most drivers, the study found, insist they would rather stay in their cabins, which are usually quite well and individually furnished.\n\nTwo-thirds of all border-crossing truckloads travel between the EU\u2019s most industrialized and economically mature countries: Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy and the UK.\n\nProposals to require trucks and drivers to return home within short intervals will add long, inefficient trips for thousands of trucks from the transport demand hotspots to periphery countries, where trucks and drivers live. The current \u201cempty mile\u201d ratio of 16 percent in European border-crossing road transport will increase by at least 5 percent; probably more. Each percentage-point added to the border-crossing truck fleet\u2019s empty-mile ratio requires about 6,000 more trucks, increasing motorway congestion and environmental burdens.\n\nAdditionally, international truck operators from periphery countries will be forced move their operational centers to Central Europe. Drivers\u2019 jobs and incomes will therefore leave the less economically developed periphery countries, where they constitute significant parts of the GDP. Awkward new situations will arise for the families of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of drivers who have to relocate to Central Europe.\n\nBut it\u2019s the proposals on the temporary \u201cposting\u201d of workers that has received some of the most vehement opposition. It will make international \u201ccross-trade\u201d operations \u2013 in which trucks moving freight between countries are not their home countries \u2013 largely unfeasible. But cross-trade operations today constitute one-third of all international transport capacity. So if this capacity is removed rapidly, the European transport system will face dramatic disruptions.\n\nThe removal of undisputed shortcomings in the current system must be based on a full understanding of transport demands and the availability of drivers.\n\nBut what if the scenario that industry experts envisaged plays out, rather than the rapid implementation of the policies now on the table? This scenario accepts the fact that the massive geographical divide in the sector cannot be ignored or regulated away. Instead, the removal of undisputed shortcomings in the current system must be based on a full understanding of transport demands and the availability of drivers.\n\nThen the focus of the political process would be redirected to removing the massive shortages of parking infrastructure for trucks, and of expanding intermodal capacities. Reducing empty mile ratios and underused load capacity would become first priority, rather than forcing them up. The emergence of new grey areas, where regulations in the industry are circumvented, would be avoided by simpler, implementable and enforceable procedures for hiring, educating and paying drivers between all participants in the European road transport system.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nAuthors:\n\nThe above column is sponsor-generated content.
