What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Public Joint Stock Company Kurgan Generation Company (MCX:KGKC) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Kurgan Generation\n\nHow Much Debt Does Kurgan Generation Carry?\n\nAs you can see below, Kurgan Generation had RU\u0440\u0443\u04311.16b of debt at June 2019, down from RU\u0440\u0443\u04311.43b a year prior. However, it does have RU\u0440\u0443\u043172.7m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about RU\u0440\u0443\u04311.09b.\n\nMISX:KGKC Historical Debt, September 15th 2019 More\n\nHow Strong Is Kurgan Generation's Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Kurgan Generation had liabilities of RU\u0440\u0443\u04312.18b due within 12 months and liabilities of RU\u0440\u0443\u04312.90b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of RU\u0440\u0443\u043172.7m as well as receivables valued at RU\u0440\u0443\u04312.38b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling RU\u0440\u0443\u04312.63b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Kurgan Generation is worth RU\u0440\u0443\u04319.06b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nKurgan Generation has net debt of just 0.88 times EBITDA, indicating that it is certainly not a reckless borrower. And this view is supported by the solid interest coverage, with EBIT coming in at 7.5 times the interest expense over the last year. It was also good to see that despite losing money on the EBIT line last year, Kurgan Generation turned things around in the last 12 months, delivering and EBIT of RU\u0440\u0443\u0431848m. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Kurgan Generation will need earnings to service that debt. So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. Click here for an interactive snapshot.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) is backed by free cash flow. In the last year, Kurgan Generation's free cash flow amounted to 35% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.\n\nStory continues", "description": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about.
