Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to partner with a Democrat and prepare a response to whatever Erdogan has planned.\n\nOn Monday morning, Graham had tweeted that Trump's Syria decision was \"a disaster in the making,\" while Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) tweeted \"Congress must make it clear that Turkey will pay a heavy price if they attack the Syrian Kurds.\" Graham then tweeted that he'd talked to Van Hollen about doing just that, announcing that \"we will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey\" and move to remove the country from NATO if it attacks Syria or the Kurds.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham's \"veto-proof\" guarantee probably won't be necessary considering Trump's subsequent and, uh... passionate response.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope and expect sanctions against Turkey \u2013 if necessary \u2013 would be veto-proof.\n\n\n\nThis decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019", "description": "President Trump's promise to pull out of Syria is not going over well.The White House announced Sunday night that the U.S. will \"no longer be in the immediate area\" of northern Syria where Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday a Turkish military incursion was \"imminent", "authors": ["Kathryn Krawczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
