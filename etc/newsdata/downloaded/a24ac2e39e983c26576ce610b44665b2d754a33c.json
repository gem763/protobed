We tell the inside story of the dystopian thriller\n\nImagine a world where babies are stored in life-support jars, humans are stalked by oily ghosts, and the American president is played by Lindsay Wagner, the helter-skelter-haired star of 1970s cult TV show The Bionic Woman. This is the dystopian milieu of Death Stranding, which will hit shops soon, just in time for the hectic Christmas period . In this epic video game, by far the most controversial of 2019, players must traverse a future America to reconnect its \u201cchiral network\u201d (a posh internet), while dodging mysterious BTs (beached things). For reasons unknown, the living and dead coexist, with the protagonist able to connect to the \u201cother side\u201d via a \u201cjar baby\u201d in an artificial womb. One recent demo focused on such gimmicks as urinating to create mushrooms.\n\nWagner is not the only star to feature. Acclaimed video game director Hideo Kojima and his team have also created incredible likenesses of The Walking Dead\u2019s Norman Reedus, who takes on the lead role of delivery man, as well as Mads Mikkelsen and director Guillermo del Toro. Most agreed to perform because they\u2019re fans of Kojima\u2019s work, especially his multimillion-selling Metal Gear Solid series. Wagner took more persuading, though.\n\n\u201cThis year I turned 55 and maybe tomorrow I\u2019m going to be dead,\u201d Kojima said recently. \u201cEvery time I work on a project, I make it like it might be my last. I thought I\u2019d ask Lindsay, as the person I admire the most.\u201d Kojima met Wagner in person and spent more than three hours, punctuated by tears, explaining how Death Stranding wasn\u2019t a traditional violent game.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Star-studded ...

Photograph: Kojima Productions\n\nSince the game was announced in 2016, its plot and gameplay have remained mostly under wraps. The bizarre snippets that have been released have obsessed the web: 7.7 million people have watched Reedus\u2019s protagonist studiously adjust his backpack, while 6 million caught French actor L\u00e9a Seydoux eating a space slug to keep away the \u201ctimefall\u201d (a rain that causes people and plants to rapidly age and die). It all adds up to a remarkable show of faith in Kojima, whose notorious Twitter account oscillates between creative musings and carefully staged pictures of Bento boxes.\n\nWhile Kojima\u2019s fans include Del Toro and Kong: Skull Island director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, many remain unconvinced, irritated by his celebrity posturing and the game\u2019s apparent lack of substance. A notably ill-judged (or possibly mistranslated) tweet recently landed Kojima in trouble for promoting himself \u2013 instead of the hundreds of developers who have worked on the game.\n\nIn his defence, Metal Gear Solid 5 does contain copious credits after each of its 50 missions \u2013 but Kojima has also appeared in his own games as a \u201ccritical VIP\u201d while also being referred to as \u201cGod\u201d. When talking about Death Stranding, he recently proclaimed: \u201cMy mission is to create a genre that does not currently exist, and which takes everyone by surprise.\u201d One of MGS5\u2019s themes is the importance \u2013 and fallibility \u2013 of messianic leadership, which can\u2019t be lost on a perfectionist who finds fault with the texture of a doorknob.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cult figure \u2026 Lindsay Wagner plays the US president. Photograph: Kojima Productions\n\nDeath Stranding\u2019s core theme is connection. \u201cThere are so many things happening in the real world, in America, in Europe,\u201d Kojima said in April at the Tribeca film festival. \u201cEverything is connected by the internet, but we\u2019re not connected in the real world these days. Players will have to reconnect the world in the game. You feel very alone, in solitude \u2013 but you\u2019re trying to connect.\u201d\n\nKojima is an anomaly in the video game industry: a self-styled auteur, obsessed with minutiae and at odds with focus-tested, apolitical, annualised sequels. His influences include Stanley Kubrick, Joy Division, David Bowie, Alien, James Cameron, The Selfish Gene, Nicolas Winding Refn (who also appears in Death Stranding), the moon landings, Kobo Abe \u2026 the list goes on. He is to games what Kanye West is to music: an easily parodied all-or-nothing performance artist who blurs the lines between his public persona, games and reality.\n\nKojima\u2019s work is relentlessly provocative, often outraging fans on release, only for his intentions to be later understood. MGS2 angered many by teasing the return of grizzled badass Solid Snake, then forcing users to play as androgynous J-pop reject Raiden, but its story also explored the politics of data surveillance and information control more than 15 years before the topics became headline news.\n\nOnce you\u2019re tuned into how he operates \u2013 each pre-release trailer, interview, public appearance and tweet feeding a giant guessing game, complete with red herrings \u2013 you start to see connections and conspiracies everywhere. The Metal Gear Solid community\u2019s ability to crowdsource solutions has kept pace with Kojima\u2019s increasingly obtuse meta-puzzles. Fans took less than a day to unlock the secret ending in Kojima\u2019s horror curio PT by deducing \u2013 despite no obvious clues \u2013 that you needed to plug a microphone into the PlayStation 4.\n\nAt its core, Death Stranding is an open-world adventure combining The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u2019s limitless freedom, MGS5\u2019s interlocking upgrade system and Dark Souls\u2019 asynchronous online world. In addition to leaving equipment and warnings for other players, you\u2019ll be able to pool resources, creating bridges to \u201cconnect\u201d the barren world. Some speculate that Death Stranding will be radically transformed by its players\u2019 philanthropy, perhaps evolving into a hi-tech network of roads and cities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riding high \u2026 Death Stranding. Photograph: Kojima Productions\n\nKojima\u2019s hints imply the game\u2019s government organisation Bridges, who want to reconnect the US, aren\u2019t as noble as they seem. Will players be invited to join the game\u2019s terrorist faction, the Homo Demons, to fight for an alternate vision of the greater good? If so, the shared online world would become a battle of competing philosophies.\n\nOthers speculate that Death Stranding is about transhumanism. Or that it\u2019s a video game about video games. (Death Stranding\u2019s stick, rope and ladder might be a metaphor for the evolution of gameplay, an unlikely tribute to Donkey Kong.) Or perhaps it is a walking simulator. \u201cAt the release of my games,\u201d Kojima told Comic Con, \u201cpeople might say, \u2018Ooh\u2019 or praise it, but after five or 10 years, people will start to evaluate what it was about. Same as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Blade Runner. Creativity is so homogenised, generalised and perfumed, and algorithms dictate everything. It becomes important to counter that.\u201d\n\nOn 8 November, we\u2019ll find out if Death Stranding has been playing us all along \u2013 or if the truth is stranded at the point where the guessing ends and the argument begins.", "description": "It\u2019s the most eagerly awaited game of the year \u2013 and it stars everyone from Guillermo del Toro to the Bionic Woman.
