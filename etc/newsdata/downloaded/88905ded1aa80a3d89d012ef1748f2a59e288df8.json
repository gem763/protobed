Sweden has resisted that to some extent, but there are signs that it is also slowing down here,\u201d Holmgren said.\n\n\u201cThat usually spills over to domestic demand. Consumers (get) worried and investments will not increase as much or may even fall,\u201d he said.\n\nThe largest Nordic economy and the fastest-growing each year from 2013 to 2018, Swedish GDP is set to expand by 1.4% in 2019, down from 2.4% last year. That\u2019s the weakest in six years and below a 1.8% forecast in a July survey.\n\nIt would make Sweden the most sluggish of the three countries this year and could remain so in 2020, when growth is expected to slow further, to 1.3%, predictions showed.\n\nIn Norway, growth is likely to drop from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.8% next year as a boom in oil industry investment in recent years is forecast to gradually fade.\n\nDenmark is expected to see a decrease from 1.9% growth in 2019 to 1.5% next year. The economy is close to full employment, Danske Bank\u2019s Olsen said, and the economy had largely run out of spare capacity.", "description": "The Nordic economies of Sweden, Denmark and Norway are cooling off after years of expansion as global trade tensions mix with domestic factors to stifle investment, a Reuters poll found.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
