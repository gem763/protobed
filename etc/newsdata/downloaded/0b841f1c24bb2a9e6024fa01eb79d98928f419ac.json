But we\u2019re in total shock.\u201d\n\nHe said she had made a desperate phone call to her ex-partner, Brian Keenan, on Sunday lunchtime, which led to a 999 call for help.\n\nHer children - Amy, 16, Liam, 11, and seven-year-old Mikayla - lived with her, but were staying with their father at the time to mark the beginning of the October school holidays.\n\nMr McCord said: \u201cShe went through a few tests at Wishaw General and by 11pm doctors said it was safe for her to go home.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the NHS have had major budget and staff cuts but I can\u2019t believe they let her go home.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cShe burst out of an ambulance four times \u2013 she wasn\u2019t fit to be out of hospital.\u201d\n\nBack at home, Ms Maher called her sister Elizabeth Maher - Mr McCord's mum - at about 9am on Monday.\n\nElizabeth and her other sister, Michelle, took turns checking in on Ms Maher throughout the morning to make sure she was okay.\n\nCommunity psychiatric nurses at Lanark Health Centre also called Denise to check on her, it was reported.\n\nBut by mid-afternoon a nurse was unable to get in touch with Ms Maher - her phone rang out for times - and her family was notified.\n\nMr McCord said: \u201cWe live round the corner from Denise so my mum, my girlfriend and I ran round to the house.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, Denise was dead.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible.\u201d\n\nHe has set up a JustGiving page to raise funds to cover Ms Maher's funeral.\n\nNHS Lanarkshire said a full review would be carried out.\n\nMargaret Serrels, service manager for mental health and learning disability services, said: \u201cOur thoughts and sympathies go out to the family at this difficult time.\n\n\u201cWe will carry out a full review in line with the NHS Lanarkshire\u2019s significant adverse event review process.\n\n\u201cAs part of the review process we will contact the patient\u2019s family to give them the opportunity to share their views and raise any questions they have.\n\n\"A copy of the final report will be provided to the family.\u201d \u201cThere are no suspicious circumstances and the Procurator Fiscal has been informed.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
