I was desperate and depressed.\"\n\nThe Slovenian cyclist posted the shots after competing in the CRO Race in Croatia, where he finished 38th while British rider Adam Yates won.\n\nCaptioning the pictures, Janez said: \u201cIt\u2019s only about not f ** it up now.\u201d\n\nFans were stunned by the images, one joking: \"All set for Halloween .\"\n\nAnother asked \u201cDoes that hurt?\u201d and a third said: \"I admire you, I am tipping my hat to your will, desire and love for cycling.\u201d\n\nSports doctor Natasa Desnica said: \"In this sport, this is a normal occurrence.\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n\"I have seen cyclists shortly after three weeks of cycling races in France, Italy and Spain who looked like him.\n\n\u201cTheir legs were incredibly tiny, with no subcutaneous fat, and they were even dehydrated, so every bone could be seen as well as veins, and you could see every single muscle like on an anatomical atlas.\n\n\u201cThe cyclist recovers from this relatively quickly, his appearance normalises, it is only a matter of how such cycles have a lasting effect on health.\u201d", "description": "Janez Brajkovic, 35, posted the shocking images after his comeback event following a 10-month doping ban", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Corbis Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560565.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Janez-Brajkovic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
