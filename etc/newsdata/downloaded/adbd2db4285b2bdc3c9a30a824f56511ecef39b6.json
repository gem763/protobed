Global benchmark Brent crude futures were up 35 cents at $61.89 a barrel by 0846 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate was up 31 cents at $56.83.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz said he did not believe world energy demand had slowed and that the global economic outlook was expected to improve once a trade dispute between the United States and China was resolved.\n\nThe oil ministers of Oman and Iraq earlier told reporters in Abu Dhabi that it was too early to assess whether deeper cuts were required to support oil markets at a time of global recession concerns due to the U.S.-China row.\n\nThe oil minister of Iraq, OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer, said Baghdad was committed to complying with the OPEC-led deal and that his country\u2019s production stood at 4.6 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely committed to respect (the curbs) ... our exports have decreased by at least 150,000 bpd from the south,\u201d Thamer Ghadhban said.\n\nOn Sunday the United Arab Emirates\u2019 energy minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, said OPEC and non-OPEC producers were \u201ccommitted\u201d to achieving oil market balance and that Abu Dhabi would support any consensus decision on further production cuts.\n\nThe OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee, known as JMMC, will meet on Thursday in Abu Dhabi on the sidelines of the energy conference.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's new energy minister said on Monday the world's top oil exporter would keep working with other producers to achieve market balance and that an OPEC-led supply-curbing deal would survive \"with the will of everybody\".", "authors": ["Dahlia Nehme", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
