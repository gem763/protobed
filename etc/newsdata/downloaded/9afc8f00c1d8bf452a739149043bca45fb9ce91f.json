(Provincial Archives of Alberta, A17202b)\n\nThe phone call left veteran investigator Phil Merrill \u201cshocked.\u201d But also, he admits, just a tiny bit exhilarated.\n\nA tipster had phoned the 24-hour hotline to report a sighting of the villain Merrill has spent a career hunting.\n\nThe perp was hiding in a paper recycling plant in Calgary, Alberta. When investigators arrived, they made a surprising discovery: He wasn\u2019t alone. Authorities eventually rounded up all six of the gang.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, Merrill says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a rat with all of the paper.\u201d\n\nPest-control authorities from Washington, D.C., to Wellington, New Zealand, are working to battle growing rat populations. They might want to meet Merrill.\n\nFrom his office in Lethbridge, the loquacious 68-year-old leads Alberta\u2019s much lauded, but never replicated, rat-control program. Key elements: Zero tolerance, free poison, and the Rat Patrol, a team of officers armed with shotguns, defending the Alberta-Saskatchewan border from the small invaders.\n\nNext year, the province celebrates 70 years rat-free.\n\nNow, a caveat: \u201cWhen we say we\u2019re rat-free,\u201d Merrill says, \u201cit means that we don\u2019t have a resident or breeding rat population.\u201d\n\n[The dog is one of the world\u2019s most destructive mammals. Brazil proves it.]\n\nRattus norvegicus \u2014 the brown rat \u2014 is a destructive force in much of the world, wreaking ecological havoc, contaminating crops, vandalizing property and spreading as many as 35 diseases.\n\nThe species arrived in North America aboard the sailing ships of the late 18th century, but Alberta did not worry much about the pest until the summer of 1950. That is when a colony was discovered on its doorstep in the border town of Alsask, Saskatchewan. A hit squad was dispatched, and the infestation was eradicated. But the rats returned.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in the history of Alberta, rats have infiltrated the eastern border of the province to the point of establishing colonies in hamlets and farms,\u201d David Ure, the provincial agriculture minister, warned in a 1951 report.\n\n\n\nThe Rat Patrol near Sibbald, Alberta, in the Rat Control Zone. (Courtesy of Phil Merrill)\n\nOfficials decided they needed to act quickly and ruthlessly to protect their citizens and their crops from the little miscreants.\n\nAlberta is protected by bitterly cold forests to the north, mostly barren land to the south and mountains to the west. The government focused its efforts on the Saskatchewan border to the east, setting up a Rat Control Zone, where armed investigators kept watch for any rat that dared put its paws on Alberta territory \u2014 and snuffed it out.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1953, nearly 70 tons of tracking powder were blown underneath the permanent buildings in the Rat Control Zone. Civilians were required to rat-proof their properties and kill any rats they saw. Authorities provided the poison warfarin free of charge.\n\nBut there was a problem: Most Albertans did not have the faintest clue what their enemy looked like. So officials paraded rat specimens around the province, distributed pamphlets on how to exterminate them and displayed anti-rat posters in post offices, grain elevators and schools.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the rat,\u201d one example reads. \u201cHe\u2019s a menace to HEALTH . . . HOME . . . INDUSTRY . . . KILL HIM!\u201d\n\n[Two percent of the world\u2019s North Atlantic right whales have died in the last two months]\n\nLianne McTavish, an art history professor at the University of Alberta, co-authored an analysis of the posters in 2011. She found that they were modeled after World War II posters that rallied the home front in the war against a common enemy.\n\nIn a 1954 pamphlet, O.S. Longman, the deputy agriculture minister, admonished Albertans who were \u201cproviding the rat with comfortable shelter and plenty of food.\u201d\n\nWithin a decade, the number of infestations began to drop significantly, and Alberta declared victory. But the province is no less attentive, its defenses no less alert. Rats sometimes hitch rides on planes, trains and automobiles, or sneak in on foot.\n\nAnother caveat: Zoos and researchers may keep rats. But they need a special permit from the provincial government.\n\nPet rats? They are illegal. A family new to Calgary learned that lesson the hard way in 2010, when it was forced to surrender Matilda to authorities. She was spared a death sentence when neighboring British Columbia offered her sanctuary.\n\n\n\nRats in Alberta are few and difficult to photograph. Here\u2019s one behind an apartment in Silver Spring, Md. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nMerrill\u2019s team still patrols the Rat Control Zone. They conduct twice-yearly inspections of farms and buildings along an 18-mile wide stretch of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, looking for the telltale signs: droppings, chew marks, tracks.\n\n\u201cSome of the guys like to [shoot the rats] because it\u2019s fun,\u201d Merrill says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably easier to just bait them out.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s 24-hour rat hotline (310-RATS) logs hundreds of false alarms each year. Accordingly, it dedicates a full page on its website to \u201cAnimals Mistaken for Rats\u201d \u2014 pocket gophers, red squirrels and muskrats, to name a few.\n\nThe discovery of a single rat does not trouble Merrill\u2019s team much because it can be trapped or baited fairly easily. But infestations \u2014 two or more rats together \u2014 are cause for real concern. There are a handful each year, and they often garner news coverage here.\n\nMerrill has counted three infestations this year: two along the border that were not dealt with effectively last year, and the one in the Calgary paper recycling plant \u2014 a rarity in a major city.\n\n\u201cWe get a little excited because we don\u2019t get too many,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s fun. But everyone\u2019s on high alert.\u201d\n\nSaskatchewan has its own rat-control program. Richard Wilkins, a specialist with that province\u2019s ministry of agriculture, says Alberta does an \u201cexcellent\u201d job of controlling rats. But he thinks it\u2019s taking some liberties with its definition of rat-free.\n\n\u201cA rat\u2019s a rat,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to blame us for the rat population, we could blame Manitoba, Manitoba could blame Ontario, Ontario could blame Quebec.\n\n\u201cThey have them on the West Coast. They have them on the East Coast. They\u2019re intelligent and adaptive. They can make a home anywhere.\u201d\n\n[Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to a ferocious start]\n\nThere are those who speak for the rats.\n\nTrev Miller, an organizer with the Calgary Animal Rights Effort, says it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d that Alberta remain free of pests. But the rat-control program, he says, is too punishing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe current program is very cruel.\u201d\n\nLisa Hutcheon, president of the Small Animal Rescue Society of British Columbia, says Albertans and soon-to-be-Albertans have contacted her organization a handful of times in the past decade looking for refuge for their pet rats. Some worry that even if they do manage to successfully hide their pet rats from the authorities, they will not be able to get them medical care if they fall ill.\n\nHutcheon says rats are her charity\u2019s most popular pet for adoption. She says Alberta should draw a distinction between wild rats and domesticated rats.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re really affectionate, they love their people and they\u2019re amazing animals. I don\u2019t think a lot of people appreciate them enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmory the rat enjoys some appreciation during a pop-up Rat Cafe at the San Francisco Dungeon in 2017.

Officials set up infrared cameras, bait and unleashed a pair of bull snakes. When that proved futile, they launched \u201cOperation Haystack,\u201d in which they deployed bales of hay laced with poison across the city.\n\n[An oil pipeline expansion is dividing Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples]\n\nAnother caveat: Alberta is not the only jurisdiction in the world that has effectively eradicated rats. South Georgia Island, a British overseas territory, and Macquarie Island, a reserve of the Australian state of Tasmania, have dumped tons of poison in the last decade to snuff out the vermin.\n\nBut there\u2019s something different about Alberta.\n\nWhen McTavish moved to the province, she says, she learned \u201cpretty quickly\u201d about the rats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the provincial identity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the way people understand Alberta.\u201d\n\nThe France-sized province of 4.3 million is said to be the largest jurisdiction in the world to rid itself of the rodent.\n\nMerrill believes the vigilance is worth the effort. The program costs less than $377,000 per year to administer. In 2004, the government-funded Alberta Research Council estimated that it saves more than $31 million in economic and environmental damage.\n\nAlberta benefits from geography. Banishing rats is much more difficult for port cities with large coastlines, which nurture much of what rats like to eat. But Merrill believes it is not impossible to replicate the province\u2019s success.\n\nHe has been intrigued by the Ekomille, a contraption being rolled out in Brooklyn that attracts rats with bait and then drops them through a trap door to drown in an alcoholic substance.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Merrill says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not going to work extremely well, because rats are extremely smart. They\u2019ll watch their friend go in there, splash around a little and die, and then they won\u2019t go in there.\u201d\n\nMerrill plans to retire next year. After a long career fighting the rodents, he says he has \u201crespect\u201d for them.\n\n\u201cI love to talk about rats!\u201d he says. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t hate them, because without them I wouldn\u2019t have a job.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrudeau apologizes again as campaign reels from racist makeup revelations\n\nMonths before Canada\u2019s election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all\n\nAs price of insulin soars, Americans caravan to Canada for lifesaving medicine\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The western province keeps the rodents at bay with zero tolerance, poison and shotguns.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-7FnWcY_eRvYpqpTQCjMKDKNfso=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R64HBDHBF4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
