It actually has been lost,\u201d Butina told Russian state media Saturday.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Butina tried to quietly advance Russian interests in the U.S by infiltrating groups including the National Rifle Association. She has denied spying for Moscow and has previously said that she came to the U.S. seeking to become a \u201cpeace builder\u201d between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nThe Russian government maintained Butina\u2019s innocence upon her return this weekend, outright dismissing the plea she previously entered in D.C. federal court.\n\n\u201cThe partial admission of guilt that Maria was forced to make due to harsh detention conditions and the threat of a long prison term does not negate her total innocence,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \u201cIn actual fact, the Russian national was convicted solely for her active and involved civic stance and her sincere desire to further the restoration of good relations between Russia and the United States.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow fired back on social media, recalling Butina\u2019s guilty plea while subtly contrasting the American and Russian legal systems.\n\n\u201cButina committed a crime. She was arrested, familiarized with the evidence, pleaded guilty and sentenced to serve her sentence. Her allegations of wrongdoing and plea agreements were made public. This is how a fair and open judiciary works,\u201d the U.S. Embassy said on Twitter. \u201cAfter the arrest, Butina had access to evidence against her and access to a lawyer without interference. This is how the rule of law works.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
