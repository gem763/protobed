It\u2019s now seeking $300 million in damages, as reported by Forbes.\n\nThe original complaint, filed in March, accused Peloton of using over 1,000 songs without getting the proper license. At the time, NMPA requested $150 million in damages. After the lawsuit was filed, the offending songs conveniently disappeared, upsetting connected exercise equipment owners who\u2019d gotten used to their beloved playlists.\n\nBut not all the songs disappeared, as reported by The Verge. Here\u2019s what the NMPA now has to say about that:\n\nIndeed, it is only as a result of initial discovery in this lawsuit that the full scope and extent of Peloton\u2019s unlawful infringement has started to come into focus, revealing more than 1,000 additional musical works [...] those newly discovered works include some of the most famous and popular songs ever recorded, such as \u201cGeorgia On My Mind,\u201d \u201cI Can See For Miles\u201d and \u201cI Saw Her Standing There.\u201d\n\nPopular music is core to Peloton\u2019s business model. The company, set to go public later this year, allows people to replicate the experience of being in a fancy workout class without ever leaving their living rooms. If investors agree that the company\u2019s IPO is priced correctly, the brand could be worth as much as $8 billion.\n\nPeloton tells The Hollywood Reporter that the NMPA\u2019s new claims are just grandstanding, though:\n\nNMPA has again revealed its anti-competitive objective in this matter. In March, NMPA requested an expedited trial schedule, to which Peloton readily agreed. On the eve of court-ordered mediation, NMPA sought to alter the optics around its lawsuit by filing exaggerated new claims prior to the mediation while also transparently timing its filing to capitalize on Peloton\u2019s inability to publicly respond in detail during our quiet period... We will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims.\n\nYou can read NMPA\u2019s complete requested amendment below.", "description": "The National Music Publishers\u2019 Association (NMPA) has asked the courts to allow it to double its claims against exercise bike and treadmill startup Peloton, after discovering more unlicensed music \u2014 including songs by Taylor Swift and Kesha \u2014 being used in workout videos that play on the bikes\u2019 built-in screens.
