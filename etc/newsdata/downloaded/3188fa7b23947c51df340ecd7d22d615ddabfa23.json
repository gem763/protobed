Martinez was not included in the squad despite having scored 26 goals in the MLS this season.\n\nMart\u00ednez said he made the decision because of \u201can increasingly deteriorating professional relationship\u201d with Dudamel but said he still hopes to play for the national team again one day.\n\nDudamel has held the coaching job since 2016, and has not commented on Martinez\u2019s announcement.\n\nVenezuela will play Bolivia on Oct. 10 and four days later will face Trinidad and Tobago. Both matches will be in Caracas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atlanta United striker Josef Mart\u00ednez says he will not play for Venezuela's national team as long as Rafael Dudamel is the coach.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/mls_atlanta_united_fc_cincinnati_soccer_24889_c0-93-2240-1399_s1770x1032.jpg?47b0a26dee2651567584ceaa1e80c87bb7da3e53", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
