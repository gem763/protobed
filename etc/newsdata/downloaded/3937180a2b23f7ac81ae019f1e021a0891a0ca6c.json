Iran tensions\n\nTensions are escalating between the U.S. and Iran as the Trump administration accuses Tehran of crippling Saudi Arabia's key oil facilities in a weekend drone attack.\n\nHours after the massive attack, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed the Iranian government, which denied involvement. President Donald Trump initially tweeted that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded\" to respond to Iran if necessary, but has stopped short of directly pointing a finger at the regime.\n\n\"That was a very large attack and it could be met with an attack, many, many times larger, very easily by our country, but we're going to find out who definitively did it first,\" he told reporters at the White House on Monday.\n\n\"It's looking that way,\" President Trump says when asked if if there is evidence that Iran was behind the attack on the Saudi oil facility.\n\n\n\n\"As soon as we find out definitively we'll let you know,\" he adds. https://t.co/LikcIgXaoi pic.twitter.com/ExoKMd4zeO \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 16, 2019\n\nAs the U.S. maintains its maximum pressure campaign against Iran, ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz questions on \"Start Here\" whether the strategy is working.\n\n\"The U.S. really has to take a look at where this has gotten the Americans because so far oil tankers have been attacked, they've shot down a U.S. drone, and now according to the U.S., they're launching missiles and drones at oil facilities,\" she says, adding, \"If there's no response to this, then what do the Iranians think?\"\n\n2. Israel's do-over\n\nEmbattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his job in Israel's do-over election today as he faces a formidable challenge from centrist and rival Benny Gantz.\n\nNetanyahu failed to form a ruling coalition after barely winning his election back in April amid possible corruption charges. In the months since, he's made appeals to his right-wing base to try to secure another victory in today's re-do.\n\n\"Netanyahu had a decade to annex the West Bank, or the Jordan Valley, or settlements,\" ABC News' Jordana Miller says. \"He has traditionally staved off those far-right elements, but this time around he needs them.\"\n\nAmir Cohen/Reuters\n\n3. Autoworkers strike\n\nTens of thousands of General Motors factory workers are on strike, demanding a fair return for what they say were big concessions made during the 2009 auto industry bailout.\n\n\"They forfeited pay, and they forfeited vacation, and they forfeited benefits, and they said when things get better for you, they're going to get better for us,\" the Detroit Free Press' Phoebe Wall Howard tells the podcast.\n\nContract talks between the United Auto Workers and GM resumed on Monday, but negotiations over wages, health care benefits and and more remain at a stalemate.\n\nAfter the union announced the strike over the weekend, GM issued a statement including the offer rejected by the UAW-- $7 billion in investments and more than 5,400 jobs-- and said the company has \"negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency.\"\n\nJake May/The Flint Journal via AP\n\n\"Start Here,\" ABC News' flagship podcast, offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

She gave up alcohol and went sober, realizing that her drinking had gotten out of hand. She was no longer drinking for fun, but rather, to mask the pressures of motherhood.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cInstantly, it made me feel better,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cI had rules because I didn\u2019t want to be irresponsible, so I would drink a lot at home -- wine. Just a glass or two and I feel better. Then, I [would] get the kids again and I would drink like the rest of the bottle and start on another one.\u201d\n\nShe then transformed her blog about drinking into one that chronicled her painful road to recovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that at 37 years old, I\u2019m going to have to relearn how to cope with the difficulties of life: grief and pain and abandonment and loss and the everyday stress that accompanies motherhood,\u201d Harmony Hobbs wrote in a blog post after being sober for 25 days. \u201cMaybe I never knew how to handle those things in the first place, and that\u2019s what landed me in a 12-step program. The \u2018hows\u2019 and \u2018whys\u2019 don\u2019t matter -- I just want to get better.\u201d", "description": "It's Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019.
