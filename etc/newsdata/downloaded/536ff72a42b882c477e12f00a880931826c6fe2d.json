"title": "Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal: Full text of UK-EU agreement", "language": "en", "text": "Boris Johnson today agreed a new Brexit deal with the European Union in a move which keeps alive his hopes of taking Britain out of the bloc by October 31.\n\nNews of the agreement took many people in Westminster by surprise after the DUP said it could not support the Prime Minister's proposed way forward but he went ahead with it anyway.\n\nThe PM's accord was signed off by European leaders in Brussels at a crunch summit this evening, setting the table for a major showdown in the House of Commons this weekend.\n\nMr Johnson will ask MPs to vote for the deal at a special 'Super Saturday' sitting of the House of Commons.\n\nBut his path to victory appears to be fraught with difficulty, especially given the DUP's ardent opposition to the blueprint.\n\nWithout the DUP's 10 MPs, Mr Johnson will face even more of a struggle to secure a Commons majority for his agreement with the fate of Brexit potentially in the hands of Labour backbenchers.\n\nMr Johnson was given a boost after Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, suggested the EU would not grant any further Brexit delays.\n\nThat means MPs are likely to go into Saturday's vote knowing that rejecting the PM's deal could lead to a No Deal split on Halloween.\n\nHere is the deal in full that MPs will be asked to vote on:\n\nPROTOCOL ON IRELAND/NORTHERN IRELAND\n\nThe Union and the United Kingdom, HAVING REGARD to the historic ties and enduring nature of the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom,\n\nRECALLING that the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union presents a significant and unique challenge to the island of Ireland, and reaffirming that the

circumstances on the island of Ireland through a unique solution in order to ensure the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union,\n\nAFFIRMING that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement of 10 April 1998 between the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of Ireland and the other participants in the multi-party negotiations (the \u20181998 Agreement\u2019), which is annexed to the British-Irish Agreement of the same date (the \u2018British-Irish Agreement\u2019), including its subsequent implementation agreements and arrangements, should be protected in all its parts,\n\nRECOGNISING that cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland is a central part of the 1998 Agreement and is essential for achieving reconciliation and the normalisation of relationships on the island of Ireland, and recalling the roles, functions and safeguards of the Northern Ireland Executive, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council (including cross-community provisions), as set out in the 1998 Agreement,\n\nNOTING that Union law has provided a supporting framework for the provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity of the 1998 Agreement,\n\nRECOGNISING that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, by virtue of their Union citizenship, will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits, and that this Protocol should respect and be without prejudice to the rights, opportunities and identity that come with citizenship of the Union for the people of Northern Ireland who choose to assert their right to Irish citizenship, as defined in Annex 2 of the British-Irish Agreement \u2018Declaration on the Provisions of Paragraph (vi) of Article 1 in Relation to Citizenship\u2019,\n\nEMPHASISING that in order to ensure democratic legitimacy, there should be a process to ensure democratic consent in Northern Ireland to the application of Union law under this Protocol,\n\nRECALLING the commitment of the United Kingdom to protect North-South cooperation and its guarantee of avoiding a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls,\n\nNOTING that nothing in this Protocol prevents the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom's internal market,\n\nUNDERLINING the Union's and the United Kingdom's shared aim of avoiding controls at the ports and airports of Northern Ireland, to the extent possible in accordance with applicable legislation and taking into account their respective regulatory regimes as well as the implementation thereof,\n\nRECALLING the commitments of the Union and the United Kingdom reflected in the Joint Report from the negotiators of the European Union and the United Kingdom Government on progress during phase 1 of negotiations under Article 50 TEU on the United Kingdom's orderly withdrawal from the European Union of 8 December 2017,\n\nRECALLING that the Union and the United Kingdom have carried out a mapping exercise which shows that North-South cooperation relies to a significant extent on a common Union legal and policy framework,\n\nNOTING that therefore the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation,\n\nRECALLING that the United Kingdom remains committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South and East-West cooperation across the full range of political, economic, security, societal and agricultural contexts and frameworks for cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies,\n\nACKNOWLEDGING the need for this Protocol to be

Member State or to a third country, and vice versa,\n\nDETERMINED that the application of this Protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland,\n\nUNDERLINING their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern

REGARD to the importance of maintaining the integral place of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom\u2019s internal market, MINDFUL that the rights and obligations of Ireland under the rules of the Union's internal market and customs union must be fully respected,\n\nHAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Withdrawal Agreement:\n\nArticle 1\n\nObjectives\n\n1.

This Protocol respects the essential State functions and territorial integrity of the United Kingdom.\n\n3. This Protocol sets out arrangements necessary to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South cooperation, to avoid a hard border and to protect the 1998 Agreement in all its dimensions.\n\nArticle 2\n\nRights of individuals\n\n1.

If a safeguard measure taken by the Union or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, in accordance with paragraph 1 creates an imbalance between the rights and obligations under this Protocol, the Union or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may take such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Protocol.\n\n3. Safeguard and rebalancing measures taken in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be governed by the procedures set out in Annex 7 to this Protocol.\n\nArticle 17\n\nProtection of financial interests\n\nThe Union and the United Kingdom shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union or the financial interests of the United Kingdom.\n\nArticle 18\n\nDemocratic consent in Northern Ireland 1. Within 2 months before the end of both the initial period and any subsequent period, the United Kingdom shall provide the opportunity for democratic consent in Northern Ireland to the continued application of Articles 5 to 10.\n\n2.

Where the decision reached in a given period had cross-community support, the subsequent period is the 8-year period following that period, for as long as Articles 5 to 10 continue to apply.\n\n6.
