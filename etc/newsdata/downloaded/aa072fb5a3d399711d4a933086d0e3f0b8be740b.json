But the comic I\u2019ve read and reread the most in 2018 has been this wonderfully weird book I bought three years ago. It\u2019s called The Kurdles, by Robert Goodin, and my four-and-a-half-year-old cannot get enough of its 60 pages.\n\nA teddy bear helps a group of misfits who are worried because their house has grown hair and constantly sings sea shanties: this is everything my son wants out of literature.\n\nWe read quite a few comics together (and my eight-and-a-half-year-old daughter has her own favourites), so I\u2019m always struck by how many families don\u2019t share this kind of storytelling with their kids. If you\u2019re new to comics and want to try some with your little ones or pick up some titles for them to read on their own, here are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nYou'll Also Love: Finding The Right Comic For The Right Kid\n\nYou don\u2019t read comics aloud, you perform them\n\nComic books and picture books aren\u2019t the same thing. Sure, they can both have words and pictures sharing a page, but in comics you have to \u201cread\u201d the images as much as you do the text. The images, especially when there are lots of them on a single page, might depict an action or a range of emotions or the passage of time, and there won\u2019t necessarily be a narrator to guide you. It\u2019s a show-don\u2019t-tell approach that can be pretty easy when you\u2019re reading it to yourself, but can be tricky when you\u2019re doing it out loud for an audience.\n\nWhen you share these books with a preschooler, it feels closer to a dramatic performance than a reading. Speaking from experience, a 20-page comic bedtime story takes way longer than a picture book or chapter of the same length.\n\nA good way to feel the difference is by reading something like Canadian John Martz\u2019s Evie and the Truth About Witches, which combines comic and picture-book approaches. When you get to the comic parts, you\u2019ll probably find yourself discussing details or asking questions (\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing now? Is she happy or sad or scared?\u201d). His earlier A Cat Named Tim and Other Stories is another fun read that takes patience; it uses surprisingly complex panels to tell really simple stories. Reading it with my kids involves a lot of pointing and tracing the page to show how things happen.\n\nIt\u2019s really easy to find the right comic for your kids\n\nOnline, you\u2019ll come across lots of best-of lists, reviews and suggestions, but there\u2019s really no substitute for heading down to your local bookstore, library or comic shop and flipping through the pages to see if it might be a good fit.\n\nLast year, I spoke with Christine Rentschler, an expert with Toronto\u2019s The Beguiling \u2014 an internationally lauded comics shop and home to one of the best for-kids sections on the planet \u2014 to get recommendations for finding the right comic for the right kid. Another one to add to that list: one of my favourite comics this year has been The Dragon Slayer by Jaime Hernandez, a collection of three short, simple, forever-rereadable adaptations of Central American folk tales.\n\nComics encourage \u2018traditional\u2019 literacy\n\nThis year, we started reading Raina Telgemeier\u2019s comic adaptations of the Baby-Sitters Club with our daughter. Then she started rereading them on her own, followed by Raina\u2019s other books like Smile, Sisters and Ghosts. It\u2019s also directly led her to diving into the original Ann M. Martin\u2019s Baby-Sitters Club novels, feeling confident with having a visual background of the plot.\n\nIf you want kids to read, let them pick what they read (or what you read to them). Some people question the literary value in reading graphic novels, but clever text is text whether it\u2019s in comics or prose. It fosters a love of reading and builds vocabulary. (I learned more words from DC Comics than dictionaries.) A kid that gets hooked on a manga series with dozens of volumes will be reading a lot of words, even if those words are interspersed by cool drawings.\n\nYou'll Also Love: 10 Super-Fun Books Your Kids Can Interact With\n\nComics help kids become more visually literate\n\nLiteracy goes beyond reading and comprehending written words. Kids who are fluent in comics are also able to interpret and understand other types of information presented as images.\n\nWhether it's restroom signage, Ikea instructions or that red, underlined 100 in a group chat, people need to be able to decode visuals and graphic representations. Simple images can carry lots of meaning \u2014 one of the reasons why Oxford Dictionaries selected the cry/laugh emoji as \u201cword of the year.\u201d Comics encourage readers to quickly decipher images and how they all relate to one another \u2014 a particularly useful skill as language continues to evolve.\n\nComics can encourage not only a love of reading, but an appreciation for art\n\nMy kids are getting better at recognizing different cartoonists and already have a sense of what they like and what they find ugly.\n\nBut the visual component of comics is more than the art itself \u2014 it\u2019s also about how the panels are laid out on a page. Using simple language, we\u2019ve talked about how Luke Pearson\u2019s adventurer Hilda (now a pretty perfect series on Netflix), will use different panel sizes or repetition for effect. It\u2019s probably a bit much to suggest this is the start in a lifelong interest in graphic design or cinematography, but you never know.\n\nMy kids also love to mimic the format of some of my mini comics and zines as a means of expression. Using a simple folding process or sheets of paper and a big stapler, they have created so many of their own comics \u2014 endless inspiration for their stories and imagination.", "description": "I\u2019ve been struck by how many families don\u2019t share this kind of storytelling with their kids.
