Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything\n\nJeet Heer\u2019s recent essay in The Nation argues that the 2020 race has shifted the Democratic Party to the left. This can be seen with the profusion of progressive policy ideas. The policy chops of the leading 2020 Democrats are ostensibly stealing a page from progressive think tanks:\n\nWarren and Sanders have yanked the conversation\u2014and the party\u2014sharply to the left. The upshot has been a Democratic Party that is more willing to argue over radical ideas than any other time since the days of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society. Nor are Sanders and Warren alone. Politicians often deemed moderate such as Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris have joined the policy arms race, with candidates trying to top one another with their competing plans to remake America. Suddenly the political conversation is dominated by ideas like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, student debt relief, free public college, statehood for DC and Puerto Rico, and even Supreme Court expansion. It\u2019s telling that Warren has become a leading contender with the catchphrase \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d Democratic voters seem positively hungry for plans.\n\nHeer is much closer to the pulse of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party than I am, so I\u2019ll take his word for most of the claims in the above paragraph. But it is noteworthy that the policy initiatives discussed by Heer have little to do with foreign affairs. That might be because voters don\u2019t care about foreign policy. Or it might be that on foreign affairs, the story is rather different from the one that Heer portrays.\n\nAs noted multiple times in this space, progressives have taken a much more serious interest in foreign policy than in previous election cycles. As with domestic policy, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been at the forefront of staking out a set of policies that rejects both the neoconservatism of the GOP and the centrist hawkery of Hillary Clinton (Pete Buttigieg has also spoken out on these issues). This has led to some imaginative ideas. But I am not convinced that Democrats are gravitating to where Warren and Sanders sit on foreign policy.\n\nTo understand what I mean, let\u2019s take a gander at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs\u2019 just-released report, \u201cRejecting Retreat.\u201d (Full disclosure: I am on the foreign policy advisory board that consulted with and provided feedback to the survey team.) My Post colleagues Scott Clement and Dan Balz have already written about the survey, as has my fellow opinion writer Max Boot. Here\u2019s a quick video summary:\n\nWhat stands out in particular from the survey data is how gosh-darn keen everyone seems to be about international trade:\n\n\n\nSurvey data from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs reveals increasing enthusiasm for trade among American voters. (Chicago Council on Global Affairs/Chicago Council on Global Affairs)\n\nAs Boot noted in his column, \u201cfor all of Trump\u2019s vilification of U.S. trade partners, overwhelming majorities favor trade with Germany (87 percent), Japan (87 percent) and Mexico (83 percent). Seventy-four percent even support trade with China, despite \u2014 or because of \u2014 Trump\u2019s trade war.\u201d\n\nOne of the drivers of this increased enthusiasm is that Donald Trump\u2019s GOP supporters now equate trade with Trump-approved deals. A deeper dive into the numbers, however, reveals that Democrats are even more keen about trade than Republicans. According to the Chicago Council, \u201cCompared with 2017, larger majorities also see trade deals as benefiting both the United States and other countries (63%, up from 51%), including majorities of Democrats (74%), Independents (59%), and Republicans (54%).\u201d\n\nThis comes through even more clearly in Craig Kafura\u2019s analysis of Sino-American trade: \u201cTariffs divide Americans sharply along party lines: 72 percent of Republicans support, and 71 percent of Democrats oppose, raising tariffs on products imported from China.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see that in chart form!\n\n\n\nA partisan breakdown of public attitudes about tariffs on China, courtesy of the 2019 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey. (Chicago Council on Global Affairs/Chicago Council on Global Affairs)\n\n\n\nA partisan breakdown on U.S. attitudes towards trade with China, courtesy of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs 2019 survey. (Chicago Council on Global Affairs/Chicago Council on Global Affairs)\n\nThe data here is incontrovertible, and jibes with findings from Gallup and other polling outfits: Democrats have shifted toward being very positive about trade with the rest of the world, including China.\n\nOne would think that this shift in public opinion \u2014 a shift that started before Trump, by the way \u2014 would prompt some of the 2020 candidate policy shops to sound more enthusiastic about trade with the rest of the world. This has not happened, however. Instead, we get dreck from Elizabeth Warren that looks about as protectionist as Donald Trump. We get Joe Biden sounding more hawkish toward China than he did a year ago. The best of the lot is Beto O\u2019Rourke, but that is a low bar. For a group of candidates that claim they want to restore America\u2019s standing in the world, they sure do seem reluctant to embrace one of the most obvious and reliable tools in the policy quiver.\n\nWhenever I politely raise this point in online conversation, I am told that Democratic support for trade is shallow, or that the shift is a pure partisan reaction to Trump. Neither explanation is satisfactory. If there is a trend, it is that Democrats are more and not less enthusiastic about trade. If it is a pure partisan reaction, it seems like a smart candidate should weaponize that reaction rather than move in the opposite direction. Instead, Democrats are acting as though there is some trade-based interest group akin to the NRA that will nuke them if they express an iota of enthusiasm about globalization.\n\nThis is usually the moment in a Spoiler Alerts column when I explain what is going on. This time, however, I\u2019ve got nothing. Democrats have grown far more comfortable with international trade than the candidates who want the party nomination. In a field this crowded, some of the leading candidates should gravitate toward that more popular policy position.\n\nThey have not. And I would really like to know why.", "description": "Why are the candidates zigging when most Democrats are zagging on trade?", "authors": ["Daniel W. Drezner", "Daniel W.
