He left us. We were inside. My friend on the other side kept advising us to leave. We believed the firefighter who told us to stay. So we stayed,\u201d Mr Tekle said.\n\n\u201cEvery single minute now, I\u2019m thinking of that. I was desperate at that time. If we were helped properly, he would be here today, and I wouldn\u2019t be telling this story.\u201d\n\nShah Aghlani, whose disabled mother Sakina Afrasehabi and aunt Fatima Afrasehabi perished in the fire, said he did not want individual fire fighfighters who \u201crisked their lives\u201d to be prosecuted, but that \u201ccultural change\u201d was needed within the London Fire Brigade to prevent a repeat of Grenfell.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Seventy people who died were waiting desperately to be rescued. But nobody showed up. The last thing I was hearing from my aunt was, where are the firefighters?\n\n\u201cIt would have been good if the fire brigade came out and put their hands up and accepted responsibility.\"\n\nMr Aghlani's sister Nazanin said said senior officers in the LFB should be prosecuted, arguing that they should be treated as \"professionals not heroes\".\n\nShe added: \"I\u2019m not saying individual firefighters should be. They do a good job, bless them, and they don\u2019t get paid that well. But senior firefighters should be held to account.\n\n\"They need to train firefighters better, but it\u2019s also the attitude and the culture.
