(Tribune Content Agency/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nCritic, Book World\n\nI banned a book. Or at least I helped get it banned, which makes Banned Books Week a little awkward for me this year. Like celebrating Arbor Day by cutting down a tree.\n\nI came to censorship innocently. Almost by accident. Two weeks ago, a reader sent in a photo he took in a Barnes & Noble store in Arlington, Va. It showed a promotion table: \u201cNew Releases in Paperback 20% Off.\u201d There, among copies of \u201cThe Paris Orphan,\u201d \u201cThe Nightjar\u201d and \u201cThe Read Aloud Handbook,\u201d was David Icke\u2019s \u201cThe Trigger: The Lie That Changed the World \u2014 Who Really Did It and Why.\u201d\n\nYou may not recognize the name David Icke if you don\u2019t spend a lot of time slithering around the anti-Semitic corners of the Internet or listening to Alice Walker. Icke is a former British sports commentator who announced in the early 1990s that he is the son of God. Soon after that, he started to sound weird. He\u2019s published more than a dozen \u201cmind-blowing\u201d conspiracy books that explain everything, including how interdimensional reptiles control planet Earth.\n\n\u201cTrigger,\u201d Icke\u2019s new self-published book, is 900 pages of harebrained word-vomit. It claims that the official explanation of the Sept. 11 attacks is a lie to cover up the \u201cmassive and central involvement in 9/11 by Israeli government, military and intelligence operatives.\u201d This is consistent with his claims that the \u201csatanic\u201d Mossad has had its hands in international drug running and the assassination of President Kennedy. Naturally, Icke is also a student of that anti-Semitic classic \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\u201d\n\nGiven that content, I thought it was odd to see Barnes & Noble promoting \u201cThe Trigger,\u201d so I sent a note to B&N\u2019s corporate office asking about it. A day later, a spokesperson told me: \u201cThis book is sold by an independent publishing distributor, and was ordered for a sub-section called \u2018Conspiracies\u2019 in some stores. After being alerted to the content, we are removing the book from all stores.\u201d\n\nNow you can\u2019t even find \u201cThe Trigger\u201d on Barnes & Noble\u2019s website, although plenty of Icke\u2019s other execrable books are still available there.\n\nAsked more broadly about B&N\u2019s selection process involving books by white supremacists, anti-Semites and other hate-fueled activists, the spokesperson added, \u201cWe work to never allow content with hate speech in our stores, and in cases when something slips through, we take quick and resolute action to remove it.\u201d\n\nThat sounds wonderfully decisive, but the more I think about that message, the more I find my First Amendment absolutism chasing its tail.\n\nShould the country\u2019s largest bricks-and-mortar bookstore chain \u201cnever allow content with hate speech\u201d? I expect \u2014 and want \u2014 an indie bookstore to curate its collection of titles carefully. But the idea of a big corporation sending books to the shredder raises different historical precedents. Of course, B&N has every right to carry whichever books it wants, but how will the company determine what is hate speech? And is \u201cquick and resolute\u201d the right way to decide which books should be removed?\n\nThis is not a recent conundrum for Americans. In the 1690s, long before we had a First Amendment, a Boston merchant named Robert Calef dared to publish a book denouncing the witchcraft trials in Salem. Leading clergymen condemned Calef\u2019s \u201cscandalous\u201d book, and bookstores took quick and resolute action to removeth it.\n\nMost of us would say that was a mistake, but the offense against free expression is always obvious when the censored title is one we appreciate. How hard are we willing to fight for the principle of free speech when we think the censored book is abhorrent? It\u2019s the bookstore version of \u201cMust the neo-Nazis be allowed to march through Skokie?\u201d\n\nThis week, as it does every year, the American Library Association is promoting Banned Books Week to raise awareness of threats against our freedom to read whatever we want. Central to that campaign is the annual list of Top 10 Most Challenged Books. The list \u2014 11 this year \u2014 is a collection of beloved titles for children and young adults. Years ago, it contained books such as \u201cHarry Potter\u201d (witchcraft!), \u201cHuck Finn\u201d (language!) and \u201cIn the Night Kitchen\u201d (nudity!). But lately, the list is dominated by books that draw censure for their positive portrayal of LGBTQIA+ relationships, such as David Levithan\u2019s \u201cTwo Boys Kissing.\u201d Bookstores around the country are championing these titles in special Banned Books Week displays. I hope kids read every one of these books, but I can\u2019t help noticing that no liberal tastes were harmed in the making of this list. It costs us nothing to celebrate these banned books. The whole campaign is pungent with self-satisfaction, a chance for us enlightened liberals to remind each other that we are freedom fighters.\n\nWhat, though, of the detestable books \u2014 such as \u201cTrigger\u201d \u2014 removed from stores after someone objects? There will be no nationwide First Amendment protests. Barnes and Nobles will not be picketed by activists waving Fahrenheit 451 flags.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s as it should be. After all, do we really need to put up with freaks like Icke to maintain a free and open exchange of ideas? Can\u2019t intelligent people be trusted to distinguish between books that should be taken seriously and books that should be consigned to the flames? Perhaps my First Amendment anxiety is a luxury afforded only to male WASPs. If my life were being actively threatened by hate speech, I wouldn\u2019t regard it with such legalistic objectivity.\n\nBut it was the First Amendment that allowed once repressed and forbidden voices that we now celebrate to speak in this country. Watering down that principle by reassuring ourselves that we can make righteous judgments about who should be allowed to sell their books might be a dangerous step backward. If we\u2019re not willing to trust the wisdom of crowds, what hope has democracy? Under the rule of corporate blandness policed by a cloud of Furies on social media, we could someday find ourselves browsing shelves entirely sanitized, guaranteed not to offend the sensibilities of any reader.\n\nMaybe the best we can hope for is an uneasy balance of tolerance and abhorrence, while we let the messy marketplace of ideas sort the chaff from the wheat. It would be wonderful if David Icke\u2019s awful books didn\u2019t exist, but they do. And nothing will discredit him more effectively than reading one of them.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.", "description": "Confessions of an accidental censor.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World", "September At Am", "Ron Charles Writes About Books For The Washington Post.
