There were no cars involved. He died because we don\u2019t have a helmet law, and we don\u2019t have a helmet law because of bicycle-advocacy groups like Transportation Alternatives, which oppose this common-sense regulation for fear it will deter cycling.\n\nLicensing provides accountability. Training and helmets save lives. And enforcement of laws promotes compliance. Any cyclist who would be deterred by these conditions is not the kind of cyclist we want on our streets, and any group that opposes such measures is clearly more concerned about promoting cycling than protecting cyclists.\n\nGARY TAUSTINE\n\nNew York\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
