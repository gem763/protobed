Democrats have zeroed in on what appears to be a shadow diplomacy effort, spearheaded by Giuliani, aimed at sparking such investigations and stiff-arming U.S. officials who stood in their way.\n\nIn his opening statement, Anderson plans to say that John Bolton, who served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser until recently, told him during a June meeting that \u201cMr. Giuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement\u201d with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Croft wrote in her opening statement that she heard Trump, both directly and indirectly, \u201cdescribe Ukraine as a corrupt country.\u201d\n\nAnderson plans to describe how Giuliani\u2019s involvement became such an obstacle earlier this year, forcing the State Department to scramble to contain fallout after the abrupt removal of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine whom Trump recalled after a smear campaign by the president\u2019s allies.\n\n\u201cBefore [Zelensky\u2019s] inauguration in May, my colleagues and I saw a tweet by Rudolph Giuliani alleging that President-elect Zelensky was surrounded by enemies of President Trump,\u201d he intends to say, according to his opening statement. \u201cIn an effort to counter the negative narrative sparked by Ambassador Yovanovitch\u2019s withdrawal and Giuliani\u2019s statements, we pushed for a high-level delegation to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration.\u201d\n\nAnderson also intends to tell lawmakers that \u201csenior officials in the White House\u201d blocked the State Department from issuing a statement condemning Russia after Moscow seized Ukrainian ships in November 2018. Instead, Anderson recalls, \u201cAmbassador Volker drafted a tweet condemning Russia\u2019s actions, which I posted to his account.\u201d\n\nCroft, who also served as a Ukraine adviser on the National Security Council, plans to tell investigators that she received \u201cmultiple calls\u201d from Livingston, a lobbyist, who told her that Yovanovitch should be fired. She also intends to say she never met Giuliani but was aware that Volker spoke to him at times.\n\nTrump ousted Yovanovitch in May after Giuliani and others had launched a coordinated effort to undermine her, according to Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony before impeachment investigators earlier this month.\n\n\u201c[Livingston] characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d Croft plans to say. \u201cIt was not clear to me at the time\u2014or now\u2014at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d\n\nLivingston, a former Republican lawmaker, is registered as a foreign agent to represent an association of steel companies that acts as a liaison between the industry and the Ukrainian government. His filing with the Justice Department indicates his work for the association includes maintaining \u201ccontact, as necessary, with members of Congress and their staff, and with executive branch officials.\u201d\n\nTrump later criticized Yovanovitch during his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, according to a White House memorandum of the call, and several other senior State Department officials have told impeachment investigators that they were alarmed by the push to remove Yovanovitch.\n\nCroft plans to testify that she told her supervisor on the National Security Council, Fiona Hill, about the calls from Livingston. Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia aide, told investigators earlier this month that she was so concerned with Giuliani\u2019s involvement that she reported it to an NSC lawyer.\n\nCroft also plans to reveal that she learned of an effort by Trump to withhold military aid to Ukraine \u2014 approved by Congress and the Pentagon \u2014 prior to July 18, when it was officially revealed to agency officials during a video conference.\n\n\u201cThe only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the president,\u201d she said.\n\nMark MacDougall, the lawyer representing Croft and Anderson, said in separate statements that the State Department sought to block his clients\u2019 testimony, adding that both were served with subpoenas to compel their appearance Wednesday morning.\n\nMacDougall also plans to push back against what he characterized as Republican lawmakers\u2019 efforts to identify the whistleblower who first raised concerns about Trump\u2019s posture toward Ukraine.\n\n\u201c[To] the extent we reasonably conclude that any questions directed to [Croft and Anderson] this afternoon are intended to assist anyone in establishing the identity of the Whistleblower, we will make the necessary objections and will give the witness appropriate instructions,\u201d MacDougall says.\n\nUnderscoring the peril of operating in Ukraine at a precarious time in its relationship with the U.S., Anderson intends to tell lawmakers that his work \u201chas at times led to harassment and intimidation by hostile intelligence services, death threats, and other significant challenges for my family and I.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a8/b6/d835c8024685a7d3a79d7f728cdd/191030-catherine-croft-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
