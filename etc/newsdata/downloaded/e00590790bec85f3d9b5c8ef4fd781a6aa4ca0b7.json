Here\u2019s one reason it\u2019s not likely.", "language": "en", "text": "By Wednesday morning, the seas had indeed changed. Rather than abandoning Trump, several dozen House Republicans who are not members of the committees leading the inquiry marched into a secure briefing room and effectively shuttered the investigation for several hours.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this seemingly parallel-universe behavior? Probably the fact that, in many ways, their voters are living in parallel universes when it comes to what they expect of their politicians when it comes to civility and compromise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA new study published Wednesday by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service demonstrates just how angry voters are at lawmakers on the opposite end of the political spectrum. This \u201ccivility poll\u201d sought to find out how much voters of all stripes care about the tenor of today\u2019s politics and whether they want leaders in Washington to reach compromise.\n\nThe top-line result is particularly alarming, with a majority of Americans now believing the nation is on \u201cthe edge of a civil war.\u201d But the research provided plenty of explanation for why a Democrat like Lynch expects \u201ca sea change\u201d and why a Republican like Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) organized the GOP insurrection.\n\nAsk the question one way and it almost looks as if America is a remarkably united nation: 88 percent of voters are \u201cfrustrated by the uncivil and rude behavior\u201d in Washington, 87 percent believe compromise \u201cshould be the goal for political leaders\u201d and 84 percent believe behavior that used to be unacceptable is now \u201cnormal behavior.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut those seemingly unified positions mask the deep division among voters over who deserves the blame for these obviously bad political dynamics.\n\n\u201cWhen offered options on who to blame for this increase in bad behavior, voters retreat to partisan corners and dole out blame in the manner one would expect,\u201d wrote GOP pollsters Ed Goeas and Brian Neinaber of the Tarrance Group, who co-wrote the study with Lake Research Group, a Democratic firm.\n\nAmong Democratic voters, 63 percent say GOP leaders are \u201cvery responsible\u201d for the decline in civility and 86 percent say Trump is \u201cvery responsible.\u201d Only 10 percent of Democratic voters place a large degree of blame at the feet of their party leaders.\n\nAD\n\nAmong Republicans, those numbers are flipped \u2014 67 percent of GOP voters say Democratic leaders are \u201cvery responsible\u201d for the decline in today\u2019s politics, easily the largest culprit among those voters.\n\nAD\n\nIn that undercurrent, that supposed goal of compromise falls completely apart because each party\u2019s base views the other side as the culprit for all that ails America.\n\nWhat about all those voters claiming compromise should be \u201cthe goal\u201d for Washington\u2019s leaders?\n\n\u201cThey also \u2014 in even greater numbers and with more intensity \u2014 decry political leaders for compromising their values and ideals by failing to stand up to \u2018the other side,\u2019\u201d the Democratic pollsters wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAn almost equal number, 84 percent of voters, say they are \u201ctired of leaders compromising my values and my ideals\u201d and want their party\u2019s politicians to \u201cstand up to the other side.\u201d\n\nSo on Monday, during a Cabinet meeting, Trump looked into the TV cameras and told Republicans on Capitol Hill to \u201cget tougher and fight,\u201d and two days later Gaetz and House Republicans barged into Wednesday\u2019s proceedings and argued with Democrats about the process.\n\nAD\n\nThe action had been discussed for several days, but Trump\u2019s declaration served as a clarion call to arms for those GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe Tarrance Group pollsters acknowledge that the president\u2019s constant attacks on his perceived enemies has had his desired effect. GOP voters place the highest blame for the rise in incivility on Democratic leaders and media outlets such as CNN, The Washington Post and the New York Times.\n\nAD\n\nThis sentiment makes it harder and harder for Republicans to ever consider dumping the president. \u201cIt is very challenging for a politician to be both a fighter and a dealmaker. It is even more challenging to try this balancing act when the most successful national politicians in your party show little interest in finding this balance,\u201d Goeas and Neinaber wrote.\n\nDemocrats face their share of problems, too, in terms of an angry base that does not want to see its party leaders breaking bread with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nThe Pew Research Center has studied issues like civility throughout this decade, and last year the study found a sharp drop among Democratic voters looking for compromise. Given a choice between supporting politicians who \u201cmake compromises with people they disagree with\u201d or who \u201cstick to their positions,\u201d 46 percent of Democrats supported the compromiser and 52 percent chose the fighter.\n\nAD\n\nIndependent voters may be the most disaffected of all. In the Georgetown study, they gave equal blame to Democratic and Republican leaders for who is \u201cvery responsible\u201d for the decline in civility. Trump received more blame (51 percent of independents said he was \u201cvery responsible\u201d), but these unaligned voters gave their highest share of blame to social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook for the coarsening of society.\n\nAll of this division has left most members of each party in their respective corners, unwilling to compromise and, among Republicans, unwilling to challenge Trump.\n\nAD\n\nSen. John Cornyn (Tex.), who served 10 years in GOP leadership, took the unique approach Wednesday of declaring that he viewed the House inquiry as illegitimate and would simply not read any testimony about impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not going to \u2014 I do not approve,\u201d said Cornyn, who would serve as a juror in a Senate trial. Asked if that meant he was not going to watch the daily developments, he said, \u201cNo, I am not, or by an hourly basis, or minute by minute.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Compromise took a beating in a new poll that found each party\u2019s base views the other side as the culprit for all that ails America.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uAx0_wEDiWpL2p-3fGuZtogMYfc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N264YGHV2YI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
