But executives have recently been tempering that goal, and David Marcus \u2014 the head of Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary helping to launch the cryptocurrency \u2014 told reporters last week to think of that date as an ambitious goal.\n\n\"We co-wrote a white paper to begin a dialogue with experts and the regulators and policymakers who oversee the stability and security of our financial systems,\" Zuckerberg will say. \"It was never intended to be the final word on the project. The goal was to signal the direction we want to go and to start a conversation about how to get there. That conversation is ongoing.\"\n\nZuckerberg is certain to face a grilling from lawmakers at the hearing, who peppered Marcus with questions and criticisms for hours at a hearing over the summer.\n\nThe tech executive \u2014 who has launched a charm offensive of public appearances in recent weeks \u2014 will defend the Libra project, which was his idea alongside Marcus.\n\n\"The idea behind Libra is that sending money should be as easy and secure as sending a text message,\" Zuckerberg will say.\n\n\"I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we\u2019re not the ideal messenger right now,\" he will add, referring to Facebook. \"We\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I\u2019m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.\"\n\n\"But there\u2019s a reason we care about this,\" he will say. \"Facebook is about putting power in people\u2019s hands.\"\n\nThere are 21 initial members of the Libra Association, the body tasked with overseeing the controversial cryptocurrency.\n\nUpdated at 3:39 p.m.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0is set to\u00a0tell\u00a0House lawmakers\u00a0that he\u00a0would support a delay\u00a0of the company's Libra\u00a0cryptocurrency project until regulators are satisfied.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_041018gn29_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
