When we were potty-training, there was an episode for that. When it was time to give up the pacifier, there was a jingle for that (\u201cBye Bye, Binky\u201d).\n\n\u201cSesame Street\u201d taught our children kindness and sharing. But lately the show has been tackling ever-more mature topics \u2014 with dubious results.\n\nIn 2017, \u201cSesame Street\u201d added a Muppet with autism to teach children about neurological differences. The character, Julia, was very well-received. In August, however, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, the group that helped create the Julia character, cut ties with the show because of its affiliation with a different, more controversial, organization, Autism Speaks. Autism Speaks had previously argued that autism can be cured.\n\nBut while the execution of this storyline may have stumbled, at least the Julia character made sense. Kids should learn that there are all different kinds of people in the world, with different kinds of needs. Teaching children how to deal with those needs is exactly what \u201cSesame Street\u201d is about.\n\nBut the addition of a recent character, a bright green Muppet named Karli, is far less compatible with the show\u2019s target audience and core message.\n\nKarli is a foster child, and in a recent episode, it was revealed that she is in foster care because her mother is seeking treatment for opioid addiction. Karli will meet 10-year-old Salia, a real girl whose parents have also struggled with addiction. Viewers are introduced to Salia\u2019s family, and she tells us, \u201cThey were gone for 60 days. But it felt like 60 years.\u201d Crushing stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s terrible that any child has to learn about addiction at a young age. A child is in foster care or stays with relatives, like Salia did, because her mother is in rehab \u2014 it breaks our collective hearts.\n\nIt\u2019s a devastating story, one that often has no happy ending. It\u2019s hard for adults to hear \u2014 why subject children to it?\n\nsee also Sesame Street's newest Muppet lives in foster care Sesame Street introduced a new character on Monday named Karli...\n\nI\u2019m extremely sensitive to the opioid epidemic. As I wrote in these pages in February, I have had close friends die of overdoses. And I confessed that I want to scare my own children out of ever using drugs: \u201cIt\u2019s poison. You will die. I don\u2019t want to go to your \u00adfuneral and sit in the front row, shaking and shell-shocked like my friend\u2019s mother. I want you to live.\u201d\n\nBut I meant that for when they grow older and learn to understand our fallen world\u2019s darknesses. I talk to my 9-year-old about drugs. I told my 6-year-old about the loss of my friend. I\u2019m not imploring my 3-year-old, who has already aged out of watching \u201cSesame Street,\u201d to lay off drugs. Teens and tweens, meanwhile, don\u2019t watch \u201cSesame Street,\u201d a show meant for preschoolers.\n\nAll a small child will hear is that a character\u2019s mother is gone. That\u2019s pushing fear on kids without the necessary context: Will my mother have to go, too? Will I be left with people I don\u2019t know?\n\nWe keep hanging these serious issues on ever-younger kids, and it\u2019s causing them lasting damage.\n\nLast year, The Washington Post reported that in the \u201cNational Survey of Children\u2019s Health for ages 6 to 17, researchers found a 20 percent increase in diagnoses of anxiety between 2007 and 2012.\u201d\n\nWhen we fail to protect our children from all the scary things they will face in the adult world, it\u2019s no surprise that they experience a spike in adult ailments like anxiety.\n\nLying awake at night worrying about the things that can go wrong \u2014 in your family, in your life, in the world \u2014 should be the province of grown-ups, not toddlers. \u201cSesame Street\u201d has a lot to teach children about how to be good people. It shouldn\u2019t teach them to be grown-ups until they have to be.\n\nTwitter: @Karol", "description": "It\u2019s terrible that any child has to learn about addiction at a young age.
