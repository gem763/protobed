Ghosn says he is innocent.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to investors, customers and of course our workers,\u201d said Saikawa.\n\nBoard member Yasushi Kimura earlier announced that the board had approved Saikawa\u2019s resignation, effective Sept. 16, and a successor would be appointed next month. A search is underway, he added.\n\nCalls for Saikawa\u2019s resignation, which arose after Ghosn\u2019s arrest last year, have grown louder after Saikawa acknowledged last week that he had received dubious payments.\n\nThe income was linked to the stock price of Nissan Motor Co., and he has said his pay got inflated after the date for cashing in was illicitly adjusted. He has said he was unaware of the adjustment.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s board met to look into the allegations against Saikawa, as well as other issues related to Ghosn\u2019s allegations and corporate ethics at the company.\n\nKimura said the income Saikawa had received was confirmed as \u201cnot illegal.\u201d\n\nKimura and three other board members, who all have backgrounds outside the company, said their investigation of the scandal over Ghosn\u2019s arrest found that alleged misconduct by Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a former board member who was also arrested, had caused 35 billion yen ($350 million) in damage to the company.\n\nNissan will seek a repayment of the damages, Kimura said.\n\nThe board said about 10 candidates are being considered for Saikawa\u2019s replacement. They did not identify them, but said outsiders and non-Japanese are on the list. Until a successor is decided, Chief Operating Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi will serve as interim chief, the board said.\n\nSaikawa has not been charged.\n\n\u201cI have been trying to do what needs to be done so that I can pass the baton over as soon as possible,\u201d he told reporters earlier in the day, referring to his willingness to leave his job.\n\nSaikawa has said he didn\u2019t know about the improprieties, promised to return the money and blamed the system he said Ghosn had created at Nissan for the dubious payments.\n\nThe internal investigation found that Saikawa had received 47 million yen ($440,000) in inappropriate extra compensation, according to a board statement released Monday.\n\nGhosn has been charged with falsifying documents on deferred compensation which he had not received. He has also been charged with breach of trust for allegedly funneling company money for personal gain. The investigation listed as examples the use of company jets by his family, use of company money for family vacations and personal gifts and donations to universities.\n\nNissan\u2019s profits and sales have tumbled over the past year. Investors are also worried about Nissan\u2019s relationship with alliance partner Renault SA of France, which owns 43% of Nissan. Ghosn was sent in by Renault to lead Nissan two decades ago.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa tendered his resignation Monday after acknowledging that he had received dubious income and vowed to pass the leadership of the Japanese automaker to a new generation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Yuri Kageyama"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/japan_nissan_12177_c0-122-2905-1815_s1770x1032.jpg?6fc672feac451d46a25a225f572a98bd4988fdc0", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
