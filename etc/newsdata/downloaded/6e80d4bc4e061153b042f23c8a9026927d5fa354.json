A senior Pakistani security source who spoke to AFP over WhatsApp said: \"We (have) nothing to do with this.\"\n\nGulalai Ismail is an international award-winning activist who has championed the rights of Pakistani girls in a deeply patriarchal country.\n\nShe has spoken out against sexual violence and disappearances allegedly carried out by the army in northwestern Pakistan -- a red line for the powerful security establishment which has run the country for much of its history.\n\nFearing for her life, she went on the run for four months before turning up in the United States in September.\n\nShe told AFP during an interview in Washington last month that she feared for her parents, saying they have become socially isolated, with security forces interrogating anyone who so much as texts them.\n\nMehmood tweeted that the couple had \"continuously been harassed by the law enforcement agencies\" through late night raids, surveillance and false cases.\n\nA witness told Ismail her father \"was dragged into the vehicle while being physically tortured & abused\", she tweeted.\n\n\"I knew they wouldn't spare me... but I hadn't imagined them persecuting my elderly parents,\" she added later.\n\nRights watchdogs have long warned of a shrinking space for dissent in Pakistan, one of the most dangerous places in the world for activists and journalists.\n\nThey can face abductions, torture, even killings if they cross red lines that a journalism watchdog last year said had been \"quietly, but effectively\" set by the army.\n\nThat can include social media and online posts.\n\nIn 2016 a controversial law was passed that prohibits posts that are deemed to compromise state security or offend anything from \"the glory of Islam\" to non-defined notions of \"decency and morality\".\n\nActivists have warned previously that it could be abused as a tool of repression.", "description": "Pakistan on Friday confirmed it detained the father of a prominent activist who has fled the country, in an incident that's fueled fears of a clampdown on dissent and sparked condemnation from the United States.  \"Prof. Mohammad Ismail has been detained by the law enforcement authorities in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AQN7iIMow.A7WjfAebV22Q--~B/aD00ODc7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/7767c78a4984a6291a7475a089f41eb1148c0b32.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
