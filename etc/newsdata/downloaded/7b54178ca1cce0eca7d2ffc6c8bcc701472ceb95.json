Senator Elizabeth Warren \u201cappears to have a good shot at winning the Democratic nomination for president\u201d given that she now has moved into second place in the RealClearPolitics.com polling average, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, while polling data show that she is the second-favorite choice of voters who prefer Biden, Calif. Senator Kamala Harris and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, putting her in a good position to \u201cemerge as the consensus candidate\u201d when all is said and done.\n\nThough institutional investors still believe that President Trump will win reelection next year, based on RBC client polling, Calvasina warns that investors should not become overconfident of this scenario.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s far too early to call the outcome of the 2020 election, and expect a close race,\u201d Calvasina wrote. \u201cBut our analysis of the electoral math tells us that investors need to at least consider the possibility that the Democrats will emerge victorious.\u201d\n\nShe points out that the next Democratic nominee would need to win only the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, plus Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Clinton lost by very narrow margins, in order to win the presidency. Democratic Congressional candidates won more votes than their Republican counterparts in each of these states during the 2018 election, while the president has negative approval ratings in those states, she pointed out.\n\nAnd while the Democratic nomination process will formally continue through the summer of next year, 40% of delegates to the nominating convention will be assigned through caucuses and state primaries held in early March of 2020, and two-thirds by the end of March. \u201cIf Warren wins the nomination, we expect most of the pain associated with a White House victory to occur well ahead of Election Day,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe reaction could be severe. \u201cThe combination of a Warren White House and a Democratic Congress would be extremely challenging for stocks from a bottom-up perspective,\u201d Calvasina argued, given the ambition and scope of the senator\u2019s policy prescriptions on everything from banking regulation, to wealth taxes, to Medicare for All. Investors surveyed by RBC see health care, financial and technology stocks as those that would take the biggest hit if Warren is elected and Democrats take back the Senate.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\n\nIf fears of a Warren presidency do, in fact, lead to volatility in equity markets during the first quarter of next year, Calvasina argued that it will be short lived. She argued that even if Democrats take back the White House, regaining the Senate will be more difficult, and a Republican Senate could block many of the more extreme proposals put forward by Senator Warren, like a wealth tax or the institution of Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cMost of the sectors at high risk under a Warren Presidency from a policy perspective (Financials, Energy, Health Care, Industrials) are already deeply undervalued versus the broader market,\u201d Calvasina pointed out.\n\nFurthermore, the stock market has historically performed well when Democrats have had one-part control of Washington, and actually have performed best when a Democrat is in the White House, but control of Congress is split.\n\nRBC Capital Markets\n\n\u201cIn the short-term, stocks don\u2019t respond well to heightened economic policy uncertainty,\u201d she warned. \u201cUltimately we think Corporate America and U.S. equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do.\u201d", "description": "As a Warren nomination looks more likely, expect stock markets to react sooner than later", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS782_warren_ZG_20191007105451.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
