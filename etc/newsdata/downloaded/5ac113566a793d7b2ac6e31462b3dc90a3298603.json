In one exchange Sept. 9, Bill Taylor, a senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told Sondland: \"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nSondland responded: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\"\n\nClick here to read those texts.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today. Ambassador Sondland traveled to Washington from Brussels in order to prepare for his testimony and to be available to answer the Committee's questions,\" Luskin said in his statement.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the Committee's questions fully and truthfully,\" Luskin said.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that the Trump administration made the move to block Sondland from speaking before the Democrat-led committees, which are in the midst of an impeachment probe sparked by Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump in that call asked Zelensky to \"look into\" unsubstantiated allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 Trump's possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 and his son, Hunter.\n\nTrump also asked Zelensky to \"do us a favor though\" and investigate Ukraine's connection to the Russia probe concluded earlier this year by former special counsel, Robert Mueller, after the Ukraine leader said his administration was \"almost ready to buy more [Javelin missiles] from the United States for defense purposes.\"\n\nNeither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment. Spokespersons for the House committees did not immediately provide a response to CNBC's requests for comment.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was expected to address the situation publicly at 9:30 a.m., the time Sondland was scheduled to appear.\n\nRead Luskin's full statement below:", "description": "Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, was directed early Tuesday morning by the State Department not to show up for a deposition.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106169873-1570537916465gettyimages-1166060401.jpeg?v=1570537949", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
