The nation\u2019s largest abortion business was listed as a \u201cHealth and Wellbeing\u201d resource.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing about what a range of Catholics believe, think and so forth, and what the official teaching of the Catholic Church is publicly,\u201d Sundborg said. \u201cWe\u2019re a public Catholic institution, and therefore, that\u2019s why I needed to make that decision.\u201d\n\nSundborg said his decision was made based on the teachings of the Catholic Church that assert human life is sacred and must be protected from conception.\n\n\u201cI made this decision, consistent with my own and other presidents\u2019 previous practice, in my responsibility to publicly represent our university as Catholic and in reflecting the central teaching of the Catholic Church regarding abortion \u2014 specifically as a significant moral issue \u2014 and not any other services provided by Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Sundborg in a letter to the community.\n\nThe Jesuit leader also thanked youth pro-life organization Students for Life of America (SFLA), which sent Sundborg a letter observing the abortion vendor was listed as a student resource.\n\nThe president of Seattle University, Fr. Sundborg, correctly decided to remove Planned Parenthood from the school's website after Students for Life Action brought it to his attention. We are grateful when Catholic universities correct mistakes and stand for the dignity of life. \u2014 Students for Life (@StudentsforLife) October 15, 2019\n\nAccording to the Spectator, Sundborg said the school\u2019s Non- Discrimination Policy states, \u201cAll University policies, practices and procedures are administered in a manner consistent with Seattle University\u2019s Catholic and Jesuit identity and character.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no specific university policy that references Planned Parenthood or abortion, Sundborg said the school has a \u201clong-standing practice\u201d of removing references to the abortion business from the websites of the College of Nursing, the Law School and the College of Arts & Sciences.\n\n\u201cI have to draw the line somewhere,\u201d Sundborg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a judgment. I could have drawn it in a different place, but I drew it there eight years ago \u2026 I just continued so I was consistent with the decision that I made eight years ago.\u201d\n\nCatholic universities should not be promoting Planned Parenthood. \u2014 Students for Life (@StudentsforLife) October 7, 2019\n\nSenior Allie Schiele, a political science and criminal justice major, helped to create a petition that seeks to reverse Sundborg\u2019s decision.\n\nHer group\u2019s goal is for the university to recognize that removal of Planned Parenthood\u2019s name poses an \u201cextreme danger to the welfare\u201d of the students, the Spectator reported.\n\n\u201cIt seems like President Sundborg wants this to go away quickly and wants it to be shut down,\u201d Schiele said. \u201cIt seems like such a small issue, but it\u2019s really not. The fact that he is not being swayed over by what I consider to be a large collective voice of the university is frustrating and makes me more likely to do something about it.\u201d\n\nCommunications department instructor Jim Clune described Sundborg\u2019s decision to remove Planned Parenthood\u2019s name as a breach in trust, noted the Spectator.\n\n\u201cWhen they remove Planned Parenthood from options that women can take advantage of for their own health, it\u2019s a form of censorship, and it\u2019s showing they don\u2019t trust their students,\u201d Clune said. \u201cPeople trust that Seattle University as an institution, stands for social justice, right? And [that it] supports organizations that support vulnerable, underserved and low-income women and as well as their students.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives more than $500 million in federal taxpayer funding. Nevertheless, the abortion giant has been accused of multiple scandals, including Medicaid fraud, allegations of child sex abuse cover-up, and profiting from the harvest and sale of body parts of babies aborted in its clinics.", "description": "The president of Catholic Seattle University removed Planned Parenthood from a list of student healthcare resources, sparking protests.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Seattle-U-President-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
