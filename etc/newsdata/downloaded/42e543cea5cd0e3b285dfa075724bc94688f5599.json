It\u2019s a toxic myth that Sarah Newcomb, director of behavior science at Morningstar, wants to debunk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so used to sacrificing for our children \u2013 sometimes we can even make that a point of pride,\u201d she said recently on Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut if you sacrifice your retirement savings to send your child to college, you\u2019re making a huge mistake.\u201d\n\nParents can miss out on earning tens of thousands of dollars over 20 years if they put their dollars toward their children\u2019s education rather than in their 401(k) or other retirement plans, according to a recent report from Morningstar, an investment analysis firm.\n\nFor instance, if you invest $10,000 at a 6% interest rate, you can build up $42,000 in retirement savings after 20 years. Even an investment of $10,000 at a smaller 4% return rate could more than double in the same time span.\n\nBenjamin Philip, 23, a graduate in engineering from The City College of New York poses for photos with his family at his commencement ceremony.

And unlike for college, there\u2019s no loan you can take out for retirement, Newcomb said.\n\nEmotional trap\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this belief we have that a \u2018good parent\u2019 pays for college,\u201d Newcomb said. \u201cAnd if you believe that, then no financial advice is going to help you because not paying for college means you\u2019re a bad parent.\u201d\n\nBut by succumbing to this emotional trap, parents not only hurt themselves. They could potentially harm their child, too, in the long run.\n\n\u201cYou can burden them now while they\u2019re young and healthy and able to repay [the loans],\u201d Newcomb said. \u201cOr, you can burden them later when you need to move in with them because you didn\u2019t prepare for retirement.\u201d\n\nStill, she acknowledged that parents rightly worry about student loan debt, which has reached a staggering $1.48 trillion and is stifling for many who have taken out loans. Some borrowers report having to delay major life milestones, such as getting married or buying a house because of their education debt.\n\nGraduates of The City College of New York walk to their seats at their commencement ceremony in Manhattan.

To keep loan amounts down, Newcomb also recommended that students work while in school.\n\nShe noted that students who work up to 15 hours a week actually perform better in their studies.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel guilty having your child doing work study,\u201d Newcomb said. \u201cIt can actually increase engagement, increase performance, and increase quality of life.\u201d\n\nDhara is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
