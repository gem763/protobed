The massage therapist from Girrawheen, in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, is convinced that the meaty smells wafting over her back fence are being generated specifically to spite her\u2014apparently as part of some malicious attack on her decision to not eat animals.\n\n\"It's deliberate,\" she told Nine. \"They've put it so I smell fish. All I can smell is fish. I can't enjoy my backyard; I can't go out there.\"\n\nCilla the vegan was so disgruntled by her neighbours\u2019 penchant for grilling seafood outdoors that she took them to the Supreme Court, claiming the odours have affected her quality of life. In a legal saga that\u2019s dragged on for the past two years, Cilla also complained about the smell of cigarette smoke, chairs scraping on concrete, reflective light, and the sounds of children playing basketball. \u201cIt's been devastating, it's been turmoil, it's been unrest, I haven't been able to sleep,\u201d she said. \"It's deliberate. That's what I told the courts: it\u2019s deliberate.\"\n\nBoth the Supreme Court and the Western Australian administrative tribunal threw out Cilla\u2019s complaints. Last month, Supreme court chief justice Peter Quinlan also dismissed her request to appeal the decision, according to The Guardian.\n\n\u201cMs Carden was given a fair opportunity to present her case, and the learned tribunal member conducted the proceedings fairly and appropriately,\u201d the judgment said. In an official statement, one neighbour further noted that \u201cMs Carden\u2019s demands were proven to be not reasonable and indeed were to the detriment of the other owners\u2019 ability to enjoy their lots in a reasonable and acceptable manner.\u201d Another neighbour said that he removed his barbecue from his backyard following her complaints.\n\nCilla is considering further potential legal action.\n\nFollow Gavin on Twitter or Instagram", "description": "\"All I can smell is fish,\" said the Australian massage therapist, who is convinced her neighbours are grilling meats just to spite her.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f18e4fffff30008de1933/lede/1567563754071-pjimage-2019-09-04T122222532.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
