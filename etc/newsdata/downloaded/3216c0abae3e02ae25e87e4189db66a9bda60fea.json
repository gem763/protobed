As Lydecker points out, when you\u2019re not snuggled beneath it, a throw can instantly add texture or color to a room just by being draped across a chair. Plus, she adds that \u201ca throw blanket is also the perfect gift, as you can never have too many, and they are so versatile.\u201d To help you find the perfect throws for cozying up, zhuzhing up your space, or both, we asked Lydecker and 17 other cool people \u2014 from interior designers to artists \u2014 for their favorites. Read on for their picks, which suit practically every home-d\u00e9cor style and include cashmere, wool, and faux-fur options.\n\nFaux-fur throw blankets\n\nCB2 Premium Grey Faux Fur Throw Faux-fur blankets work well in many spaces, and make especially great picks in the colder fall and winter months. According to Alessandra Wood, director of style at Modsy, \u201cThey\u2019re luxurious and a great way to stay warm in the cold months while adding a \u2018winter wonderland\u2019 feel to a space.\u201d They\u2019re also more affordable (and less ethically complicated) than blankets made from actual fur, but often just as cozy (and cozy-looking) as the real deal. \u201cThey add instant warmth and elegance to any space,\u201d says Decorist creative director Jessica McCarthy. For a comfy pick at a relatively approachable price point, few styles beat this extra-large throw from CB2. As Lydecker says, \u201csize is super important. Remember to stay within the range of 50 to 70 inches, so it\u2019s large enough to snuggle up in.\u201d This throw blanket\u2019s gray shade should work with most rooms\u2019 d\u00e9cor schemes, and its rich, textured layers make it look much more expensive than it actually is. $169 at CB2 Buy\n\nWest Elm Faux Fur Brushed Tips Throw $69 (was $99, now 30% off) For a less-expensive faux-fur option, Sean Juneja, the founder and CEO of D\u00e9cor Aid, likes this West Elm throw that he says is \u201cinexpensive, easy to maintain, has a great look, and is ultrasoft.\u201d He adds that his company\u2019s designers often order these throws by the dozen for their clients. Molly Schoneveld, president of the Storied Group, also likes the West Elm faux-fur throws, noting they can make great gifts. \u201cI think it looks and feels luxurious, but the best part is that with a throw like this, you don\u2019t have to worry so much about matching someone\u2019s d\u00e9cor. They can store this away and pull it out when they want to snuggle on the sofa,\u201d she explains. $69 at West Elm Buy\n\nWool throw blankets\n\n\n\n\n\nPendleton Washable Wool Blanket The faux-fur look isn\u2019t for everyone, and those in the market for something less opulent-looking might consider a wool throw \u2014 especially one from a heritage brand with a legacy of quality. Oregon-based Pendleton has been family-owned for six generations, and producing wool products in the Pacific Northwest since 1863. \u201cPendleton is a classic that has been around for a very long time, and for good reason,\u201d says stylist Emily Henderson. \u201cTheir plaid patterns are timeless and will never go out of style.\u201d The brand\u2019s ecofriendly wool is also machine washable \u2014 a very nice plus for something timeless that you\u2019ll always want out on display. From $149 at Amazon Buy From $149 at Amazon Buy\n\nSchoolhouse Tangerine Fringed Throw For a less-expensive all-wool option, designer Grant K. Gibson loves this fringed tangerine number that he says will add a bold \u201csplash of color\u201d to your interior. He adds that, for just $99, \u201cit has the look of being much more expensive.\u201d $99 at Schoolhouse Buy\n\nFaribault Woolen Mill Trapper Wool Throw, Gray, Natural Based in Minnesota, Faribault Woolen Mill is another company with an impressive history, according to McCarthy, who told us she \u201cloves a classic Faribault wool blanket.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s the type of blanket that is crafted to last for generations and still made today in an old historic factory.\u201d Faribault has been making blankets, scarves, and more since 1892; this one has a small amount of cotton blended into the wool to keep it from feeling itchy. $200 at Burke Decor Buy\n\nFaux Mohair Grid Throw Blanket While it\u2019s technically made of faux wool, Modsy designer Irah Price says this under-$25 blanket is an easy and inexpensive way to add a rustic touch to a living space or bedroom. \u201cI love the deep autumn colors of navy and gold,\u201d he says. Plus, he notes the faux wool is still \u201cincredibly soft,\u201d and stresses that \u201cyou can\u2019t beat the price.\u201d $24 at Target Buy\n\nCashmere throw blankets\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams Sonoma Home Solid Cashmere Throw, Smokey Amethyst $239 (was $299, now 20% off) For something truly luxurious to throw over yourself or your furniture, cashmere blankets are hard to beat. As Wood says, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love the soft luxury of a cashmere sweater?\u201d She recommends this fringe-trimmed Williams Sonoma throw that comes in a slew of colors \u2014 more than 25 by our count \u2014 with her favorite being \u201csmokey amethyst,\u201d because she says it will add a glam touch to your room year-round. $239 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nAlt for Living Cashmere Throws Christine Gachot, the co-founder of design firm Gachot, is also a fan of adorning a couch with cashmere. Her favorite cashmere throw is from Alt for Living, which makes its blankets in custom colors, ranging from mustard yellow to sky blue. The bespoke service makes it even easier to match the throws to your space \u2014 or, as she points out, to someone else\u2019s. \u201cHow chic to give a beautiful blanket as a gift with a color chosen by you,\u201d Gachot says. $395 at Alt for Living Buy\n\nBen Soleimani Ribbed Cashmere Throw \u201cThe soft cashmere of these throws makes you want to curl up with a book all day long,\u201d says Grant, who adds that the ribbing brings unexpected \u201ctexture and a layer to a space.\u201d In addition to ivory, these supersoft blankets come in other subtle neutrals, including a light gray and charcoal. $295 at Ben Soleimani Buy\n\nVelvet throw blanket\n\nOpalhouse Velvet Tufted Stitch Quilt A throw made from velvet is another way to add a touch of decadence to a room, according to Price, who says, \u201cI always love a good, rich velvet fabric.\u201d His favorite velvet throw is a reasonably priced tufted number that \u201chas some really beautiful options for color,\u201d including bronze, blush, and teal. $70 at Target Buy\n\nLinen throw blanket\n\nCitt\u00e1 Design Linen Throw $135 (was $169, now 20% off) Linen, on the other hand, is a great option if you\u2019re looking for something crisp and clean (though it may not keep you as warm as other throws on this list). According to Lia-Belle King, the creative director and co-founder of Worn Store, New Zealand\u2013based textile brand Citt\u00e1 Design \u201cdoes the best home textiles made from natural fibers, and is my absolute favorite.\u201d King notes that the colors Citt\u00e1 Design uses in its products are among the things she loves about the brand, and this linen blanket\u2019s orange trim is a nice and subtle contrast to its plum body. \u201cTheir colors are always vibrant and rich,\u201d she explains, adding that \u201cthe quality of their products is premium, and everything has an element of luxury without being precious.\u201d $135 at Citt\u00e1 Design Buy\n\nKnit throw blankets\n\n\n\n\n\nLane and Mae Merino Wool Blanket For a blanket that\u2019s just as cozy as your favorite sweater, many of the cool people we talked to suggest a woven throw. \u201cChunky knit blankets are like a giant sweater for your sofa,\u201d says Wood. Designer Nick Olsen loves this option from Lane and Mae: \u201cI love the massive knit on a neutral sofa.\u201d Plus, the weave gives these luxe throws a special, handmade feel. In addition to the white, gray, and graphite colors shown, the blanket also comes in blue, fawn, and blush. $598 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPine Cone Hill Chunky Knit Throw A slightly less chunky \u2014 and far less expensive \u2014 option is this Pine Cone Hill knit blanket, which comes recommended by Wood, who notes that \u201cPine Cone Hill\u2019s blankets are 100 percent wool for extra warmth.\u201d $188 at Pine Cone Hill Buy\n\nTexturableDecor Knot Wool Blanket \u201cWith throws and blankets, look for natural colors that add a lot of texture to a room,\u201d advises interior design duo Porter and Hollister Hovey. Their other design tip is to source from international Etsy sellers, like the Montevideo-based shop TexturableDecor, which sells handwoven Uruguayan textiles. Buying from retailers like this gives you access to handmade goods that are really \u201crare and special,\u201d the Hoveys explain. They call the seller\u2019s knot blanket an absolute favorite. From $390 at Etsy Buy\n\nPatterned throw blankets\n\nFern Living Mirage Throws If you\u2019re looking for something more graphic than any of the plaid or bold-colored options above, consider a blanket sporting a subtle pattern or abstract print. Among the latter is this reversible cotton blanket by Fern Living \u2014 a favorite of designer Jenny J. Norris \u2014 with soft, geometric forms on either side. \u201cSo on-trend and very cool,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement, certainly more unique than your traditional throw blanket.\u201d The highly stylized look, she adds, \u201cmakes it an especially fun gift to give and receive.\u201d $179 at 2Modern Buy\n\nTactile Home Horizon Throw \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of artist Kenesha Sneed, and this throw is a beautiful way to bring her iconic artwork into the home,\u201d says designer and author Justina Blakeney. The cotton throw is woven in North Carolina, and features a graphic desert scene in a modern color palette. $210 at Tactile Home Buy\n\n54Kibo Gabi Ethiopian Throw Blanket $140 (was $175, now 20% off) Ceramic textile artist Malene Barnett is another \u201cfan of handmade textiles,\u201d and pointed us to this throw with a contrasting geometric pattern that is hand-spun and loomed by local artisans in Ethiopia. Aside from loving it\u2019s made-by-hand nature, Barnett appreciates that the blanket is \u201clightweight and has a minimalist design.\u201d $140 at 54Kibo Buy\n\nZara Home Two-Tone Blanket With a slightly more restrained pattern, this color-blocked number recommended by Norris \u201cis perfectly earthy, which feels appropriate when autumn kicks in,\u201d she says. $119 at Zara Buy\n\nWilliams Sonoma Home Cashmere and Wool Equestrian Throw $319 (was $399, now 20% off) If you covet an Herm\u00e8s blanket but shudder at the cost, Schoneveld says this cashmere-and-wool Williams Sonoma throw has \u201ca similar feel, but for a fraction of the price.\u201d $319 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nCrate and Barrel Carreno Multicolored Throw For a blanket as colorful as it is cozy, Wood suggests this throw from Crate and Barrel, which she says is \u201cperfect for family rooms or spaces where you cuddle up to watch television, since this soft and textured throw adds layers of comfort.\u201d $90 at Crate and Barrel Buy\n\nEider & Ivory Brampt Herringbone Throw Our cool people also mentioned herringbone-patterned throws as timeless options that suit a wide range of tastes. According to Lydecker, \u201cA tailored herringbone pattern with fringed ends always blends seamlessly with one\u2019s existing d\u00e9cor.\u201d At just more than $100, this cozy, cotton-blend blanket is her favorite reasonably priced herringbone throw. In addition to this light sky-blue color, you can get the blanket in soft yellow, bright blue, or traditional shades like charcoal or coffee brown. $94 at Wayfair Buy\n\nFells Andes Sill Throw Charcoal Homepolish interior designer Amy Courtney agrees that \u201cyou can never go wrong with a classic herringbone throw.\u201d Her pick is this ultraluxe version with a slightly more subtle pattern that\u2019s made from Peruvian baby alpaca wool and comes with its own leather carrying strap. $395 at Fells Andes Buy\n\n\u201cPom-pom\u201d throw blankets\n\nJayson Home Pom Stripe Wool Blanket Lots of the stylish folks we talked to say that \u201cpom-pom\u201d or Moroccan-style blankets are a great way to add both texture and a touch of bohemian flair to your space (though they may not be as warm as some other options on this list). \u201cI just returned from a trip to Morocco and wanted to buy everything with pom-poms,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cI love the strips and chunky weave of this blanket, which would look great at the foot of a bed or draped over a sofa.\u201d $295 at Jayson Home Buy\n\nAmber Interiors Moroccan Bendaoud Throw For a throw that is equal parts laid-back and sophisticated, Schoneveld loves this handmade Moroccan blanket that she says would be \u201cperfect for giving your bed that chic layered look.\u201d $295 at Amber Interiors Buy\n\nMistana Symonds Block Print Cotton Throw A less-expensive pom-pom option is this embroidered piece that \u201ceffortlessly ties together pattern, comfort, and color into one cozy package,\u201d according to Modsy designer Megan Huffman. She notes that while the throw is \u201csubtle enough for any room or style,\u201d it still adds a \u201cperfect pop of color\u201d that will complement any aesthetic, from mid-century modern to traditional. $140 at Wayfair Buy\n\nQuilt-style throw blankets\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch Thompson Street Studio Indigo Tile Quilt \u201cI didn\u2019t think that I was a quilt person until this stopped me in my tracks,\u201d says Gibson. According to the brand, the blanket\u2019s design was \u201cinspired by a trip through Portugal and North Africa while reading the book Chatting With Henri Matisse, the Lost 1941 Interview.\u201d Each of the Indigo Tile Quilts is made with more than 100 pieces of recycled cotton and linen remnants. $700 at March Buy\n\nCalvin Klein Vintage Eight-Point Star Throw Blanket This eight-point star throw provides the same dose of Americana as the quilted blanket above, but at a far more palatable price point. It came recommended by Olsen, who says it also serves as a \u201cnice memento\u201d to Raf Simons\u2019s tenure at Calvin Klein. $99 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
