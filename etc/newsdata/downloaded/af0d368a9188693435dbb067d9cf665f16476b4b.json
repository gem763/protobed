There have been major advances in treatment and, following a series of more recent discoveries, we believe we can stop MS.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a point where we know what\u2019s causing the disease to progress.\n\nIn people with MS, a protective substance that surrounds your nerves \u2013 called myelin \u2013 becomes damaged, which makes it harder for messages to get received, causing problems with how a person walks, moves, eats and thinks. Without this protective coating nerve cells become vulnerable, and once a nerve cell is lost, this causes disability.\n\nFinding treatments that can regenerate myelin has eluded scientists for decades \u2013 it has been the major missing piece of the MS treatment puzzle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UK is a world leader in this kind of research and we now know that it is possible to repair it. We have teams of researchers focused on understanding why the repair process breaks down and finding ways to kick-start it again.\n\nJust last week, new research in Cell Stem Cell revealed a new route through which we may be able to enhance myelin repair with a common diabetes drug. Years of hard work and research from dedicated scientists have gone in to making this possible, and this outcome shows what a significant time we\u2019re living in.\n\nFinding treatments that protect nerves is the second missing piece of our jigsaw and clinical trials of potential treatments are already underway.\n\nFinding these new treatments to protect nerves and repair the coating that surrounds them will help us slow or stop MS progressing, and will mean people don\u2019t have to worry about one day relying on a wheelchair, or losing their independence.\n\nResearchers are using their increasing knowledge of nerves to design new ways to keep them alive and healthy. These include clearing up \u2018debris\u2019 left over from myelin attacks, energising nerves, and improving transport of important molecules in the nerves.\n\nAlthough research has brought us to a critical point, and we believe we can stop MS, funding research and clinical trials is very expensive \u2013 and there\u2019s lots more work to do before we get to where we need to be.\n\nI have the privilege of leading the Scientific Steering Committee of the International Progressive MS Alliance, which brings together MS charities, scientists and people affected by MS to drive forward research like the above, and ultimately accelerate the development of new treatments in progressive MS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve also been personally involved in exploring the mechanisms underpinning progression, using imaging to determine what happens to people with progressive MS.\n\nThe shape of treatment has changed dramatically over my career. However, there are still so many people with MS who don\u2019t have any treatment because those that do exist only work on damage caused by the immune system. They don\u2019t stop the slow burn of MS progression, which ultimately causes disability.\n\nFinding these new treatments to protect nerves and repair the coating that surrounds them will help us slow or stop MS progressing, and will mean people don\u2019t have to worry about one day relying on a wheelchair, or losing their independence. I can now say confidently that the future will look very different for people living with this condition.\n\nFor the first time, the international research community is aligned on what needs to be done and, with a dramatic increase in investment, we could genuinely change people\u2019s lives.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re working on now, and it\u2019s never been a more exciting time.\n\nThe MS Society\u2019s Stop MS Appeal needs to raise \u00a3100 million to find treatments for everyone living with MS.
