That never happened.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite her protestations, Khloe is convinced that Kris did orchestrate the awkward incident and shared her suspicions.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018The only reason I feel like my mum did disclose my whereabouts is because how would Lamar know where I was going at 5:30 in the morning,\u2019 Khloe questioned.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think my mum realises the severity of the emotional distress Lamar was on during that time. I think she just kind of retreated and got nervous to admit that she potentially put me in harm\u2019s way.\u2019\n\nKris admitted to Scott Disick that she feared Khloe was \u2018literally going to like, come for her\u2019, to which the reality star later replied: \u2018Guess what? I am.\u2019\n\nSince that uncomfortable incident, Khloe and Lamar have found themselves in the same Hollywood spot seemingly by coincidence.\n\nMost recently, the pair were seen partying separately at Hyde in West Hollywood earlier this month, risking another awkward encounter. Khloe was enjoying the night with her younger sister Kylie Jenner, while Lamar was accompanied by his new girlfriend Sabrina Parr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Lamar has revealed that he was dating actress Taraji P Henson when he \u2018fell in love\u2019 with Khloe but was too \u2018immature\u2019 to end his romance with Taraji the right way.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
