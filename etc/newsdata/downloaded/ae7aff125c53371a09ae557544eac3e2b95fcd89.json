The research could promote innovation and development of basic science, he said.\n\nSolving the scientific problems involving human survival on the moon could lay a foundation for human beings to go further into deep space, Chen added.", "description": "China is carrying out in-depth demonstration and long-term planning for its manned lunar exploration, and has formed an overall consensus and a preliminary plan, according to a senior space engineer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db68692a310cf3e97a33a04.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
