Most aren\u2019t great.", "language": "en", "text": "For Trump\u2019s experienced defenders, the president\u2019s solicitation of electoral aid from a foreign country, the possibility that he leveraged government resources to solicit that aid and his administration\u2019s alleged effort to hide that solicitation poses a new and evolving challenge. Over the past week, they\u2019ve had to follow Trump\u2019s shifting explanations as information came out. (Remember when Trump claimed that he was just looking to combat corruption?) With the past two days\u2019 document releases \u2014 the rough transcript of a call with Ukraine\u2019s president and a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower \u2014 his defenders have been operating on quickly shifting the terrain.\n\nWith that in mind, we decided to evaluate those arguments. How effective have Trump\u2019s team and his defenders been at repelling the looming allegations?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe answer, in short, is: not terribly.\n\nJoe Biden did it, too.\n\nWhile the rest of this article focuses on recently emerging defenses, it\u2019s worth lifting up one of the central, ongoing claims made by Trump and his team: Former vice president Joe Biden was the one who acted inappropriately.\n\nThe assertion here is that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor in December 2015 because the prosecutor was investigating a company who had hired Biden\u2019s son Hunter as a board member. Biden even bragged about withholding aid to Ukraine in early 2018 at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBy now, though, this has been shown to be an inaccurate depiction of what happened. The prosecutor at the time, Viktor Shokin, was broadly and publicly criticized for not acting on corruption cases \u2014 including criticism from other members of the U.S. government. It\u2019s not clear there was an investigation at that point into the company for which Hunter Biden worked, much less one targeting Hunter Biden. There\u2019s been no evidence to emerge tying Joe Biden\u2019s request to a defense of Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump first made this argument in an interview with Fox News on May 19. Interestingly, that was apparently before his administration decided to withhold aid intended for Ukraine that was still on track to be delivered as of May 23. By July, the aid was on hold, and it was still on hold when Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on July 25.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is that Trump is accusing Biden of doing what he himself stands accused of doing: withholding aid or perhaps an in-person meeting until Zelensky signed on to an investigation of Biden. What Biden actually did, by all accounts, is what Trump claims he himself did: took an action to push back on corruption.\n\nDemocratic senators did it, too.\n\nA Washington Post opinion piece by columnist Marc Thiessen pointed to a letter sent by three Democratic senators last year which, Thiessen suggested, demonstrated the sort of attempted arm-twisting of which Trump stood accused.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[I]n May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake,\u201d he wrote. \u201c \u2026 So, it\u2019s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it\u2019s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?\u201d\n\nThiessen\u2019s argument was quickly lifted up as an example of Democratic hypocrisy. There are a few large differences between the two situations, though.\n\nThe first is that the threat Thiessen\u2019s column (and subsequent defensive tweets) identifies the Democrats making is at best indirect. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s a big difference between three senators in the minority party threatening to curtail aid and the president of the United States actually doing it. Zelensky and Ukrainian officials are almost certainly aware that Trump has a lot more leverage over their fates than do three senators.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the intent of the purported threats is quite different. It\u2019s not investigate Trump versus investigate Hunter Biden, as Thiessen has it. The Democrats were responding to a report in the New York Times suggesting that Ukraine was curtailing its assistance in former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe in order not to offend the Trump administration. In other words, it\u2019s senators pushing Ukraine not to stonewall an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Justice Department.\n\nWhat Trump wanted was more basic. He wanted dirt on Joe Biden. The beneficiary of tearing down Biden \u2014 Trump \u2014 is quite different than the beneficiaries of a robust Mueller probe. The senators weren\u2019t asking for a probe of Trump; they were asking that a probe of Trump and his team not be hindered. Trump was asking for a probe of the Bidens.\n\nThe media isn\u2019t quoting the rough transcript properly.\n\nThe rough transcript of that July 25 call includes a number of tantalizing and suggestive passages. One that attracted a great deal of attention was Trump\u2019s responding to Zelensky\u2019s mention of possibly seeking military aid by saying, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d Another was his subsequent mention of Biden:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nTrump allies disparaged outlets that linked the two. After all, the specific favor Trump was mentioning wasn\u2019t that probe of Biden. The favor was an investigation into Ukraine\u2019s role in the hacking of Democratic National Committee\u2019s server in 2016 (a role that doesn\u2019t exist). Between the two were Zelensky\u2019s reply (solicitous), Trump objecting to the firing of a prosecutor (presumably Shokin) and Trump praising his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani.\n\nIt\u2019s inaccurate to say that Trump directly asked Zelensky for the favor of investigating Biden. But it\u2019s accurate to say that Trump asked for a favor and also asked for an investigation of Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle distinction.\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower didn\u2019t observe things firsthand.\n\nEven before the release of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint on Thursday, Trump allies were pointing to reports that the whistleblower hadn\u2019t observed the July 25 call firsthand. After it was released, that argument became a primary point of objection.\n\nAD\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example, was asked about the complaint on Thursday. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to read the whole thing, he said, but \u201cif I understand it right, it\u2019s from someone who had secondhand knowledge.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s largely true. The whistleblower notes that the information about the call is secondhand and in other places points to information shared with him or her or to public reporting to build out his case.\n\nAD\n\nAs a general rule, it\u2019s worth considering secondhand sources with more skepticism. In this case, though, a primary focus of the whistleblower\u2019s information \u2014 that call \u2014 has been made public. What the transcript of the call shows is that the whistleblower\u2019s presentation in the complaint is largely accurate. It\u2019s unfair, then, to dismiss the entire document out-of-hand for being indirectly sourced.\n\nAD\n\nOne effort to diminish the complaint tried to cast doubt on it by noting, among other things, that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint referred to a mention of \u201cservers,\u201d plural, instead of the one server mentioned in the rough transcript. Such discrepancies are hardly disqualifying, of course \u2014 and may in fact reflect that the whistleblower was hearing from people listening to the call live, not reading the rough transcript.\n\nLiddle\u2019 Adam Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had second hand information, \u201cis credible.\u201d How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019\n\nThe whistleblower and their lawyers are biased.\n\nAllies of the president have alleged an apparent political bias on the part of the whistleblower (whose identity remains unknown). It was, in fact, one of the considerations taken into account by the inspector general for the office of the director of national intelligence in evaluating the complaint\u2019s credibility.\n\nAD\n\nThat, after all, is the key question. If the complaint is credible, then bias doesn\u2019t matter. If your sworn enemy robs a bank and you have proof, should the police dismiss your evidence simply because it\u2019s your sworn enemy?\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of the whistleblower complaint, the inspector general specifically decided that the credibility of the complaint outweighed concerns of bias.\n\n\u201cAlthough the ICIG\u2019s preliminary review found \u2018some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u2019\u201d an Office of Legal Counsel evaluation states, \u201cthe ICIG concluded that the complaint\u2019s allegations nonetheless appeared credible.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies also targeted the whistleblower\u2019s attorney.\n\nWow! \u201cUkraine Whistleblower\u2019s lead attorney donated to Biden.\u201d @FreeBeacon \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nAs others have pointed out, Trump himself donated to Biden in 2001.\n\nThe whistleblower and their sources are equivalent to spies.\n\nAt an event on Thursday morning, Trump used remarkably aggressive language to disparage the whistleblower and the people who spoke with them.\n\n\u201cBasically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call \u2014 heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell they saw \u2014 they\u2019re almost a spy,\u201d Trump said according to audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Eli Stokols.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower used the defined legal process to raise concerns about the president\u2019s behavior. It was Trump himself who decided to release the rough transcript and the complaint after keeping them out of Congress\u2019s hands for weeks. The whistleblower didn\u2019t leak information, as far as is known; nor did that person share information with any foreign power. Those who spoke with the whistleblower were expressing concerns to a peer.\n\nIf those are the actions of spies, then in the opinion of the president anyone who legally shares any derogatory information about Trump is a spy deserving of the punishment once meted out to spies \u2014 death.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is wary about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine because one of the 24 foreign policy advisers he had on his 2012 campaign joined the board of the company for which Hunter Biden was working six months after Biden left.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. thinks this makes sense (per a tweet), and the Trump campaign\u2019s rapid-response shop soon retweeted it.\n\nThis one we will allow you to evaluate yourself.", "description": "A look at how Trump's allies are trying to get his back.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Zc4XWh6f3lHJZ3XTNKb7UdcejNE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECZ7DBWW64I6RA4EXTCUSL7PJE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
