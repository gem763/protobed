It has two large bedrooms and a third that could be used as a home office.\n\nThere is a living room off the kitchen that has a damaged ceiling, cracks in the walls and scratches on the floors.\n\nThe kitchen is probably most in need of a renovation with a massive crack down the entire side of one wall, while the other walls are covered in dirt and the wooden roof needs replacing.\n\nAt the rear is a courtyard that also has a storage room and laundry, plus an outdoor toilet. This is the only toilet, with a bathroom inside only having a bath tub and shower.\n\nNo. 25 Pine St is the third home to come up for sale on Pine St this year. The property across the street at no. 22 sold in June for $2.75 million, according to CoreLogic.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE LATEST NSW REAL ESTATE NEWSLETTER", "description": "Buyers searching for something unusual should look no further than this inner west semi that not only needs a lot of work, but also has no indoor toilet.", "authors": ["Matt Bell"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/25000255/capi_a5e28da01dbe585aa8abd1c9e2010e98_9648b50177c30f4212a28d2ffb7107f1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
