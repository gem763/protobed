They decided not to pick it up.\n\n'Look, we're you know, meeting with people and seeing if there's another place that makes sense for it to go. Because I would like to continue doing it. We would all like to figure out a way to continue to make [it].\n\n'It's kinda wild because you know we've only been doing the show for like a relatively short period of time, you know. Like five months, six months now.\n\n'And in that time I feel like we've been able to accomplish so much, creatively, and you know, I guess culturally.\n\n'And I'm so proud of all of the things that we've done, like that we've been able to do and I feel like the show is really successful in that way. You know.'", "description": "The actress, 40, put on a leggy display as she showed off her bronzed pins in a gorgeous floral print black dress with a thigh-split.", "authors": ["Harry Howard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/08/19527854-0-image-a-27_1570693278635.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
