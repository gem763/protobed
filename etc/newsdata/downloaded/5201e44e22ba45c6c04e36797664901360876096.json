He must be reminded that he is not above the law.\"", "description": "A legal challenge will examine whether Boris Johnson could be jailed if he pushes through a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1639F/production/_109093019_tv056223637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
