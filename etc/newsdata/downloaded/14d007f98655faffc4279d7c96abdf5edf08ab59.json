As Toews drove to the net, the puck deflected in off his left leg to give Chicago (2-2-1) its second straight win.\n\n\u201cIt felt better coming off my shin pads,\u201d Toews said. \u201cPretty good feeling, for sure.\u201d\n\nAlex DeBrincat tied it at 2 with a power-play goal midway through the third period. Drake Caggiula also scored for Chicago, and Kane finished with two assists.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois scored his third goal in four games for the Blue Jackets, and Markus Nutivaara connected early in the third. Columbus (3-3-1) outskated Chicago for much of the night and outshot the Blackhawks 39-33.\n\nBut Toews, Chicago\u2019s captain, collected his franchise-leading 13th overtime goal.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things we know we can do better, but for us to hang in there and find a way to tie things up and give ourselves a chance in overtime,\u201d Toews said. \u201cGot to find a way to win those games, can\u2019t let them slip, sometimes you get two points.\u201d\n\nLehner\u2019s effort - and first win with Chicago - was part of the equation. So was killing all four Columbus power plays.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s also a positive that we found a way to win anyway,\u201d Chicago coach Jeremy Colliton said. \u201cI thought the penalty kill was excellent. (Lehner) made some big saves those time they had us under pressure.\u201d\n\nMerzlikins blocked 30 shots in his second NHL start. The 25-year-old Latvian was tagged for seven goals on 40 shots by Pittsburgh in his debut on Oct. 5.\n\n\u201cI came to the rink with the mindset I was going to win my first game,\u201d Merzlikins said. \u201cThe team helped me a lot. Huge blocked shots in front of me. Thank them for that.\u201d\n\nThe Blackhawks led 1-0 after the first period on Caggiula\u2019s first goal of the season, despite being outplayed for much of the frame.\n\nThe Blue Jackets dominated early and Lehner came up with several tough saves to keep it scoreless. He stopped Riley Nash and Alexander Wennberg from close range in the opening minutes.\n\nColumbus was outshooting Chicago 12-4 when Caggiula connected with 4:25 left in the period from the top of the left circle. Caggiula faked a pass, then fired a shot that deflected off defenseman Ryan Murray\u2019s stick, sailed over Merzlikins\u2019 glove and clanked in off the intersection of the crossbar and right post.\n\nThe Blackhawks failed to score during a 5-on-3 power play during the final 1:06 of the first.\n\nDubois tied it 5:33 into the second when he battled past Chicago defenseman Connor Murphy and cut in alone. After drawing Lehner out of the net and down to the ice, Dubois fired into the upper right corner of the net.\n\nNutivaara put Columbus ahead 2-1 at 2:55 of the third. Lehner got a glove on Nutivaara\u2019s first shot from right wing, but couldn\u2019t control the rebound. Nutivaara skated to the net and pitched the rebound past Lehner\u2019s left shoulder for this second goal.\n\nDeBrincat tied it during a power play at 8:08. He fired in a one-timer from the left circle off Kane\u2019s cross-ice feed.\n\nNOTES: After the game, the Blackhawks recalled forward Kirby Dach, the third overall pick in the 2019 draft, from his conditioning assignment with Rockford of the AHL. \u2026 Tennis great Billie Jean King participated in a fire-the-puck contest between the second and third period and scored a goal. \u2026 Columbus F Josh Anderson missed his fifth game with an upper-body injury. \u2026 Merzlikins is the fourth Latvian goalie in NHL history and played the past six seasons for HC Lugano of the Swiss national league. \u2026 Former Blackhawks C Dave Bolland, who played on Chicago\u2019s 2010 and 2013 Stanley Cup teams, was honored in a \u201cOne More Shift\u201d pregame ceremony. Bolland scored the winning goal in Game 6 of the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals at Boston that gave Chicago the championship.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jackets: Host the New York Islanders on Saturday.\n\nBlackhawks: Host Washington on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonathan Toews got his first goal of the season when he was in the right place at the right time Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/blue_jackets_blackhawks_hockey_79878_c0-117-2811-1756_s1200x700.jpg?d255d7b5bf18954f65861cce79dc56f476b456be", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
