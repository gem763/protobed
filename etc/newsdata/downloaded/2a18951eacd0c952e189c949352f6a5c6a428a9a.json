I was panicking.\"\n\nShe added: \"I still wasn't sure that help was on its way.\"\n\nClaire was sitting with her son in the backseat when a paramedic arrived and took over, followed by an air ambulance and the police.\n\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nHe was placed in an induced coma on the road before being flown to Sheffield Children's Hospital in an air ambulance and taken straight to theatre for brain surgery.\n\nClaire and her partner Mark Szalmer arrived soon after.\n\n\"A doctor spoke to us and said they couldn't give us any guarantees, I just went into shock,\" Claire said.\n\n\"I didn't know what to do. It wasn't sinking in.\"\n\nAfter coming out of surgery Bradley, who is now 17, was placed on a life support machine and the family agonised over whether or not he would survive.\n\n\"It was such a traumatic time, I couldn't stop blaming myself and asking whether I should have made the car journey that I did,\" Claire said.\n\n\"I'll never stop asking myself those questions.\"\n\nAfter nine days in hospital the family were overjoyed when Bradley finally woke up, although it was just the beginning of a long recovery process.\n\nHe spent a month in hospital and, after being discharged, he had to relearn many basic skills like reading and writing, which he had lost as a result of the head injury.\n\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nAlthough Bradley's rehabilitation still continues today, Claire says he is \"almost back to his best\".\n\nThe 17-year-old said: \"I don't remember anything about the crash, I blacked out.\n\n\"The first thing I remember was waking up in the hospital with wires everywhere.\n\n\"I had to ask my family what had happened because I didn't know.\n\n(Image: Claire Duke / SWNS)\n\n\"I was scared but really thankful to be alive.\"\n\nHe added: \"I feel very lucky, if it wasn't for the technology in the car and the doctors in the hospital, I wouldn't be here today.\n\n\"It's amazing what the technology can do. Nobody knew the car had that feature.\"\n\nA BMW spokesman said when the airbags are set off in an accident, BMW will call the car via its onboard SIM card.\n\nIf it gets no reply from the passengers, emergency services are deployed to the crash scene immediately.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"We are so delighted that Bradley and Claire are fit and well after their awful crash.\"\n\nBradley has since taken part in a fundraising drive to raise over \u00a3500,000 for a helipad at Sheffield Children's Hospital, which is where he was flown to and treated after the crash.", "description": "Bradley Duke, 14, was minutes from death after cracking his head when his mum's car slid on black ice in Sheffield - but was saved by paramedics after the car dialled 999", "authors": ["Image", "Tom Maddick", "Swns", "Claire Duke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571917.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_BMW_CALL_201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
