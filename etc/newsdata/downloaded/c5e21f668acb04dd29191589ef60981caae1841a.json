(MPL.LN) rose in early trade Monday after the company said it has won a contract with a joint venture between Tata Group and Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. (047040.SE).\n\nThe contract is expected to generate revenue of more than 5.5 million pounds ($6.8 million) over a 40-month period starting April 2020, the U.K. port and logistics company said.
