Orangutans are on the brink of extinction in Indonesia because hundreds of them are slaughtered every year for profits, Boon-Mee however was just tranquilized.\n\nUK-based charity International Animal Rescue reached the spot and found not only the starving Boon-Mee, but three other orangutans.\n\nIAR official Lis Key reportedly said,\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see the appalling state of these animals as their habitat is razed for the palm oil industry \u2013 they were weak from hunger. It\u2019s a small comfort that this time rather than chase them off or kill them, the \u00adcompany did the right thing and \u00adcontacted us.\u201d\n\nPress People\n\nShe further continued, \u201cDespite the condition they were in, they really are the lucky ones. The worst thing is there are hundreds of orang-utans who won\u2019t be so lucky because of the awful conditions they are forced to try to survive in.\u201d\n\nAccording IAR, palm oil is the primary reason for deforestation.\n\nApparently in Indonesia, palm oil is used in most of the processed foods and is now also being used as a bio-fuel and is also a key ingredient in shampoo and other cosmetics. Talking about alternatives Lis said, \u201cThere are plenty of alternatives to it but none is as cheap.\u201d\n\nYou must surely remember this video from Greenpeace Canada?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it alright to drive an entire species to extinction because the alternatives are not \u2018as cheap\u2019? The image of the orangutan clinging to whatever was left of its home represents all the helpless wildlife, unable to protect their spaces owing to human \u2018development\u2019.", "description": "Even as public is becoming more and more aware of the harms of deforestation, authorities in power appear to be unbothered by the adverse effects it can have over the environment and the wildlife.
