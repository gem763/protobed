(Reuters)\n\nNASA astronaut Anne McClain was accused last week of what may be the first crime committed in space.\n\nFormer Air Force intelligence officer Summer Worden filed an identify-theft report with the Federal Trade Commission, alleging McClain, her estranged wife, accessed her bank account without permission from the International Space Station, where she is stationed on a six-month mission.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, McClain admitted to logging into the account from space, but claimed it was routine and blamed the allegations on the couple\u2019s bitter separation and ongoing custody battle.\n\nThe incident is still being investigated, but it raised questions about how the law applies in space.\n\nThe International Space Station is governed by a treaty called the Intergovernmental Agreement on Space Station Cooperation, signed by all five entities involved in the ISS \u2014 Russia, Japan, Europe, Canada and the United States. When a crime is committed on the ISS, it states that the country whose national was involved has criminal jurisdiction, unless people from other countries were affected.\n\nBecause McClain\u2019s actions \u2014 whether criminal or not \u2014 affected only U.S. citizens, it falls entirely under U.S. law.\n\nBut what if the crime involved a civilian staying in a space hotel and, instead of going into a computer, she stole another guest\u2019s watch, whose laws would apply then? In the soon-to-be era of space tourism and routine travel, criminal jurisdiction is just one of many complex legal issues arising.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of space law, how it affects our day-to-day lives, and several things you wouldn\u2019t have known space law experts are thinking about.\n\nReally, we\u2019re dependent on space.\n\nWhen we think of space, we think of rovers going to Mars and Apollo landings. We don\u2019t think about the mundane, everyday things: telecommunication, transmission of information, GPS location services and tracking transponders in the air and sea.\n\n\u201cWe take it for granted. We think of the milestones,\u201d said Andrea Harrington, associate professor at the Air Command and Staff College at Air University, but we use space every day. (Her views do not reflect the position of the Air Force or U.S. government.)\n\nTelecommunication, GPS navigation and timing technology satellites are in space. Without them, financial institutions wouldn\u2019t be able to function. People wouldn\u2019t be able to make banking transactions or withdraw money from ATMs. We would lose any space-based weather forecasting and satellite-based television and Internet. Travel by air and sea transponders would be down; Instagram wouldn\u2019t work on some phones; and there would be no Sirius XM radio. Some hospital systems need satellite integration to function, too.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster, Harrington said that multiple countries with remote-sensing satellites \u2014 including the U.S., Japan, South Africa, Russia and the European Union \u2014 are part of a disaster charter. Whomever had a satellite passing over the disaster-ridden region before, after and during the event has agreed to share data to mitigate damage, saving lives and property.\n\nYes, space law is a thing. (And it doesn\u2019t involve real estate or aliens.)\n\nSpace law is a collection of domestic and international agreements and guidelines that govern issues like space exploration, military and weapons use, and liability for damage. It also involves other fields of law, from criminal, commercial and insurance law to property and environmental law.\n\nThere are four space-related treaties that the U.S. is a party to: the Outer Space Treaty, the Liability Convention, the Registration Convention and the Return and Rescue Agreement.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty \u2014 or as some call it, \u201cthe Magna Carta of Space\u201d \u2014 is a 50-year-old agreement that outlines how to peacefully explore space.\n\n\u201cAll space-faring states are parties to the Outer Space Treaty,\u201d Charles Stotler, associate director of the University of Mississippi\u2019s air and space law program told The Washington Post. It includes 109 nations, with more joining regularly.\n\nThe U.N.-approved document is the foundation of international space law. Its guiding principle is that space exploration should be a peaceful initiative and all nations should have free access to space. The Outer Space Treaty covers things like how to hold nations responsible for their space actions and rules to avoid polluting our solar system. It also addresses fair use of outer space and prohibits any nation from \u201cappropriation of outer space, including celestial bodies.\u201d\n\nHow to interpret that clause has become contentious as the commercialization of space expands. Stotler said that countries have differing interpretations \u2014 to some, it means no country can own territory in space, but others have applied it to ownership of anything, including extracted resources, absent an international agreement.\n\nThe Registration Convention requires registration with the United Nations before sending something to space and the Liability Convention states that a nation is liable for damage if its space object harms someone else\u2019s. Under the Return and Rescue Agreement, if a party stumbles upon an astronaut in need, it must rescue him or her.\n\nMilitarization of space\n\nAfter more than three decades enmeshed in space law, Jakhu warned of several other issues that have become increasingly dangerous: the militarization of space, exploitation of natural resources and space debris.\n\n\u201cThe biggest changes have been the development of technology and business and the militarization of space,\u201d Ram Jakhu, former director of the Institute of Air and Space Law, told The Post in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cThe problems have increased significantly but the law has not kept pace with that.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump announced the establishment of the U.S. military\u2019s Space Command. Jakhu explained that, like the U.S., Russia and China are building space forces, and \u201conce you have a dedicated force, you\u2019re preparing for war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are issues with lack of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are going to be worse in the future because the number of actors and activities will increase \u2014 and they should increase. Space offers tremendous benefits. We just need to keep up with the technology.\u201d\n\nArticle 4 of the Outer Space Treaty addresses military use. It says that the moon and other celestial bodies must be used \u201cexclusively for peaceful purposes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harrington, the language doesn\u2019t inherently prohibit military activity.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is that most space objects are dual-use,\u201d she said. Anything that can closely approach another space object, like the space shuttle sent to service the Hubble, also has the potential to be used as a weapon.\n\nThe \u201cpeaceful purposes\u201d limitation doesn\u2019t apply to deep space activity, she said. There, the bar is exclusively on nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. There\u2019s no prohibition on things like setting up military bases, conducting weapons testing, or bringing weapons into space, so long as they aren\u2019t weapons of mass destruction and comply with other Outer Space Treaty requirements.\n\nSpace debris\n\nAnother major concern voiced by many experts in the field was the increase in space debris.\n\nThese pieces of left-behind, man-made objects lead to in-orbit collisions. They can be as large as a motorcycle and as small as a tool lost by an astronaut, and move around at fatal speeds, threatening people, space stations, and satellites that impact global commerce, commercial and military missions.\n\nDebris, which will multiply as the exploration and uses of space increase, has been created accidentally and deliberately. Every collision, breakup or fragmentation creates additional debris.\n\nFor example, China launched a missile to strike down one of its aging satellites in 2007; the collision caused thousands of new pieces of debris.\n\nIf debris causes damage or loss of life on the earth\u2019s surface, the liability is on the launching state, said Matthew Schaefer, co-director of University of Nebraska College of Law\u2019s Space, Cyber and Telecommunications program. But if the harm happens in space, he explained, it becomes murkier.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s in outer space, it\u2019s a fault-based standard,\u201d which is difficult to assess, Schaefer said. (Among other things, the debris\u2019 origin would need to be known and it would need to be big enough to track.)\n\nAs of March, there were 2,062 satellites orbiting Earth, more than 40 percent of which belonged to the United States. The nation\u2019s overwhelming dependency on its space assets places it at a greater risk of space debris \u2014 deliberate or accidental.\n\nA look into the future\n\nThere\u2019s a commercial burst underway due to new technology, lower-cost access to space, and new business models, Schaefer said, and as traditional space activities are revolutionized, new and complex legal issues crop up.\n\nAlthough the Outer Space Treaty says no nation may appropriate territory anywhere in space, it\u2019s silent to individuals and corporate entities.\n\nCompanies are already building models for space hotels, and soon we\u2019re going to have commercial entities landing on and mining the moon. Space travel and tourism create a pressing need for legislation to ensure that private companies comply with the minimal OST obligations, Schaefer said, adding that liability issues will become particularly relevant as suborbital flights begin in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nChina is planning to put the first space-based solar-power satellite into orbit and Harrington said the FCC has received applications for thousands of new satellites for utilities like space-based Internet services.\n\nAnd then others, like Michelle Hanlon, associate director of the University of Mississippi School of Law\u2019s air and space law program, are debating what human rights are needed in space.\n\nThe population of humans in space is going to continue to grow, Hanlon told The Post.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Declaration of Human Rights that says humans have a right to oxygen or right to an open line of communication back to earth,\u201d she said. \u201cThings have to evolve to protect humans in space.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nCompanies in the Cosmos: The new space race\n\nA secretive space drone just broke its own orbit record, and almost no one knows what it\u2019s doing\n\nAnother front in the tensions between the U.S. and China: Space\n\nSpacewalking astronauts add parking spot to space station", "description": "Human presence in space is growing, and so is the strange and varied field of space law.", "authors": ["Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Deanna Paul Covers National", "Breaking News For The Washington Post.
