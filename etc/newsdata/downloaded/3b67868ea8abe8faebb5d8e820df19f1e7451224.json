Kavanaugh probed both the government and Malvo\u2019s advocate, appearing to suggest the high court must clarify how the subsequent cases impacting the punishment of youth should be applied by the lower courts.\n\nThe Democratic-appointed justices remained united in their quizzing of the state and federal government, stressing rulings from the past decade mandate a juvenile defendant\u2019s age must be considered during his or her sentencing.\n\n\u201cYouth matters,\u201d said Justice Elena Kagan.\n\n\u201cThe jury had only two choices: death or life without parole,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.\n\nDanielle Spinelli, Malvo\u2019s attorney, urged the justices to grant her client a new sentencing hearing, arguing subsequent Supreme Court precedent dictates a juvenile shouldn\u2019t be sentenced to life in prison without parole in violation of the 8th Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nShe pointed to a 2012 ruling where the high court held the sentencing of juvenile homicide offenders to life in prison without parole ran afoul of the Constitution. And in 2016, the justices applied their 2012 ruling to a separate case involving a man who was sentenced to life without parole in Louisiana for a crime committed when he was 17.\n\nIn that ruling, the court said only \u201c\u2018the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\u2019\u201d may be sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole.\n\nSince Malvo was sentenced before those subsequent cases were decided, he\u2019s hoping the justices will apply the 2012 and 2016 cases retroactively, giving him a chance at a new punishment.\n\n\u201cHe had no way of anticipating this new constitutional rule would be announced,\u201d Ms. Spinelli said.\n\nThe government, though, says the court shouldn\u2019t apply the 2012 and 2016 holdings retroactively since it will upset the finality of state convictions decided years prior.\n\nToby Heytens, Virginia\u2019s solicitor general, said the judge \u2014 not the jury \u2014 was the one to decide Malvo\u2019s fate, and the judge had the option to consider mitigating circumstances like age.\n\nMalvo and Muhammad, who was in his 40s, committed random attacks at locations including schools, gas stations and grocery stores around the Beltway.\n\nSome residents avoided going out except when absolutely necessary, and some gas stations took to hanging tarps around the pumps to keep customers from becoming targets. Schools were placed on lockdown and on one occasion, Interstate 95 was closed to traffic.\n\nThe pair killed a total of 12 people and wounded six, all while taunting police. They had drilled a hole in the trunk of their car just above the license plate so they could fire at victims undetected, then drive off, eluding authorities and prolonging the terror for weeks.\n\nMuhammad had brought Malvo from Jamaica to the U.S. illegally and became a father figure to the teen.\n\nMalvo was convicted by a jury of murdering one woman, and he pleaded guilty to the murder and attempted murder of two other individuals in Virginia. He also pleaded guilty to six murders in Maryland.\n\nHe has been serving his life sentence at Red Onion State Prison in Wise County, Virginia.\n\nMuhammad was executed for his part in the sniper shootings in 2009.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
