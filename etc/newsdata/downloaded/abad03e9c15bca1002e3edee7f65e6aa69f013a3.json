They shouted and sung anti-police messages in the presence of riot officers. A group of senior citizens stood between the police and protesters in a bid to calm down the tense atmosphere. Police at one point held up a sign warning protesters they were engaged in illegal assembly and could be prosecuted.\n\nRiot police later charged at protesters from several directions to disperse the crowds. Police also searched cars parked outside the station. Many drivers sympathetic to the protesters gave them lifts into the city centre last week after the metro station closed due to a protest aimed at paralysing the airport.\n\nAt Kowloon bay, dozens of protesters staged a sit-in at a shopping centre near the metro station, shouting anti-police slogans. There was also a sit-in protest at a shopping centre in Shatin, while a small crowd gathered at Heng Fa Chuen metro station, on Hong Kong island.\n\nThe Prince Edward metro station, in Mong Kok, near the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters late on Friday, closed late in the afternoon after a small group tried to submit a petition to urge the MTR metro company to release CCTV footage of the police beating protesters inside the station last Saturday.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government said on Saturday that reports of people dying as a result of the police action were \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d rumours.\n\nMany protesters said on Saturday the police had severely beaten peaceful citizens, and have also accused police of turning a blind eye during a suspected triad attack on civilians at a metro station in July. They have insisted the Hong Kong government meet their political demands, including setting up an independent body to investigate the police\u2019s alleged excessive use of force since the wave of protests started in June.\n\nEarlier in the week, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew a controversial extradition bill, which originally ignited the protests in June. But protesters remain angry about alleged police brutality and have vowed to continue demonstrations.\n\nIn a front-page editorial on Saturday, the overseas edition of the Communist party\u2019s mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily\u2019s said \u201ca small bunch of extremely violent elements have become the vanguards of foreign and anti-China forces\u201d and were trying to \u201cdisrupt Hong Kong and paralyse the government to make it into an independent or semi-independent political entity\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters at a shopping mall in Hong Kong on September 2019.

Airport staff only admitted travellers with passports and boarding passes after a court injunction was issued earlier. A water cannon truck was spotted near the airport.\n\nDozens of riot police also stopped airport-bound buses throughout the day, carrying out detailed searches of passengers\u2019 luggage and checking their ID. They removed people they suspected of being protesters, some of whom were carrying gas masks and other protective gear.\n\nThe airport express railway linking the airport to the city closed several stations, only operating services from the Hong Kong station terminus, where dozens of riot police were standing guard.\n\nSeveral bus services also suspended services to the airport, diverting to a neighbouring residential district, Tung Chung, and the airport car park was closed.\n\nHong and Kong?

Riot police fired tear gas and bean bag rounds at protesters outside Mong Kok metro station, after they had occupied roads, built barricades on streets and set fire to them.\n\nThey also threw objects and smashed windows at Mong Kok police station, and vandalised several metro stations in the area, destroying ticket machines and barriers. Several stations were closed.\n\nLast Sunday, thousands of demonstrators paralysed traffic and shut down transport links between the city and the airport. Travellers were stranded as train and bus services were suspended and roads were heavily congested. Flights were cancelled and delayed.", "description": "Riot police at entrances and only travellers with passports and boarding passes admitted", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d245ed3c8c1fa1fc982f1d258c91cc8ea4771c13/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39b5661b3cc454dc0e50c729833286da", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
