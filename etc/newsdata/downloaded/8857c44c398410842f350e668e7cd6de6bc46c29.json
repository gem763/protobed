But it finds unprecedented and dangerous changes being driven by global heating.\n\nSea level rise is accelerating as losses from Greenland and Antarctica increase, and the ocean is getting hotter, more acidic and less oxygenated. All these trends will continue to the end of the century, the IPCC report said.\n\nHalf the world\u2019s megacities, and almost 2 billion people, live on coasts. Even if heating is restricted to just 2C, scientists expect the impact of sea level rise to cause several trillion dollars of damage a year, and result in many millions of migrants.\n\n\u201cThe future for low-lying coastal communities looks extremely bleak,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Bamber at Bristol University in the UK, who is not one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cBut the consequences will be felt by all of us. There is plenty to be concerned about for the future of humanity and social order from the headlines in this report.\u201d\n\nQuick guide The IPCC report in numbers Show Hide 5.4 metres: highest likely sea level rise by 2300, if global carbon emissions are not cut.\n\n653bn tonnes: average ice melted in Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers every year from 2006-2016, equivalent to 500 Olympic swimming pools every minute. 100-1,000 times: the increase in coastal flood damages expected in 2100 unless major adaptation efforts are made. 1.8 billion people: the number likely to be directly affected by sea level rise on low-lying coasts and melting glaciers in high mountain regions in 2050. 1,500bn tonnes: the carbon stored in permafrost, almost double all the carbon in the atmosphere. 7,000: the number of scientific articles considered by the 104 expert authors from 36 countries.\n\nThe new IPCC projections of likely sea level rise by 2100 are higher than those it made in 2014, due to unexpectedly fast melting in Antarctica. Without cuts in carbon emissions, the ocean is expected to rise between 61cm and 110cm, about 10cm more than the earlier estimate. A 10cm rise means an additional 10 million people exposed to flooding, research shows.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An iceberg floating in Antarctica\u2019s McMurdo Sound.

Recent expert analysis led by Bamber concluded that up to 238cm of sea level rise remains possible by 2100, drowning many megacities around the world. \u201cThis cannot be ruled out,\u201d said Zita Sebesvari at the United Nations University, a lead author of the IPCC report.\n\nEven if huge cuts in emissions begin immediately, between 29cm and 59cm of sea level rise is already inevitable because the ice caps and glaciers melt slowly. Sea level will rise for centuries without action, Sebesvari warned. \u201cThe dramatic thing about sea level rise is if we accept 1 metre happening by 2100, we accept we will get about 4 metres by 2300. That is simply not an option we can risk.\u201d\n\n\u2018Extraordinary thinning\u2019 of ice sheets revealed deep inside Antarctica Read more\n\nExtreme sea level impacts will be felt in many places very soon and well before 2050, Sebesvari said. The IPCC report states: \u201cExtreme sea level events that [occur] once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least once per year at many locations by 2050 in all scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe heating oceans are causing more intense tropical storms to batter coasts, the IPCC report found, with stronger winds and greater deluges of rain. For example, Hurricane Harvey\u2019s unprecedented deluge, which caused catastrophic flooding, was made three times more likely by climate change.\n\nOcean heating also harms kelp forests and other important ecosystems, with the marine heatwaves that sear through them like underwater wildfires having doubled in frequency in the last 40 years. They are projected to increase by at least 20 times by 2100, the IPCC reported.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Floodwaters in Houston after Hurricane Harvey struck the US. Photograph: David J. Phillip/AP\n\nExtreme El Ni\u00f1o events, which see heatwaves in some regions and floods in others, are projected to occur twice as often this century whether emissions are cut or not, the report said. Coral reefs, vital nurseries for marine life, will suffer major losses and local extinctions. Across the ocean, heat, acidification and lower oxygen is set to cut fisheries by a quarter and all marine life by 15% if emissions are not slashed.\n\nQ&A What is the IPCC? Show Hide The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a body of the United Nations. Based in Geneva, it was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to determine the state of knowledge on climate change. For each report, the IPCC assembles hundreds of senior scientists from across the world to assess the current state of knowledge. It publishes major 'assessment' reports every 5\u20137 years, with the next, 'AR6' due in 2022, as well as producing ad hoc special reports. The IPCC has more than 190 member countries, and its reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages to guarantee their quality, with member governments signing off the final versions. The \"Principles Governing IPCC Work\" states it will assess: the risk of human-induced climate change\n\npotential impacts\n\npossible options for prevention In October 2018 it published a special report analysing current climate research stating that we have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, and that urgent changes are needed to cut risk of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty.\n\nThe IPCC report also records the large reduction in Arctic ice. This loss exacerbates global heating, because the exposed darker ocean absorbs more heat from the sun than highly reflective ice. On Monday, scientists announced that the Arctic sea ice in 2019 shrank to its second lowest extent in the 41-year satellite record.\n\nA third of Himalayan ice cap doomed, finds report Read more\n\nThe world\u2019s high mountain glaciers, upon which almost 2 billion people rely for water, are also melting fast, the IPCC found, while landslides are expected to increase. A third of the great Himalayan range is already doomed, with two-thirds projected to vanish if emissions are not cut.\n\nOne of the most worrying alarms sounded by the IPCC report is about melting tundra and increasing wildfires in northern latitudes: \u201cWidespread permafrost thaw is projected for this century and beyond.\u201d A quarter is already near certain to melt, it said, and 70% or more would go if emissions are not curbed. In the latter case, hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane could be released, supercharging the climate emergency.\n\n\u201cThat risks taking us beyond the point where climate change could be easily constrained,\u201d said Richard Black, at the UK\u2019s Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. \u201cNevertheless, the IPCC\u2019s 2018 report concluded that governments can shrink emissions quickly enough to keep global warming to 1.5C if they choose. None can claim to be unaware of both the dangers of untrammelled climate change nor the feasibility of preventing it.\u201d\n\nAnne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris and chair of the C40 Cities climate coalition, said the IPCC report was shocking. \u201cAround 1.9 billion people and over half of the world\u2019s megacities are all in grave danger if we don\u2019t act immediately. Several cities, home to hundreds of thousands of people, are already disappearing underwater. This is what the climate crisis looks like now.\u201d\n\nTaehyun Park, of Greenpeace East Asia, said: \u201cThe science is both chilling and compelling. The impacts on our oceans are on a much larger scale and happening way faster than predicted. It will require unprecedented political action to prevent the most severe consequences to our planet.\u201d\n\nAs well as cutting fossil fuel emissions, preparing for the inevitable impacts is also vital, said Sebesvari, especially in poorer nations that lack the funds to build sea walls, move settlements or restore protective coastal marshes.\n\n\u201cAction is needed now to secure the coast for our children and coming generations,\u201d she said. The pressure now being exerted by the global school strikes for climate was important, she said. \u201cI have very strong motivation. I have two kids and we are really being tested by our kids on our actions.\u201d", "description": "Climate report says intense storms and loss of marine life are already inevitable", "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdf6204edfe5a088a1b84c4b75b4cff248658b43/0_199_3182_1910/master/3182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75d25e2909d5cc30b71d1fe10c48caaa", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
