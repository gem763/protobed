have pretty fantastic growth rates.\u201d\n\nThe ecosystems they foster below their branches are also a vital means of boosting ecological diversity and assisting growers with the means of making even greater financial returns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a cup of coffee this morning that came from Latin America, the odds are that it was growing underneath one of these inga trees,\u201d Professor Pennington added.\n\nGreater coverage of land where ingas are grown could also provide vital corridors for wildlife in the Amazon, which has become increasingly split into fractured areas.\n\nThe Ouro Verde (Green Gold) Institute, which is behind the initiative, hope by encouraging greater biodiversity in areas already affected by slash and burn clearing, they could help mitigate some of the effects of climate change.\n\nAnd according to the Inga Foundation, planting crops of the trees \u201cprovides soil protection, weed control and a nutrient regime\u201d.\n\nHowever, attempts to re-green areas of the Amazon needs to occur at the same time as stopping the destruction of the rainforest.\n\nFires in the Amazon have increased by 84 per cent since the same period last year, according to satellite data from Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research.\n\nIn June, the institute published data showing an 88 per cent increase in deforestation in the Amazon compared to the same month a year ago.\n\nThe data release led to Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro accusing the director of the National Institute for Space Research of lying, which apparently led to him being fired.\n\nUncontrolled logging and land invasion has been blamed by analysts for much of the loss, some of which occurred in protected areas and indigenous reserves.\n\nIn August this year, Professor Thomas Lovejoy of George Mason University, who has studied the Amazon since 1965, told The Independent there are signs the vital rainforest is on course for further extensive deforestation and could soon reach a \u201ctipping point\u201d will soon stretch beyond human control and spell disaster for the forest, and consequently, life on our planet.", "description": "Amid devastating
