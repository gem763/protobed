REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nTUNIS (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeals court on Wednesday freed presidential candidate Nabil Karoui days before Sunday\u2019s second-round runoff election, his lawyer told Reuters.\n\nMedia mogul Karoui was detained in August before the first round of the election and has spent the entire campaign period in prison pending a verdict in his trial for money laundering and tax evasion, which he denies.\n\n\u201cThe appeals court has decided to immediately free Nabil Karoui,\u201d lawyer Kamal Ben Massoud said without elaborating.\n\n\u201cHis release saved our transition and the situation at the last moment ... We were in a very difficult moment in Tunisia which really threatened Tunisian democracy,\u201d Karoui\u2019s spokesman Hatem Mliki said.\n\nLast week, interim president Mohamed Ennaceur said Karoui\u2019s detention and inability to campaign had damaged the credibility of the election. Election watchdogs had also called for his release saying there could be no fair vote if he was detained.\n\nTunisia\u2019s electoral commission has itself warned that Karoui could appeal against the result if he loses as he has been denied equal opportunity to communicate with voters, and that the result could be annulled.\n\nKaroui took 15.6% of the vote in the first round of the election three weeks ago and on Sunday he will face Kais Saied, a retired law professor who came first with 18.4%.\n\nThe case against Karoui was brought three years ago by I Watch, the local chapter of Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog. It is not clear when a final verdict will be made in the case.\n\nCritics regard Karoui as a corrupt populist wrongfully manipulating his television station and a charity he runs for personal political gain, but his supporters see him as a champion of Tunisia\u2019s poor.", "description": "A Tunisian appeals court on Wednesday freed presidential candidate Nabil Karoui days before Sunday's second-round runoff election, his lawyer told Reuters.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438918371&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981P4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
