Did you walk here?\u2019\n\nThe female activist\u2019s response cannot be heard clearly.\n\nHowever, after she speaks, another woman tells her: \u2018No, no, no. It\u2019s a clear answer.\n\n\u2018How did you get here?\n\nHere\u2019s another, at a DLR station. Angry commuters asking an Extinction Rebellion protestor who has glued herself to the train doors how she got there in the first place. By bus? By train?

You\u2019re not walking.\u2019\n\nThe protester appears to agree, saying: \u2018We\u2019re hypocrites Absolutely. I\u2019m a hypocrite.\u2019\n\nDaniel Sugarman, the journalist who posted the video to Twitter, commented on the footage saying: \u2018Angry commuters asking an Extinction Rebellion protestor who has glued herself to the train doors how she got there in the first place.\n\n\u2018By bus? By train? She doesn\u2019t seem very keen on answering.\u2019\n\nAnother incident posted online shows a commuter at Shadwell station demanding to know why protesters had bothered to glue themselves to DLR trains, which are run by electric.\n\nThe man filming can be heard loudly saying: \u2018Gluing themselves to an electric train.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Electricity. No cars, no diesel, nothing. Electricity.\n\n\u2018Yet they\u2019re helping the cause. Alright, sure.\n\n\u2018Look at that train over there.\n\n\u2018People are stuck on there, can\u2019t get off.\u2019\n\nBoth incidents come on the same morning that angry commuters dragged Extinction Rebellion protesters from the top of a train at Canning Town station.\n\nThe climate change group has come under fire many times for \u2018hypocrisy\u2019, but have consistently defended themselves saying climate change is a \u2018systems-wide issue\u2019.\n\nCommuters look up at Extinction Rebellion protesters glued onto the train at the Shadwell DLR station in London (Picture: Twitter @MAXIMUS3005 via Reuter)\n\nOn Tuesday last week, environmentalists at the protests in central London were forced to defend themselves when they were spotted eating at McDonald\u2019s, one of the largest buyers of beef in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne activist said the criticism and \u2018demonisation\u2019 of enviro-protesters \u2018does not invalidate the facts of climate change\u2019.\n\nJavi, 28, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Everyone protesting here is hypocritical because we\u2019re all living in this society.\n\n\u2018We run on cars, we run on petrol, we run on buses.\n\n\u2018Even if you eat only vegan, everything has an impact in the environment.\u2019\n\n\u2018How far do you want me to go before I\u2019m not criticised by you?\u2019\n\nRetired probation officer Phil Kingston, 83 and mother-of-three Ruth Jarman 56, at Shadwell station during the Extinction Rebellion protests (Picture: Alamy Live News)\n\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Skeena Rathor also came under fire when she appeared on Good Morning Britain in October, with Piers Morgan blasting her for not \u2018practising what you preach\u2019.\n\nIn a fiery debate, the host told her to \u2018start with action in your own four walls\u2019 when she refused to admit whether she owned a TV and confessed she had arrived at the studios in a car.\n\nHowever, Rathor responded by saying she \u2018had to be part of this system to raise the alarm\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u2018It\u2019s a systems-wide issue\u2026 it\u2019s about our government telling the truth. Every individual voice matters.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not about individual carbon footprint, it\u2019s about a systems wide issue.\n\n\u2018Unless you live in a wood completely as a recluse, you are going to be part of this system.\n\n\u2018To raise the alarm I have to be part of this system.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
