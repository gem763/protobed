That might happen here and there if you\u2019re shutting the Fold in a hurry, but it\u2019s unlikely that someone would shut the Fold that hard so often, or for 14 hours straight.\n\nThere is nothing that replicates human behavior here. If anything, it\u2019s frankly impressive that the Galaxy Fold survived as long as it did in CNET\u2019s test.\n\nBy comparison, here\u2019s a clip of Samsung\u2019s own test where the company claimed it could last up to 200,000 folds and unfolds. It\u2019s less barbaric \u2013 soothing, even. And at the very least, closer to how a human would actually open and close the Galaxy Fold:\n\nYou can scroll through CNET\u2019s YouTube video timeline below:\n\nThere\u2019s increased attention on Samsung\u2019s revised Galaxy Fold, as the first wave of devices in April started breaking far too easily in the hands of reviewers.", "description": "Business Insider - CNET demonstrates the tech equivalent of a brutal medieval torture designed to break the will of dissidents and heretics alike..
