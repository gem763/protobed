In the past, coccolithophores built mountains \u26f0. Now, they make the ocean look turquoise, taking crunchy carbon into the ocean\u2019s depths \u2b07\ufe0f to build the mountains of future. Are you a coccolithophore? <a href=\"https://t.co/xAbNjBsSME\">pic.twitter.com/xAbNjBsSME</a> \u2014@NASAEarth\n\n\"That reflects light, and that's the reason we can actually see the turquoise colour ... it's like a chalk, and that's what these guys are made out of.\n\n\"The minute you see that ... the turquoise is what gives it away as a coccolithophore bloom.\"\n\nMcKenzie says the blooms pop up every so often in the waters off the southern part of the island, but it's the first time she's seen them so far north, in places like Trinity Bay and Conception Bay.\n\nThey've lasted longer this time around, too, she says.\n\nThese blooms happen every so often, but this one is hanging around longer than usual. (Layna Willcott)\n\nThat indicates they're happy where they are, clustered close to the shore and near the surface of the water, where the phytoplankton can pick up the most sunlight and warmth.\n\n\"That's why they show up really well on satellite images.\"\n\nEven Hurricane Dorian didn't sway the little guys. McKenzie theorizes it's because shifts in the water brought more nutrients drifting in.\n\n\"So they're hanging around even more now,\" she said.\n\nAs for how long they'll stick around? The phytoplankton will eventually die off \u2014 but this time, thanks to favourable conditions, McKenzie thinks it could take weeks instead of days.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "The stunning turquoise hue is catching the eyes of residents around the province.
