It\u2019s time to converge the two into one bag to fit it all \u2014 shoes and laptop, dirty laundry, and Kindle.\n\nSo I asked some folks at the Beast about it and everyone generally agrees there are two ways to go about this: A gym bag focus and a work bag focus, each its own priority in a bag that will cover all my necessities. There are many options, and of course, they depend on your taste and specific routines. My focus is simple: I want a bag to hold all of my gym gear before and after I work out, and for the bag to not only hold and protect my tech but also look good enough for to show up with at a client meeting. If I wasn\u2019t prone to dropping things, I\u2019d very likely grab a tote bag and call it a day, but for now, am searching for something more\u2026 traditional.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nGym Bags That Work at Work\n\nOn this end of the spectrum, we\u2019re going to prioritize fitness features above the rest. That\u2019s not to say bag\u2019s style isn\u2019t important, but it\u2019s relegated to the second tier.\n\nCaraa\u2019s Caraa x Athleta Convertible Backpack, $138 at Caraa: It's a convertible backpack that can turn messenger when you want it to, and its bottom shoe compartment separates it from the rest of your belongings. I\u2019m particularly drawn to the removable pouch on its front and the 15-inch laptop pocket on the interior. Big ups for looking so stylish and minimalist and maintaining some pretty unique function.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.

But wow is this thing packing. It has a structured sunglasses holster, laptop protection, built-in yoga mat storage, a bottle holster, and an exterior padded pocket for a 15-inch laptop. This is backpack-only territory and if I was still commuting to work in Washington, D.C., by bike, this would be my pick. The Everywhere Backpack is likewise striking in its simplicity.\n\nNike's Sport III Golf Backpack, $110 on Amazon: It will fit your shoes and electronics but doesn\u2019t offer hard protection to the latter \u2014 which is also unnecessary depending on your environment. The Adidas Squad III is another versatile option and comes in a million colors.\n\nWork Bags That Work Out With You at the Gym\n\nFor the more professionally-minded are bags whose aesthetic rules their function, as opposed to the other way around. This is a welcome respite from some of the bags I see at the gym, to boot.\n\nDagne Dover\u2019s Landon Carryall, $95 at Lululemon: It's beautiful, to put it simply. I\u2019d probably grab the large size if I were planning to use it on the daily since I\u2019d be getting an expandable main compartment, a padded laptop sleeve, a shoe bag and pockets lining its insides (and a few on it outside). I especially like the neoprene material, perfect for drive-by puddle bombs and occasional downpours.\n\nGent Supply's Leather Duffle Adventure Bag, $295 on Amazon: I particularly found it unique in that it has a bottom compartment catering to different needs, like shoes or toiletries. It\u2019s made of buffalo leather and will work just great for your work out but I would maybe shy away from taking it hiking.\n\nKemy's Oversized Canvas Duffle Bag, $60 on Amazon: This canvas duffel gives you leather pocket tops and lots of high ratings. Its shoe compartment, size, and exterior pockets make it a workhorse of a bag but the accents and the style mean it won\u2019t stand out in the office.\n\nPlambag's Canvas Duffle Bag for Travel, $31 on Amazon: A similar take to Kemy's, Plambag provides an affordable option and covers you needed functions, from sturdy zippers to several on the inside. The rugged spiked legs on its bottom also mean it won\u2019t slide around on moving platforms, like trains or buses. Other notable canvas bags include the Toupons travel tote in multiple colors and a similar option from Kenox.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
