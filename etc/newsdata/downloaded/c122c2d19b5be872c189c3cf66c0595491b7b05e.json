Now, many of those moderate Democrats are among the strongest voices backing the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSome moderate Democrats had argued that zeroing in on the threat of foreign interference \u2014 which they saw as an indisputable conclusion of Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 was the caucus\u2019 best bet to bringing on GOP support.\n\nThe election bill on Wednesday, however, garnered zero Republican votes, with Trump and GOP leaders adamantly opposed to what they see as unnecessary restrictions on campaigns. The White House threatened to veto the bill ahead of the vote\n\nThe legislation is going nowhere in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described it on Wednesday as an attack on the First Amendment.\n\nDemocrats, however, also see a chance to squeeze House Republicans, as some in the GOP become increasingly uncomfortable with the drip-drip of revelations on Ukraine.\n\nThat includes Tuesday\u2019s damning closed-door testimony from William Taylor, the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine, in which he told lawmakers that that Trump withheld U.S. military aid to Ukraine in order to secure investigations into his political rivals like former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe bill presents Republicans with a very crucial opportunity,\u201d freshman Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThey can start to work together with us Democrats to honor our sacred oath to the Constitution and keep our country safe, or they can bow down to foreign influence.\u201d\n\nThe House passed a sweeping elections and campaign finance bill, H.R. 1, in the early weeks of their majority. But Democratic leaders have long planned to vote again on key pieces of that bill in a bid to pressure on Republicans while reminding the public about a signature proposal.\n\nSome vulnerable Democrats would still rather call for stronger legislation protecting U.S. elections than formally join their party\u2019s impeachment push.\n\nReps. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.) and Kendra Horn (D-Okla.) \u2014 neither of whom support the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday that would prohibit foreign ownership or control of U.S. elections systems.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/23/8d/64f4ec5142528bd97a480d56a8f0/181029-voting-booths-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
