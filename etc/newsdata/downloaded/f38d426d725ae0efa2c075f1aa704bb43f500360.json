The purity, the joy and the love of football was amazing and it should be shown to every young player.\u2019\n\nIt is that innocence and enthusiasm which make their story all the more endearing, as their mum says: \u2018They are really close, they genuinely love each other. They used to fight and argue when they were younger, but they\u2019ve always had each other\u2019s backs.\n\n\u2018They are good people first and foremost. They are just normal, genuine lads blessed with a talent and they have worked so hard to get here.\n\nThe Longstaff brothers pose as youngsters during a family holiday to Florida in 2014\n\nThe teenager lets rip from 25 yards as his 72nd minute strike secured a vital three points\n\n\u2018Everyone keeps saying, \u201cThey\u2019re a credit to you\u201d, but they\u2019re also a credit to themselves. We are all just so proud of them.\u2019\n\nAlan Shearer\u2019s first thought when he saw the team-sheet was not for the boys on the pitch, but for their parents in the stand. Dad David, a former Great Britain ice hockey star, missed a match for current team Whitley Warriors to be there.\n\n\u2018My first thought was for them, knowing what my parents went through when I made my debut,\u2019 says Shearer, who opened a new floodlit 3G pitch at Wallsend Boys Club yesterday.\n\n\u2018They must have been petrified and excited all in one.\u2019\n\nMatty roars in celebration after bagging the winning goal of his side's crucial 1-0 victory\n\nSo, were they? \u2018I felt sick most of the day with nerves,\u2019 says Michelle, 45, who woke at 5am. \u2018I have never felt like that before. It was because both of them were playing and it was Matty\u2019s first time. As a parent, you are a nervous wreck with one, never mind two!\u2019\n\nBut then, in the 72nd minute, came the moment of euphoria when Matty smashed the ball into the bottom corner at the Gallowgate End from 25 yards. \u2018We just jumped up and down like lunatics,\u2019 says Michelle, a fine netball player. \u2018It was pure elation, it\u2019s hard to describe how happy you feel.\u2019\n\nUntil recently, when Sean moved into his own apartment, the brothers lived together with their mum and sister Milly, 15, at the family home in North Shields.\n\n\u2018It feels like only yesterday we\u2019d all be sat around watching Match of the Day. On Sunday night the boys went out for some food and me and Milly watched it together. It was so surreal, you\u2019re just thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s my boys\u201d.\u2019\n\nHe runs to the Newcastle fans with Andy Carroll after scoring on his Premier League debut\n\nThe brothers are 'really close and genuinely love each other', according to their mum Michelle\n\nThe family lived in Sweden for a year while David played for Djurgardens but returned to the North East and the brothers joined North Shields Juniors, where John Farrage is chairman. \u2018Matty was only three,\u2019 he tells Sportsmail. \u2018He played against boys of six and I had to tell him to stop tackling so hard! He used to say, \u201cBut they\u2019re bigger than me.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sean was a must-win character as well. We had to ask his dad to take him off one day and calm him down. He came back on and scored the winner!\u2019\n\nFarrage was in the Gallowgate on Sunday. \u2018That feeling when Matty scored \u2014 wow,\u2019 says the 64-year-old. \u2018I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d broken my toe in the celebrations until after the game. I\u2019m in agony now, but who cares?\n\n\u2018We couldn\u2019t be more proud as a club. They have never changed at all, nothing has gone to their heads. They called into training a few weeks back and were just chatting away to our seven-year-olds. That humility is a special quality.\u2019\n\nMatty (left) pictured in a Celtic shirt as they are related to Alan Thompson and Sean (right)\n\nIn October of last year the brothers dined in the Miller & Carter Steakhouse in Newcastle\u2019s city centre to celebrate Sean\u2019s 21st birthday.\n\nThey were not bothered for a single autograph \u2014 Sean did not even have a signature \u2014 and a couple of weeks later they were playing together for the Under 21s in front of a few hundred fans at Grimsby.\n\nTwelve months on and they are just about the most recognisable and popular pair on Tyneside. Their dad\u2019s cousin is Alan Thompson, the former Celtic and England midfielder.\n\n\u2018They are brilliant boys but they will stay grounded,\u2019 he says. \u2018You only have to meet the family to realise that.\u2019\n\nSean revealed earlier this year how he leans on \u2018Uncle Alan\u2019 for advice, and Matty is tapping into that, too.\n\nMatty's brother Sean burst on the scene for the club last season and has become a key player\n\n\u2018I sent Matty a text before the game just telling him, even though there are 52,000 there, you don\u2019t have to change the way you play,\u2019 says Thompson.\n\n\u2018I told him not to complicate it, don\u2019t feel you have to try anything too magical \u2014 and then he puts one in from 25 yards!\n\n\u2018I was making the Sunday dinner and had to run back through to the living room. I was jumping all over, absolutely buzzing.\u2019\n\nIt is a recurring theme, as Shearer says: \u2018I was jumping around the studio in Manchester, what a story!\u2019\n\nThis, though, is just the beginning. Mum and dad had better get used to those nerves, not that their boys show any on the pitch.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY CRAIG HOPE: Matty, 19, was still clutching his man-of-the-match prize after scoring Newcastle's winning goal against Manchester United on his Premier League debut.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/19410484-0-image-a-22_1570475710616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
