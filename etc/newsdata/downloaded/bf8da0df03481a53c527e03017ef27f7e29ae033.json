They have worked on me to try and make the perfect player.\n\n\"Over the last three years they have made me work harder and prepare better for big games,\" he added.\n\n\"Mako, I have scrummed quite a lot against him in training... It is a bit different, it's not a training field, it's a big Test so I'm quite excited about that.\"\n\nEngland dethroned reigning world champions New Zealand with a stunning 19-7 semi-final win, whereas the Springboks ground out a 19-16 victory over Wales in their last-four clash.\n\n\"We have played them (England) four times in the last 18 months and it is a draw,\" said South Africa forwards coach Matt Proudfoot.\n\n\"They were very efficient and very powerful against New Zealand, the trend-setters. We need to match that intensity. It wasn't just brute force, there was very intelligent play from their pack,\" he added.\n\n\"Up front I think they're a lot more confident in what they're doing. In terms of their efficiency of execution, it's a lot better.\n\n\"For myself, I am very pleased with our pack's performance.\"\n\nProudfoot, however, summed up the scale of South Africa's task by saying of England's win over the All Blacks: \"It was a great game to watch. Gee, it was a great game.\"\n\nVictory in Yokohama on Saturday would mean South Africa had won the World Cup for the third time after their 1995 triumph on home soil and a win over England in the 2007 final in Paris.\n\n\"I think South Africa as a country has got a lot of challenges,\" said Proudfoot.\n\n\"We are resilient people. What 1995 meant created a new opportunity for people in South Africa.\"\n\nSpringbok lock Lood de Jager agreed before sounding a warning note.\n\n\"1995 had a massive impact and I think it will (winning the World Cup) have a massive impact,\" said the towering second row.\n\n\"But we can't get caught up in that, we've got 80 minutes against a world-class team coming up.\"\n\nKick-off on Saturday is at 11:00 SA time.", "description": "South Africa prop Vincent Koch is relishing the prospect of facing Saracens team-mate Mako Vunipola when the Springboks play England in the Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7997/7a5cf8510aad4cb589881f10ba7f2347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
