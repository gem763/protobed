But when her starter came, it took just two bites for her to realise she had eaten potentially deadly nuts\n\nShe was admitted to the emergency room where she was treated for a severe anaphylactic reaction and given steroids and antihistamines.\n\nMs Revelle had an even worse reaction an hour later because the cashews remained in her system.\n\n'I had a second, more severe reaction where my face blew up and my throat closed up,' she said.\n\n'I was treated with another shot of adrenaline and steroids, I was hooked up to an IV and I was kept awake for 4-5 hours just for monitoring until the doctors finally let me get some sleep before I was discharged the next morning.'\n\nAfter recovering at home for a week Ms Revelle bravely decided to return to the restaurant on Sunday to ask them to be more careful in future.\n\n'I went back into the restaurant just to let them know that I was alive and well, and also needed to explain to them the severity of the situation because God forbid it happens to anyone with a weaker immune system or a child,' Ms Revelle said.\n\nAfter speaking with a waitress about her experience and explaining the dangers of serving nuts to people with allergies, Ms Revelle received a weak apology.\n\n'The waitress apologised and offered me a free drink for my trouble,' Ms Revelle said.\n\n'I was quite offended and infuriated that she thought me almost losing my life was equal to the value of a cocktail or a beer, so I asked to speak to the manager.'\n\nAfter recovering at home for a week Ms Revelle bravely decided to return to the restaurant on Sunday to ask them to be more careful in future\n\nBy chance, the owner of the establishment happened to be there and she explained once again what had happened but she was stunned by his rude response.\n\n'When it came to me trying to get through to him about the severity of the situation and to be more careful he said that most of his items on the menu contains allergens and if he were to list every allergen on the menu it just wouldn't make sense,' Ms Revelle said.\n\n'I said I wasn't expecting him to list every flavour, ingredient or spice that's in everything, but the main components that people need to know about, especially nuts because it's such a common allergy.'\n\n'Even just a disclaimer on the bottom saying this venue uses nuts or common allergens, please let the wait staff know.'\n\nWhile talking to Ms Revelle the owner tried to downplay the situation but then let slip that the same thing had happened to him before.\n\n'He was pretty much trying to belittle the situation and belittle the position I was in, and I said to him that it was because he didn't train staff properly and his waitress literally put my life on the line because of her mistake and he wasn't doing anything about it,' she said.\n\n'The owner then said that people with allergies shouldn't eat at his restaurant or anywhere out as it's high risk.'\n\nMs Revelle said the owner refused to compensate her for the ordeal.\n\n'There was absolutely no compassion... no empathy and no responsibility, I don't know how they're still operating,' she said.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has reached out to the establishment for comment.", "description": "Jaicey Revelle, who has had a serious allergy to nuts since birth, went for dinner at a restaurant in Byron Bay on October 11, and ended up in hospital with two severe allergic reactions.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/05/20019700-0-image-a-34_1571718930992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
