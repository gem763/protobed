The city remains responsible for replacing pipes up to the private property line.\n\nDouglas said Ottawa's treated tap water is lead-free, but can pick up trace amounts of lead as it passes through old pipes leading into homes.\n\nOttawa's drinking water is top-notch, Ian Douglas says, but can pick up trace amounts of lead from the pipes leading to older homes. (Andrew Foote/CBC)\n\nThe city has $1 million set aside to replace its portion of the pipes, but at a cost of about $7,000 per property, it would cost approximately $210 million to replace all the pipes leading to the estimated 30,000 homes in Ottawa that still have lead, and would likely take years.\n\nThe city also offers a loan program to homeowners who want to replace their lead pipes, allowing them to pay off the cost along with their property taxes over several years.\n\nDouglas said there was a spike of interest in the replacement program in 2007, when the issue last made headlines.\n\n\"The phone was ringing off the hook,\" he said, but interest has since waned.\n\nProbable carcinogen\n\nSo, what makes lead so dangerous?\n\n\"There's been mounting research over the last 10 or 20 years that they can't find a safe level for lead, so even tiny amounts of lead seem to have an adverse effect,\" Douglas said.\n\nAccording to Health Canada, those adverse effects include \"reduced intelligence in children,\" reduced cognition, increased blood pressure and kidney problems in adults.\n\nLead has also been classified as a probable carcinogen.\n\nThe city is offering free testing for anyone who's concerned their tap water may have contain lead, and is also offering free lead removal kits for a year.\n\n\"Kits are really effective, however, they're really an interim measure. So, for example, in the middle of the night, you know, a child gets up and is thirsty and takes a drink of water, they're probably not going to be using the filter,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"Really, the long-term solution is to remove the lead service pipe.\"", "description": "An estimated 30,000 homeowners across Ottawa are being urged to replace their old pipes after\u00a0Health Canada issued new guidelines suggesting there's no acceptable amount of lead in drinking water.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3621725.1568908274!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lead-pipes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
