In fact, a recent GOBankingRates survey found more than half of Americans will retire broke. Even if you have made saving a priority, however, you still can make missteps once you leave the 9-to-5 that will put a comfortable retirement at risk.\n\nClick through to learn how you can avoid these common mistakes people make in retirement.\n\n1. Claiming Social Security Too Early\n\nMore than a third of baby boomers take advantage of the option to claim Social Security benefits early at age 62, according to the Center for Retirement Research. But taking benefits before full retirement age results in a permanent reduction of as much as 25 percent of your benefit, said Patricia Cathey, an investment advisor with financial services firm Smart Retirement in Denver.\n\nFull retirement age is 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954 and gradually increases until it reaches 67 for people born after 1959. \u201cWaiting to claim Social Security is one of the best things you can do to boost your income in retirement,\u201d Cathey said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a big bonus for delaying your claim beyond your full retirement age: Your benefit will grow by as much as 8 percent a year from your full retirement age up until age 70.\u201d\n\nLast updated: Jan. 8, 2018\n\n2. Continuing to Work After Claiming Social Security Early\n\nIf you start receiving benefits at 62 and continue to work, you will lose $1 in benefits for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $17,040. The year in which you reach full retirement age, you will lose $1 in benefits for every $3 earned above the annual limit of $45,360. That continues until the month you actually reach full retirement age \u2014 at which point the limit disappears.\n\n3. Carrying Debt Into Retirement\n\nHaving debt in retirement when you are on a fixed income makes you vulnerable to financial hardships because it leaves you with less money to cover unexpected expenses, Cathey said.\n\nShe recommends you pay off all debt before you retire. But if that\u2019s not possible, have a plan to pay it off by a certain date in retirement.\n\nIn particular, you should focus on paying off your mortgage, because it is the biggest monthly expense for most people, said Robert Steen, enterprise advice director for retirement and complex financial planning for USAA, which offers financial services for members of the military.\n\n4. Being Too Conservative With Investments\n\nMany retirees shy away from holding stocks in their retirement account portfolios because they fear losing money in a market downturn. By avoiding stocks, though, they are trading off one risk for another \u2014 not having enough growth potential in their portfolio to outpace inflation, Steen said.\n\nAlthough they are often volatile over short periods, stocks tend to outperform bonds and other conservative investments over long periods, said David Walters, a certified financial planner and portfolio manager with Palisades Hudson Financial Group\u2019s Portland, Ore., office.\n\n\u201cRetirees need to understand that the period of their retirement can be upwards of 30 years, and they need their portfolio to support them throughout this entire period,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, while it is important to keep the risk of the portfolio in check, some allocation to stocks is warranted.\u201d\n\n5. Being Too Aggressive With Investments\n\nSome retirees become too aggressive with their portfolios to achieve better returns, said Corey Sunstrom, a Charlotte, N.C.-based certified financial planner with Hobart Financial Group. \u201cThe truth is, aggressive investors aren\u2019t being rewarded either, and their portfolios have a greater propensity for loss,\u201d he said.\n\nRather than reach for returns, Sunstrom recommends working with an advisor to ensure you are properly diversified with investments that will help you reach goals.\n\n6. Overexposure to One Stock or Asset Class\n\nSome people have a significant portion of their portfolio invested in their former employer\u2019s stock, Walters said. This creates risk, though, because a large amount of your retirement income could be riding on the fate of a single stock. If it tanks, so will your portfolio.\n\n\u201cWhere possible, allocations to any single company should be minimized in favor of a well-diversified portfolio with exposure to many companies and asset classes,\u201d Walters said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Anyone can make a bad money move in retirement.", "authors": ["Cameron Huddleston"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bMr2oxXR_.FPYaPiYoK.Yg--~B/aD0xMzc2O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/gobankingrates_644/93a81539b36b5ebf24d68f83c1522a30", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
