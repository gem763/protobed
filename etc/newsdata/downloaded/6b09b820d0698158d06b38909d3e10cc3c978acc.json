The newer album was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge, the studio engineer whose compressed, impeccable sonic draftsmanship had shepherded recordings by Madonna and Bruce Springsteen. Largely acoustic-based, the album was a brick wrapped in a pillow, a set of clever and emotionally devastating songs whose impact was muffled by the attempt to lean mainstream and capture the epic dreaminess of late \u201980s pop. As the band\u2019s leader, Westerberg knew that Don\u2019t Tell a Soul was a make-or-break proposition. \u201cIf this one don\u2019t fly,\u201d he said of the album in Bob Mehr\u2019s book Trouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements, \u201cthen it\u2019s back to the brooms.\u201d\n\nWriting about Don\u2019t Tell a Soul for Rolling Stone in 1989, the critic Ira Robbins remarked on the album\u2019s ethereality, pointing out that \u201cWesterberg\u2019s unmistakable, shaggy voice and Chris Mars\u2019s decisive 4/4 snare work are all that keeps the LP from drifting away.\u201d It became the Replacements\u2019 best-selling album to date, but it still fell far short of commercial expectations. And it alienated many longtime fans in the process, those who couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t parse this newfound delicacy in what once was America\u2019s most dangerous band\u2014even if its members were mostly a danger to themselves.\n\nThirty years later, Don\u2019t Tell a Soul\u2019s stab at timelessness ironically makes it sound dated. The album title seems to hint at the defeatist attitude that the group was cultivating; it was as if the members were saying to the world, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about us. We\u2019re underdogs. We don\u2019t know how we might handle the attention.\u201d In the soaring song \u201cWe\u2019ll Inherit the Earth,\u201d Westerberg whisper-growls over an urgently strummed chord progression, \u201cWe\u2019ll inherit the Earth / But we don\u2019t want it.\u201d The original version is ambient and airy; the remixed version is grittier and gutsier, with more pronounced distortion and a tone of nervy rawness that\u2019s missing from Don\u2019t Tell a Soul. It evokes far more convincing friction between pop sheen and rock punch, between self-mythologizing and self-negation.\n\nMatt Wallace, the producer behind Don\u2019t Tell a Soul, was a novice in the studio when he was chosen to helm the album\u2019s recording sessions. (He later went on to produce hits for Faith No More and Maroon 5.) His quick, initial mix of the album\u2014done before the job was handed to Lord-Alge\u2014languished on tapes buried in the basement of the Replacements\u2019 guitarist Slim Dunlap for decades. These tapes form the basis of the new Dead Man\u2019s Pop version of the album, with Wallace given the chance to expand on that first, unheard mix. Mostly the changes are cosmetic: Restored tempos, vocal takes, and guitar solos help round out a rebalancing of instruments and effects that tease out the spirited performances at the core of the recording.", "description": "In 1989, the band reached for the mainstream with its sixth album.
