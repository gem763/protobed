We never colluded with anyone, which is exactly what the Mueller report says, so I was happy to go,\u201d he said.\n\nDOJ USES DEMOCRATS' IMPEACHMENT CONFUSION AGAINST THEM IN COURT\n\nHe rejected a claim by committee member Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that he was trying to \"campaign\" via his testimony.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Republican primary campaign, you are not on the campaign trail yet. This is the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 act like you know the difference,\u201d Jeffries told Lewandowski.\n\nThe former Trump aide said he was not trying to campaign during the hearing, adding he hasn't even made up his mind about running against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhat the congressman failed to articulate was, I was compelled by a lawful subpoena to show up today \u2013 and that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added he also found it ridiculous that Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., would claim Tuesday he should be potentially fined by the House and be subject to an \"inherent contempt order.\"\n\n\u201cJackie Speier wants to fine me? For what? Coming to Congress and testifying in open Congress under oath? I\u2019m happy to do that.\u201d\n\nOf Democrats\u2019 assertion Trump may be \u201cguilty,\u201d Lewandowski remarked they were half right.\n\n\u201cThe president didn\u2019t commit any crimes, didn\u2019t collude with any foreign entities and didn\u2019t try and stop the Mueller investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s guilty of something, it\u2019s of putting America first \u2013 and if that's the case, then he\u2019s absolutely guilty as charged.\u201d\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Trump\u00a0campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said in his first interview following a marathon hearing before the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0Tuesday that congressional\u00a0Democrats\u00a0organized the proceedings for political gain.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/McCallum-Lewandowski.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
