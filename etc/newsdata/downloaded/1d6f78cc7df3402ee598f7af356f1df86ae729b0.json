High inflation has driven up rents, with salaries and employment hit by recession. Gauna herself lost her long-term job in August.\n\nA board advertising apartments for sale or rent is displayed at a real estate agency in Buenos Aires, Argentina October 15, 2019.

REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nNow the 49-year-old risks losing her home, one of a growing number of Argentines straining under rental payments as an economic crisis and popular anger tips South America\u2019s No. 2 economy back toward populism ahead of presidential elections this month.\n\nGauna\u2019s plight reflects a broader housing crisis. In the wealthy capital alone, two-fifths of people have difficulty making rent as prices have outstripped salaries, according to the city\u2019s independent ombudsman office, double the level in March last year. Homelessness has risen and many houses stand empty.\n\n\u201cI hope the economic situation improves because inflation is killing us, it\u2019s emptying our pockets. Either we eat, or we pay our bills, or we pay the rent,\u201d Gauna said in her apartment, where the shared bedroom doubles as a dining and living room.\n\nGauna, who works as a hotel receptionist, lost her long-term position two months ago, just as President Mauricio Macri was dealt an unexpected landslide defeat in primary elections.\n\nThe rental crisis underscores broader dynamics in Argentina ahead of elections likely to oust Macri. The center-rightist, a former Buenos Aires mayor, came to power promising to spur investment and eradicate poverty, but now looks set to leave office with millions more in hardship.\n\nPeronist Alberto Fernandez is heavily favored to win the Oct. 27 vote. He is running alongside Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who served as Argentina\u2019s president from 2007 to 2015 and won strong support among many Argentines with public subsidies to reduce living costs, especially among the poor.\n\nGervasio Mu\u00f1oz, president of a local tenants\u2019 organization, said Macri\u2019s market-oriented reforms and the country\u2019s economic crisis had combined to put a squeeze on housing costs and renters.\n\n\u201cWith rent increases across the board, people can\u2019t cope because of delayed salaries and tough market rules,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, since I think (the economic crisis of) 2001-2002, that we\u2019ve seen a situation where so many families in Argentina don\u2019t know where they will live because they can no longer pay rent.\u201d\n\n\u2018HOW DO I GET OUT?\u2019\n\nAhead of the vote, Macri has rolled out popular measures to bolster jobs and cut taxes, though many blame his administration\u2019s deregulation of the housing market for high rents and for failing to get inflation under control.\n\nMacri has promised his government will look to \u201ctake care\u201d of renters worried about an uncertain future. But he has won few favors among hard-hit voters by cutting back on subsidies for public utilities as part of a drive to lower government debts.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Congress, meanwhile, is now looking at draft proposals to alleviate the housing crisis. Three proposed housing-related bills went in front of lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nFernando Mu\u00f1oz, an official at the Buenos Aires ombudsman, pointed to the number of people trying to break rental agreements, even as they worry about incurring fines, as a testament to how tough the housing situation has become.\n\n\u201cMany people come and tell us I want to end the contract, I can\u2019t keep paying. How do I get out?\u201d he said.\n\nGauna herself is hoping the country\u2019s next leader will help bolster jobs, but is pessimistic with economic growth forecasts deteriorating and annual inflation running at over 50%.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nShe now scrapes by with temporary work to pay the 9,200 Argentine peso ($159.02) monthly rent for her apartment, but said she has had to cut back to eating just one meal a day.\n\n\u201cI am afraid for the future because I do not know what will happen with my work,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI hope just to have a home and a stable job, and that the next government looks after the workers because we are not having a good time. A house for me is very important, just to leave something to my daughter.\u201d", "description": "Silvia Gauna is struggling to make the rent on the one-room Buenos Aires apartment she shares with her teenage daughter.
