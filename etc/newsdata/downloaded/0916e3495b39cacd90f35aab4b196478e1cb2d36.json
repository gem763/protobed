Pete Worden, Executive Director of the Breakthrough Initiatives; Dr. Andrew Siemion, leader of the Breakthrough Listen science team at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s SETI Research Center (BSRC); and will engage Listen partners and collaborators worldwide.\n\nThe TESS and Listen collaboration will expand Breakthrough Listen\u2019s target list (adding over 1000 \u201cobjects of interest\u201d identified by TESS); refine Listen\u2019s analysis strategy (for example, utilizing new knowledge about planetary alignments to predict when transmissions might be more likely to occur); and provide more meaningful statistics in the event of non-detections.\n\nObservations will take place using Listen\u2019s primary facilities (the Green Bank and Parkes Telescopes1, 2, MeerKAT2, and the Automated Planet Finder), as well as partner facilities including VERITAS4, NenuFAR, FAST5, the Murchison Widefield Array, LOFAR stations in Ireland and Sweden, Jodrell Bank Observatory and e-MERLIN6, Keck Observatory, and the Sardinia Radio Telescope, along with the SETI Institute\u2019s Allen Telescope Array7.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting that the world\u2019s most powerful SETI search, with our partner facilities across the globe, will be collaborating with the TESS team and our most capable planet-hunting machine,\u201d remarked Dr. Worden. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working together as we try to answer one of the most profound questions about our place in the Universe: Are we alone?\u201d\n\nThe TESS mission measures \u201clightcurves\u201d (how the brightness of stars changes over time) to look for telltale dips caused by \u201ctransits\u201d \u2013 where a planet passes in front of the star as viewed from Earth. The cutting-edge instruments on TESS are sensitive enough to detect small, rocky planets similar to Earth. Such planets are prime targets for follow-up by NASA programs, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, that seek to measure planetary atmospheres. Careful measurements of atmospheric composition could result in the detection of \u201cbiosignatures\u201d \u2013 indicators that biological processes may be taking place on worlds other than Earth.\n\nAs well as looking for biosignatures, astrobiologists search for \u201ctechnosignatures\u201d \u2013 indicators of technology that may have been developed by advanced civilizations. Also known as SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), technosignature searches use powerful telescopes to look for signals coming from space that appear to have arisen from transmitters, propulsion devices, or other engineering. No unambiguous technosignatures have been seen to date, but the chances of detection are higher than they have ever been, in large part due to Breakthrough Listen \u2013 the most sensitive, comprehensive, and intensive search for advanced life on other worlds ever performed8. Listen is using facilities across the globe, including cutting-edge optical telescopes, to search for powerful lasers, and the world\u2019s most capable radio telescopes to search for signals over a wide range of the radio spectrum.\n\nIn the past three decades over 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered \u2013 many by TESS\u2019s predecessor, the Kepler spacecraft. According to recent estimates, the average number of planets per star is greater than one. As a result, technosignature searches operate in a \u201ctarget-rich\u201d environment, observing stars whether or not confirmed planets are known to exist around them. Nevertheless, as the haul of confirmed exoplanets continues to grow, the additional information about these systems is very useful for optimizing SETI strategies.\n\nLaunched in April 2018, TESS has four wide-field cameras, each monitoring a region of sky 24 degrees across (about the width of the span of your hand when held at arm\u2019s length). Lightcurves for 20,000 stars are measured every 2 minutes, and in addition, the brightness of every pixel in the cameras is recorded every 30 minutes.\n\nTESS will observe over 85% of the sky \u2013 around 400 times more than Kepler \u2013 and is predicted to find as many as 10,000 new planets. Most of the TESS targets are considerably closer to Earth than those viewed by Kepler, enabling technosignature searches to probe for fainter transmitters. And because TESS only sees planets that pass in front of their host star as viewed from Earth, all the planetary systems it detects will be edge-on. A large fraction (roughly 70%) of radio leakage from Earth-based transmitters is emitted in the plane of Earth\u2019s orbit; if the same is true for any transmitters developed by extraterrestrial intelligence, observing the systems edge-on will offer the best chance of detection.\n\nIn addition to targeting of TESS planets with Listen facilities, the TESS lightcurves themselves will be searched for anomalies. A planet transit produces a well-understood variation in detected light from the star, but large-scale engineering projects (for example, \u201cmegastructures\u201d constructed in orbit) could block the stellar light in more complex ways. The TESS analysis pipeline is in essence a wide-field anomaly detector, and stars that behave strangely are interesting not just as technosignature candidates, but as potential laboratories for studying interesting astrophysics.\n\n\u201cThe discovery by the Kepler spacecraft of Boyajian\u2019s Star, an object with wild, and apparently random, variations in its lightcurve, sparked great excitement and a range of possible explanations, of which megastructures were just one,\u201d said Dr. Siemion. \u201cFollow-up observations have suggested that dust particles in orbit around the star are responsible for the dimming, but studies of anomalies like this are expanding our knowledge of astrophysics, as well as casting a wider net in the search for technosignatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very enthusiastic about joining the Breakthrough Listen SETI search,\u201d said Prof. Sara Seager. \u201cOut of all the exoplanet endeavors only SETI holds the promise for identifying signs of intelligent life.\u201d\n\nBreakthrough Listen is a scientific program in search for evidence of technological life in the Universe. It aims to survey one million nearby stars, the entire galactic plane and 100 nearby galaxies at a wide range of radio and optical bands.\n\nThe Breakthrough Initiatives are a suite of scientific and technological programs, founded by Yuri Milner, investigating life in the Universe. Along with Breakthrough Listen, they include Breakthrough Watch, an optical search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars; and Breakthrough Starshot, the first significant attempt to design and develop a space probe capable of reaching another star.\n\nYuri Milner founded DST Global, which has become one of the world\u2019s leading technology investors and its portfolio has included some of the world's most prominent internet companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Airbnb, Spotify, Alibaba, and others.\n\nYuri lives in Silicon Valley with his family. He graduated in 1985 with an advanced degree in theoretical physics and subsequently conducted research in quantum field theory. Yuri and his wife Julia have partnered with Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, Pony Ma, and Anne Wojcicki to fund the Breakthrough Prizes \u2013 the world\u2019s largest scientific awards, honoring important, primarily recent, achievements in Fundamental Physics, Life Sciences and Mathematics. In July 2015, together with Stephen Hawking, Yuri launched the $100 million Breakthrough Listen initiative to reinvigorate the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the Universe; and in April 2016 they launched Breakthrough Starshot \u2013 a $100 million research and engineering program seeking to develop a technology for interstellar travel.\n\nMore information about TESS: tess.mit.edu\n\nBerkeley SETI: seti.berkeley.edu\n\nBreakthrough Initiatives: breakthroughinitiatives.org\n\nFor media inquiries: media@breakthroughprize.org\n\nOR\n\nRubenstein Communications, Inc.\n\nNew York, New York\n\nJanet Wootten\n\njwootten@rubenstein.com / +1.212.843.8024", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/favicon.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
