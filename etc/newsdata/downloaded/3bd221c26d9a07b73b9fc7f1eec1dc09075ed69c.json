Photo: Courtesy of SHOWTIME\n\nThe Showtime docuseries Couples Therapy is an experiment inspired by a single question: \u201cIs it possible to capture what goes on in therapy while preserving the authenticity?\u201d It seems implausible that a couple diving into their deepest arguments and traumas could be exactly the same in front of a camera as they would be in private. Doing so also raises a briar patch of thorny ethical concerns. But the show\u2019s mission, as envisioned by co-producers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg, is exactly that.\n\nThe idea of therapy sessions being broadcast as entertainment is hardly new, of course \u2014 figures like Dr. Drew regularly provide \u201ccounseling\u201d to reality TV personalities, and more than one Real Housewife has broadcast her therapy sessions on Bravo \u2014 but those attempts are almost always, to put it mildly, bad, both in terms of therapeutic practice and in the way they exploit trauma for ratings. And unlike Esther Perel\u2019s popular podcast, Where Should We Begin? \u2014 an example of therapy made public in a healthier and more serious way \u2014 Couples Therapy can\u2019t offer the semi-anonymity of an audio-only production, nor a one-session, one-episode format that ensures couples are only exposed for a single hour. On Couples Therapy, they show up for multiple sessions, episode after episode.\n\nThe couples of Couples Therapy had to be called \u201cparticipants\u201d rather than \u201cpatients,\u201d because a doctor-patient relationship comes with legally required confidentiality. Rather than paying to get therapy, the docuseries paid participants to receive it. Even aside from the strict ethical questions of medical practice, the gut-level voyeurism of watching couples discuss their sex lives, their childhoods, and their financial insecurities can trigger an icky, nauseous sense of overstepped boundaries and exploitation. But Couples Therapy tactfully avoids all those obstacles, suggesting that when filmmakers and participants approach this idea seriously enough, if there\u2019s enough care taken with the design and execution of a series, therapy made so widely visible can still be effective and meaningful for those involved. It can also make for very compelling television.\n\nThe idea for the show came from Kreigman\u2019s experiences with his parents, who are therapists, as well as from his and Steinberg\u2019s 2016 documentary, Weiner. The movie was about Anthony Weiner\u2019s New York City mayoral campaign, but the story was shown almost entirely through his marriage to Huma Abedin, allowing the movie to feel much more human and more complicated than a simple, win-or-loss political story. \u201cThe reality of their relationship was way more complicated than it appeared in the public,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cWe came away really wanting to delve into this truth of a relationship that\u2019s way more complicated than it appears on the surface.\u201d\n\nGoing from Anthony Weiner\u2019s marriage to a show about couples therapy was already a wild leap, but the mechanics of how to do it well were an even bigger concern: How do you find participants who won\u2019t turn it into a circus? How do you record the process without interfering? One key was persuading Orna Guralnik, the show\u2019s therapist, to sign on to the project. Her skill and care is a massive feature of Couples Therapy, in part because she\u2019s able to push back when necessary, but always with the clear goal of making useful connections for the participants rather than merely putting their pain on display for the cameras. Guralnik\u2019s insights are occasionally so revelatory that they hit the participants like a wave of surprise; they also give the audience compelling arcs to follow, full of twists and satisfying discoveries. But it took a long time to convince Guralnik to actually appear on camera. \u201cI thought I would talk to them like a consultant,\u201d she said, \u201csomeone who could give them some background information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had to earn my trust,\u201d Guralnik recalled. \u201cAre they going to try to make this into something that it is not? Is there going to be a wish for more drama?\u201d Once she understood their intent, though, Guralnik said she \u201cgot super excited about the possibility of someone documenting what really happens [in therapy] as opposed to the endless caricatures we have on film.\u201d\n\nProducers interviewed more than 1,000 couples during the casting process, trying to find people who were sincerely interested in the project, who truly wanted to get therapy, and who were inspired by the idea that witnessing real therapy could be helpful for others. They also needed to screen out individuals who might be harmed by the process of making the show. \u201cIt had to be people who were well enough to withstand the pressure and anxiety of this project,\u201d Guralnik said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get involved with people who are very vulnerable, a suicidal person or a drug addict. We didn\u2019t want to take people who were vulnerable and this could unravel them.\u201d Guralnik was not involved with casting and screening the couples; when she meets them in the first episode, it\u2019s for the very first time. She does know several of the other therapists who were involved with the process, though, and offered advice on what issues wouldn\u2019t be a good fit for the project.\n\nElaine and DeSean, whose last names aren\u2019t used in the show to allow them a small amount of anonymity, discovered the project when Elaine responded to an online recruitment post from the producers. (\u201cShe answers a lot of these types of internet questionnaires,\u201d DeSean said. \u201c\u201810 Facts Will Reveal How Much You\u2019re In Love With Each Other,\u2019 stuff like that.\u201d) They didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be chosen, but when producers asked them to participate, it was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d \u201cWe were in a space where it was a do-or-die situation for our relationship,\u201d Elaine said. The filmmakers credit their sincere desire to get help, rather than their desire to be on TV, as fundamental to the show\u2019s mission. \u201cThey were genuinely looking for help,\u201d Steinberg said, \u201cand this was an opportunity to work with a world-class therapist.\u201d\n\nThe other key to Couples Therapy is the space where the sessions take place. It looks like any typical therapist\u2019s office, a neutral room full of tasteful tchotchkes and comfortable, stylish furniture. It looks so unremarkable that it\u2019s easy to ignore the most important thing about it: You can\u2019t see any cameras. \u201cWe created an office where the cameras actually were concealed behind one-way glass,\u201d Kriegman said. \u201cThey could come in, sit in the waiting room, do an hour session with Orna, leave, and never once interact with any element of production or see a camera.\u201d\n\nAnother couple in the \u201coffice\u201d with Dr. Orna.

That allowed us to forget that we were being filmed. It doesn\u2019t occur to you because there\u2019s not a camera in your face,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cEvery week you\u2019d go in knowing that there\u2019s cameras somewhere,\u201d DeSean added, \u201cbut three minutes into the session, you forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t include it in the editing,\u201d Guralnik explained, \u201cbut for each of these couples, there was some level of checking in on how they were feeling about being part of the project. But it was more a concern for us than for them. They were like, Yeah, yeah, there\u2019s a camera, but can we talk about what happened yesterday?\u201d\n\nThere is one more participant in Couples Therapy: Guralnik\u2019s dog, Nico, an adorable, mid-size black-and-white pooch with floppy ears and bright-blue eyes, who bounces over to greet couples as they walk in the door to Guralnik\u2019s office. (Several participants lean over to pet her before sitting down on the sofa across from Guralnik\u2019s chair.) \u201cNico is a deeply soothing presence, reminding people of a baseline of safety and goodness,\u201d Guralnik said. \u201cI have seen very tense and guarded people reveal sweet and playful sides in response to her.\u201d\n\nFor the filmmakers, for Guralnik, and for Elaine and DeSean, Couples Therapy is an experiment that worked. \u201cI was utterly floored,\u201d Guralnik said, \u201cin awe of their capacity to translate the essence of each treatment into the language of film.\u201d That may be due to something Kriegman and Steinberg realized several months into the process of making the show: Therapy and filmmaking are a lot alike. \u201cThe parallel between therapy and filmmaking is really fascinating. You gather the raw material, and then you sift through it to find the story that is the true story. It was surprising how similar that was to the editing process,\u201d Kriegman said.\n\nIn the case of Elaine and DeSean, that true story began with DeSean\u2019s frustration with Elaine \u2014 how much she contacts him at work, how needy she seems, how overbearing and dramatic he felt like she could become, often with no underlying logic or explanation. For Elaine, the frustration was inverse: DeSean was ignoring her, drifting farther away from her needs and desires. Over the course of the show\u2019s eight episodes, Guralnik uncovers a history of early experiences that had been \u201ccoloring\u201d the couples\u2019 understanding of one another, often in ways they were completely unconscious of. \u201cPrior to going through [the show] I don\u2019t know that I heard a lot of what he said,\u201d Elaine told me. \u201cI\u2019m painted by my own stuff.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Elaine and DeSean whether the experience felt more like making a TV show or being in therapy, they didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe latter,\u201d DeSean said. \u201cI think Dr. Orna saved our lives, our marriage. Definitely.\u201d", "description": "The Showtime docuseries Couples Therapy is an experiment inspired by a single question: \u201cIs it possible to capture what goes on in therapy while preserving the authenticity?\u201d Here\u2019s how the show pulled it off.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-couples-therapy-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
