You might need to spend an hour or two making phone calls and seeing what you qualify for. Don\u2019t just go for the first mortgage rate you get,\u201d Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet, told FOX Business.\n\nHere\u2019s how to choose the best mortgage:\n\nKnow your credit score and work to improve it\n\nYour credit history is how lenders determine your mortgage interest rate. So be sure to check your credit for any potential errors, and do your best to make payments on outstanding debts like student loans or credit card bills before you start applying for mortgages.\n\n\u201cTry to get your score as high as possible because that will help you qualify for lower interest rate,\u201d Palmer advised.\n\nTypes of mortgages\n\nFirst-time homebuyers can typically choose from two main types of mortgages: a conventional loan, which comes from a bank, credit union or private lender or a government-backed loan.\n\nConventional Loans:\n\nNew homebuyers who will typically qualify for a conventional loan must have good credit (some lenders can go as low as a 620 credit score) and can expect to put down at least 5 percent, according to NerdWallet. Terms can typically range from 15 to 30 years.\n\nGovernment-backed loans\n\nIf a home buyer has good credit but does not have a lot in savings for a down payment, they could see if they qualify for a government-backed loan.\n\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) are loans that allow down payments as low as 3.5 percent of the purchase price. VA loans, on the other hand, insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs, offer buyers low or sometimes no down payment options. VA loans are offered only to current military service members and veterans.\n\nUSDA loans come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and are offered to rural property buyers who meet income requirements.\n\nGet pre-qualified\n\nGetting pre-qualified means a lender will take a look at your finances and say how much it\u2019s willing to lend you and outline the terms. First-time buyers can have the upper hand over others if they have a preapproval letter when applying for a home.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCompare mortgage rates\n\nGet at least three quotes and compare both rates and fees. NerdWallet suggests asking lenders if you can buy discount points, or prepay interest upfront to get a lower interest rate on your loan.\n\nFixed-rate and ARMs\n\nFixed-rate mortgages mean the interest rate will stay the same throughout the term of your loan. Currently, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.56 percent, according to Freddie Mac. This is one of the most popular types.\n\nFixed-rate mortgages typically tend to have a higher interest rate than adjustable-rate mortgages, which have low, fixed rates for a short period of time (usually three to seven years) before they reset. These types of rates are usually more appealing for young homebuyers who may not plan on staying put for more than a few years.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "How to get the best mortgage rate as a first-time home buyer.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/a29e050e-mortgage-monopoly-gettyimages-49598-077f40ea3546c510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
