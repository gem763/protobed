I don\u2019t think anyone alive \u2014 just the Holocaust survivors \u2014 has seen the same size of what she saw,\u201d Fayyad told AFP. \u201cThe barbaric siege, the longest running siege in Syria\u2019s modern history in Eastern Ghouta \u2026 Nobody can imagine this.\u201d\n\nAmani Ballour, the young female pediatrician who is the film\u2019s subject, ran a subterranean network of tunnels and makeshift wards and operating rooms beneath the final rebel foothold at the gates of Damascus.\n\nShe and her team were the first to respond and the last hope for many civilians \u2014 including children \u2014 hit by relentless waves of Russian and Syrian regime bombing, until a 2018 chemical attack finally forced them to evacuate.\n\nDespite her heroics, Fayyad said Amani took some convincing that the world would be interested in a film about her story.\n\n\u2013 Harrowing footage \u2013\n\n\u201cWhy do you think they will respond when there\u2019s bigger issues happening around us?\u201d Amani asked Fayyad, who admitted he did not have an answer.\n\n\u201cI want to try \u2014 I want to trust that people could respond to this,\u201d he recalled telling her. \u201cI don\u2019t think people will (be able to) move their eyes from that, from what you do.\u201d\n\nThe result is a harrowing 102-minute documentary, shot by a local camera crew still living in Ghouta, showing life below and above ground as bombs rain and casualties are rushed in on stretchers and wheelbarrows.\n\nThe film \u2014 from National Geographic and Danish Documentary Films \u2014 was directed by Fayyad, in daily contact with the crew from rebel-held northern Syria.\n\nFayyad, the first Syrian director nominated for an Oscar with 2017\u2019s \u201cLast Men in Aleppo,\u201d instructed them to depict everyday life in claustrophobic, cinema verite style \u2014 without voice-over or direct-to-camera interviews.\n\nAmongst the tears and tragedy there are vignettes of everyday life, from a young nurse\u2019s creative attempts to cook for 150 people with scant supplies, to a secret birthday party featuring surgical gloves for balloons.\n\nFootage of medics scrambling to deal with the chlorine gas attack\u2019s deadly aftermath is especially searing.\n\nIn addition to her bravery, Fayyad chose Amani for another reason. She was an extremely rare \u2014 possibly the first \u2014 female hospital director in deeply patriarchal Syria.\n\nEarly in the film she is berated by a desperate patient\u2019s husband, who blames the hospital\u2019s lack of medicine on its female director.\n\n\u2013 \u2018I feel guilty\u2019 \u2013\n\nFayyad, who grew up in a female-dominated household with a Kurdish mother and seven sisters, said he is acutely aware of harassment and even violence against women who refuse to conform.\n\n\u201cAlong with the torture I\u2019ve experienced, I heard the sounds of women who were tortured because of their gender,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was threatened that they will bring my mom and my sisters to the prison.\n\n\u201cThere were times when I heard the sounds and I felt like it was my mother and my sister (being tortured).\u201d\n\nAmani was able to escape to northern Syria, and eventually Europe via Turkey \u2014 joining the refugee exodus which has sparked intense, polarized debate in the West.\n\nFayyad himself was earlier smuggled to safety across the Jordan border, and now travels between his home in Copenhagen and work in northern Syria.\n\nLike many, he has been alarmed by recent events which saw US forces withdraw from Kurdish-held northern Syria, and Turkey launch an offensive across the border.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happening now it\u2019s very, very scary because it\u2019s extending the time of the war in Syria, and there are more victims,\u201d he said, predicting another wave of refugees will follow.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not there, I feel guilty,\u201d admitted Fayyad, who spoke to AFP in Los Angeles. \u201cLike I\u2019m sitting here away, and thinking every day about my family and my friends and colleagues who are suffering.\n\n\u201cI feel like you have to do something\u2026 and bring these voices. I try to bring the hope for these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cave\u201d opens in select US theaters on Friday.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Oscar-nominated Syrian director Feras Fayyad has risked his life to chronicle the atrocities of the Assad regime, and suffered", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/c171b5_syrians-enter-tunnel-leading-an-underground-hospital-in-douma-in-eartern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
