They return home to host Colorado on Monday, and with a day off Tuesday, there\u2019s a decent chance a few of Coach Todd Reirden\u2019s players will be in the stands at Nationals Park for Game 4.\n\nAD\n\nCapitals Evgeny Kuznetsov, John Carlson, Nicklas Backstrom, Braden Holtby and Garnet Hathaway attended Game 3 of the NLDS on Sunday. In the Capitals\u2019 latest show of support for their baseball-playing brethren, the entire team sported red Nationals T-shirts under their suit jackets on Wednesday\u2019s trip to Nashville. The Capitals continue to use a Nationals batting helmet as their \u201cHard Hat\u201d award, which goes to the most deserving player after every game. The Nationals wore Capitals hats during batting practice during the Capitals\u2019 Stanley Cup title run in 2018.\n\nCapitals radio play-by-play man John Walton and several colleagues, including the NBC Sports Washington broadcast team of Joe Beninati and Craig Laughlin, gathered at a Nashville bar to watch Game 5. They went wild when Howie Kendrick\u2019s 10th-inning grand slam gave the Nationals the lead for good.\n\nAD\n\nCaptain, the Capitals\u2019 very good dog, presumably slept through Wednesday night\u2019s excitement. Oshie woke up to a proposed \u201cfriendly wager\u201d on the Nationals-Cardinals NLCS from former NHL defenseman Barret Jackman, his teammate for seven years with the Blues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Oshie replied, without knowing the terms.\n\nAfter Wednesday, who would dare bet against the Nationals? Certainly not some of their biggest fans.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Alex Ovechkin and his teammates wore Nats T-shirts for their trip to Nashville on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
