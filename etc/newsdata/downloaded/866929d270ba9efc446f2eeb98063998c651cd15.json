Canada and several other countries cut diplomatic ties with Syria in 2012 after the Houla massacre killed dozens of people. Syria maintains two honorary consul offices in Vancouver and Montreal.\n\nCanada\u2019s Maclean\u2019s magazine reported on Monday that Montreal businessman Waseem Ramli, a supporter and ally of Assad\u2019s regime, was appointed to the Montreal consul position.\n\nThe appointment, put forward by the Syrian government and approved by Global Affairs Canada, as the country\u2019s foreign ministry is known, will take effect on Oct 1.\n\nIn an interview with Maclean\u2019s, Ramli confirmed that he is a supporter of the Assad regime, was vetted by Ottawa before being approved and would treat all Syrian immigrants equally. He also described the Syrian White Helmets rescue workers as a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d affiliated with al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cShocked by the comments made to the press by the Syrian Honorary Consul in Montreal and the views he has espoused publicly on social media and elsewhere,\u201d Freeland, who heads the department that approved Ramli\u2019s appointment, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNeither my team nor I were aware that officials at Global Affairs Canada had approved this appointment.\u201d\n\nFreeland said she has asked the department to look into the appointment immediately.\n\nShe told reporters in Quebec on Tuesday that \u201cthe current situation is unacceptable and we intend to respond very quickly,\u201d but added she felt it was important to \u201chear out\u201d the public servants in Global Affairs Canada, who made the decision to approve Ramli.\n\nAt a Tuesday campaign stop, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government was \u201cobviously ... quite seized with this issue\u201d and that he had spoken with Freeland about the matter earlier.\n\nCanada accepted 58,650 Syrian refugees between 2015 and 2018 through both government and private citizen sponsorship, according to the most recent government statistics.\n\nFreeland told reporters Canada is \u201cvery proud\u201d to have welcomed so many Syrian refugees, many affiliated with the White Helmets, and said she wants them to \u201chear very clearly that Canada supports them, that Canada condemns the Assad regime for its war crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have relatives in Syria and we care about them,\u201d said Muzna Dureid, who moved to Montreal from Syria in 2016. \u201cAny kind of activities we do, demonstrations or any activism against the Syrian regime ... they will send it to security in Syria. That\u2019s what scares us as Syrians in Montreal.\u201d", "description": "Canada Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has condemned her government's approval of a supporter of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad to a consular post in Canada, and said she would look into the matter.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433469550&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1KL-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
