Or do you move on and find someone else?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIf you find yourself in this precarious position and decide to give it a go again, you need to be careful.\n\nAt least, that's according to marriage therapist Dr Jane Greer.\n\nSpeaking to Cosmopolitan, she said: \"You have to be careful if you\u2019re going to date a zombie.\n\n\"It\u2019s essential to have very clear plans in place for connecting, when you\u2019re going to be spending time, and how often you\u2019ll text.\"\n\nSome other things to consider before agreeing to another date are whether or not the individual apologised for ghosting you in the first place, whether there are any other red flags about this person that concern you and where your standards are at - because you deserve to be treated well.", "description": "Just in time for Halloween here's everything you need to know about zombieing", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16507948.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Zombies-Invade-Sydney-For-Halloween.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
