REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nIt was an agonising and heartwarming end to the opening heat of the men\u2019s 5,000m as a distressed Busby, near collapse, was rescued on the final lap by Dabo and helped home, with the two men crossing the line to a rousing ovation at Khalifa Stadium.\n\n\u201cThe main objective was to represent my country as well as possible and I\u2019m happy I could help the other guy,\u201d Portuguese-speaking Dabo told Reuters. \u201cI saw he was not running in the right way, he was leaning, I realised he wasn\u2019t going to finish.\n\n\u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to beat my personal record, so when I realised that, it was better to go for the main aim, which was to finish the race. My thoughts were to help him finish, that is the point of the race.\u201d\n\nDespite the searing temperatures in Doha, the race was run in pleasant spring-like conditions thanks to the innovative air-conditioning system at the Khalifa stadium.\n\nThe heat was won by Ethiopia\u2019s Selemon Barega in a time of 13 minutes 24.69 seconds but it was the heroic effort unfolding behind the winner that brought the crowd to its feet.\n\nAs the pair crossed the finish line nearly five minutes later, Dabo held Busby until emergency personnel appeared, with the Aruban put in a wheelchair and taken from the track.\n\nThere was no immediate word on 33-year-old Busby\u2019s condition.\n\n\u201cHe thanked me and he was suffering, he couldn\u2019t really speak ....in any case, we don\u2019t speak the same language so our conversation was never going to be very long,\u201d said Dabo.\n\nAsked about the crowd\u2019s reaction to his gesture of sportsmanship a humble Dabo, 26, said nothing had changed.\n\n\u201cI continue being the same as before \u2014 I\u2019m proud to be here representing my country.\u201d", "description": "Guinea-Bissau's Braima Dabo will not win any medals at the world championships but he won the admiration of the crowd on Friday by helping exhausted Aruban Johnathan Busby across the 5,000 metres finish line in an astonishing display of sportsmanship.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434819346&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R06T-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
