AAPL -1.46% a reprieve from tariffs on 10 items, including a power supply and a logic board, that are imported from China.\n\nThey were among the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports first targeted for tariffs in September 2018.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on Friday granted Apple exemptions on its Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2 and various internal components. The exclusions cover a time period from September 2018 to August 2020, and the U.S. will refund tariffs already paid.\n\nThe exclusions do not apply to other Apple items facing tariffs later this year, such as the Apple Watch, iPhones or AirPods, although the tech giant may seek more exemptions in the future.\n\nThe dollar value of the exemptions couldn\u2019t be determined. Such parts imported from China are subject to tariffs of 25% of their value with the levies scheduled to rise to 30% on Oct. 15.\n\nFive other Apple exemption requests, including power and data cables and a circuit board, are still under review, according to the USTR.\n\nDuring an earnings call July 30, Tim Cook told analysts that Apple was seeking the exclusions so it could continue assembling some Mac Pros in the U.S. as it began doing with a version launched in 2013. Various parts for the Mac Pro are made in China. \u201cWe\u2019re explaining that and hope for a positive outcome,\u201d he said of the tariff exclusion process.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment further. In seeking individual exclusions, the company said, \u201cThere are no other sources for this proprietary, Apple-designed component.\u201d\n\nA few days before Mr. Cook\u2019s comments, President Trump tweeted: \u201cApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if any of Friday\u2019s exclusions relate to a new Mac Pro Apple revealed in June or an older model made in Austin, Texas, since 2013.\n\nThe company planned to assemble the new Mac Pro, which is slated for release later this year, in China, using Taiwanese manufacturer Quanta Computer Inc. It also was making contingency plans to shift production elsewhere, if needed, because of U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe USTR didn\u2019t say why it granted the specific exemptions Friday.\n\nThe trade representative\u2019s office has been granting exclusions on a rolling basis for over a year. Only at the end of June could companies apply for relief from the tranche of tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods that took effect in September 2018. The levies were initially set at 10%. But as trade relations with Beijing deteriorated this year, the U.S. raised those tariffs to 25%.\n\nOn Friday, the USTR granted exceptions on more than 400 items, primarily applications that had been filed on earlier tranches of tariffs.\n\nOther items granted reprieves included some familiar to consumers, such as miniature Christmas tree light sets and retractable dog leashes. Other exemptions included highly specific and obscure chemicals.\n\n\u2014Tripp Mickle in San Francisco and Chad Day in Washington contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration has given Apple a reprieve from tariffs on 10 items, including a power supply and a logic board, that are imported from China.", "authors": ["Josh Zumbrun", "Anthony Debarros", "Josh.Zumbrun Wsj.Com", "Anthony.Debarros Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109527/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
