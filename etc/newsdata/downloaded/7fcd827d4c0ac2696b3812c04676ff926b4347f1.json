PCSB's position was that its unpaid rental could be offset by money owed by MMSB for its non-compliance of two settlement letters in relation to the same store.\n\nAfter MMSB filed notice, PCSB's lawyers filed for the injunction on July 29, 2019, and the case's hearing date was set on Sept 19.\n\nAccording to Parkson in its August disclosure, MMSB\u2019s solicitors had given an undertaking to the court that it would not file any winding up petition against PCSB until after a decision had been made on the injunction application. But after the injunction was filed, PCSB had received a legal letter from MMSB alleging wrongful termination of its lease and claiming about RM77.9 million for reinstatement charges, rental charges for the lease period, double rental and ancillary charges.\n\nPCSB said the claimed amount was grossly inflated and disputed it. MMSB did not proceed with formal legal action on this claim.\n\nShares of mainboard-listed Parkson Retail Asia, which is on the SGX's watch list, were unchanged at S$0.022 as at 9.15am.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - PARKSON Retail Asia's unit, Parkson Corporation Sdn Bhd (PCSB), has defended against a legal claim in Malaysia of about RM1.5 million (S$500,000) by the landlord of its M Square Mall store, Millennium Mall Sdn Bhd (MMSB). .
