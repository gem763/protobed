He received less than \u00a35,000.\n\nProfessor Gosden, an expert in European archaeology, took his lawyers to court claiming they failed to act to stop his mother, Dr Jean Weddell, selling her house to move in with her lover and civil partner Miss Cook. He only learned of the sale years later, after his mother\u2019s death.\n\nA High Court judge has now ruled that while Professor Gosden\u2019s lawyers should have delayed the sale of his mother\u2019s house, she still had full capacity to make her own decisions, and ultimately would have sold it and moved anyway.\n\nMiss Cook's second elderly female lover was Dr Jean Weddell and they became civil partners in 2007.

She qualified as a barrister in 1997 but was suspended in 2015 after being twice caught drink-driving within a few months and banned from the roads for five years. Miss Cook had insisted in court that she was not living in a \u2018threesome\u2019 with the two rich, elderly Jeans.\n\nThe High Court in London heard that Professor Gosden\u2019s mother, Dr Weddell, had been a pioneering female doctor in Britain\u2019s formerly men-only medical schools.\n\nMiss Cook's lover Jean Southworth QC who had been a Bletchley Park codebreaker. Their physical relationship ended in in the 1990s, after which the older woman became her \u2018adopted ma and mentor\u2019\n\nBut she had given up her son for adoption. Professor Gosden was brought up in Australia before being reunited with Dr Weddell in 1987. Relations were friendly, and she told him she would leave him her Edwardian terraced house in Kennington, south London, now worth \u00a31.25million.\n\nHowever, things changed after she met Miss Cook. The barrister had already met Jean Southworth QC, who had been a Bletchley Park codebreaker and went on to sit as a judge for 20 years. Miss Cook told the High Court last year that they became lovers, but their physical relationship ended in the 1990s, after which the older woman became her \u2018adopted ma and mentor\u2019.\n\nA decade later Miss Cook took her second elderly female lover, Dr Weddell, and they became civil partners in 2007. Not long afterwards, Dr Weddell sold her house for \u00a3710,000, without telling her son, and moved with Miss Cook to the Isle of Wight.\n\nBefore long, Miss Cook was living with both Dr Weddell and Miss Southworth in the same cottage in the centre of Newport on the island. Miss Southworth died of septicaemia in 2010 aged 83. Her will, written on the Isle of Wight three months earlier, left the bulk of her \u00a35.3million estate to Miss Cook.\n\nIt was contested unsuccessfully by Miss Southworth\u2019s godson Nicholas Falla. Then, in 2013, Dr Weddell died aged 84. Her estate had already been largely gifted to Miss Cook.\n\nOxford University professor Christopher Gosden, son of Dr Weddell, has been told he has no valid claim on the estate of his mother, which ended up mostly going to Miss Cook\n\nJudge Mark Pelling QC has now ruled that while Professor Gosden\u2019s lawyers could have prevented the sale of his mother\u2019s house without his knowledge, he was not due any compensation because his mother could ultimately have insisted that she wanted to sell her house and move in with her younger lover.\n\nThere was no evidence she lacked the mental capacity to make rational decisions.\n\nAnd he said that Miss Cook\u2019s huge inheritance from her other elderly lover, Miss Southworth, did not mean Dr Weddell could not have wanted to give her more.\n\nDr Weddell told Professor Gosden she would leave him her Edwardian terraced house in Kennington, south London, now worth \u00a31.25million\n\nJudge Pelling, whose judgment was issued in February but has only now come to light, ruled that it appeared reasonable for Miss Cook to move her two wealthy Jeans in to the same cottage.\n\nAnd Judge Pelling said that as far as Dr Weddell was concerned: \u2018It is entirely unsurprising that she would want to leave the bulk of her estate to Ms Cook, her civil partner, irrespective of Ms Cook\u2019s wealth from other sources.\u2019\n\nMiss Cook declined Daily Mail requests for comment.", "description": "Wendy Cook's two lovers, Jean Southworth QC and , lived with her in the Isle of Wight.
