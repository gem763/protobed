On nearly every major issue, Biden has either exponentially increased the scope of what Clinton proposed or advocated for new ideas that most Democrats would have up until recently considered fringe.\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s embrace of an unabashedly liberal agenda cuts against some perceptions of him, both from progressives who criticize Biden as insufficiently bold and center-left allies who argue he can appeal to voters in the middle against in an election against Donald Trump.\n\nBut for a candidate who has generally kept within his party\u2019s mainstream during his five-decade career, it also underlines just how much \u2014 and how rapidly \u2014 the Democratic Party has changed in the three years since Clinton was its standard bearer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mcclatchydc.Com News Politics-Government Election Campaigns"], "top_image": ""}
