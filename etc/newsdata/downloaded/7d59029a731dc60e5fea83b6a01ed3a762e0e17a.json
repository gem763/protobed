That caps a third quarter that\u2019s seen the index rise 3.4%, its strongest quarterly rise since a 5% rally in the second quarter of 2018.\n\nThat could be a factor as earnings season gets under way. A strong dollar can be a headwind \u2014 and a handy excuse for disappointing performance \u2014 for exporters, including large-cap multinationals. So it will be interesting to see how much the dollar\u2019s strength factors into management discussions of third-quarter performance. Compared to a year ago, the DXY is up around 4.4%, while the euro EURUSD, -0.0092% is nursing a 6.1% year-over-year decline. The dollar has lost ground versus the Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.02%, however, down 6.1% year-over year.\n\nWhen it comes to the dollar index, however, it\u2019s the euro that sets the tone. The euro is weighted at nearly 60% of the DXY. The shared currency, meanwhile, is trading at its lowest versus the dollar since May 2017 after slipping below the $1.10 level earlier this month.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve remains in easing mode, the European Central Bank has also shifted toward looser policy \u2014 moving to cut its deposit rate further into negative territory and restarting its bond-buying program in a controversial decision earlier this month.\n\nNevertheless, as gloom builds around the eurozone economy, with Germany threatening to tip into recession and inflation remaining stubbornly low, many analysts see further weakness in store for the shared currency.\n\n\u201cUntil the eurozone reaches a more credible fiscal/monetary policy mix, I expect inflation expectations and EUR/USD to fall further,\u201d said Thomas Harr, global head of fixed-income and currency research at Danske Bank, in a Monday note.\n\nKit Juckes, global macro strategist at Societe Generale, sees the euro continuing a pattern that saw it make new cycle lows \u201cin late April, late May, late July, late August, and now late-September.\u201d\n\nSee: No end in sight for ECB\u2019s inflation problem\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s true to form, the downtrend can continue for a few more months, even if the pace is very restrained,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe \u2018news\u2019 isn\u2019t new, the market\u2019s short and bearish, and further out, forward-looking indicators are looking brighter. That said, new lows are likely in the weeks ahead.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. dollar remains a bulldozer as the third quarter draws to a close.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS332_dollar_ZG_20190930152747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
