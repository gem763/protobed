It helps you understand your body and how strong you can be,\u201d said Sanna, who is enjoying his best start to a season with six winners so far. \u201cThe [combat aspect of the] training is very, very easy.\u201d\n\nLong known for his relentless fitness regime that included gruelling runs and bike rides, Sanna missed large chunks of last season because of a shattered hip and a broken ankle and says he is no longer interested in punishing his body.\n\n\u201cI just train easy now. I was so stupid before to do many things to put pain on my body because everything was damaging. Now I just take it much easier. I train, but just easy, not stupid,\u201d he said, adding that his preparation for Sunday\u2019s races was a far cry from that of years past.\n\n\u201cI woke up, I was light so I just watched Netflix, did some warm-up exercises and relaxed my mind before the races.\u201d\n\nSanna also travelled to Thailand to train during the off-season and says his most recent trip was a breath of fresh air.\n\n\u201cYou really work hard. Those four days, if I stayed in Hong Kong it would have made me upset because I see the horses running that I should have been riding,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt refreshes my mind. Last year when I wasn\u2019t riding I was always stuck in Hong Kong and it drives you mad. I think in this game the mind and of course your health are the most important things.\u201d\n\nSanna continues to practise Muay Thai in Hong Kong and believes it has contributed to his strong start to the term, with the Italian\u2019s full book of rides at Happy Valley on Wednesday night testament to the form he is in.\n\nThe 34-year-old is confident he has \u201cplenty of nice rides\u201d and is thrilled with the support he is getting from a range of trainers.\n\nAs good as Sanna\u2019s start to the season has been, he\u2019s been quite reliant on first-year trainer Douglas Whyte \u2013 20 of his 60 rides and four of his six winners have come for the South African \u2013 but he teams up with six trainers on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m riding more for other trainers, which is good. I\u2019m looking to get more support from other trainers, it\u2019s good to ride more winners for other people,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m happy to ride winners for Douglas, but you can\u2019t rely on one trainer.\u201d\n\nWhile he partners Winning Endeavour, Bright Kid and Last Kingdom for Whyte, he also rides for Francis Lui Kin-wai (Golden Kid), Chris So Wai-yin (Cerefino), Michael Chang Chun-wai (Happy Rocky), Me Tsui Yu-sak (Divine Unicorn) and Tony Millard (Sichuan Dar).", "description": "He has a reputation as a fitness freak but in-form jockey Alberto Sanna has recalibrated his approach after a string of serious injuries, turning to Muay Thai as he looks to train smarter....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/28/50783f84-f948-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_144610.JPG?itok=M8Co_uQC&v=1572245180", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
