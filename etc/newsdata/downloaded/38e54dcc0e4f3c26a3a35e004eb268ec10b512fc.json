But Johnson insisted Wednesday that \"under no circumstances\" would there be customs checks at the border in Northern Ireland under the proposed deal.\n\nBREXIT SAGA: WHAT HAPPENS NOW AFTER SUSPENSION OF UK PARLIAMENT RULED ILLEGAL?\n\nJohnson said late Tuesday that convincing the EU to strike a deal would not be \"a walk in the park,\" but he thought the agreement could be reached by the time the bloc's leaders meet for a key summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18.\n\n\"We have made huge progress and I hope very much that in the course of the next few days we are going to get there,\" he told a reception at the Conservative conference.\n\nThe European Union said Wednesday it will give any proposal from Johnson serious legal vetting before saying whether it is worthy of being a basis for future talks.\n\nJOHNSON TAUNTS OPPOSITION, DEMANDS NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE AMID BREXIT TURMOIL\n\nThe European Commission said in a statement that \"once received, we will examine (the UK text) objectively & in light of well-known criteria.\"\n\nJohnson has said the U.K. can handle any bumps that come from tumbling out of the bloc without a deal, which would mean the instant imposition of customs checks and other barriers between Britain and the EU, its biggest trading partner.\n\nBut the U.K. government and businesses both say the disruptions would be substantial, with the flow of goods coming into Britain through the port of Dover cut in half.\n\nMany lawmakers want to prevent a no-deal exit, and have passed a law that compels the government to seek a delay to Brexit if it can't get an agreement with the EU by Oct. 19. Johnson says he won't do that \u2014 though he also insists he will obey the law.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhether Britain leaves the EU on Oct. 31 or not, Johnson is likely to face the verdict of voters in an election before the end of the year.\n\n\"Voters are desperate for us to focus on their other priorities. What people want \u2014 what leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants - is to move on,\" he'll say.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u00a0is submitting the U.K.\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d for a Brexit deal to the European Union on Wednesday. \u201cWe can, we must and we will\u201d leave the bloc before the\u00a0Oct. 31 deadline, he insisted.", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/boris-johnson.jpg"}
