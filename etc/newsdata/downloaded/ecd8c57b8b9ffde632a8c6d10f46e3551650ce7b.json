After his teacher's post about the shirt went viral, UT decided to sell it online in the campus store.\n\nLaura Snyder wrote on Facebook last week that her student had been extremely excited to show his support of UT.\n\n\"When I told my students about this day a week before, this particular child came to me and told me that he wanted to wear a University of Tennessee shirt, but he didn\u2019t have one. We discussed that he could wear an orange shirt to show his spirit. He told me every day leading up to it that he had an orange shirt that he was going to wear,\" she said. \"So when the day finally arrived, he was SO EXCITED to show me his shirt. I was impressed that he took it one step further to make his own label.\"\n\nBut some of his classmates bullied him over the homemade shirt.\n\n\"After lunch, he came back to my room, put his head [on] his desk and was crying. Some girls at the lunch table next to his [who didn\u2019t even participate in college colors day] had made fun of his sign that he had attached to his shirt. He was DEVASTATED,\" she wrote.\n\nSnyder's post was shared more than 11,000 times and caught the attention of the university, which embraced the student's design and school spirit.\n\nBULLIED STUDENT'S HOMEMADE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE SHIRT NOW AN OFFICIAL DESIGN\n\n\"Vols were touched to learn of the student's heart for the University of Tennesse and sent UT gifts of all sorts.

Orders are expected to ship later this month.\n\n\"It was so heartwarming. My student was so amazed at all the goodies in the box,\" Snyder said. \"He proudly put on the jersey and one of the many hats in the box. All who saw had either goosebumps or tears while we explained that he had inspired and touched the lives of so many people.\"\n\n\"When I told him that his design was being made into a real shirt and people wanted to wear it, his jaw dropped,\" she added. \"He had a big smile on his face, walked taller, and I could tell his confidence grew today!\"\n\nMore than 50,000 shirts have been pre-sold, and all proceeds will go the Stomp Out Bullying nonprofit, according to the university.\n\nNCAA TELLS CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR COLLEGE ATHLETE 'FAIR PAY' BILL IS 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n\"Alumni, fans, and honorary Volunteers have stepped up in response to this story,\" the school said, adding: \"University officials have spoken several times with the boy\u2019s mother, who has expressed gratitude to the university and said the family has been deeply touched by the overwhelming outpouring from people around the world.\"\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe University of Tennessee has also said it plans to cover the cost of the student's scholarship separately, should he decide to attend and be accepted.\n\nThis year marks UT's 225th anniversary, and the fourth-grader's story is part of the school's celebration, the university said, adding: \"Volunteers light the way for others across Tennessee and throughout the world.\"", "description": "The Florida fourth-grader who was bullied for his original T-shirt design showing off University of Tennessee spirit has been offered a full scholarship there, the university said Thursday.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/e7d2a6a6-Bully-T-Shirt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
