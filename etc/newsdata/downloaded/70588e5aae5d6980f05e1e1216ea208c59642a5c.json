LOUIS (Reuters) - It is \u201cinevitable\u201d that central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve will start issuing digital currency, Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank president Patrick Harker said on Wednesday, while cautioning that the United States should not be the nation to lead such a move.\n\n\u201cFrankly I don\u2019t think we should be the first mover as a nation to do this,\u201d Harker said at a community banking conference here, given the dollar\u2019s role as the world\u2019s reserve currency and the need to test out new technology. But he added: \u201cIt is inevitable ... I think it is better for us to start getting our hands around it.\u201d\n\nHis comment came in response to a question about the Fed\u2019s decision to create its own real-time payments system.\n\nHarker said with the so-called \u201cFedNow\u201d service in the works, \u201cI am looking at the next five years after that. What comes next? I do think it is something around digital currency.\u201d\n\nThe Fed and other central banks are debating both how to approach the rise of privately issued cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and examining how the underlying blockchain technology might change traditional central banking.\n\nThe general mood is skeptical - about whether private cryptocurrencies will ever become large enough, or behave enough like true currencies, to require regulation, or to threaten the ability of traditional central banks to conduct monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from that,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in June, describing the technology as in its \u201cinfancy.\u201d Other Fed officials have said that the benefits of a central bank issued digital currency were \u201cnot obvious.\u201d\n\nBut there is also concern, particularly over Facebook\u2019s potential to pull a large financial consortium together behind its Libra initiative. And globally, other central banks and institutions including the Bank for International Settlements have begun to take the possible spread of central bank digital currencies as more of a possibility.\n\nHarker acknowledged his view was \u201cin the minority\u201d at the Fed right now. But his staff has begun research on the issue, and he said he is organizing a small research conference for academics to be held early next year.", "description": "It is \"inevitable\" that central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve will start issuing digital currency, Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank president Patrick Harker said on Wednesday, while cautioning that the United States should not be the nation to lead such a move.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
