Cryptojacking and ransomware are new exploits that join the traditional list of computer threats from botnets, Denial-of-Service (DDoS), phishing, and malware.\n\nRansomware: 11 steps to help keep hackers at bay Falling victim to ransomware could put your vital business or personal data at risk of being lost forever. These steps can help bolster your defences.\n\nOptiv says that cyber criminals and nation-state hackers are learning from each other and becoming more successful. They also try to spoof each other by adopting similar techniques to try and confuse investigators.\n\nSpecial feature Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity Today's security threats have expanded in scope and seriousness. There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when information security isn't handled properly.

Over a seven-month period the hackers kept changing the method of their attacks to try and disguise their origin.\n\nCheck Point researchers said the hackers had put a lot of effort into creating documents with useful information in formats that are associated with government documents. Users became infected when they viewed the documents.\n\nUS government agencies are especially vulnerable to this novel attack warns Check Point.\n\nCrowdstrike issued a report this week that named Chinese nation-state hackers as the most active of any country, and they have attacked the largest number of industries: chemical, gaming, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, technology and telecom.\n\nForemski's Take\n\nThe tools and techniques developed by nation-state backed hacking groups are helping cyber criminals loot hundreds of millions in cash and IP. As governments seek backdoors to security systems and their cyber-security teams develop advanced hacking tools it is the cyber criminals that benefit the most by exploiting weakened security systems and using the same tools.\n\nAn example is the US National Security Agency's EternalBlue hacking tool which is in the hands of cyber criminals and is being used in ransomware attacks on US cities and government agencies.\n\nThe nation-state efforts to develop sophisticated attack software that then leaks into the wild is exacerbating an already dire cyber security threat landscape. The nation-state groups don't appear to be developing any defensive technologies which means an ever growing arsenal of advanced attack technologies that cyber criminals can use, adapt and improve.\n\nWhen governments justify their rights to access secure systems in the name of protecting national interests they create the means to endanger the very things the they seek to protect.", "description": "It's difficult to tell hackers apart says Optiv as US government agencies are warned by Check Point about new threats from a Chinese government-backed group.", "authors": ["Tom Foremski"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/28/93a18820-76b2-11e4-b569-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/62a4d9f552881d7a7ca1f356bce83665/nation-state-spying-malware-revealed-v1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
