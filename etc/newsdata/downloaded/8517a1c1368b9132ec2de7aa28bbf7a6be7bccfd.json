The protests initially arose due to opposition against an extradition bill raised by the government of Hong Kong, but it has since grown into a rally for greater democracy.\n\nAn underlying feature of the Hong Kong protests has been the way it has extended onto the internet. The internet and social media applications, such as Telegram, have been used by Hong Kong civilians to spread fervor and organise protests. For example, Telegram played a central role in a protest that took place last week, with protesters forming a human chain across the city on the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Chain demonstration from 1989.\n\nWith the internet being used by civilians as an instrument for rallying support, China has allegedly worked to limit the influence of Telegram. Back in June, the messaging platform received a \"powerful\" DDoS attack from IP addresses that were primarily located in China.\n\nChina has also created thousands of Twitter accounts for the purpose of \"deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong\". 936 of these accounts have since been banned, and Twitter has stop accepting ads from state-run media organisations.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nHong Kong protesters warn of Telegram feature that can disclose their identities\n\nMessage shared on discussion boards sparks panic among protesters.\n\nTwitter bans 936 accounts managed by the Chinese state, aimed at Hong Kong protests\n\nTwitter will also stop accepting ads paid for by state-run news agencies.\n\nTelegram says 'whopper' DDoS attack launched mostly from China\n\nThe company's CEO has confirmed the timing coincided with the Hong Kong extradition law protests organised on his platform.\n\nAlibaba eyes second $20 billion listing in Hong Kong: Report\n\nThe listing could occur as early as the second half of 2019.\n\nAmazon Web Services enters the Hong Kong cloud market\n\nAmazon says the new cloud service entry has been prompted by demand by enterprises and government organizations.", "description": "It has requested for government to seek industry consultation before any internet restrictions are made.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/13/5c8baa3d-c8ba-46ae-a96b-1f4e33a007ea/thumbnail/770x578/e16d21fe7bae9beafd98bfb0e778936b/hongkongskyscrapers.jpg"}
