(CIRA/RAMMB/NOAA)\n\nTropical storm warnings are up for much of Florida\u2019s Panhandle and Big Bend area ahead of Tropical Storm Nestor, with heavy rains, strong winds and building surf already affecting the northeast Gulf Coast Friday evening. These impacts, along with storm surge flooding, will continue over the weekend across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including central and North Florida, as the system continues to move northeast from a position 140 miles southwest of Panama City, Florida on Friday night.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center named the storm system shortly before 2 p.m. Friday, based on data from satellite, ship and ocean buoy data that revealed the storm has intensified and become better defined.\n\nMaximum sustained winds in Nestor are at 60 mph, with higher gusts. The storm has an unconventional appearance for a tropical storm, with the heaviest showers and thunderstorms located to the east-northeast of the center.\n\nA tropical storm warning is up from Navarre to Yankeetown, Fla. and Nestor is slated to make landfall Saturday morning in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nPart of the reason the storm doesn\u2019t look like a typical tropical cyclone is because of its proximity to an approaching cold front and jet stream disturbance to its west. That will enhance the system\u2019s motion ahead of the front while imparting upon it some of the traits of an extratropical cyclone.\n\nThis will broaden the area at risk for high winds, heavy rain, tornado-producing thunderstorms, and in particular, storm surge flooding.\n\nStorm surge flooding is a major threat with this storm\n\nThe greatest threat for wind and surge appear to be to the right or east of the center. This will focus the maximum concern for coastal surge inundation from Indian Pass to Clearwater Beach, Fla. A surge of several feet is expected, and considering how close to sea level much of Florida\u2019s coastline lies, this could be of significant concern to shoreline residents. \u201cThis is a life-threatening situation,\u201d the Hurricane Center warned.\n\n\n\nNotice that model simulations place the greatest risk of strong winds east of the system's center. (Weatherbell.com)\n\nApropos to surge, the National Hurricane Center warns that the exact rise in water levels depends largely on the timing of the surge relative to the tidal cycle.\n\nThe NHC storm surge guidance shows a potential inundation of three to five feet above normally dry ground from Indian Pass to Chassahowitzka, Fla., if the peak surge hits at high tide. Farther south, from Chassahowitzka to Clearwater Beach, Fla., a potential inundation of two to four feet above normally dry ground could occur, if the peak surge occurs at high tide.\n\nAnd for Tampa Bay, a storm surge inundation of one to three feet is anticipated.\n\nA past storm that had a similar appearance and struck the Florida Panhandle was Tropical Storm Josephine in 1996. That storm brought a 5 to 7 foot storm surge to the west coast of Florida.\n\nTropical Storm Nestor has a broad wind field, meaning some of the strong winds associated with the system may extend well outward from the center. In fact, tropical storm force winds already are occurring \u201cup to 175 miles mainly to the northeast and east of the center.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative to plan accordingly for the impacts of this storm system.\n\n\n\nHeavy rainfall will continue farther inland in the Southeast where the system moves over the weekend. (Weatherbell.com)\n\nHeavy rainfall may be in the offing as well, particularly in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region as well as Georgia and South Carolina. A broad swath of rainfall amounting to 2 to 5 inches, with localized higher amounts, is possible in these areas.\n\nFreshwater flooding is not expected to be a widespread concern, though, as recent drought conditions in the Southeast means the dry soils can soak up more rainwater like a sponge. The heavy rains will spread northeastward into the Carolinas on Saturday into Sunday, and may affect southern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region as well.\n\nDamaging winds are also possible from eastern Louisiana to Tampa, though eastern areas may be favored.\n\nThere is also a chance of some severe weather, including tornadoes, with any squall lines that develop and cross over the Florida Peninsula from the gulf. In addition, any bands of thunderstorm activity could exacerbate the storm surge threat, concentrating water rises along their leading edges, where gusty winds tend to be located.", "description": "Tropical Storm Nestor will bring the risk of a \"life-threatening\" storm surge, heavy rain and strong winds to the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend area.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "October At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
