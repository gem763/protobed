Toynk debuted four costumes inspired by the hit sitcom Golden Girls for this Halloween\n\nLongevity: The show premiered in 1985 and ended in 1992 but still has loyal fans\n\nToynk unveiled the costumes on its website, and they were also available to purchase on Amazon, Target's website, and Walmart's website before fans snatched them up.\n\nEach one cost $70 and consisted of a whole outfit, with wigs and accessories sold separately.\n\nDorothy Zbornak's look is black pants with a printed top and scarf, while Blanche Devereaux's is a red sleeveless v-neck jumpsuit with a floral patterned blazer featuring shoulder pads and gold costume jewelry.\n\nRose Nylund's outfit was a girly blue dress with a ruffled collar, while Sophia Petrillo's was a floral dress with a cameo broach plus glasses with a faux pearl chain.\n\nThe collection of demure costumes is a stark contrast to the endless array of 'sexy' ensembles that are being released in the run-up to this year's spooky holiday - with controversial lingerie company Yandy leading the way with a range of barely-there ensembles.\n\nSo far this year, the online retailer has debuted everything from a sexy Mr Rogers-inspired number to a skin-tight outfit inspired by the college admissions scandal.\n\nSo popular! The costumes, including this one for Rose, have already sold out\n\nMust-haves! Each one, including this Dorothy costume, cost $70 before they were snatched up\n\nGone! The wigs were sold separately, but those have also all been bought (pictured: Blanche)\n\nLife of the party! It seems plenty of costumers thought these would make for perfect group costumes (pictured: Sophia)\n\nHowever, despite not falling in the 'sexy' category, the Golden Girls costumes have proven to be far more popular than the more risque alternatives out there - even though they were released years after the show first premiered.\n\nIn fact the series, which debuted over three decades ago, has actually grown in popularity in syndication.\n\nThere is plenty of Golden Girls merchandise on the market, including dolls, games, party supplies, candles, and even Chia pets.\n\nSadly, only 97-year-old Betty White, who played Rose, is still living among the four main cast members.\n\nEstelle Getty passed in 2008, Bea Arthur in 2009, and Rue McClanahan in 2010.\n\nBut the show may be getting new life, as Jane Lynch revealed last week that she is set to be part of a new series for Netflix that she describes as 'kind of a Golden Girls for today.'\n\nSo far, both Jane and Cyndi Lauper will have starring roles.", "description": "Toynk unveiled the four costumes for Halloween this year.
