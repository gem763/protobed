At the New York Public Library, she is filed under \u201cWomen Detectives\u201d and \u201cAction and Adventure Fiction\u201d and \u201cCode and Cipher Stories.\u201d If you are the target demo of a Drew book \u2014 tween, female, and solitary enough to spend time reading \u2014 she is the antidote to a life full of mysteries with unsatisfying conclusions. (Why are girls at school mean to me? Why do I bleed from the crotch every month?) If you are a woman who has aged out of that demo, she is nostalgia. If you are in sales at Penguin Random House, she is a cash cow. (The original Nancy Drew books still sell more than 350,000 copies a year. And there are over 70 million of the books in print \u2014 a number that includes both the classics and their spinoffs.) If you are a network executive, she is marketable intellectual property. If you are a male, she is \u2014 wait, who?\n\nIf you are me, Nancy Drew is the first thing you collected, meaning the first thing I desired with completist gluttony and could, at $2 a pop from the local used-book store, afford. The Nancy Drew Mystery Stories were designed for bulk acquisition. Lined up on a shelf, the yellow spines formed a banana slug of escape opportunities. I would describe them less as novels than as \u201cfodder.\u201d I liked the way Nancy looked on the covers, which was tastefully made-up and inquisitive, and I liked sniffing the pages, which smelled like stamp glue.\n\nThe conventions of the series were stable. Nancy, an amateur sleuth, was customarily described somewhere in the first few pages as \u201ctitian-haired\u201d \u2014 a phrase that no child in recent centuries has read without confusion \u2014 before stumbling into a mystery and becoming obsessed with it. The mysteries generally turned on something like a phantom horse or Indian amulet or set of purloined African documents, and they relied on line breaks and exclamation points for narrative velocity.\n\nLike this!\n\nNancy drove a sporty blue car. She courted danger. She got knocked down, and she got up again. (Literally: A lot of the books have Nancy losing consciousness at a vital moment, like one of those fainting goats.) She solved the mystery. Her bravery was applauded. Along the way, she interacted with her boyfriend, Ned Nickerson, who made passive-aggressive comments about the way his girlfriend was always doggedly pursuing clues instead of him, and hung out with her best friends, George and Bess. Of all the characters, George is the most futuristically out of place in the original books: She is inevitably described as boyish and handsome with short hair and a taste for athletic competitions. I\u2019m not alleging that the series\u2019 pseudonymous author, Carolyn Keene, planted a crypto-lesbian in her detective tales, but I\u2019m not alleging she didn\u2019t.\n\nThe first volume came out in 1930, written by Mildred Wirt Benson from an idea devised by an author named Edward Stratemeyer. Stratemeyer ran a syndicate that originated nearly 1,400 books, including the Bobbsey Twins and the Hardy Boys. He came up with plot ideas, wrote three-page outlines, and distributed them to staff writers who fleshed out the books at warp speed for a flat fee of $50 to $250 per title. Like all of the books that followed, the first Nancy Drew was published under the Carolyn Keene pen name.\n\nBy the late 1930s, the series was so popular that it had been translated into Braille. By 1969, more than 30 million copies had been sold. Revised editions of the core 64 titles have been released over the decades with the covers evolving \u2014 Nancy in a flapper outfit transitions to Nancy in jeans \u2014 and questionable elements of the originals, like racism, edited out. Nancy\u2019s personality has been tweaked, too; in the perfect words of some anonymous Wikipedia editor, she has become \u201cless unruly and violent\u201d with the passage of time \u2014 a curious reversal of the trend in which heroines are increasingly as bloodthirsty as their male counterparts. By now, there are multiple movie and TV adaptations, and book translations into Vietnamese and Icelandic, and there is the possibility of purchasing a shirt that says \u201cI\u2019M NOT SAYING I\u2019M NANCY DREW. I\u2019M JUST SAYING THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ME AND NANCY DREW IN THE SAME ROOM.\u201d\n\nLike any morsel of profitable IP, Nancy is both a constellation of specific traits (red hair, sporty blue car) and a neutral substrate that can be topped, toastlike, with whatever condiment the decade requires: margarine in the 1930s, avocado in 2019. In a 1970s TV adaptation, Nancy wore slinky halter tops and had feathered hair. Scott Speedman played Nancy\u2019s boyfriend in the 1995 version. (Lucky.) A company called HeR Interactive spun out a bunch of Nancy Drew computer games starting in the late \u201990s. (The company\u2019s tagline, possibly the apex of gaming sloganeering: \u201cFor girls who aren\u2019t afraid of a mouse.\u201d) Nancy reappeared in 2002 on TV, then in a 2007 movie with Emma Roberts. A Nancy Drew movie released earlier this year replaced Nancy\u2019s car with a skateboard. (She wore a helmet.)\n\nThe newest onscreen version of Nancy, who appears in a CW TV adaptation this fall, is noticeably sex-positive: Within four minutes of the pilot\u2019s start, she\u2019s fucking Ned Nickerson\u2019s brains out. Whoa! The most appealing character on the adaptation is George, whom the CW show turns into a cynical bitch with Amy Winehouse eyeliner and tattoos. She manages the restaurant where both girls work, has all of the show\u2019s funniest lines, is ethnically ambiguous, and has a boy\u2019s name. George is cool, in other words, and Nancy, stuck halfway between 1950 and the 21st century, is a dork. A likable dork, but still. If the show weren\u2019t tethered to its IP, George would be the obvious starring character.\n\nI\u2019ve seen nothing more than that pilot, so I can\u2019t speak to Nancy\u2019s development over the series, but the coitus looks like more of a flourish than a theme. Like Old Nancy, New Nancy is a human glass of whole milk: nutritious, pass\u00e9, white. (Somehow she has sex fully clothed.) In her early days, Nancy offered a well-mannered mold for Truman-era parents to pour their messy girl children into. But if genre novels are big brimming bowls of escapism, then what kind of escape does a squeaky-clean type-A heroine like Nancy have to offer? Isn\u2019t she exactly the sort of mannered do-gooder who repulses any human in the prepubertal range?\n\nChapter Two: A Tangled Trail\n\nYoung readers have historically been drawn to two opposing female character types. On the one hand, they like characters who push juvenile traits to their screechiest, id-iest extreme and get away with it. In this category, we have the mischievous heroine (Ramona Quimby), the spirited heroine (Anne of Green Gables), the naughty (Eloise), and the anarchic (Pippi Longstocking). It\u2019s a gleefully simple form of wish fulfillment: the idea that an untrammeled kid could bend the rest of the world to her will without ever bothering to brush her teeth or use an indoor voice \u2014 a daydream about growing older without having to change.\n\nThe opposing type of character is the adult-in-a-kid\u2019s-body \u2014 both an aspirational and a fantastical model of being. Many young people, it turns out, don\u2019t conceive of themselves as a lesser class of dumber, smaller humans, and this constituency enjoys books that mirror their delusion \u2014 and so we have the philosophical heroine (Turtle Wexler from The Westing Game), the stoic heroine (Claudia from The Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler), the intellectual (Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda), the careerist (Harriet the Spy), the neurotic (Anastasia Krupnik), and, of course, Nancy, who resembles no youth ever to traipse the Earth.\n\nMost of the Nancy Drew readers I\u2019ve talked to have two things in common: fond memories of the books and an amnesiac inability to remember anything about them. My explanation for this is that Nancy is an incredibly boring character. It\u2019s not an original observation. Writing in 1975, Karla Ruskin pointed out that the detective\u2019s most exceptional trait is her lack of exceptional traits. \u201cNancy is not \u2018different,\u2019 a quality as highly prized as leprosy when you\u2019re young,\u201d Ruskin wrote. \u201cThere is no magic to her, no eccentricity, no humor. She is simply prettier (but not a raving beauty), brighter (but not a crazy genius) and nicer than most people.\u201d Mid-century modest. If Nancy were perfect in the approved contemporary way \u2014 in the way that, for example, Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect \u2014 she\u2019d be funnier and more self-aware, with a collection of minor vulnerabilities to trot out as exceptions proving the rule of her ecru-colored flawlessness. Instead of freelancing for her dad, she\u2019d establish a detective start-up of her own. She would build a personal brand. She would start, for God\u2019s sake, accepting money for her work. Instead, Nancy has leaned so far out she\u2019s practically prone on the floor.\n\nBut it was never Nancy\u2019s personality that shone; it was her skills. I reread The Mystery of the Ivory Charm, the 13th installment of the original series, to revisit the redheaded gumshoe as she appeared in print, unimpeded by the doughnut glaze of my nostalgia. On the cover is our protagonist, stiffly coiffed and with a menacing brown-skinned man in a turban floating behind her (an accurate snapshot of the series\u2019, uh, racial politics). Inside the book, Nancy rescues a helpless child, assists with housework, climbs a rope, dresses injuries, hides in a clump of bushes, confirms suspicions, obeys the law, thwarts bad guys, and zips up the case. She is polite and well groomed. Her hunches are infallible. She says things like, \u201cFor a long while I have suspected the truth \u2014 now I am certain of it.\u201d\n\nThe Nancy Drew books make a case that you can be a complete nonentity \u2014 okay, a privileged nonentity \u2014 and still do tons of courageous, adventurous, altruistic stuff. Her glamour isn\u2019t to be found in her adjectives \u2014 tactful, cordial, serious \u2014 but in her verbs. She\u2019s constantly jumping, springing, racing, clambering, scrambling, darting after shadowy crooks, and zooming away in the blue convertible. One thing the CW show does get right is the character\u2019s mobility \u2014 in the pilot, at least, she doesn\u2019t drive a car, but she does pop up immediately after having sex with Ned Nickerson and sprints away.\n\nAt the initial age of Drew consumption, my definition of \u201cfreedom\u201d was pretty elementary. Freedom was the ability to leave the house, roam unobserved, and return safely when I felt like it to a stocked pantry. This is what all kids would do starting at age 7 if they didn\u2019t have parents to stop them. Bursts of elective chaos with a cozy ending are what the Nancy Drew books deliver. A shot of endangerment with a chaser of domesticity. The plots might be spooky, but they are never creepy.\n\nIt\u2019s a strenuous mental exercise to rewind to a time when basic capability wasn\u2019t assumed in young women, but you have to force yourself to do it when you peer back at Nancy Drew. Readers in the 1950s would have experienced her usefulness and abilities as subversive. They would have marveled at all the public credit given to her triumphs, even if she inevitably refused to accept it. Identifying with Nancy was a way for girls to feel unburdened \u2014 not just physically, in space and time and miles per hour, but by expectations. After all, she was twice as accomplished as her male counterparts. (There were two Hardy Boys!) She had money, family, friends, adventure, a fulfilling career, and a slim figure. Nancy Drew, who is technically 55 years older than Sheryl Sandberg, was maybe the first unrealistic \u201chave it all\u201d heroine.\n\nChapter Three: The One-Way Street\n\nSo far, none of the attempts to translate Nancy into TV or movie form have been as lucrative as the book sales would suggest. Perhaps it\u2019s because in an age when every girlboss is expected to #slay, much of what once made the sleuth provocative has evaporated.\n\nAnother possibility: Part of the pleasure of revisiting childhood books is discovering all the ways in which they reflect favorably on your younger self. What a cool and interesting kid I was for liking this!, you think, paging through The Westing Game or Sideways Stories From Wayside School. Rereading Nancy Drew is, I\u2019m sorry to say it, an unflattering experience. As I worked through chapters about visiting a circus (\u201cAn Angry Elephant\u201d) and discovering a hidden rock door (\u201cHidden Rock Door\u201d) and pursuing a suspect off a bridge into roiling waters (\u201cDangerous Dive\u201d), my inner monologue ran more like, \u201cI must have been incredibly lame and dimwitted to find this compelling.\u201d\n\nBut discovering the mediocrity of a beloved childhood book doesn\u2019t always mean that the book was bad or the reader was lame. Sometimes it means that the book served its purpose: It turned you into an adult capable of distinguishing between great and not-great books. With their candylike covers and porridgelike plots, the books pushed me and others further down the trail to better reading material. Nancy Drew, unlike Eloise or Pippi Longstocking, has proved to be a one-way street. Rereading Carolyn Keene when you\u2019ve tasted Agatha Christie is like eating diet ice cream after years of H\u00e4agen-Dazs. It\u2019s like reverting to the Counting Crows after you\u2019ve locked into Van Morrison. Or snuggling up to some R.L. Stine when you\u2019ve sipped on the sweet nectar of Stephen King. Maybe Nancy Drew is unrevivable. Maybe rebooting Nancy Drew is like \u2026 rebooting a training bra.\n\nOne Great Story: A Nightly Newsletter for the Best of New York The one story you shouldn't miss today, selected by New York's editors.
