Taubman shouted, \"Thank God we got Osuna!\" according to SI, which said he made similar remarks several times during Saturday night's celebration, punctuating them with a profanity.\n\nHouston issued a statement Monday accusing the SI reporter of making up the story. Taubman apologized for his language in a statement Tuesday, and MLB and the team started an investigation.\n\nAstros general manager Jeff Luhnow apologized Thursday for the team's initial response, saying it was wrong, and the team apologized to the SI reporter, the magazine and people who saw the incident, and to those who were offended.\n\nFILE - In this Jan. 17, 2018, file photo, Houston Astros Senior Director of Baseball Operations Brandon Taubman attends a baseball news conference in Houston.
