But I didn\u2019t come here expecting everything to be easy and have an easy route and start every game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always that easy. So I came in had to work for my spot just like everyone does. I\u2019m proud of the journey I\u2019ve had so far.\u201d\n\nPulisic said the important thing was that Chelsea manager Frank Lampard \u2014 who was not in charge when the club bought him \u2014 had faith in him.\n\nLampard had said he deserved a chance after he came off the bench in midweek to set up Michy Batshuayi\u2019s late winner in the 1-0 victory over Ajax in Wednesday\u2019s Champions League match.\n\n\u201c(Lampard) believes in me and he\u2019s told me that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep working hard in training and earn my spot, that\u2019s how it is at the highest level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to do so. This is hopefully just the start.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic says he felt a \u201csense of relief\u201d after he netted a hat-trick against Burnley on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/2ae777_chelsea-christian-pulisic-he-felt-sense-relief-scoring-his-goals-club-difficult-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
