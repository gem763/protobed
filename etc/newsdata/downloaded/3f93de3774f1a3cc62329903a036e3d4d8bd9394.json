There was also emotional strain - one farmer reported suffering from depression and a suicide was reported on the West Coast.\n\n\"Other [farmers] associated drought with pain and expressed that drought was a disaster that they couldn't find words to describe\u2026 others said drought was a 'killer' in the farming business,\" Ncube said.\n\n\"In Overberg\u2026 another farmer said it takes everything away from you, even your future.\"\n\nFarmers had different reactions to drought. They had to physically transport water, reduce the size of their herds or even resorting to prayer.\n\n\"Other [farmers] expressed a feeling of helplessness in terms of planning for drought,\" Ncube said.\n\nShe added that farmers had told her that they simply \"take every day as it comes\" or \"rely on the Lord who sends the rain\".\n\nNcube said smallholder farmers need to be empowered to deal with drought.\n\n\"Government and private support can play a critical role in enhancing the coping and adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers in the Western Cape,\" Ncube said.\n\nShe added that \"there is [a] need for smallholder farmers to understand the role that they can play in drought mitigation and adaption\".", "description": "Speaking at the 20th Waternet symposium on fresh water management, Dr Bongani Ncube of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology says she looked into how smallholder farmers were able to cope and adapt during times of drought.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9360/2bb4c20d816645d0970687000638a523.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
