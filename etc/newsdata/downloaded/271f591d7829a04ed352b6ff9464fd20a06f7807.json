In Chicago on Sunday, that took on another look.\n\nDuring the Chargers\u2019 third drive of the game, Philip Rivers threw an interception that Kyle Fuller nearly returned for a Bears touchdown. It was the third play of the drive after the Chargers lost a yard and gained 2 back from their own 23-yard line. Fuller was downed at the 4.\n\nKyle Fuller intercepts Rivers and almost returns it to the house! #LACvsCHI #Bears100\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: FOX\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch free on mobile: https://t.co/a16R5wPShJ pic.twitter.com/pjzIzc80UA \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 27, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe interception was Rivers\u2019 seventh of the season.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nIt was then that cameras focused on Rivers going back to his sideline and exchanging heated words with head coach Anthony Lynn.

When a referee came over to speak with Lynn, Rivers came back into the fray that also included Allen on the left side.\n\nThe Chargers defense held the Bears to a field goal on the ensuing drive which proved critical as they held on, thanks to a missed Eddy Pineiro field goal on the game\u2019s final play, to win 17-16.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and head coach Anthony Lynn had words after an interception Sunday.
