The property was once known for loud parties, but according to authorities it had transformed into a marijuana \u201cpop-up\u201d venue that attracted one seller from abroad. Police said they seized nearly 25 pounds of marijuana and hundreds of smoking devices and marijuana-infused candies, along with ledgers of sales.\n\nPolice raid mansion near Dupont Circle suspected of hosting marijuana party\n\nPeople may grow and possess small amounts of marijuana in the District but cannot legally purchase recreational pot. Smoking small amounts is allowed inside private residences. The mayor is trying to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana dispensaries.\n\nAllowing people to possess but not sell marijuana has led to confusion and prompted an influx of \u201cpop-up\u201d markets advertised through social media and designed to remain somewhat hidden from the general public and law enforcement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice continue to target selling operations and organized events where marijuana is used and distributed.\n\nCmdr. John Haines, who heads the D.C. police narcotics and special-investigations division, said that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen quite a bit of an increase\u201d in marijuana pop-ups and distribution organizations in the past two years.\n\nMarijuana pop-ups thrive in District\u2019s murky world of marijuana laws\n\nHe said organizers often try to skirt the law by asking for donations and then giving out \u201cfree gifts\u201d that include marijuana, falsely believing that doesn\u2019t qualify as an exchange of something of value, although it is illegal if the exchange includes marijuana. He said organizers also sometimes rent rooms or houses for a short periods of time to help avoid detection of the events.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey rent a place on a Thursday for a party on a Saturday and they\u2019re gone Sunday,\u201d Haines said. \u201cThat limited exposure times makes it difficult for law enforcement to take any kind of action.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHaines said the parties and the distribution venues invite danger. \u201cThese marijuana parties bring a lot of cash,\u201d he said, making patrons and organizers vulnerable to being robbed either of drugs or money, or both.\n\nAuthorities said the suspected drug operation in Foggy Bottom, first reported by WRC-TV, was found by accident. Court documents and a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service said agents went to the apartment to arrest a resident who police said had failed to show up for a court appearance on a marijuana distribution charge.\n\nAD\n\nAgents were told that man had left the country, the court documents state. But that man\u2019s brother was at the apartment, according to Haines, and the agents detained him after seeing the suspected drugs. D.C. police obtained a search warrant, and that led to the arrest of Jeffrey Bennett, 52.\n\nAD\n\nBennett was charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a felony. A D.C. Superior Court judge on Thursday released Bennett, who also has an address in Silver Spring, Md., and set a hearing for Oct. 17. Bennett could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Teresa G. Kleiman, did not return calls to her office Friday.\n\nCoast Guard lieutenant accused of plotting mass attack pleads guilty to gun, drug charges\n\nA mystery 32 stories up: Is a grandfather, 68, leaping of the D.C. area\u2019s tallest buildings?\n\nIG at center of impeachment inquiry promised robust whistleblower protections when he took job\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The raid was the second in a week targeting what police described as large-scale selling operations near downtown Washington.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
