The bad people in this equation are all those who have instilled this young woman with fear and are using her as a human shield \u2014 and her parents for letting it happen.\n\nWhere are the parents of this kid? \u2014 PCH Political (@pchpolitical) September 23, 2019\n\nHer parents have failed her so badly. \u2014 Justine Merrifield (@Blue111962) September 23, 2019\n\nAnybody see this and think 'child abuse?\" This girl clearly had this written for her, and they're carting her all over the world for their agenda instead of letting her live out a childhood. https://t.co/Sz1hvfoUEE \u2014 Brandon Morse (@TheBrandonMorse) September 23, 2019\n\nThe real crime is that this girl was brainwashed by her parents to forfeit her childhood on the altar of climate hysteria. \u2014 KSazerac (@KSazerac) September 23, 2019\n\nThis child is being used and that is abuse \u2014 JG\u2026.. (@survivor_jg) September 23, 2019\n\nThey're using her as their avatar because they can twist any refutation of her wild claims into an \"attack\" on a child. This kid is on the autism spectrum, manipulating her emotionally like this is flagrant abuse. It's contemptible. https://t.co/6c8ZRIl2Tt \u2014 Cruadin (@cruadin) September 23, 2019\n\nShame on all of them.
