What we didn\u2019t expect was Washington Nationals\u2019 starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez setting the tone in Game 1 by flirting with the third no-hitter in postseason history.\n\nThe 14-year MLB veteran carried his no-hit bid into the eighth inning before pinch-hitter Jose Martinez broke it up with a two-out single. S\u00e1nchez settled for 7 2/3 scoreless innings, which helped Washington to a 2-0 victory and a 1-0 series lead.\n\nIn taking his no-hit bid into the late innings, S\u00e1nchez became the first pitcher in MLB history with multiple postseason no-hit bids of at least six innings.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez is the first player in MLB postseason history with multiple career no-hit bids of at least 6 innings. h/t @EliasSports\n\n\n\nHe threw 6 hitless innings in Game 1 of the 2013 ALCS. pic.twitter.com/140RhQYFvS \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 12, 2019\n\nS\u00e1nchez is the owner of one regular-season no-hitter. That occurred on Sept. 6, 2006, as a member of the then Florida Marlins. He would have joined Hall of Famer Roy Halladay as the only pitchers to throw no-hitters in the regular season and postseason.\n\nThe Nationals offense had its own struggles but did manage enough offense to secure the victory. Washington broke through against Cardinals\u2019 starter Miles Mikolas with a single run in the second inning. NLDS Game 5 hero Howie Kendrick started the inning with a single and later scored on Yan Gomes\u2019 two-out RBI double.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn another day, Mikolas would have been the story in Game 1. The Cardinals right-hander continued his strong postseason with six innings of one-run ball.\n\nWashington added an insurance run in the seventh when that man again, Howie Kendrick, drove in Adam Eaton with a two-out single. Eaton had tripled earlier in the frame.\n\nWith closer Daniel Hudson away on paternity leave, former closer Sean Doolittle stepped up to record a four-out save. Doolittle set down the Cardinals first four hitters in order.\n\nWashington Nationals starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez throws during the fifth inning of Game 1 of the baseball National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals Friday, Oct. 11, 2019, in St. Louis. (AP)\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u2022 An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez: No Max Scherzer in Game 1. No Stephen Strasburg. No Patrick Corbin. No problem. S\u00e1nchez took charge for Washington and immediately put St. Louis in a difficult position as their suddenly scuffling offense will have to get on track against Washington\u2019s three aces. Good luck.\n\n\u2022 Howie Kendrick: There\u2019s clutch and then there\u2019s Howie Kendrick in the 2019 postseason clutch. The veteran forever endeared himself to Nationals fans with his NLDS Game 5 grand slam, and he kept on rolling in NLCS Game 1 with a pair of hits that led directly to Washington\u2019s first two runs.\n\n\u2022 Yan Gomes: With Kurt Suzuki out of the lineup following a hit-by-pitch scare in NLDS Game 5, Gomes stepped in and provided a lift for Washington\u2019s offense. The veteran catcher started the scoring with his RBI double and later added a single and a walk. He was also the man who helped guide S\u00e1nchez through his masterful performance.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nHad S\u00e1nchez completed the no-hitter, this diving catch by Ryan Zimmerman would have been one of the most talked about plays in postseason history.\n\nIt was still a very important play as it prevented the Cardinals from starting a rally.\n\nRyan Zimmerman keeps the no-hit bid alive with this play\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\n\n\n\n(via @MLB) pic.twitter.com/Hs5X38rOnb \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) October 12, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nJuan Soto\u2019s pitch-take routine is an event all to itself.\n\nIt certainly got the attention of Miles Mikolas, who reciprocated with his own version.\n\nA Juan Soto vs. Miles Mikolas cup battle is exactly what this series needs.\n\n\n\n(via @PitchingNinja)pic.twitter.com/6hIFT8MvGr \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 12, 2019\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThe Cardinals and Nationals will be right back at it Saturday afternoon. The first pitch for Game 2 is scheduled for 4:08 p.m. ET. The Cardinals will look to even the series with veteran Adam Wainwright on the hill. The 38-year-old right-hander shined in his lone NLDS appearance, holding the Braves scoreless over 7 2/3 innings in Game 3.\n\nThe Nationals will counter with Max Scherzer, who will be on normal rest for the first time in his last three appearances. He pitched seven innings of one-run ball in Washington's Game 4 win against Los Angeles.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Washington Nationals defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 in Game 1 of the NLCS.", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/E3qruTqUPRdY.ov1HD6pwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTEuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WTKAMAgB0CiivEpb1cin.Q--~B/aD0yNDE4O3c9MzYzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/20d3a210-ec9a-11e9-a39f-d55702583509", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
