Trump insisted that the conversation was \"perfect\" and he was just making sure the country was making good on its promise to weed out corruption.\n\nObama\u2019s former national security adviser said the \"normal system\" that holds information on similar calls is protected and classified. She said there was \"no classified substance\" in the Trump phone call and yet the administration \"hid it on a very highly sensitive, highly compartmentalized server that very few people in the U.S. government have access to in order to bury it.\"\n\nShe was asked by the moderator if the Obama administration ever kept calls on a separate server. She responded by saying only if \"they were legitimately in their contents classified.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s rare that a presidential conversation would be classified to that highest level,\" she said. \"It's not impossible. It\u2019s very rare. Even when they are two leaders discussing classified information. Here\u2019s a case where there was nothing classified and it was moved to the most secure, sensitive server.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that the Trump administration\u2014after sensing problematic leaks early in his presidency\u2014worked to protect presidential phone calls. Politicians on both sides of the aisle understand the importance of a sitting president\u2019s ability to engage with a foreign leader in a conversation that would not face public scrutiny.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly said the phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader was only added to the server after guidance from National Security Counsel lawyer.", "description": "Susan Rice, who was one of President Obama's closest advisers during his time in office, blasted\u00a0President Trump on Friday night for storing details about his July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in a separate,\u00a0highly secured computer system.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
