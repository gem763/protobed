Today, America is selling us out,\u201d is how Jihan summed it up.\n\nIn the school yard in Hasakeh, the displaced children play on a rusty old swing while their parents start unpacking their bags and feed the youngest.\n\nMost of the displaced are from the largest towns on the border, including Kobane, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain.\n\n\u201cFollowing the emergency\u2026 people went to Tall Tamr, Hasakeh and surrounding villages. We have requisitioned three schools to house the people,\u201d said Majida Amin, a local official in charge of displaced people.\n\nShe said that the number of people who were given shelter in the first school was 220 and increasing with every hour.\n\nAmin said that little help was available from local aid groups and called on the international community to step up and organise the emergency humanitarian response.\n\nShe explained that most of the people who fled their homes try to move in with relatives who live in safer areas before coming to the newly opened shelters.\n\nSince Turkish jets and artillery started raining bombs and shells, families can be seen heading away from the border, some of them walking down roads with bags and bundles on their backs.\n\nOthers like Ibrahim Fares and his family were able to squeeze in a car to leave Ras al-Ain, one of the towns hardest hit.\n\n\u201cNow we don\u2019t know where to go and where we will sleep,\u201d the 28-year-old said.", "description": "Hasakeh (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 For the second time in two years, Jihan and her family had to pack their bags and abandon their home in northern Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/433ba8_kurds-tens-thousands-fleeing-civilians-it-is-time-in-two-years-driven-homes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
