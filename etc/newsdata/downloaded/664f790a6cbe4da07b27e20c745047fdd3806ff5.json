I have no doubt the attorney general will formulate his decision in a professional and appropriate manner,\u201d said lawyer Ram Caspi, according to The Times of Israel.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He has repeatedly denied all the charges.\n\nIn case 4000, police have alleged that Mr Netanyahu, as communication minister, granted regulatory favours to Israel\u2019s leading telecommunications company, Bezeq, in return for more positive coverage on Walla, a news website belonging to the firm\u2019s owner.\n\nCase 2000 focuses on suspicions Mr Netanyahu negotiated a deal with the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper for better coverage in return for promises to limit the circulation of a rival.\n\nIn the third investigation, case 1000, police argue that he received expensive gifts from wealthy friends, including Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan, in exchange for political favours.\n\nThe first two days of hearing are expected to focus on case 4000, while next week the hearings will focus on the other two cases.\n\nThe justice ministry is expected to reach a final decision by December.\n\nThe prime minister is also battling to form a unity government in a bid to stay in office.\n\nHe had sought a clear victory to secure immunity from the expected corruption trials.\n\nIn the September elections, neither Mr Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing allies nor Mr Gantz\u2019s centre-left bloc was able to secure the 61-seat majority of the 120-seat Knesset needed to rule.\n\nHowever, President Rivlin Reuven awarded Mr Netanyahu first chance of building a coalition, because the Likud and its allies swept more seats.\n\nBut Blue and White scuppered chances of a speedy resolution to the political stand-off on Tuesday when they rejected a negotiating meeting that Mr Netanyahu had requested.\n\n\u201cThe Blue and White faction announced that, at this stage, the preconditions upon which any further meetings between the negotiating teams may take place have not been met,\u201d the party said in a statement.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn view of this, no meeting will be held on Wednesday \u2026 under these circumstances, there is naturally no reason to hold a meeting between the two party heads, LTG (res) Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at this time.\u201d\n\nThe deadlock has raised fears of a possible third election in under a year. September\u2019s election was already the second in six months after Mr Netanyahu failed to form a government following an April vote.\n\nThe idea of yet another vote is unpopular in Israel, which has been stuck in political limbo with a caretaker government for a year now.\n\nAccording to new research published by The Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday, 65 per cent of Jewish Israelis prefer a unity government compared to only 15 per cent who prefer new elections.\n\nMeanwhile, a third of Arab or Palestinian citizens of Arab Israelis prefer a unity government and 17 per cent new elections, while half have no clear preference.\n\nThe same poll found that just over half of Israelis do not think the state should offer Benjamin Netanyahu a plea bargain.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu is battling possible indictment on corruption charges in a string of pre-trial hearings that begin on Wednesday, as his efforts to build a unity government with a chief\u00a0rival once again hit a wall.
