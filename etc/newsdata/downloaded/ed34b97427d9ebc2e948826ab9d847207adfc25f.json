As a financial planner in New York City, I've come to expect new client meetings to include conversations about financial anxiety, confusion, and frustration.\n\nThe reality is, when it comes to money, most people are doing far better than they think they are. Sure, you may not have reached your goals yet, but that doesn't mean you won't or that you've failed already. Even if things are particularly tough right now, it won't stay that way forever.\n\nThat is why the best piece of advice I can give you about money is this:\n\nMoney is dynamic. Plan for the long run, and don't get too caught up on today.\n\nTo see this in action, all you have to do is take a look at any of your account balances over the past year, or five years, or longer. If you're like most people, you've had highs and lows. The stock market is the same way. Money is constantly on the move.\n\nWhen it comes to your money, a financial planner can help you see the big picture. Use SmartAsset's free tool to find a qualified financial adviser today \u00bb\n\nKeeping track of your net worth is a good way to follow the ups and downs of your financial situation and to remind yourself that you aren't stuck. Making one mistake doesn't doom you to a lifetime of financial struggle, and getting lucky once \u2014 even winning the lottery \u2014 doesn't necessarily mean you're set for life.\n\nIf things are great right now, enjoy it. But make sure to save as much as you can for a time in the future when you'll need it. Retirement is one universal example, but a job loss, medical expense, or other big life event could happen as well. It will be easier to weather the tough times if you prepare during the good times.\n\nAnd, if you're living through one of those tough times, try to remember that it's temporary. Don't stress about the progress you're not making. Just try to get through today. If you lost your job, focus on finding a new one. If you're in over your head with debt, cut back as much as you can to pay it off. You'll get through it.\n\nIt's worth mentioning \u2014 and this is where the long-term planning really comes into play \u2014 since money is dynamic, your financial goals can be, too. Don't underestimate your potential. If your current goal feels far away, be patient and keep working toward it. If you've recently reached a financial goal, set a new one. The important thing is to keep moving.", "description": "This financial planner has found that, despite some mistakes here and there, most people are doing far better with money than they think they are.", "authors": ["Lauren Lyons Cole"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9231d52e22af4a844f3d5f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
