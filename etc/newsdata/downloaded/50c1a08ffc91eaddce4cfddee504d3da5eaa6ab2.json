He is at ease with journalists and able to explain in a convincing way the crucial role of business in a prosperous society.\n\nOn Thursday he was across the topical and intense debates over the forced divestment of assets by energy companies, NBN\u2019s sudden and unusual push into business fibre connections and allegations by the Prime Minister Scott Morrison of major bank \u201cprofiteering\u201d.\n\nIncoming Business Council of Australia president, Tim Reed, knows the important of big and small business working together.

Nor has he been cowed by the repeated attacks by federal government ministers and assistant ministers against business leaders who have championed social issues.\n\nReed\u2019s 12 years running the accounting software company MYOB has given him valuable insights into the symbiotic relationship between large and small business. He believes the role of business in society must be guided by leaders with integrity who behave ethically.\n\nAt MYOB Reed told his executive team to approach all internal discussions with the assumption that it could be viewed by customers. This is a variation of the \u201cfront page test\u201d used by sensible CEOs for decades.\n\nReed says he will work closely with BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott to push three policy priorities: the implementation of immigration and educational policies to deal with the skills shortage, reduction in regulation to help boost productivity and ensuring Australia\u2019s corporate tax system is made to be competitive.", "description": "The Business Council of Australia has opted for a generational change with the appointment of Tim Reed, 49, as president when Grant King retires in November.
