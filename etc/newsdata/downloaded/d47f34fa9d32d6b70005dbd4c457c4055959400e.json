She made it her Twitter cover photo.", "language": "en", "text": "To Democrats, what the photo conveyed was clear: the speaker \u201cliterally standing up to the president\u201d after the House overwhelmingly voted to condemn his decision to pull out of northern Syria. The stunning moment marked the latest episode in the long-running theatrical feud between Pelosi and the president, ending, like others, with the Democratic leader reclaiming Trump\u2019s insult as a badge of pride.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCan a woman beat Donald Trump? Yes,\u201d Democratic presidential contender Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wrote on Twitter. \u201c@SpeakerPelosi does it every day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d comment, which he tweeted with the photo, came after Pelosi walked out on a White House meeting regarding Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of northern Syria, leaving Kurdish fighters previously allied with the U.S. vulnerable to a Turkish offensive. House lawmakers voted 354-60-4 to denounce Trump\u2019s decision in a bipartisan resolution on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump reportedly called Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician,\u201d labeled former defense secretary Jim Mattis the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and brushed off concerns about the Islamic State taking advantage of the U.S. military\u2019s withdrawal from the region. Pressed on a strategy going forward, Trump said his plan was \u201cto keep the American people safe,\u201d to which Pelosi retorted: \u201cThat\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a goal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs she got up and left, Trump reportedly yelled, \u201cSee you at the polls.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think now we have to pray for his health,\u201d Pelosi said afterward, \u201cbecause this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nLater, when Trump attempted to use the photo to depict Pelosi as the one who had the real \u201cmeltdown,\u201d even some conservatives questioned why Trump believed the photo would be perceived the same way by others.\n\n\u201cThat would happen to be a woman standing up and asserting herself at a table full of men. I understand such a scene may cause a meltdown but I assure you it\u2019s not on Speaker Pelosi\u2019s behalf,\u201d wrote Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to current and former Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Jim DeMint (S.C.). Carpenter questioned how a Republican president could have driven her to \u201cspeak up for Nancy Pelosi? I mean, really.\"\n\nAD\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of late Republican senator John McCain, questioned why \u201ctough women who don\u2019t put up with s---\" get labeled as \u201cunhinged.\u201d Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.) commented: \u201cSomeone is definitely nervous and unhinged. But it\u2019s not @SpeakerPelosi.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOthers, meanwhile, challenged a common observation made by political commentators: that Trump is skilled at controlling the narrative in the news media.\n\n\u201cPeople say Trump, for all his failings, is a media genius,\u201d wrote Rick Hasen, a political science professor at the University of California at Irvine School of Law. \u201cSo how could he have thought posting this picture of Pelosi standing up to Trump in a room full of old white men was a good idea for him?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPelosi is using the picture the president tried to use to mock her as her new Twitter background pic \u2014 the only woman pictured at the table literally standing up to the president. pic.twitter.com/1ftdlQ8WFE \u2014 Kathryn Watson (@kathrynw5) October 17, 2019\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham later defended Trump\u2019s behavior during the meeting and disputed Pelosi\u2019s account, saying the speaker \u201chad no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Democratic leadership chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine, everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room and work on behalf of this country,\u201d Grisham said in a statement. Reporters were not allowed in the meeting.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to mock or insult Pelosi have backfired before \u2014 often after contentious meetings like the one Wednesday.\n\nThe feud between the two leaders escalated during the government shutdown, as Pelosi portrayed him as childish, inexperienced and selfish, strolling out of one of their first meetings in December 2018 wearing a red-hot coat, shades and a smirk fit for a meme. She described Trump\u2019s obsession with the wall as \u201cmanhood thing for him \u2014 as if manhood could ever be associated with him,\u201d and belittled the president in comments to colleagues.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was trying to be the mom,\u201d she said, as The Washington Post reported. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it to you. It was so wild. It goes to show you: You get into a tickle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.\u201d\n\nWhen Pelosi delayed Trump\u2019s scheduled State of the Union address to the House the following month, Trump returned the jab by canceling Pelosi\u2019s and other top Democrats\u2019 scheduled trip to visit an Afghanistan war zone, describing it as a \u201cpublic relations event.\u201d But Democrats and national security experts noted that trips to war zones are typically kept secret for security purposes, and that its purpose was to show appreciation to the troops. Pelosi questioned whether \u201cperhaps the president\u2019s inexperience\u201d kept him from understanding that.\n\nAD\n\nHer second viral meme-generating moment rolled around shortly thereafter. In February, when the State of the Union address finally happened and Trump urged \u201cunity,\u201d appearing to signal a truce with the speaker, there was Pelosi in the background: her lips pursed, her hands clapping at him like a set of jaws.\n\nAD\n\nThe unity, of course, didn\u2019t quite happen. By May, when it was Trump\u2019s turn to storm out of a meeting with Pelosi, he resorted to calling her a nickname for the first time: \u201cCrazy Nancy.\u201d He described her as \u201ca mess\u201d and himself as an \u201cextremely stable genius.\u201d Pelosi said she was praying for the president, and urged his family, the administration or his staff to \u201chave an intervention\u201d with Trump for the \u201cgood of the country.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, both Pelosi and Trump said they were praying for each other now, each somehow managing to transform a religious offering into an insult. \u201cPray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d Trump tweeted, just after releasing the photo of Pelosi pointing at him.\n\nPelosi\u2019s daughter, Christine Pelosi, for one, appeared to identify with Trump\u2019s position in the photo on Twitter.\n\n\u201cLooks like she owned you on #NationalBossDay,\u201d she said, referring to Wednesday\u2019s national day of appreciation for bosses. \u201cBeen there.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "It's the latest viral photo of Pelosi that Democrats have claimed as a showing of her power over Trump.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Xo1O7jmvIM-vV3qYOsWLejCJyXA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AIDE7NR2EJES5HODCWMQTBKO2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
