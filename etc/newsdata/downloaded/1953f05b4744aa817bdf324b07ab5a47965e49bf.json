You don't speak for Britain.\"\n\nBanks branded Morgan a \"Snowflake\" over his comment.\n\nMorgan replied: \"Arron, you guys do yourselves no favours with xenophobic nonsense like this. Delete it.\"\n\nWigmore replied with an image of a 1996 Mirror front page, which was edited by Morgan at the time, about the Euro 96 football tournament, with the headline: \"Achtung! Surrender!\"\n\nWigmore wrote: \"One of yours I believe @piersmorgan \"\n\nMorgan wrote: \"Yes, that was 23yrs ago when Dad\u2019s Army & \u2018Allo \u2018Allo were on TV. It was meant as a joke but people were rightly offended, and I apologised.\n\n\"Your meme isn\u2019t meant as a joke, is grotesquely offensive, and makes you guys look like racist idiots. Is that the look you\u2019re after?\"\n\nBanks said: \"Listen very carefully I will say this only once - you should be outraged at the Germans trying to annex Northern Ireland!\"\n\nBut this morning he appeared to have had a change of heart.\n\nBanks tweeted: \"This is the first time we have ever apologised and the tweet was unauthorised.\n\n\"I agree with the sentiment condemning the German demands to separate NI from the rest of the UK but we could have done a better job but it doesn\u2019t detract from how outrageous the German position is!\"\n\nHe added: \"The team just went too far, the sentiment holds true that it is outrageous to say that British sovereign territory should be annexed.\"\n\nThe post was also criticised by Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice, who co-founded Leave.EU, said he was \"appalled\" by the \"stupid and offensive\" picture.\n\nLast night, Wigmore replied to Tice's tweet saying: \"Oh shut up @TiceRichard - you loved it, stop being so pompous....\"\n\nIn response to a tweet saying there was \"absolutely nothing wrong\" with the image, Banks last night tweeted: \"Quite right that\u2019s the spirit!\"\n\nA further tweet branding it a \"storm in a teacup\" was also welcomed by Banks, who wrote: \"Agreed . What a lot of nonsense!\"\n\nIn April 2018, the group were forced to delete a post featuring a picture of London mayor Sadiq Khan branding the capital \u201cLondonistan\u201d.\n\nThe post featured a string of statistics to claim a drastic decline of Christianity and an increase in Islam in London. All of the statistics were false.\n\nThey posted a \u201ccorrected\u201d version, with caveats attached to the statistics. All of the statistics in the \u201ccorrected\u201d version were still false.\n\nThe group were blasted in 2017 for posting a meme which used an image of Grenfell Tower on fire to attack plans for an amnesty on illegal immigrants in the wake of the blaze. The firm also included a logo for Mr Banks\u2019 insurance firm GoSkippy on the ad.\n\nAnd they have repeatedly used the infamous image, promoted by Nigel Farage during the referendum campaign, of a line of refugees - claiming it was illustrative of \u201cmass migration.\u201d", "description": "Arron Banks defended the post and posted it on his own Twitter account last night, but this morning he said it was \"unauthorised\", went \"too far\" and blamed his team", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543374.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-BRITAIN-POLITICS-EU-BREXIT-POLICE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
