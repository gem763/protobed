REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - An estimated 42,000 protesters took to the streets of Paris on Sunday, peacefully demonstrating against a draft law allowing lesbians and single women to conceive children with medical assistance, police said.\n\nThe bioethics law, which has cleared its first reading in parliament, would lift the current restriction limiting in vitro fertilization (IVF) to heterosexual couples.\n\nFor some in President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s governing party, the bill has revived memories of the disruptive and sometimes violent protests against his predecessor Francois Hollande\u2019s \u201cMarriage For All\u201d law which legalized gay unions.\n\nThose protests peaked in January 2013 with a demonstration attended by some 340,000 people, according to police estimates at the time, with organizers claiming 1 million.\n\nRemnants of the same \u201cDemonstrations for All\u201d movement, founded in opposition to Hollande\u2019s law, took part in Sunday\u2019s march, joined by a handful of conservative lawmakers. Some opponents of the bioethics bill fear it would ultimately pave the way for the legalization of surrogacy.\n\nThis time, however, the measures have clear public backing, with polls reporting 65-68% support among voters. The Catholic church, while critical of the bill, has also refrained from directly encouraging protests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Demonstrations for All leader Ludovine de la Rochere said on Sunday. \u201cThis is just the start.\u201d\n\nA media-funded count put the number of protesters at 74,500, well above the police estimate, while organizers said they had counted 600,000, still far below comparable tallies in 2013.", "description": "An estimated 42,000 protesters took to the streets of Paris on Sunday, peacefully demonstrating against a draft law allowing lesbians and single women to conceive children with medical assistance, police said.", "authors": ["Clotaire Achi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437818598&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950MU", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
