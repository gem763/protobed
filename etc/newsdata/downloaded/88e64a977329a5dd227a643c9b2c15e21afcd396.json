A series of gunshots went off: A city police officer had just opened fire on a man violently swinging a hammer at his partner. As authorities cordoned off the blood-splattered street corner a block away, the line only grew. The Christian Louboutin sample sale was on the other end, and not even the National Guard could have scattered these shoppers.\n\nThe Louboutin sale is one of the best and most notoriously difficult to get into. The Parisian designer, known for his red soles, charges retail prices well over $US1000 ($1300) for many styles, and only the most eccentric ones get a minor markdown in department stores at the end of the season. The sample sale is truly the only opportunity to purchase discounted goods from one of the most popular shoemakers in the world. For this reason, the sale is nearly impossible to enter.\n\nWhile many sales open their doors to the public, Louboutin requires proof of an email invitation, your name on a list and an identification check. Very tall guards police the crowd. At this year's sale, shoppers tried to sneak into the building through two different cargo doors. Some stood outside waiting for those with the golden ticket to come out, and asked if they could purchase their shoes at a slightly higher price than what they paid inside. The successful shoppers declined.\n\nThough the Louboutin sale causes a ruckus, it does not have the same reputation as the Manolo Blahnik sale at the ritzy Warwick. This sale brings out the worst in New York's most cultured, stylish buyers.\n\nManolo Blahnik's shoes are so exquisite they have been exhibited in London's Design Museum (as here). At the recent sample sale in New York, a bride-to-be was desperate to hand over the two pairs of cherished - discounted - boots she had bagsed for a pair of white bejewelled heels. Alastair Grant\n\n\"How they're storming it, you'd think they had the cure for cancer in that room,\" a woman said as she waited to be let in. She sat not far from the woman pitching the reality show. The frustrated woman was a size 42 and knew that plenty of stock would be left for her, even if it took her hours to get in. Good luck if you're a 37 or 38.\n\nFive shoes at a time, OK?\n\nIn an effort to keep the several thousand shoppers orderly, Manolo Blahnik employees handed out carnival tickets with section numbers on them. Those brightly coloured little slips are pressed firmly into palms, and are nearly shredded with sweat and anxiety by the time that section is allowed to enter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doorman opened the gateway and attempted to pick up the two dozen creased tickets thrown at him, which dropped like confetti as people sprinted inside, where there were screams, bags being ripped open and shoes being flung over shoppers' heads, landing in piles on the floor. An older man who appeared to be running the madhouse kept trying to make announcements: \"Ladies, please! Five shoes at a time, OK? Please. Please, everyone!\"\n\nDucking an airborne d'Orsay, I made my way to the size 41 table. I wear a large size, so my selection is plentiful \u2013 I saw hundreds of plastic bags stuffed with last season's shoes. The starting price: $US100, a whopping discount, since the brand's least expensive heel retails for $US595.\n\nI reached for a pair of black leather wedges and felt prodded in the leg by a stiletto. When I turned back, the wedges were gone.\n\n\"Those are mine. These are all mine. That's my box,\" a young woman wearing a Missoni dress shrieked at me. She had filled a plastic bin. Her mother, a frail older woman carrying a stunning blue snakeskin bag, stood guard over it. \"My bin! We got this bin!\" the mother added in a thick Eastern European accent.\n\nI saw one shopper snatch a pair of shoes out of another woman's pile and refuse to give them back. The rightful owner began to tear up while she continued to riffle through the piles. I heard someone yell, \"Get away from me!\" It would have been an apocalyptic nightmare if the shoes weren't so beautiful.\n\nIn the centre of the room, 15 or so younger buyers were all trying on shoes and bartering. A bride desperately needed white, bejewelled heels for her wedding. She traded two pairs of boots to get them. \"I had to dig under a table to get those boots, but I need the white heels more,\" she said.\n\nI strolled to the table of mismatched shoes. It was piled three shoes high, and a visibly unhappy employee was trying to find mates while being screamed at by a short, older man who was determined to find the match for a snakeskin sandal.\n\nTaking a final lap around the conference room turned into a discount-shoe free-fire-zone, I found a unicorn: a true sample of a classic model, the Lauratomod. For two years, these sandals had sat forgotten in a Manolo Blahnik showroom or warehouse. The Lauratomod is one of the brand's more popular styles, a thick-strapped sandal with a chunky heel. It's practical, but not in the way your mother insists your shoes ought to be. (And it was 87 per cent off, which my mother would approve of.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sample was slightly defective: it was missing the ankle strap, a simple black patent leather strap that I later purchased at a shoe repair store for $10. As I walked toward checkout with my purchase, a woman stopped me. \"I found those earlier, and I think I'd like to buy them,\" she told me. \"I put them back, but I want them again. Are you willing to give them up?\"\n\nI was not.\n\nNEWSWEEK\n\nNot For Syndication", "description": "Never bring a handbag to a luxury sample sale in New York.
