[Photo/CHINA DAILY]\n\nThe Shanghai International Medical Center, known as SIMC, and The London Clinic, or TLC, have signed a memorandum of understanding to create a partnership in knowledge sharing.\n\nThe agreement was signed at the clinic in Marylebone in London on Monday and the focus will be on oncology, gynaecology and urology as well as looking into robotic surgery.\n\nThis will be the first time the 87-year-old private London hospital has partnered with a hospital in China.\n\nAl Russell, chief executive of TLC, said: \"At the heart of this partnership is knowledge share. Our doctors go to China, and SIMC doctors come here and we both learn as institutions about how we advance health care and that has patients at the heart of it.\"\n\nSIMC hopes that the memorandum will pave the way for a nurse training program at the Chinese hospital as well as learning about UK hospital services and management.\n\n\"We want doctors from TLC to practice and consult patients at SIMC and I hope this will help advance our doctors and improve our working system,\" said Huang Yirun, SIMC president. \"At the same time, we can help TLC by expanding the Chinese market for them.\"\n\nHuang praised the London hospital's nursing practices and patient care and would like to see similar skills and services established at SIMC.\n\nHuang added, \"There are around 800 consultants practicing at TLC, they are top doctors in the UK, so we would like to see consultants working with us. Also, at SIMC we have over 2,000 consultants from public hospitals who practice at SIMC who could offer its services to TLC.\"\n\nThe Chinese delegation from SIMC were also given a tour of TLC, which included visits to the oncology department, intensive care unit and radiotherapy department.\n\nThe delegation also spoke to staff members at the London hospital on the day-today management of the hospital and departments.\n\n\"We've chosen to focus on areas that will be naturally complimentary for knowledge share,\" Russell added.\n\n\"So oncology is one of those, gynaecology is another and also urology, where we do a lot of robotic surgery here at TLC. Hopefully, SIMC will see that we have strengths that they want to learn from, and they may be using technologies that we should learn from.\"", "description": "The Shanghai International Medical Center, known as SIMC, and The London Clinic, or TLC, have signed a memorandum of understanding to create a partnership in knowledge sharing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da69affa310cf3e97a1782b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
