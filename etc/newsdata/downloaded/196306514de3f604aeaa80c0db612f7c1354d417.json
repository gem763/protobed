Will Investors Get on Board?", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nYou can bet on Asia\u2019s lead in electric-vehicle technology. Betting on the companies involved is trickier.\n\nWhile dignitaries discussed climate change at the United Nations, the race to replace carbon-spewing automobiles was on half a world away. Five of the top six electric-car battery producers are South Korean or Chinese, says James Lim, who heads Korea research at Dalton Investments.\n\nThe only developed-market firm in the mix is Japan\u2019s Panasonic (ticker: 6572.Japan). Korea\u2019s battery big three\u2014 LG Chem (051910.Korea), Samsung SDI (006400.Korea), and SK Innovation (096770.Korea)\u2014are leveraging existing expertise in cellphone batteries. Chinese champions Contemporary Amperex Technology , or CATL (300750.China), and BYD (1211.Hong Kong) were willed into existence by generous industry subsidies from their government.\n\nThese companies should in theory be exciting investors. With dominant auto makers from Volkswagen to General Motors betting on an electric future, demand for batteries will outstrip supply for at least three years, Lim predicts. LG Chem, viewed as the industry leader for now, has a $100 billion order backlog. Markets are cautious anyway. All of the battery makers\u2019 stocks have declined this year except Samsung SDI, which is up 7%.\n\nOne big reason is that China slammed the brakes on state support that was propping up some 500 companies in the electric-vehicle space, says Jack Barkenbus, a visiting scholar at Vanderbilt University. Beijing shrank the subsidy pie by some 60% this year and may cut further next year. Shares in BYD, which puts most of its batteries in its own cars, have slid 22% year to date. CATL, a purer play on batteries, has gotten off with a 3.5% dip.\n\nThe longer-term problem is knowing which horse to back in an emerging industry. Global auto makers may make life tougher for battery suppliers by manufacturing their own down the road. \u201cWe\u2019re not very keen on investment on EV,\u201d says Michael Oh, lead manager of the Matthews Asia Innovators fund. \u201cEven though industry growth is very strong, there\u2019s a lot of competition coming in.\u201d There\u2019s also the issue that making EV batteries is a money loser at present.\n\nThe Korean players are also weighed down by their roots in the multitentacled conglomerates known as chaebol. The core business of both LG Chem and SK Innovation is oil refining and petrochemicals, Lim says. Batteries were pasted in at some point by headquarters. Little wonder that shares in Samsung SDI, a battery-focused spinoff from the electronics giant, are outperforming.\n\nThings may get better. Electric-car battery manufacturing will turn profitable by early next year, Lim predicts. New European Union regulations should stimulate the industry there starting in 2021. Brussels will cut auto makers\u2019 fleet-wide carbon-emissions targets by 20%. Chinese companies that survive the subsidy cutback will be firmer on their feet, with CATL probably in position to compete globally, says Simon Webber, portfolio manager for the Hartford Schroders International Stock fund. \u201cThe next 12 months is tricky,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m one of the bulls on profitability from the end of 2020 onward.\u201d\n\nFrom railroads to dot-coms and solar panels, many early players in transformative industries failed, and investors took their chances. What\u2019s new about electric-car batteries is that they\u2019re being pioneered in emerging markets. The purportedly advanced nations are straggling behind, despite U.S.-based Tesla\u2019s plans to supply its own vehicles. \u201cThe U.S. will never get ahead of the Asians in lithium-ion batteries,\u201d Vanderbilt\u2019s Barkenbus says. \u201cMaybe we can catch them in the next generation, solid state.\u201d", "description": "Investors can bet on Asia\u2019s lead in electric-vehicle technology.
