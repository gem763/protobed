The festival symbolises the spiritual \u2018victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance,\u2019 with light as a metaphor for knowledge and consciousness.\n\nDiwali also marks a major shopping period in India, comparable to the Christmas period in terms of consumer purchases and economic activity.\n\nIt is traditionally a time when large purchases are made as the festival is dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and such purchases are considered auspicious.\n\nThis includes investments made in precious metals, such as gold, as well as those via muharat trading which is a non-scheduled trading hour, especially for Diwali, which usually takes place in the evening.\n\nInvestors place token orders and buy stocks for their children, which are held for the long term and sometimes never sold. Traders normally book their intra-day profits, however small they may be.\n\nAs Diwali also marks the beginning of the New Year, it is believed that muhurat trading on this day brings in wealth and prosperity throughout the year.\n\nAn auspicious beginning is thus made on the first day of the year.\n\nWhich India funds are shooting fireworks?\n\nJuliet Schooling Latter, research director at FundCalibre, said India is currently the team's favourite emerging market, and has been for many years.\n\nShe recommends the $1.8billion (\u00a31.4billion) Goldman Sachs India Equity portfolio which is up 73 per cent over the last five years and invests in companies of all sizes but has a natural bias to medium and smaller-sized ones.\n\nFundCalibre's Schooling Latter says Goldman Sachs' India Equity portfolio has a solid investment process\n\n'This means it is heavily dependent on the Indian economy and it can be volatile as a result,' she said.\n\n'But it has a solid investment process and we particularly like the many company meetings the team undertake - the team never says no to a meeting as it can always learn something about the industry, even if it has no intention of investing.'\n\nThe fund has an ongoing charges figure (OCF) of 1.05 per cent and holds between 70 and 90 holdings, to reduce stock-specific risk.\n\nSchooling Latter is also a fan of the $54million (\u00a341million) IIFL India Equity Opportunities (formerly Ashburton India Equity Opportunities).\n\nShe added: 'Its experienced team has shown that holding a smaller number of stocks of only 20 to 30 can work well and still achieve diversification.\n\n'The managers analyse the macroeconomic environment and industry trends, before undertaking company analysis. We like the fact that they prioritise companies that treat their shareholders properly.'\n\nThe fund is up 18 per cent over five years and has an OCF of 1.83 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile Richard Pearson, director at Selftrade from Equiniti, said India looks attractive and remains 'relatively untapped' but that issues with volatility and transparency remain.\n\nHe said: 'In recent years, India has become a firm favourite among adventurous investors, with fast economic growth delivering stellar returns. It is a global outperformer, boasting some world-class companies and entrepreneurs, a rising middle class and growing generation of under 25s.\n\n'However, as an investment opportunity, India is still somewhat of a conundrum to global investors, with volatility and a lack of transparency discouraging many investors. Those looking to access this market should tread carefully, especially with recent signs that India\u2019s economic growth has slowed, after its central bank downgraded its forecasts and slashed interest rates.'\n\nHowever, he recommends the \u00a3746million Jupiter India fund for its long-term track record of great returns and the fact 'manager Avinash Vazirani has been at the helm since launch in 2008' because it 'gives some stability in a market that can be volatile'.\n\n'Meanwhile, investors that are keen on India but are anxious about putting all their \u201cAsian eggs\u201d in one basket, may want to get exposure to India through a broader fund such as Aberdeen Standard\u2019s $2.2billion (\u00a31.7billion) ASI Emerging Markets Equity fund which has just short of 15 per cent exposure to India.'\n\nOver five years, the Jupiter India fund has returned 43 per cent while ASI EM Equity is up 39 per cent. The funds have OCFs of 1.07 per cent and 1.21 per cent respectively.\n\nOcean Dial AM's Cornell said there are opportunities to be found in India's domestic and cyclical sectors\n\nWhere are the opportunities in India?\n\nDavid Cornell, CIO of Ocean Dial Asset Management, which manages the \u00a381million India Capital Growth investment trust, said the team is finding opportunities within the domestic and cyclical sectors as economic recovery through better monetary policy and lower taxes remains on the government's agenda.\n\n'We\u2019d advise investors to look towards the industrial sector as well as companies exposed to the rural economy as agricultural price inflation is ticking upwards, which is positive news for farmers\u2019 incomes.\n\n'Value can also be found in consumption focused stocks which have previously been de-rated due to concerns about a slowdown in consumer demand. Furthermore, the media sector is due to benefit from an increase in consumer demand as companies pour more money into advertising.'\n\nCornell said the portfolio maintains a decent exposure to financials which is unlikely to change but also cautions that 'as India moves through this liquidity crisis, there are pockets of the financial sector that remain heavily under pressure'.\n\nHe added: 'How and when this draws to an end remains unclear and it is possible that further government intervention is needed to restore confidence.\n\n'Whilst volatility in India\u2019s financial sector is currently a cause for concern, over the long term it is central to the successful development of the economy and a core holding across all portfolios.'\n\nWhile still looking at financials, Rukhshad Shroff, manager of the \u00a3772million JP Morgan Indian investment trust, is focusing on the private sector, which he said is 'gaining market share at the expense of public sector banks, which are less well managed and less well capitalised'.\n\nHe added: 'We seek to invest in companies which have good long term growth prospects, with management teams which combine a strong ability to execute with robust corporate governance.\n\n'We\u2019ve had a long term overweight in private sector banks, such as HDFC Bank, India\u2019s largest private sector lender. These private sector banks are high quality, well-managed businesses positioned for growing profits and market share gains from public sector banks over the long term.'\n\nIn terms of where is less interesting at the moment, Kunal Desai, partner at Mobius Capital Partners, home to the \u00a395million Mobius Investment Trust, said businesses where the top line is driven by market prices like the global macro price or oil price are best avoided.\n\n'We typically avoid within oil and gas, global metals, and utilities which tend to be inversely impacted by regulation. We also dislike non-banking financial companies which have lent to real estate companies and developers in construction finance where there could be a huge pull on their profitability if one or two go bust.\n\n'The retail side looks very interesting but we are still concerned about the more wholesale lending models.'\n\nThe top performing India-focused investment funds and trusts include Nomura's India Equity fund and Aberdeen's New India trust. Both have outperformed the MSCI India index over the last five years\n\nGoing for gold?\n\nA telling indicator that consumption is set to increase in India is the price of gold, and when valued in rupees, gold has recently rallied approximately 25 per cent - likely in preparation for the festive Diwali month, when gold is often gifted to family members.\n\nCornell added: 'A significant part of rural families\u2019 savings is held in gold, so when the price increases people borrow more against the gold they have in order to consume more.'\n\nBut it seems as though gold has also rallied closer to home ahead of the festivities. Nicola Howell, director of precious metals at The Royal Mint, said: 'The run up to Diwali has historically had a significant impact on demand for gold in the weeks prior to the celebrations and this is a trend that also correlates with our own data.\n\n'Throughout September and the first half of October we have experienced a 32 per cent rise in online sales of the precious metal compared to the same period last year which we attribute largely to Diwali preparations.'\n\nWhat about the politics?\n\nCornell said ongoing political stability following the recent election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a 'huge plus for India' and differentiates it from many other markets, both developed and emerging.\n\nHe also expects more reform-based initiatives by the government designed to support further economic progress.\n\nMobius Capital Partners' Desai said India has one of the highest levels of political stability\n\nHe said: 'The current period of disappointing low growth is forcing the government to take tough economic decisions which will in time support more secular growth.\n\n'Our expectation is that further reforms of the banking sector and in particular the insolvency laws will be a priority, which will help the banks to pick up the pace of lending again.\n\n'The long-term outlook is better than it has ever been \u2013 interest rates are coming down, the currency stable, India has more currency reserves than it has ever had before and most importantly the Indian government is fully committed to fiscal discipline.'\n\nDesai added the positive for India is that its political risk premia against other emerging markets will continue to fall.\n\n'India has one of the highest levels of political stability,' he said. 'Even if we see concerns from the US or a recession on the horizon, while India will have a negative start, the fallout will still be lower than that in the developed world.'\n\nSchooling Latter also noted the country has gone from 'strength to strength' since Modi first came into power in 2014 and that 'the ease with which businesses can operate there is transforming'.\n\n'Having won a landslide election earlier this year, Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign - the primary goal of which is making India a global manufacturing hub, by encouraging both multinational and domestic companies to manufacture their products within the country \u2013 is now a priority,' she added.\n\n\n\nJPM India top ten holdings Name Rank Portfolio weighting (%) HDFC BANK 1 9.94 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION 2 8.72 CASH & OTHER 3 8.72 TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES 4 8.42 AXIS BANK 5 6.24 MARUTI SUZUKI INDIA 6 5.6 KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK 7 5.01 LARSEN & TOUBRO 8 4.99 ULTRATECH CEMENT 9 4.85 ITC 10 4.73 Source: FE Analytics as at 30/09/2019\n\nThe outlook for the Indian economy\n\nMeanwhile Shroff explained while there is no doubt the recent announcement of lower taxes is a positive step towards the longer term objective, and could boost near term earnings for corporate India, it 'does not resolve the fundamental issues challenging the economy at this point in time' such as 'systemic concerns around wholesale lenders, which have impacted credit availability and led to risk aversion in the banking system'.\n\n'Lower taxes are unlikely to spur a new capex cycle in the near term since utilisation levels need to improve sustainably before corporate India feels confident enough to announce large investments.'\n\nThe idea that lower taxes will stimulate a supply chain shift from China to India will also only play out over the longer run. And if there is a flipside to the cut, it highlights the uncertainty around tax rates in India, unhelpfully for a country hoping to attract investments of all kinds.\n\nShroff said he continues to monitor the reaction of ratings agencies given historically high foreign ownership of Indian bonds.\n\nPearson cautioned: 'India is best suited to those with higher-risk profiles and long-term horizons. Investors should think twice when investing money in emerging markets, if they need it back in a hurry; India is no exception, with political and economic risk driving volatility.'", "description": "With Diwali due to arrive this weekend, we take a look at the opportunities to invest in India, the struggles its high-growth economy faces, and get experts' views on funds to choose.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
