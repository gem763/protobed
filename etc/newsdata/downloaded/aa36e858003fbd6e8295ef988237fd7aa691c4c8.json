(AP) - Despite having lost a fumble in each of the first three games, running back Chris Carson has the support of the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nCoach Pete Carroll\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s all about the ball\u201d philosophy runs counter to a running back being unable to hold onto it. However, the Seahawks firmly believe this is just an unfortunate blip on the radar.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see absolute support for our guy,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great football player. We love him.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s fumble against Cincinnati in Week 1 didn\u2019t come back to haunt Seattle as the Bengals would fumble on their ensuing possession as well. However, T.J. Watt punched the ball free of Carson\u2019s grasp in Pittsburgh to set up a James Conner 1-yard touchdown run. Saints cornerback Eli Apple punched the ball free of Carson\u2019s grasp at the end of a 22-yard gain and Vonn Bell scooped up the loose ball for a 33-yard touchdown last Sunday.\n\n\u201cYou got to move on from it. It happens. You got to move on, keep going,\u201d Carson said.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though it\u2019s some new idea Carson has to tackle. As a running back, he\u2019s acutely aware of his need to hold on to the football and the techniques that give him the best chance of succeeding in that task. He fumbled just three times on 267 touches last season.\n\n\u201cI just kind of went up to him and said, \u2018You know, some of the greatest running backs, Walter Payton fumbled, too,\u2019\u201d quarterback Russell Wilson said. \u201cHe just kind of laughed and I said it\u2019s going to happen. Just realize you\u2019re a great football player. Go for it.\u201d\n\nCarson said he appreciates the support from his teammates and feels it\u2019s never wavered despite his current run of misfortune.\n\nWhile his three fumbles last season came over a span of 14 games, the three fumbles in three weeks this year have put a massive spotlight on the issue. He didn\u2019t fumble during any of the four games he played in as a rookie and didn\u2019t have issues with ball security during his college career at Oklahoma State, either.\n\nHe expects opposing teams will be that much more focused on attacking the ball given his recent problems with ball security.\n\n\u201cJust try to keep getting better. The defense is going to try to go after the ball so I\u2019ve got to be aware of that,\u201d Carson said.\n\nWhile C.J. Prosise received more snaps in the wake of Carson\u2019s fumble Sunday, Carson remains the team\u2019s most production back. Rashaad Penny is questionable to play Sunday due to a hamstring injury and could get some more work should Carson\u2019s issues continue. However, the team firmly believes Carson\u2019s problems won\u2019t persist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to pass,\u201d offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any doubt about that. We totally support him. Nobody feels worse about it than he does. The biggest thing for us is we know he\u2019s a warrior, we know he\u2019s a great player. He\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nNotes: DE Ziggy Ansah (back), DT Quinton Jefferson (hip), RB Rashaad Penny (hamstring) and CB Neiko Thorpe are all questionable to play against Arizona on Sunday. However, Carroll indicated all four have a good chance to play. . C/G Ethan Pocic (back) is doubtful.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Despite having lost a fumble in each of the first three games, running back Chris Carson has the support of the Seattle Seahawks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Curtis Crabtree"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/seahawks-carsons_fumbles_football_69207_c0-158-3780-2361_s1770x1032.jpg?4cf8d91ab985b6bdf16abf575ce8866398896294", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
