The Bronx native averaged more than $3.35 million in ticket revenue per show. The Jonas Brothers are the only other act in the LIVE75 top 10 to pass the $2 million-per-show mark, with fellow veteran Elton John pulling $1.97 million each night on his farewell tour.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSince the beginning of 2019, the piano man's year-to-date box office results at Madison Square Garden for a nine-show gross totals $22.6 million from 167,156 tickets.\n\nJoel will add to his numbers when he visits Arlington, Texas on Oct. 12, followed by three more shows at Madison Square Garden before the end of the year. Joel is scheduled for an appearance in Charlotte next April, but beyond that, the touring career of the nation's third-highest-selling solo artist is uncertain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The legendary singer still draws more fans than any other actively touring artist.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/9a326b3f1a7ea410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-Music-Bonnaroo-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
