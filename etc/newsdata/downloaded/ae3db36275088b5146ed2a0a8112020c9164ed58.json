If the ball reverses later on as well, we just wanted to add an another seaming option.\u201d\n\nThe touring side also decided to go in with an extra fast bowler and handed Anrich Nortje, 25, a test debut, replacing off-spinner Dane Piedt.\n\n\u201cThere will be something there this morning,\u201d South Africa captain Faf du Plessis said, adding he was not too disappointed with losing the toss.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we start ahead in the test match and from there we can almost take day four, day five out of the equation if we bowl really well in the first innings.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can take the 20 wickets, that\u2019s something we didn\u2019t do in the first test. That\u2019s why we are bring in someone that can potentially bring us wickets.\u201d\n\nTeams:\n\nIndia - Rohit Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami\n\nSouth Africa - Aiden Markram, Dean Elgar, Theunis de Bruyn, Temba Bavuma, Faf du Plessis (captain), Quinton de Kock, Senuran Muthusamy, Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje", "description": "India captain Virat Kohli won the toss and opted to bat against South Africa in the second test of the three-match series at Pune on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
