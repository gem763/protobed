New Jersey has leaves. They fall.\n\nBut if you want to avoid a little muscle ache by employing a leaf blower instead of a rake, get ready to do battle with the powers that be.\n\nNeighborhood advocacy groups in Maplewood and Princeton complain that, like Marty McFly\u2019s band in \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d the infernal contraptions are just too darn loud.\n\nMaplewood banned the summer use of leaf blowers by commercial businesses earlier this year. Now Princeton is seeking to follow suit for fall, and Maplewood is looking to expand its ban.\n\nExisting regulations designed to keep the noise down to a reasonable level are not good enough. Princetonians want silence.\n\n\u201cNo one would think this reasonable,\u201d Tony Lunn, an activist with the group Quiet Princeton, told Mercer Space, a publication of Community News Service.\n\nReasonableness, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Or, in this case perhaps, in the back of the beholder.\n\nA prohibition limited to commercial leaf blowers puts the burden \u2013 literally \u2013 on the employees of landscaping companies, rather than on Joe Springsteen clearing his own yard. That drives up the cost of landscaping work if Joe hires somebody, while adding considerably to the physical toll on the manual laborers actually doing the work. And rest assured, not many of them can afford to live in Maplewood, where the median household income is more than $100,000 per year.\n\nThis seems to be a thing in New Jersey.\n\nLast January, Gov. Chris Christie signed into law a bill making it legal for New Jersey residents to offer snow shoveling services without first registering with their town. Truly, a great moment in individual liberty.\n\nThe law took effect just days before a blizzard hit the East Coast. It was inspired by the case of two entrepreneurial teens who had gone door-to-door the previous winter offering to shovel snow for a small fee. Cops in the borough of Bound Brook told the two boys they were not allowed to solicit businesses without a permit, which cost $450 for six-months.\n\nAt least if it snows in New Jersey this winter, kids can now make a buck shoveling it for you.\n\nLest anyone think this is a New Jersey-only phenomenon, let\u2019s move on to springtime, when a young man\u2019s fancy turns to \u2026 lemonade.\n\nTexans pride themselves on their history of individual liberty. But in the liberal enclave of Austin, things are a little different \u2013 even if you\u2019re a kid trying to sell lemonade.\n\nCity officials graciously established \u201cLemonade Day\u201d in May as a one-time parole for miscreant lemon squeezers to hawk their wares without fear of sanction.\n\nOn that day, you still have to register, but the usual $35 to obtain a \u201ctemporary food permit\u201d is waived, and so is the $425 for \u201ca license agreement and fees\u201d to use public property, according to the Institute for Justice, which has represented the pint-sized purveyors.\n\nThe rest of the year, lemonade stands are governed by grown-up rules that bar home-prepared foods (kind of defeating the purpose of a front-yard lemonade stand), require a ceiling or canopy above prep areas, and prohibit eating, drinking and smoking \u2013 in case your six-year-old wants to light up between squeezes \u2013 in the selling area.\n\nBut at least the lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer are free from such nonsense. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThis past summer witnessed an attempt by officials in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to ban pools.\n\nIt was, to say the least, something of a surprise to many in the seaside resort town, which prospers by catering to the needs of its more than 100,000 summer visitors.\n\nBut, facing complaints from year-round residents about too much noise \u2013 maybe they could replace the pools with leaf blowers \u2014 city officials walked up to the edge of the pool, stuck their toe in, then decided not to jump.\n\nProperty owner Rebecca Howland told Delaware Online \u201cthere is clearly a tinge of hysteria based on anecdotal testimony.\u201d\n\nCity officials ultimately decided against the ban \u2013 after word of the proposal went viral and more than 1,000 people showed up to protest.\n\nRehoboth Mayor Sam Cooper was nevertheless sure he was right.\n\n\u201cI have a vision of Rehoboth,\u201d he told the Washingtonian. \u201cIf you\u2019re outside of that, then we\u2019re going to have issues.\u201d\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is the problem.\n\nFor no matter the season, the nannies are watching you. And they are always absolutely sure they are right.", "description": "When Carole King wrote \u201cwinter, spring summer or fall, all .09/02/2019 3:15:05AM EST.", "authors": ["John Bicknell", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/12/Fall-colors-300x225.jpg"}
