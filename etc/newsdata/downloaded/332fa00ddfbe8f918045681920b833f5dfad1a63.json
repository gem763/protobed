Once finished, the library will aso be released under an open source license.\n\nMozilla previously tried to ship a similar translation feature\n\nMost of the work will be done on perfecting the actual Bergamot library, rather than modifying the Firefox codebase. Firefox already ships with a user interface (UI) to support a page translation feature.\n\nThis UI was added a few years back when Mozilla first wanted to add a page translation feature similar to the one in Google Chrome. Plans were scrapped after Mozilla realized that supporting the feature would incur massive financial costs it could not sustain.\n\nHowever, Mozilla always wanted a feature similar to the one in Chrome, and the UI was left inside Firefox, while the API keys for various translation services were never added, with engineers hoping that leadership will eventually find the money to support it, or a better solution will arise in the future.\n\nUsers can enable this UI by going to the about:config options page, and enabling the browser.translation.ui.show and browser.translation.detectLanguage settings. Firefox Nightly users can enable these two options to see how work on Bergamot advances.\n\nLast week, Firefox developer Kelly Davis published two demos of Bergamot in action, showing that the library has existed the concept phase and is now at a usable state.", "description": "Firefox's page translation feature will work offline, with a local library, rather than cloud-based translation services.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/20/735f9f0c-3cd3-45e4-b528-050e467f0a8f/thumbnail/770x578/affdb496e16176cab6206c3a1d671da2/firefox-translation.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
