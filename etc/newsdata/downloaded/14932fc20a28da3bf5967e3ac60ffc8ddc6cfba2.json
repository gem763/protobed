It was heavy rain, it was very cold.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I saw Pablo sleeping again at the bus stop that evening I pulled up in my car next to the bus stop and offered him some money so he could get a hotel or some food. He was awake.\n\n\"He told me that he couldn't accept the money for religious reasons. I asked him if he needed any food, he asked for some endamame.\n\n\"It being two o'clock in the morning on Sunday night, he told me he was vegan and there was not going to be any vegan options in anywhere open at that time.\"\n\nDistrict Judge Nigel Deane heard how the next day, Harry bought the man two sandwiches, two salads and two muffins from a vegan cafe, but decided to stop interacting with him following an \"odd\" incident.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\n\"He asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant to eat,\" Harry recalled.\n\n\"I told him I was on my way to work. I found it a little odd. His facial expression made me feel a little uneasy. It was like a smirk.\n\n\"Until that point, I never felt unsafe or uneasy in my own home.\"\n\nTwo months later, Harry said his stalker had \"lunged\" at him and \"blocked his path\" as he went running.\n\nTarazaga-Orero demanded money and continued staring after Harry as he ran off.\n\n\"I never really encountered this kind of behaviour before,\" he went on.\n\n\"I've employed a night guard. I continue to lock my bedroom door at night.\"\n\nHe also said he continues to check for \"weak spots\" in his home.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe judge praised Harry for his actions, calling him a \"credible witness\".\n\nHe said: \"It would be fair for me to say at this stage that I found Mr Styles to be a reliable and credible witness.\n\n\"It seemed to me that he was doing his best to assist the court. I didn't find any major inconsistencies or shortcomings in relation to his evidence.\"\n\nJudge Deane said the \"primary reason\" the defendant camped in a bus stop outside Harry's home in March was \"that he knew that Mr Styles lived close by\".\n\nHe added: \"Mr Styles felt sorry for a young man who he saw to be living without a home during the winter when it was cold and raining very heavily and having first noticed him he then out of goodness of his heart stopped on the tenth of March and offered to fund the defendant's hotel accommodation that evening.\n\n\"I found the suggestion that Mr Styles also, the suggestion that he would accompany the defendant for fun to be completely incredible.\n\n\"These were honest, well intended, good intentions from somebody who was trying to help another for whom he felt sorry and who he thought was down on his luck.\n\n\"He knew perfectly well that what he was doing at that stage amounted to harassment of Mr Styles.\n\n\"I'm quite satisfied that this behaviour had the effect of harassing Mr Styles.\"\n\nThe sentencing was adjourned at Hendon Magistrates court for reports.\n\nTarazaga-Orero was released on conditional bail.", "description": "Pablo Tarazaga-Orero has been found guilty of one count of stalking One Direction singer Harry Styles", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Stanley", "Backgrid", "Getty Images", "Filmmagic", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20576946.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-EXCLUSIVE-MUST-CALL-FOR-PRICING-BEFORE-USAGE-Police-attended-Pop-Star-Harry-Styles-North-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
