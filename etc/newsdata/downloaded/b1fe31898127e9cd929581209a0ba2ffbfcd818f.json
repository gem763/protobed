Even if intentions are good.\n\nCadbury\u2019s thought it was doing something special for India\u2019s 72nd independence celebration this month.\n\nIt invented a single candy bar that contains four kinds of chocolate. There\u2019s dark chocolate and milk chocolate and blended chocolate and white chocolate all in one bar.\n\nCalled it the Unity Bar. To celebrate the many kinds of Indians in India. Get it? To combat racism. \u201cMade to celebrate India and her people because sweet things happen when we unite,\u201d the company said.\n\nSweet idea. No pun intended. As a publicity stunt, it works great. Look, we\u2019re writing about it nearly 9,000 miles away.\n\nA lot of people probably liked the fuzzy feeling. Even though, hey, it\u2019s a candy bar. And it\u2019s melty summer-time.\n\nOthers, however, on principle dislike this kind of corporate virtue-signaling. You know, just make the chocolate as good as usual. And next time leave out the dark chocolate. And maybe the white too.\n\nIndia is a fascinating and diverse place. Very diverse. It\u2019s now challenging China as the world\u2019s most populous country with just under 1.4 billion people packed into an area about one-third the size of the United States.\n\nIndia\u2019s Constitution designates Hindi as the official language, though English is also accepted for work. Around 44 percent of the country speaks Hindi. But \u2014 wait for it \u2014 22 other languages are also recognized as regional languages.\n\nCadbury\u2019s, which is actually owned by Mondelez International, which used to be Kraft Snack Foods, and its ad agency, Ogilvy India, caused a different kind of stir on social media in India.\n\nApparently, some of its Unity Bar ads used the wrong language in some regions. But, hey, that\u2019s diverse too in its own clumsy way, right?\n\nThe Unity Bar was a limited edition confection. So, the threat of chocolate diversity in a single candy bar infecting North America is distant. Please pass the Hershey bar, the one with Almonds.", "description": "You can't seem to escape it", "authors": ["Andrew Malcolm", "Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CadburyDiversityBar715.jpg"}
