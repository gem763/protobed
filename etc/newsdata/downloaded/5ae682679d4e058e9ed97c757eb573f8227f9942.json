But her involvement has apparently gone further, with Lloyd Webber telling the Daily Mail that she had written the lyrics to a new song, called Beautiful Ghosts, for the film.\n\nThe song will feature in a performance by ballet dancer Francesca Hayward, who plays the feline character of Victoria, a role that has been expanded from the stage version to make it more central to the plot.\n\nLloyd Webber told the newspaper the song would also be sung briefly by Dame Judy Dench, who plays Old Deuteronomy. It was reportedly written over a year ago.\n\nCats trailer\u2019s weirdness would have appealed to TS Eliot, suggests estate Read more\n\nSwift will also perform her own version of the song over the end credits. The new song means the film becomes eligible for best song categories in prestigious annual film awards such as the Academy awards. Swift has never won an Oscar, although Lloyd Webber has \u2013 in 1997, with Tim Rice, for a song from Evita.\n\nLloyd Webber penned the score for the original stage musical, based on TS Eliot\u2019s Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats, in 1977 and it was first performed on stage in 1981. The wafer-thin plot tells the story of the Jellicles, a colony of cats, over the night of their annual Jellicle ball.\n\nPlay Video 2:24 Watch the Cats movie trailer - video\n\nThe forthcoming film adaptation is directed by Tom Hooper, who was behind the 2012 live-action version of Les Mis\u00e9rables. Its ensemble cast contains some of the biggest names in film and television, including Dench, Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Jason Derulo, and Sir Ian McKellen.\n\nThe trailer for the film sent jaws dropping when it debuted in July, depicting as it did not actual cats, but humans apparently transmogrified into dancing and singing, oddly sized furry human-cat hybrids.\n\nSome viewers called the trailer cursed, nightmarish, and resembling a \u201cdemented dream ballet\u201d.\n\nCats opens in cinemas in the UK, US and Australia in December.", "description": "Singer has written the lyrics to new song Beautiful Ghosts for the film, theatrical legend is quoted as saying", "authors": ["Stephanie Convery"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb371b1c78c237299653a0367702ec68a3821d8e/547_131_949_569/master/949.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=122344349735c3d5eff9d94bfcc14df6", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
