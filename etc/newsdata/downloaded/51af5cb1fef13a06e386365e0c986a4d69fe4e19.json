If someone at your table ordered it after dinner you\u2019d probably assume they were pregnant or had high blood pressure \u2014 it certainly couldn\u2019t be for the taste, forever denounced as second only to muddy water.\n\n\u2018We assume a good decaf coffee is an exception, not a rule,\u2019 says Richard Hardwick, an expert who judges the UK Barista Championship and is founder of Halo Coffee.\n\nCup by cup, though, that seems to be changing. In May, a report by Mintel found a million Britons had switched to decaf in the previous 12 months. Sales of instant decaf are up 20 per cent since 2017.\n\nIndia Sturgis and Richard Hardwick gave their verdict on a selection of decaf coffees on sale in UK stores, including Sainsbury\u2019s Gold Roast Decaf granules (pictured)\n\nImprovements in how decaffeinated coffee is sourced, roasted and manufactured have led to some blends becoming indistinguishable from the real thing. Meanwhile as we place a greater emphasis on health and wellbeing \u2014 and the elusive eight hours\u2019 sleep \u2014 caffeine is becoming a less attractive commodity.\n\nNowadays, the most popular decaffeination method is the Swiss water process, a chemical-free, patented method pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 that uses water to repeatedly dissolve and remove caffeine from green (unroasted) beans.\n\nAnd expert Richard says there are some really good decafs coming through. You just have to find them. So which should tempt you to make the switch from caffeine?\n\nInstants\n\nSainsbury\u2019s Gold Roast Decaf granules, \u00a33.40 for 200g\n\nA medium-strength instant coffee produced in Spain and made using a blend of arabica and robusta beans.\n\nSustainability: Plastic lid and glass jar are widely recyclable.\n\nRichard says: Tasted of very little. At best, I\u2019d say it was functional.\n\nIndia says: Not great. The flavour was synthetic and plasticy with a musty aftertaste.\n\nVerdict: Little to recommend it. 2/5\n\nClipper Organic Decaf, \u00a34 for 100g, Ocado\n\nIndia claims that she wouldn't have guessed that Clipper Organic Decaf (pictured) from Ocado is decaf\n\nA medium roast using arabica beans.\n\nSustainability: In compliance with Fairtrade and the Soil Association\u2019s organic standards. Plastic lid and glass jar widely recyclable.\n\nRichard says: A few flavour layers present here: a hazelnut nuttiness and a touch of chocolate. Not bad for instant or decaf.\n\nIndia says: I wouldn\u2019t have guessed this was decaf. It had a pleasing smoothness, depth and flavour.\n\nVerdict: Top instant decaf. 3.5/5\n\nNescafe Azera Americano Decaff, \u00a35.89 for 100g, Tesco\n\nRichard says Nescafe Azera Americano Decaff (pictured) has a horribly bitter taste and is his least favourite\n\nA premium Americano-style decaffeinated coffee. Made using a blend of arabica and robusta beans from Colombia, Brazil, Honduras, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nSustainability: Recyclable lid and tube.\n\nRichard says: My least favourite. Horribly bitter. Tasted like licking an old filter paper used to make filter coffee.\n\nIndia says: Not something I\u2019d want to repeat. Too tangy.\n\nVerdict: All style, no substance. 1/5\n\nPods\n\nNespresso Arpeggio decaffeinated, 36p per capsule, Nespresso.com\n\nIndia claims Nespresso Arpeggio decaffeinated (pictured) has a lingering bitterness that stays at the back of the throat\n\nA capsule coffee made using arabica beans from South and Central America.\n\nSustainability: Made to Rainforest Alliance standards, which means the farms, forests and businesses employed all meet set environmental markers.\n\nCapsules are recyclable but the method is convoluted. You must send used capsules to Nespresso-compatible recycling factories using a special recycling bag. Alternatively, you can arrange for collection at home.\n\nRichard says: Sour and punchy. Not particularly pleasant.\n\nIndia says: Bitterness that lingers at the back of the throat like an unwelcome guest.\n\nVerdict: Strong but not in a good way. 2/5\n\nAlcafe Lungo decaf coffee pods, \u00a38.94 for 60 pods, Aldi\n\nRichard was impressed with Alcafe Lungo decaf coffee pods (pictured) for its smooth and balanced taste\n\nA light roast using beans from Colombia, Brazil, India, Uganda and Costa Rica.\n\nSustainability: Capsules are made from plastic and aluminium, so destined for landfill. Carton is card, so recyclable.\n\nRichard says: Smooth, balanced and very drinkable.\n\nIndia says: Full-bodied and Italian and not at all as I expected.\n\nVerdict: Great value and gluggable. 3.5/5\n\nGround/cafetiere\n\nDecadent Decaf Coffee Guatemala Acatenango, \u00a37.49 for 227g, decadentdecaf.com\n\nRichard and India highly rated Decadent Decaf Coffee Guatemala Acatenango (pictured), saying that it doesn't taste like decaf\n\nGrown in Guatemala, the arabica coffee benefits from fertile volcanic soil. The brand has won five Great Taste Awards and roasts in small batches on the south coast of England. Promises notes of blood orange, raisins and milk chocolate.\n\nSustainability: Combination of metal and plastic laminate makes this hard to recycle. Plans to make it plastic-free by mid-2020.\n\nRichard says: A clear favourite on taste and the only one I wouldn\u2019t guess was decaf because there\u2019s so much depth and body. Strong, sweet notes and a pleasant orangey bite. Beautifully crafted.\n\nIndia says: Refined and expensive but perhaps best enjoyed in small quantities or could be sickly.\n\nVerdict: You won\u2019t guess it\u2019s decaf. 5/5\n\nUnion Decaf Blend, \u00a34.40 for 200g, Waitrose\n\nRichard and India say that chocolate lovers will appreciate Union Decaf Blend (pictured)\n\nDark roast arabica beans from Chirinos region in Peru and Maraba in Rwanda.\n\nSustainability: Blend of paper, aluminium and plastic means very few places will recycle this. Union make efforts elsewhere at sustainable practices such as producing biofuel from coffee grounds at its barista training facility.\n\nRichard says: Beautiful aroma. Lingers well and a lovely molasses-like chocolate kick.\n\nIndia says: A subtle taste, which I like. Smooth and sweet.\n\nVerdict: For chocolate lovers. 4/5\n\nHarris & James Colombia Ground Decaf, \u00a35.99 for 250g, harris andjames.com\n\nRichard claims the coffee in Harris & James Colombia Ground Decaf (pictured) looks unevenly ground and he would want a stronger punch to go with the aroma\n\nA blend of Colombian arabica beans from the Popay\u00e1n region.\n\nSustainability: A mixture of materials makes packaging hard to recycle.\n\nRichard says: The coffee looks unevenly ground, which impacts on flavour because you\u2019ll get inconsistencies. A wonderfully strong aroma but I wanted a stronger punch.\n\nIndia says: Was that a hint of citrus? I enjoyed it.\n\nVerdict: Not bad at all. 3/5\n\nAromistico Firenze ground decaf, \u00a36.99 for 200g, Amazon\n\nIndia chose Aromistico Firenze ground decaf (pictured) as her favourite in the selection\n\nA medium/dark blend made with arabica and robusta beans from Honduras and Vietnam. Roasted in small batches in Lake Garda, Switzerland.\n\nSustainability: A mixture of materials makes packaging hard to recycle.\n\nRichard says: An enticing amaretto aroma. I tasted cocoa, spice and plummy fruitiness. Really very nice.\n\nIndia says: A favourite. Bitter enough to wake you up without making you gag.\n\nVerdict: Delicious. 4/5", "description": "A report by Mintel shows that a million Britons have switched to decaf coffee in the past 12 months.
