When you\u2019ve spent at least a decade working in a profession, you\u2019ll find it incredibly jolting to no longer be identified as the person who is a marketing expert, an investment professional, or the management consultant who can figure out how to optimize a business. It\u2019s only after you leave your job do you truly realize how wound up you were in your profession.\n\nYour identity crisis may last as short as three months or it might last for years. It all depends on how wrapped up you were in your job, how long you spent getting educated after high school, and whether you have a clear plan postretirement. Doctors are some of the people who suffer the most after leaving their occupations. Conversely, high school graduates who somehow struck it rich with a product or an invention seem to adjust much easier in postretirement life.\n\nJob titles can be incredibly addictive. Why else do people get so depressed when passed over for promotion? Why else do people try so hard to get promoted sooner and faster than everybody else? Do not underestimate the importance of being a manager, director, vice president, or even a C-level executive.\n\nAfter all, the most common question people ask when they first meet each other is: What do you do for a living? And if you tell them you don\u2019t do anything for a living, well then, you might just feel like a sheepish loser. You\u2019ll want to try to explain yourself, but by then, your three-second first impression will no longer hold the other person\u2019s attention.\n\nWhat happened to me: After working in the Asian equities business for 13 years, it felt hollow to no longer have my Executive Director title or be identified with my investment firm. I felt sad that I could no longer go to Asia for conferences or with clients. For so long, taking a business-class trip to Hong Kong, India, China or Taiwan was part of my quarterly routine. Shallow as it may sound, it felt special to have priority boarding. I felt important when clients would entrust me to show them around in a foreign land.\n\nFor the first year after leaving my job, I wondered how the business was doing without me. Could they really survive without my expertise? After all, I was there for 11 years. Surely, they needed my relationships. But after months went by with no email or phone call from my old firm saying they wanted me back, I had to come to terms that I was no longer important to them.\n\nI wanted to believe that my position meant something to the firm and to the people that I serviced. But at the end of the day, the person I trained to replace me as part of my severance agreement, was good enough. And because he was good enough, I concluded that I was no longer any good.\n\nThis ego hit took me a full year to get over.\n\nRead: Why early retirement is all it\u2019s cracked up to be\n\n2) You will be stuck in your head. When you suddenly have an extra 10 to 14 hours a day of free time, it\u2019s very difficult to optimize your time wisely.\n\nYour productivity will suffer in retirement. You will no longer feel motivated to achieve great wins. As a result, you may slowly start to get depressed. Only after some really deep soul-searching and some, \u201cwhat am I doing with my life?\u201d questioning will you begin to organize your time better and become more productive.\n\nYour mind can be very dangerous because it can always second-guess your actions. Did I retire too soon? What if I run out of money? What if people think I\u2019m a loser? What if I can\u2019t ever get back into the workforce if things go wrong? When you have a lot of time to think, your doubts go on and on.\n\nPerhaps one analogy is to compare being stuck in your head with Locked-in syndrome. LIS is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking. This could be one of my worst nightmares. Retiring early may render you inoperable for a while.\n\nWhat happened to me: Because I left work at age 34, I was worried for about the first two years whether or not I had made the right choice. No rational person leaves a well-paying job to be unemployed in their mid-30s. Your late-30s is when you start to finally make good money. And by the time you reach your 40s, you should be at your maximum earnings power.\n\nDuring my first year of early retirement, to the outside world I proudly proclaimed I was retired from a career in finance. But on the inside, I was second-guessing my decision to leave. Because of my uncertainty, I decided to do some part-time consulting with a financial technology startup for about 20 hours a week. It was a great way to distract my mind from all my fears, earn some side income, and replug myself into society. I also kept in touch with multiple banks until my Series 7 and 63 licenses expired.\n\nFinally, I dived deep into my writing on Financial Samurai. Writing has always been my most cathartic way to deal with any uncertainty or problems I might have. For example, now that I have a son, I\u2019ve been worried about whether our roughly $200,000 a year in passive income is enough to support a family of three if he doesn\u2019t win the San Francisco public school lottery system. It\u2019s taken almost 20 years for me to generate this passive income level, and it still doesn\u2019t seem like enough.\n\nGiven this worry, I did a deep dive budget analysis for a family earning $300,000 a year, and it sure seems like we need to earn $100,000 more to maintain our quality of life in San Francisco. Alternatively, we can always move to a lower cost area of the country or world.\n\nRead: People may be missing the point of early retirement\n\n3) People will treat you like a weird misfit. Whether it\u2019s because retiring early is unconventional or because people are secretly jealous you aren\u2019t grinding away at a day job, people won\u2019t give you the same amount of respect as working-class citizens. After all, if they can\u2019t describe what you do for a living, then they can\u2019t pigeonhole you into an archetype that is comfortable for them.\n\nHaving a job means you are a productive member of society. If you retire at a young age, people will assume you are simply slacking off and not paying any taxes. They\u2019ll sometimes look at you as a leech they want to flick off.\n\nFurther, if you are an outcast, then you won\u2019t be invited to parties or events that other working people always get to attend. You\u2019re simply not top of mind to them. If you are an extrovert, early retirement will be much more difficult than if you are an introvert.\n\nWhat happened to me: After the first year of early retirement, I no longer told anybody I retired early. Instead, I told anybody who asked that I was a writer, a tennis teacher, a fintech consultant, or simply in between jobs. Before that, I think a lot of people just assumed I was a trust fund baby who did not have to work. And the last thing this middle-class guy who went to public school wants to be known as is a trust fund baby.\n\nMy favorite time of the year was during the winter holidays. I loved going to all the holiday parties and getting tipsy with fellow revelers. Now, I get invited to zero holiday parties because I don\u2019t work for anyone. Nor do I get invited to client holiday parties either, even though I have several partners who are based in the San Francisco Bay Area. It may sound silly, but having a drink with good people with shared interests really means a lot to me.\n\nIt takes a lot of effort to build new social networks if you aren\u2019t part of a larger organization. There is no weekend cookout a colleague is hosting on Labor Day Weekend to attend. I\u2019ve had to participate in various meetup events to find new people to hang out with. So far, my social network only revolves around tennis and softball. But even then, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve found buddies who will come over and just chill in the hot tub over a beer or anything.\n\n4) You\u2019ll be disappointed that you aren\u2019t much happier. So many people think that once they achieve financial freedom or leave a job they dislike, they\u2019ll suddenly be permanently happier. The truth of the matter is, your elevated happiness will only last at most three to six months. Eventually, you\u2019ll revert to your natural state of being.\n\nThink back to your high school or college days when you didn\u2019t have any money compared with now. I\u2019d venture to guess you were just as happy, if not happier when you were a broke college student.\n\nHaving the freedom to do what you want is priceless. But you will eventually take your freedom for granted like the air you breathe. On the days you feel angry or sad, you will start questioning what the hell is wrong with you since you\u2019ve got more than the average person. You\u2019ll feel stupid for feeling unhappy when there are literally hundreds of millions of people in the world wondering whether they\u2019ll have enough to eat the next day.\n\nYou think, if I can\u2019t be happy when I\u2019m financially independent, surely there must be something seriously wrong with me. And you could be right! Can you imagine being unhappy as a Norwegian? Norway is perpetually ranked as one of the top five happiest countries in the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with me: I thought I\u2019d be much happier not having to report to a micromanager boss I did not respect. But my increased happiness was fleeting and only lasted for about a week before I was back to my regular self. Instead, my happiness was weighed down by months of uncertainty on whether I had made the right move to leave my job. It was only after about two years did my doubt finally start to dissipate.\n\nAlthough corporate politics no longer upset me, other things end up filling the void. For example, drivers who decide to double park on a busy street in rush hour traffic really bother me now. So do dog owners who let their dogs poop in front of my house and don\u2019t pick up after them. In the past, I could only allocate a small amount of annoyance to such incidences.\n\nInstead of being permanently at a happier level, I\u2019m simply no longer as annoyed or as angry at things as frequently. Further, the volatility around my steady state of happiness is lower. In other words, I\u2019ve mellowed out. That said, don\u2019t offend me because I still enjoy a really good fight.\n\n5) You constantly wonder whether this is all there is to life. Retiring early is like finishing up your favorite longstanding TV show. You\u2019re glad there\u2019s a conclusion, but you\u2019re also sad that it\u2019s over. You hope to find a show that\u2019s as good or better, but there are no guarantees.\n\nMost of us spend 13 years going to grade school so we can spend four years in college to get a decent job. Then we spend decades trying to earn and save money to provide for our family and then one day retire by 65. With good luck, we\u2019ll live for another 20 years to enjoy all the fruits of our labor.\n\nWhen you retire at a much earlier age, you are constantly left wondering what\u2019s next. You are mentally twiddling your thumbs waiting for the next big thing while your close friends are all at work. Early retirement can get extremely mundane and boring because you have nobody to spend time with.\n\nAs a result, you\u2019re repeatedly forced to will yourself into action. This constant self-starting attitude can become extremely trying to the point where you long to rejoin the workforce and be told what to do.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with me: I probably drove my wife nuts during the first two years of early retirement because I constantly told her I was bored. Only boring people get bored right? Wrong. Everybody gets bored at some point. When you\u2019re working, you don\u2019t have time to get bored because you\u2019re working. There\u2019s only so much tennis, golf, and softball I can play before my knees break apart. There are only so many churches to visit in Europe before they all start looking the same.\n\nShe used to have vacations from me because I would be away traveling for work every month. Now she was seeing my cherubic face every single day. It\u2019s a good thing we had three bedrooms at the time. Otherwise, I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019d both have gone crazy from seeing each other so often.\n\nIt was only after our son was born in early 2017 that I felt a renewed sense of purpose. Before my boy, I felt my purpose was to help educate as many readers as possible about personal finance to one day be free. After my boy was born, my purpose has expanded to keeping Financial Samurai running long enough to teach him about operating an online business out of fear he may have a tough time getting ahead. In addition, I now need to live long enough until he finds someone who loves him as much as I love my wife.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to die in peace if there\u2019s nobody to replace his mom or me. As a result, I\u2019m exercising more, eating healthier, and meditating longer.\n\nEarly retirement is great, but it doesn\u2019t solve everything\n\nIt might sound like I\u2019m depressed. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m simply highlighting some of the negatives you will probably go through if you decide to leave the workforce early. The more extroverted you are and the higher your position, the more you will have difficulties making the early retirement adjustment.\n\nHaving the freedom to do what you want cannot be overstated. However, your mind will play games with your spirit during the first few years after leaving work. Some people won\u2019t be able to handle early retirement life and will go back to work.\n\nJust know that with enough conditioning, you will eventually embrace your freedom. Nobody I know who retired from corporate life early stayed retired. You will find your purpose. Once you do, you will take steps, such as building passive income, to ensure you remain free forever.\n\nThis column originally appeared on Financial Samurai.
