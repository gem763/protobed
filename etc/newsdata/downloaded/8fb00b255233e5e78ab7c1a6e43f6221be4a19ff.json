Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Thirst Project\n\nThe slow train from Philly is finally approaching the 15th anniversary of The Office, a milestone that has encouraged fictional Dunder Mifflin foes and real-life best friends, Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, to celebrate in great style: a new podcast, which will definitely help you feel God in any restaurant chain of your choosing. Titled Office Ladies and distributed by Earwolf, the podcast features the BFFs fondly reminiscing episode-by-episode about their time on the sitcom, in case you, like us, have about a thousand lingering questions about Pam\u2019s hair evolution and/or the death of Sprinkles the cat. (The debut episode is out on October 16.) Last week, the giggly duo carved out some time to speak with Vulture over the phone, where they were eager to confirm that, yes, they\u2019d very much love to do an Office reunion. You listening, NBC executives?\n\nWith the launch of your podcast, it\u2019ll now be 14 years after the debut of the show. What do you think Pam and Angela are up to in this glorious year of 2019?\n\nAngela Kinsey: I would love it if Angela and Dwight were running a crappy bed and breakfast on the beet farm with Mose as the idiot valet. I hope Angela and Dwight are happy wherever they are. I like to think they made a lot more Schrutes. They\u2019re somewhere being their annoying selves in love.\n\nJenna Fischer: I like to think Pam and Jim are living a perfectly ordinary life, happily married and raising their children. I hope Pam is expressing herself somehow artistically \u2014 that would be my big dream for her. That she found a job or a way to keep doing her art. Because that was really coming out at the end of the show, but we never get to see it fully realized. So if I ever got to revisit Pam, that would be my first question: Is she still doing murals? Does she have an Etsy shop?\n\nI imagine you both have been inundated with Office-revisiting ideas in various mediums since its end. Can you speak to some of the \u201cbad\u201d ideas you\u2019ve fielded, and why this podcast proved to be the ideal time to reflect on the show?\n\nJF: I wish I had a good story for you about a weird idea, but I really don\u2019t have anything like that. Nobody has pitched me a particularly bad thing.\n\nAK: Same for me. I think the podcast came along at a perfect time because of the 15th anniversary. Jenna and I were hanging out at my house, and I was renovating my guest room and home-office area \u2014 my husband put a desk in the corner, and I had three boxes full of photos and memorabilia from The Office on top of it. Jenna likes to joke I\u2019m a bit of a hoarder, but I like to say I\u2019m a scrapbooker just without the scrapbooks. [Laughs.] We became really nostalgic for the show by hanging out and looking through all of the boxes of stuff, so I said to her I really wanted to rewatch the show fully. I hadn\u2019t done that since we made the show, and neither did Jenna, so we collectively had this Why don\u2019t we do this? moment. Why not? It\u2019s the anniversary, so let\u2019s reminisce and share the memories with the fans.\n\nJF: We\u2019re talkers!\n\nAK: We\u2019re chatty!\n\nJF: The podcast medium is perfect for our personalities.\n\nDo you recall what your first meeting and first impressions of each other were like?\n\nJF: My first impression of Angela was that she was very tiny and wouldn\u2019t stop talking.\n\nAK: I was a tiny chatterbox in her ear. [Laughs.] Jenna was so nice, and she was the closest female that I was sitting next to. I was in the corner with Oscar [Nunez] and Brian [Baumgartner], but I could just stand up and pop over and talk to Jenna. I\u2019d get up on my tippy-toes and be like, \u201cJenna, hellooooooo.\u201d\n\nJF: She was literally the closest person to my desk. I was very lonely at reception. People would often stand in front of me and have conversations, but not talk to me! It would drive me crazy. When I was a real receptionist when I first moved to Los Angeles it would drive me crazy. And then it happened to me again fictionally! It just never ended. I remember being so happy she was right over that partition and was always someone I could talk with.\n\nAK: We would talk all day long. Then we would get in our cars and continue our conversation and talk the whole car ride home.\n\nJF: That\u2019s when we could say all the stuff we couldn\u2019t say on set. Talkin\u2019 gossip that you didn\u2019t want people to overhear. [Laughs.]\n\nAK: Rainn Wilson one time watched us chitchat in-between scenes \u2014 we talked on the entire walk back to our trailers, then we talked during our lunch together, then we talked all the way to hair and makeup, then we talked while back on set, and then we talked all the way to our cars at the end of the day. Rainn was like, \u201cWhat else could you possibly talk about?! You guys have been literally talking the entire day!\u201d That was our defining friendship moment for me.\n\nDid your close friendship ever influence how Pam and Angela were written for the show? The duo were never super chummy with each other, per se, but their relationship softened throughout the seasons, which I liked.\n\nJF: Angela and I had a problem. Every time we had a scene together, we wouldn\u2019t be able to stop laughing.\n\nAK: Even at the most basic sentences, we would crack up.\n\nJF: It was bad. [Laughs.] We would waste so much time laughing!\n\nAK: There was one scene where I come over the partition and I ask Pam, \u201cI need relationship advice, and since you\u2019re always having relationship problems, give me some advice \u2026\u201d after the incident with Sprinkles the cat in the freezer. We couldn\u2019t get through that scene. We were laughing so hard that the director was like, \u201cUh, you know what, I\u2019m gonna give you guys a minute, let\u2019s stop for a break.\u201d The cast was turning on us!\n\nJF: There was that pregnant story line, too, where a potential friendship was teased.\n\nAK: Our characters tried to bond over their pregnancies, but the ways they approached their pregnancies was so different. It was funny naming our babies the same name.\n\nJF: The writers knew we were best friends in real life, and they had fun with the fact that our characters didn\u2019t get along.\n\nAK: Even if we laughed through our scenes and caused delays, NBC would always pair us up for press. They knew we were a great team.\n\nDo you two use Office GIFs a lot with family and friends? Or have any go-tos within your online lexicon that aren\u2019t necessarily of your characters? I\u2019m honestly shocked if a day goes by and I don\u2019t see an Office GIF on social media \u2014 they\u2019re everywhere.\n\nJF: I don\u2019t GIF myself to others, but I\u2019ve definitely been GIF\u2019ed. A loooooot.\n\nAK: Yup, same with me. I\u2019m in a thread chain with a lot of family members, and we\u2019re all very close. One of my cousins loves texting me Office GIFs, so I send him a lot in return.\n\nJF: My two favorite Pam GIFs are her going, \u201cYup\u201d and \u201cI just want to eat.\u201d\n\nAK: I mostly get sent the one of Angela rolling her eyes and Jenna, Oscar, and Angela saying \u201cUnbelievable!\u201d The one of Angela taking Tylenol also pops up a lot in my phone.\n\nIs there an Office text chain for the entire cast?\n\nJF: The Office cast sadly isn\u2019t GIF\u2019ing each other. [Laughs.] There\u2019s not a set text chain or anything, but we all truly text each other all the time.\n\nAK: I have so many mini chains. I have an accounting text thread, just with Oscar and Brian. There\u2019s one with Jenna and Kate. I text Phyllis Smith a lot. Rainn also texts us a lot.\n\nOkay, I have some specific Office questions I\u2019d love to ask. What would you say was the best party in the Party Planning Committee\u2019s history?\n\nAK: You have to go with the Christmas episodes. The Christmas parties are iconic. The yankee swap one was pretty amazing.\n\nJF: Ah yes, the party where I shriek and stomp on ornaments. Any of the Christmas parties are my pick. And the Benjamin Franklin bachelorette party.\n\nWho do you think had the better love story: Pam and Jim, or Angela and Dwight?\n\nAK: Are you trying to start a fight? [Laughs.] I\u2019m a huge \u201cJam\u201d fan. I wanted them to figure their stuff out and find one another and be together.\n\nJF: But there\u2019s something so satisfying about two oddballs finding their match.\n\nAK: Jim and Pam were like steak, and Angela and Dwight were the zesty sauce on the side.\n\nWhat episode was hardest not to break while filming: \u201cDinner Party\u201d or \u201cBooze Cruise\u201d?\n\nJF: \u201cDinner Party.\u201d\n\nAK: Hands down, in the history of the show.\n\nJF: When Steve Carrell pushes that tiny television screen onto his wall, when he\u2019s explaining how he mounted it, tears were streaming down my face. Speaking of text friends, I had a trailer a couple of years ago for a project \u2014 and a teeny, tiny flat-screen was mounted onto the wall. The size of a small computer monitor. I took a photo and sent it to everybody who was in that episode, the memories flooded back. Jan with the candles? And Hunter\u2019s song?\n\nAK: When Melora Hardin turns her back to us to play the song, and she\u2019s swaying around, I\u2019m honestly still surprised there was a usable take from all of the hysterical laughing we did.\n\nJF: And when Dwight\u2019s babysitter shows up. It was one too many things. I truly couldn\u2019t control myself.\n\nWhat would you tell fans who are mourning the show\u2019s impending removal from Netflix?\n\nAK: I hope it finds a nice new home at NBC streaming where fans can still watch it. I understand why fans are upset it\u2019s moving off Netflix. I get it. I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, and I hope NBC gives the show an easy transition. And if anyone at NBC is reading this interview, they should do an Office reunion movie and have that launch their streaming service.\n\nJF: That\u2019s our big idea.\n\nAh, well, naturally a reunion status was going to be my final question, so I\u2019m thrilled you two are interested in such a thing.\n\nJF: Now that we\u2019ve been rewatching it, it\u2019s making me so nostalgic for the show \u2026\n\nAK: \u2026 and the people.\n\nJF: Working with all those people. I want to be back in a room with them so badly. We want a reunion. We\u2019d like a reunion special. We\u2019d been tossing around ideas, but it\u2019s ultimately not up to us. We don\u2019t own this show. We can want it as much as the fans do, but it\u2019s in the hands of \u2026 I don\u2019t even know who it\u2019s in the hands of.\n\nAK: Newsflash: Jenna Fisher and Angela Kinsey aren\u2019t in charge. But if they were, there would be a really fun, one-time reunion special.\n\nJF: We\u2019re doing our best! We\u2019re working on it!\n\nRelated", "description": "The Office\u2019s Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey are launching a new podcast about their time on the show.
