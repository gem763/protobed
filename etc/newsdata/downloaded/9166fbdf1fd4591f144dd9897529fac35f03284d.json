Since then, more than 1,300 sellers nominated themselves for consideration to be one of Amazon's three Small Businesses of the Year.\n\n\"We would have liked them all to have been finalists, but that would have been a little bit intimidating for our customers,\" said Nick Denissen, Amazon's VP for Small Businesses, in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to sales performance and reputation metrics, Amazon reviewed the nominees against three criteria: brand narrative, product innovation, and customer centric ity.\n\n\"Each one of the finalists has their version of that combination, and that's also what our customers love about these smaller businesses,\" Denissen said. \"What inspires this company to do what they do?\"\n\nAmazon customers can now choose from a total of 18 finalists in the categories of Small Business of the Year, Women-Owned Small Business, and Small Business Owner Under 30. Voting is taking place until November 8 on the Small Business Spotlight web page, and the winners will be announced later this year.\n\nThe winning sellers will receive a package of perks, including dedicated account management, advertising and promotional support, and a trip to Amazon HQ in Seattle.\n\nThe company is also hosting a day of events in Nashville, Tennessee, and Washington, DC, to connect small businesses with customers in person and via Amazon Live. And \"Treasure Trucks\" will be out and about in 20 cities around the country, offering a special deal from one of its Storefronts partners.\n\nHere are the 18 finalists:", "description": "Amazon customers can vote for their favorites in the categories of Small Business of the Year, Women-Owned, and Owner Under 30.", "authors": ["Jennifer Ortakales", "Dominick Reuter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4c6dccc4a0a1e5e7a0ad6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
