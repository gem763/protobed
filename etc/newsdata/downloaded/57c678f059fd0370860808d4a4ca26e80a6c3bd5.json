(Getty)\n\nThe internet porn business is boomin\u2019.\n\nThe once-taboo industry\u2019s continued creep into the mainstream is seeking to broach another barrier. This time, its sights are set on big-time American sports.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAmerican Airlines announced on Thursday that it is not renewing its naming rights deal with Miami Heat home American Airlines Arena, which will expire at the end of the year.\n\nBangBros is seeking to stake its claim.\n\nPorn biz offers $10M for Heat arena\u2019s naming rights\n\nThe Miami-based porn production company was quick to announce after the American Airlines news that it wants in on the naming rights and had submitted a $10 million bid to lay claim to the home of the Heat.\n\nWe've officially Submitted our $10,000,000 bid for the naming rights to the Miami Heat Arena. We wish to thank American Airlines for their past support of the @MiamiHEAT We intend to change the name to the BangBros Center aka 'The BBC' #BangBrosCares pic.twitter.com/YbhNattIm7 \u2014 BANGBROSOFFICIAL (@BangBrosDotCom1) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cWith Pat Riley at the helm, working his magic like he has in the past, BangBros feels they need to show their support for the next wave of winning to come and give back to the city that\u2019s treated them so well,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cBoth the Heat and BangBros have become staples of the city, with huge fans of each. It doesn\u2019t get more Miami than having the arena sponsored by BangBros.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRiley is surely thrilled to be named in association with the news. As LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Jimmy Butler also must be.\n\nIs this for real?\n\nLest this be construed as strictly a publicity stunt, NBC Sports\u2019 Jessica Kleinschmidt confirmed that the submission is legitimate.\n\nI just confirmed this is indeed a real thing \u2014 a bid was submitted. They want a nickname of \u201cThe BBC.\u201d https://t.co/pyEovWTbdX \u2014 Jessica Kleinschmidt (@KleinschmidtJD) September 12, 2019\n\nNo chance this happens\n\nOf course in all actuality, it does add up to a publicity stunt.\n\nThe NBA may be the most progressive league in major American sports, but the Heat surely aren\u2019t going to promote family ticket packages to invite parents and children out to a wholesome evening at \u201cThe BBC.\u201d\n\nNor would the league subject broadcast partners to open their coverage \u201clive from the BangBros Center.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of marijuana dispensaries in Denver seeking to buy naming rights for the Broncos\u2019 Mile High Stadium.\n\nWhile the idea of the weed-embracing city having its \u201cMile High\u201d football stadium named for a marijuana company is good for a laugh, it\u2019s not good for the NFL \u2014 at least in the minds of league executives.\n\nSo bravo to BangBros for generating some headlines. Just don\u2019t expect to see this as a successful bid, as eager as the company surely is to spend that $10 million.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The home of the Miami Heat has a surprising entry in the naming rights game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/B54MYoKdhDpZ9NM33brw3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MzguNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i_wCjhW_dFVGuPF4zbD_HQ--~B/aD0zMTA0O3c9NDczNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f6756ab0-d59e-11e9-87eb-3dbd7da7e360", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
