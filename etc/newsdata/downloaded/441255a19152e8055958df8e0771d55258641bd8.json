The firm did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nGlyphosate is the world\u2019s most widely used weedkiller. Monsanto\u2019s Roundup was the first glyphosate-based weedkiller but is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are now available. Bayer does not provide sales figures for the product.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as of July 11, it faced lawsuits brought by roughly 18,400 U.S. plaintiffs who say glyphosate caused cancer.\n\nA trial over the weedkiller scheduled to begin on Oct. 15 in Missouri had been delayed, Bayer said this month.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several to be put on hold as mediator Ken Feinberg tries to negotiate a settlement between the company and U.S. plaintiffs after a California jury in August last year found that Monsanto should have warned of alleged cancer risks.
