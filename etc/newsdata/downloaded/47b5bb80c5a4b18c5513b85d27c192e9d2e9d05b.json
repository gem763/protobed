We know it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be sewing a haute couture gown by the 31, but you can easily pick up some makeup for a full face of scary (or ethereal) at the drugstore.\n\nFrom Maison Margiela\u2019s Davide Bowie-inspired look to Alexander McQueen\u2019s eerie facial accessories, there is plenty of weird and wild inspiration on the catwalk. We put together 7 of the most iconic runway beauty moments for you to recreate:\n\nAlexander McQueen Fall 1996\n\nKnown for his deliciously unsettling designs and dramatic detailing, it is hard to put together a list of runway beauty looks to emulate this holiday without mentioning Alexander McQueen. Afterall, his runway beauty choices have utilized everything from unexpected materials to unnerving prosthetics (he famously once said that he finds beauty in the grotesque). However, a particular moment in his portfolio that stands out was when model Debra Shaw walked in McQueen\u2019s Fall/Winter 1996 show in subdued makeup with an eerie face mask featuring Jesus on the cross. The facial accessory, which was equal parts strange and romantic, encapsulated the specific McQueen vibe that he became so well-known for. P.S. Not convinced McQueen was the king of Halloween? It was during this same runway show, aptly titled Dante, where he sat a human skeleton front row.\n\nJeremy Scott Fall/Winter 1998\n\nDevon Aoki\u2019s makeup from Jeremy Scott\u2019s late-90s runway show, is perfect for those low on time this Halloween, as it is purposefully incomplete. The polychromatic look, which features half of Aoki\u2019s face painted with a dark lip and one smoldering eye and the other half left totally bare, is a costume all in itself.\n\nPhoto by Karl Prouse/Catwalking/Getty Images\n\nChristian Dior Fall 2011 Couture\n\nChristian Dior\u2019s fall 2011 couture show featured no shortage of exaggerated hair accessories, unexpected patterns, and pastel bottoms. However, one of its most show-stopping looks was one that incorporated celestial beauty by makeup artist Pat McGrath and a custom headpiece by London-based milliner, Stephen Jones. McGrath created the cosmic moment by carefully arranging crystals and sequins to the model\u2019s eyelids and pairing it with a deep red lip. Both striking and timeless, the look is reminiscent of Hedy Lamarr\u2019s glitter-encrusted character in the 1941 musical film Ziegfeld Girl.\n\nPaul Cunningham/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nVivienne Westwood Spring Summer 2014\n\nFor Vivienne Westwood\u2019s spring/summer 2014 runway collection, the British designer brought couture corpses to life. Models not only captured attention by wearing the fashion brand\u2019s draped satin pieces and traditional floral sets, but also turned heads for another reason \u2014 their makeup. Each model was done up in light grey foundation layered and blended with hints of black, red, and pink to create an elevated zombie bride persona. This was the same fashion show where Westwood not only had strong makeup, but also made a strong political statement \u2014 several models were dressed in shirts and hats emblazoned with words such as \u201cClimate Revolution,\u201d which acted as a commentary on the world\u2019s ongoing climate crisis.\n\nPhoto by Francois Durand/Getty Images\n\nMaison Margiela Spring 2016 Couture\n\nPat McGrath drew inspiration from none other than the Starman himself, David Bowie, when creating the beauty looks for Maison Margiela\u2019s spring 2016 couture show during Paris Fashion Week. The makeup and hair \u2014 which centered around sequined eye designs and a dual color lip, paired with fiery-orange dyed tresses \u2014 was an homage to the British musician who had passed away just months prior. Maison Margiela\u2019s creative director, the ever-exuberant John Galliano, created the bold pieces for the collection \u2014 ones that straddled the line between reality and fantasy in true Galliano fashion.\n\nRodarte Fall Winter 2019\n\nFor its fall/winter 2019 show, Rodarte took over Huntington Library\u2019s garden court and transformed it into a floral oasis where celebrities including Rowan Blanchard, Diane Keaton, and HAIM were all in attendance. Models walked the runway in brightly painted makeup paired with layers of signature Rodarte tulle, chiffon, and lace. One of our favorite makeup looks from the season features richly pigmented fuchsia eye shadow topped with glitter and a matching pink lip. If you really feel like committing, you could even incorporate some flora and fauna into your hairstyle to capture the whole mood.\n\nPhoto by Mitchell Sams\n\nGypsy Sport Spring Summer 2020\n\nNew York City-based brand Gypsy Sport brought intergalactic glamour to the runway when they showed a number of models drenched in beautiful shades of Bioglitz, a biodegradable glitter that comes with an algae-based glue that makes application both easy and eco-friendly. This particular composition features head-to-toe turquoise sparkles worn with orange hair styled in loose finger waves. In fact, staying true to Gypsy Sport\u2019s mission which centers around sustainability, designer Rio Uribe matched the model\u2019s makeup to an outfit created entirely from recycled plastic. If you are looking for simple, yet statement-making, Halloween makeup we recommend you pick up a tub of Bioglitz and get busy.", "description": "Look to the runways of Alexander McQueen and Maison Margiela for some weird and eerie beauty inspiration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db84838aea98c00927b21a3/lede/1572361346664-runway-beauty.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.5966xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
