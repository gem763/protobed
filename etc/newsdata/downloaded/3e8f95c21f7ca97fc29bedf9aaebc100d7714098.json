Before this year, he never took part in a protest, and during Hong Kong\u2019s last major pro-democracy uprising, the 2014 Umbrella Movement, he only stopped by to take photos.\n\nNow, Fung is part of a cell of 20 protesters who face off each weekend against police on the streets of Hong Kong in clashes that have escalated from peaceful marches to flying bricks, tear gas, Molotov cocktails and, more recently, live ammunition fired into the sky. Fung, who acquired bullet-resistant body armor to wear under his black T-shirt, says the violence needs to escalate even further if protesters are to persuade Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam -- and her backers in Beijing -- to accede to their demands.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t give pressure to police, the police won\u2019t give any stress to Carrie Lam,\u201d Fung said in an interview in his home. \u201cWe, the frontliners, always lose when facing those police. We never win.\u201d He shows his armored vest. \u201cMaybe someone will die next week. I hope the one getting shot is me, since I got this. But not all the frontliners have this to protect them.\u201d\n\nFung\u2019s willingness to accept a potentially bloody escalation and his belief that the movement will ultimately succeed show that the weeks of clashes have created a hard core of determined teams of protesters whose tactics are shifting as clashes become militarized. Fung, like others interviewed for this story, declined to be quoted by their full name for fear of arrest in a city where merely participating in an unauthorized protest could mean years in prison.\n\nThe front-line protesters\u2019 hardhats, gas masks and black clothing have become the movement\u2019s uniform, lionized in street art and internet memes. But their hard-line tactics have also divided the former British colony: More moderate protesters credit them with forcing concessions from a recalcitrant government, while Chinese officials denounce them as \u201crioters,\u201d showing signs of terrorism.\n\nEven some opposition leaders warn that the radicals risk alienating support from investors and citizens inconvenienced and endangered by the chaos. More extreme tactics, including smashing train station windows, attacking police officers with batons and lighting bonfires in the streets have helped damage Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as one of Asia\u2019s safest big cities.\n\nAfter some hard-line demonstrators detained and beat two men they suspected of being undercover cops during a protest at the airport last month, some activists circulated a proposed code of conduct for front-line protesters, including no beating medical personnel or journalists, on social media forums.\n\nPolice have escalated, as well, deploying tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and, one night last month, pointing their fire arms at a larger crowd of protesters who were attacking them with sticks. Lam told reporters earlier this week that it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that no one had died, although many protesters blame the government for suicides among demonstrators and are suspicious that authorities are withholding information on other serious injuries.\n\nAlthough the protests have tapered off in recent weeks, tensions could flare again as Hong Kong confronts two politically fraught dates: The fifth anniversary of the Occupy movement Saturday and the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Tuesday. Both occasions -- one the government would like to forget and other it plans to celebrate -- will be marked by protests just the same.\n\nOne of the key principles of the movement has been to abandon their roadblocks once police move in -- summed up in the slogan \u201cBe water.\u201d But Fung argues that there need to be more protesters who will stand their ground and fight back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give a fight?\u201d he said.\n\nSuch fearlessness is not universal.\n\n\u201cYou have to know when to run and when to fight,\u201d said Vincent, a 26-year-old designer who first joined political protests in Hong Kong at the start of the Umbrella Movement, the last major pro-democracy movement in the city. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand face-to-face against the police.\u201d Asked how he responds when police move in to attack, he laughed. \u201cRun faster!\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Fung, a 24-year-old doctor, seems an unlikely candidate to stand on the front line of Hong Kong\u2019s most violent civil unrest in half a century.
