(AP) - For a team that hasn\u2019t had a winning season since 2013, the San Francisco 49ers are taking their 4-0 start this season pretty mildly.\n\nNo hoopla or big celebrations. A few handshakes, plenty of smiles and an attitude that the four consecutive wins mean nothing.\n\n\u201cAll that\u2019s guaranteed is that we can go 4-12,\u201d tight end George Kittle said. \u201cOn a short week we\u2019ve got to try and win this game and get 5-0. Wednesday comes around we will be locked and loaded for the Rams.\u201d\n\nFew people expected San Francisco to be atop the NFC West one month into the season, with both the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks looking up. But with three lopsided wins and a close victory over Pittsburgh, coach Kyle Shanahan\u2019s team is one of just two unbeaten teams left in the NFL.\n\nMonday night\u2019s blowout of Cleveland was typical of just how well the 49ers have played this year. They ran for 275 yards, forced four turnovers and made Baker Mayfield look like an undrafted rookie rather than the No. 1 overall pick from last season.\n\nIn many ways it was one of the best all-around performances by a San Francisco team in recent memory, although Shanahan was his typical self after the game and talked more about what the 49ers didn\u2019t do than what they did do.\n\n\u201cThe league is too hard to be overconfident,\u201d Shanahan said \u201cBy no means was perfect. I thought our defense played four great quarters, from the first play to the last play. I think our special teams, obviously struggled. I was real disappointed how the offense finished in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s dominant game on the ground against Cleveland enabled quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to take a back seat in the offense. Garoppolo still passed for 181 yards and two touchdowns, though the 49ers rarely attacked deep downfield and settled for four field- goal attempts, three of which failed.\n\nStill, the numbers are impressive. After four games, the 49ers lead the NFL in total rushing, are fourth in total offense and second in total defense.\n\n\u201cThe opportunities are there for us,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us. We\u2019ve got to finish drives. Got caught up a couple times down there toward the red zone in the fringe area. If we finish those drives, it\u2019s going to make it hard on teams.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nShanahan continued to lean on his three-pronged attack in the backfield, using Matt Breida, Tevin Coleman and Raheem Mostert to wear down the Browns. The three combined for 245 of the 49ers 275 rushing yards, with Breida (11 carries, 114 yards) and Coleman (16-97) doing most of the work. This, while a healthy Jeff Wilson (four touchdowns in 2019) was inactive.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe 49ers would have really pounded the Browns had it not been for some issues on special teams. Kicker Robbie Gould sent a pair of field-goal attempts wide and had a third try blocked. Shanahan indicated that part of the problem came with the snap. San Francisco signed Garrison Sanborn to replace Jon Condo, who retired after one game filling in for Colin Holba, who was recently released.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nFirst-round pick Nick Bosa has played a key role in how well San Francisco\u2019s defensive line has played, and the rookie defensive end had his best game as a pro against the Browns. Bosa had two sacks, five hurries, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. To hear others on the 49ers front line, the kid is just getting started.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nThe entire receiving group was pretty much non-existent against the Browns, a recurring theme for the 49ers. Marquise Goodwin (three catches, 41 yards) was the only receiver who caught more than two passes, and there was little downfield threat. Having a tight end such as George Kittle makes it a little easier to handle, but don\u2019t be surprised to see Shanahan and general manager John Lynch make a move to bring in someone who can upgrade the unit.\n\nINJURED\n\nFullback Kyle Juszczyk suffered a left knee sprain and will miss four to six weeks. His loss is a big blow, as Juszczyk\u2019s blocking has been critical to the success of the running game.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n400. With so much talk about the defense it\u2019s been easy to overlook how productive San Francisco\u2019s offense has been. The 49ers dominated Cleveland on the ground and piled up 446 yards against the Browns, marking the third consecutive game that they\u2019ve gone over the 400-yard mark. The 49ers last did that in 2003.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe 49ers will get the litmus test everyone has been asking for when they travel to Los Angeles to meet the Rams on a short week. \u201cIt is time to play division opponents so that is what really matters,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cWe are not done.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For a team that hasn't had a winning season since 2013, the San Francisco 49ers are taking their 4-0 start this season pretty mildly.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Wagaman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/browns_49ers_football_76016_c0-225-5388-3366_s1770x1032.jpg?7a1d0e4774c6ccff282ce97d15c8d8e85aaec86b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
