At the moment it\u2019s working for us.\u201d\n\nMount, who persisted at Chelsea despite his father\u2019s advice to leave, became the first academy graduate form the London club since John Terry to claim a regular first team spot.\n\nHe said that having so many young players brought another quality to the team.\n\n\u201cHaving all the players around and the fact we are doing it together, we probably are feeding off each other and it\u2019s giving us that fearlessness going into games,\u201d said Mount.\n\n\u201cThere is pressure playing for a massive club and you\u2019ve got stuff to prove, but I think coming through with a lot of similar faces who you have known growing up, it does help a lot.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Frank Lampard\u2019s strategy of rewarding youth and discarding Chelsea\u2019s pattern of loaning them out has paid dividends and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/d00afa_frank-lampard-placing-his-faith-in-young-english-talent-chelsea-has-not-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
