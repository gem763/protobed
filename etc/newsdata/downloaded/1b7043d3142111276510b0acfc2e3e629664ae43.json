Today I am clean and sober for 6 YEARS!!! I\u2019m the hottest mess I\u2019ve ever been, and by that I mean - I\u2019ve embraced myself - all my bullsh**, all my fears, and have become the most honest and accurate version of myself and it\u2019s absolutely DIVINE.\u201dNina also shared a throwback photo of herself at \u2018her worst\u2019 and revealed that she was going through a hard time.\u201cHere\u2019s me with no makeup and my hair looking feral as f***, but you know what - I HAVE HAIR! 6 years ago I was bald and fat and angry (scroll to the last image - I know it looks like I\u2019m smiling on the outside, but really that\u2019s cause I had just found out that there was an open bar at the after party)I face my fears, my f*** ups, and my insecurities with gratitude and an opportunity to grow, and it\u2019s really hard most of the time - but the payoff is freedom of the bondage of self - and lemme tell you that is one HUGE RELIEF [sic],\u201d she wrote.\n\nAlthough she still labels herself an alcoholic, Nina hasn\u2019t touched alcohol in years.Nina also took the opportunity to thank the people around her who helped her get by.\n\n\u201cThank you to every person around me that contributes to this marvelous life of mine I love you. And if I\u2019ve somehow pissed you off in life I\u2019m sorry, I genuinely haven\u2019t gotten round to making amends with you, probably because I forgot, and I pray that life gives me the opportunity to do so,\u201d she added.\n\nThe ever-smiling TV personality said that she\u2019s learning everyday and that she is learning to forgive herself for the mistakes she\u2019s done in the past. She encouraged everyone who\u2019s going through the same to never give up because it gets easier and better.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s so nice to have a new outlook on life and realise - heck, turns out - it\u2019s bloody beautiful.\n\n\u201cThank you for your time, and know this - if you\u2019re struggling with depression and anxiety and self-medicating with alcohol and drugs and sex and food and toxic relationships - you can get through it, you can change, you have it inside you to be brave enough to take steps to change... I BELIEVE IN YOU!
