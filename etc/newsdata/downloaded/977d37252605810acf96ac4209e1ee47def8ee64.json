But in 2019, Truebill does the manual labor for you, including alerting you to recurring charges for long-forgotten subscriptions. That feature alone was worth more than $2 million, the amount Truebill raised in seed funding in 2016, when the company was fresh out of startup accelerator Y Combinator.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 3-year old startup added another $15 million in Series B funding to its balance sheet. The round was led by Eldridge Industries with participation from Evolution VC, Cota Capital, Lucas Venture Group, and YouTube cofounder Jawed Karim.\n\n\"A lot of these startups get traction by solving specific issues, but that doesn't solve the problem of looking at your finances holistically,\" Truebill cofounder and CEO Haroon Mokhtarzada told Business Insider. \"We wanted to find out, 'what is the Calm for your finances?'\n\nRead More: Galileo, the profitable 'best-kept secret in fintech,' is raising $77 million in its first-ever venture-capital deal after 19 years of bootstrapping\n\nAs Mokhtarzada tells it, budgeting app Mint was a user-favorite that was almost, but not quite, the solution long before Truebill entered the scene. But after the app was acquired by software giant Intuit, updates stalled and users left the service in droves without a viable replacement.\n\nWith the abundance of other niche fintech services, Mokhtarzada saw the opportunity to step in with a bank-agnostic software tool that could replace Mint. Now, Truebill works with most banking and credit providers, including online-only companies like Chime, and other fintech startups like investing app Robinhood. He's betting that customers won't trust smaller providers like Robinhood to move into more comprehensive services, and will instead want a service provider that isn't trying to upsell them on a debit card or hot stock of the day.\n\n\"Everything is an arms race to that direct banking relationship,\" Mokhtarzada said. \"Everyone can go fight over that and we can work on this.\"\n\nBorn out of subscription fatigue\n\nMokhtarzada had just wrapped up his first business when he started looking for new opportunities. He always had \"the entrepreneurial bug,\" he said, and was always trying to convince those around him to take a leap of faith.\n\nIn a mixture of his own poor financial management and acute business sense, Mokhtarzada wrote a program to check for recurring charges on his credit card. Turns out he had been paying monthly for a security service on a home he no longer lived in. He told his brothers, with whom he had started and sold his previous company.\n\n\"All of us found something we didn't want to be paying for,\" Mokhtarzada said.\n\nSince then, Truebill has expanded from a recurring charge monitoring tool to a whole host of financial management tools, including credit score reporting and a rewards program just launched Wednesday.\n\n\"It can't work if you are looking at it through a periscope,\" Mokhtarzada said. \"And as more things move to subscriptions, it gets more and more unwieldy to manage and stay on top of it.\"\n\nAnother Silicon Valley exodus\n\nAs the team has expanded, Mokhtarzada said talent is getting more difficult to attract and retain at the startup's San Francisco headquarters. Although the company was started in Mountain View at Y Combinator and met a large portion of its early investors at Demo Day, the company was ready to move on, he said.\n\n\"Hiring in San Francisco became increasingly difficult, and was ultimately more difficult than we anticipated,\" Mokhtarzada said. \"A great candidate has a lot of offers and so you're competing with other companies, the cost of living is higher, and it's harder to retain people.\"\n\nEffective Wednesday, Truebill's headquarters will effectively be in its new Washington, DC office, Mokhtarzada said. Although open positions will be posted as located in either location, and the San Francisco office will remain open, Mokhtarzada said the move was necessary for the company's long-term growth.\n\n\"As a tech company in DC, we are one of the most exciting employers in the region,\" Mokhtarzada said. \"Our close rate is actually really high because we are really cool compared to what else is out there.\"", "description": "Along with funding, the fintech startup announced it was effectively relocated its headquarters from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dae52d94af90924ae27b574?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
