This book is my definitive story. It's in my words and expresses my thoughts. It describes how I feel and what's happened in my life.\n\n\"I've been working at it steadily, and I'm looking forward to continuing the process and creating a book that people will want to read.\"\n\n\"Back\" is a seemingly perfect title for the memoir given how far Woods has come in the wake of four back surgeries from 2014 through 2017. It was widely believed that he would never be able to return to the top of the sport. Tiger proved the naysayers wrong, though, with huge victories in 2018 and 2019.\n\nTiger won the Tour Championship last year, marking his first win since 2013. Then, the 43-year-old won this year's Masters Tournament, making him a five-time Masters winner and a 15-time major champion. That was Woods' first major title since the 2008 U.S. Open.\n\nWoods fell off after his Masters victory and later underwent arthroscopic knee surgery, but his return to the pinnacle of golf has been an all-time great comeback regardless.\n\nTiger will look to write another chapter in his return to prominence later this month when he takes part in the Zozo Championship in Japan.", "description": "Tiger Woods  announced Tuesday that he is writing a memoir entitled  Back , which will be the first ever released regarding the legendary golfer's life and career...", "authors": ["Mike"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/833/157/hi-res-c0935b1b2b66a63f6399f86e5e5b54a9_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
