The service member, whom Griffin described as \"hardened,\" is among the 1,000 or so U.S. troops who remain in Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey is not doing what it agreed to. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d this military source on the ground told Griffin. \u201cWe met every single security agreement. The Kurds met every single agreement [with the Turks]. There was no threat to the Turks -- none -- from this side of the border.\"\n\nTURKEY SAYS GROUND FORCES HAVE INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA; MULTIPLE CIVILIANS REPORTED DEAD\n\nPresident Trump said the U.S. would pull its troops from northeast Syria on Sunday, a move considered a blow to the U.S.-backed Kurds by many analysts and political observers. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later announced a military operation in the region that he said was to \"neutralize terror threats\" and establish a \"safe zone.\"\n\nAt least seven civilians have been killed in strikes in northeastern Syria since the assault began on Wednesday, according to activists and a war monitor. Turkey later announced that its ground forces had invaded the region to fight the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThis is insanity,\u201d the concerned U.S. service member said. \"I don\u2019t know what they call atrocities, but they are happening.\u201d\n\nGriffin called it one of the hardest phone calls she has ever taken.\n\nU.S. military officials told Fox News the president ordered the military not to get involved in the Turkish strikes, after the Kurds requested air support.\n\nKurdish forces in northeastern Syria are guarding thousands of captured Islamic State (ISIS) fighters, now without the help of the U.S. in the area.\n\nTRUMP 'WENT OFF SCRIPT' DURING CALL WITH ERDOGAN, SENIOR MILITARY SOURCE REVEALS\n\nThe Special Forces member said the Kurds have not left their positions guarding detainees. In fact, \u201cthey prevented a prison break last night without us,\" the military source on the front line said. \u201cThey are not abandoning our side [yet].\"\n\n\"The Turks are hitting outside the security mechanism,\" according to the source, who said the Kurds are \"pleading for our support.\"\n\nThe American troops are doing \u201cnothing,\" the source lamented. \"Just sitting by and watching it unfold.\u201d\n\nTroops on the ground in Syria and their commanders were \u201csurprised\u201d by Trump's withdrawal decision Sunday night.\n\nOf the president\u2019s decision, the source said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the problem. He doesn\u2019t understand the repercussions of this. Erdogan is an Islamist, not a level-headed actor.\u201d\n\nTRUMP PULLS BACK TROOPS FROM NORTHERN SYRIA AHEAD OF TURKISH ASSAULT, PENTAGON OFFICIALS 'BLINDSIDED'\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are as close to Western thinking in the Middle East as anyone,\u201d said the longtime member of Special Forces. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. We are just watching. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not helping the ISIS fight,\" the military source said.\n\nMany of the ISIS prisoners \"will be free in the coming days and weeks,\" he predicted.\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that the captured terrorists were \"really bad people who should go back to Europe.\"\n\n\"We said to various countries, we'd like you to take your people back. Nobody wants them, they're bad,\" Trump said, saying that \"maybe the Kurds [...] if not them, Turkey\" would deal with the ISIS fighters.\n\nTRUMP CALLS TURKEY ASSAULT ON SYRIA A 'BAD IDEA' AS KURDS REPORT CIVILIAN DEATHS\n\n\"The Kurds are sticking by us,\" the Special Forces source stressed to Fox News. \"No other partner I have ever dealt with would stand by us.\"\n\nAmerican troops were disappointed in the decisions being handed down by senior leaders, the source on the ground added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A U.S. Special Forces soldier serving alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin on Wednesday they were witnessing Turkish atrocities on the frontlines.", "authors": ["Jennifer Griffin"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/us-syria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
