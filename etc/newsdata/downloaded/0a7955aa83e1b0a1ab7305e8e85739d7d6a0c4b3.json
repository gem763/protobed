It was based on three experiments designed to test consumer perceptions of women CEOs.\n\nTHE GODFATHER OF TENNESSEE WHISKEY AND THE POWERHOUSE CEO BEHIND THE COMPANY\n\nFemale leaders are generally penalized less for competence failures, the authors determined, unless they occur in an industry that\u2019s viewed as \u201cfemale-dominated,\u201d such as children's products. In that case, women face harsher blowback than their male-led counterparts, just as they do in ethical failures.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because women executives are often expected to be likable, sensitive and supportive of others, the study said; essentially, consumers expect women-led companies to be more ethical, but less competent.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"Even in leadership settings, women are still expected to be more communal than their male counterparts,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s authors, University of Virginia\u2019s Nicole Votolato Montgomery and Amanda P. Cowen.\n\nMontgomery and Cowen also pointed to the 2016 presidential election as an example of the morality issue women face. Though President Trump made more false statements during the campaign, they wrote, Hillary Clinton was perceived as more untrustworthy by voters.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with more rigorous work showing that women incur greater penalties for ethical transgressions than their male counterparts,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWomen sit at the helm of just 33 Fortune 500 companies, or a mere 6.6 percent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Consumers judge women CEOs more harshly for ethical lapses than their male counterparts.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/rsz_two_businesswomen_signing_agree-37a28c931145c510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
