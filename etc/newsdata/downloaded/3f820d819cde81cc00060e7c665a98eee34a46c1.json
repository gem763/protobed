As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nDiscrepancies between NBA statements released Sunday night in English and Chinese have relayed different messaging in the wake of the growing issue between the NBA, China and the United States after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet.\n\nFollowing Morey\u2019s since-deleted Tweet showing support for Hong Kong and then Chinese businesses halting business operations with the Rockets, the NBA released a statement from the league\u2019s executive vice president of communications Mike Bass.\n\n\"We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nHowever, a statement posted in Chinese by the NBA on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like microblogging site, appeared different, according to translators.\n\n\u201cWe feel greatly disappointed at Houston Rockets\u2019 GM Daryl Morey\u2019s inappropriate speech, which is regrettable,\" the statement read. \"Without a doubt, he has deeply offended many Chinese basketball fans. Morey has clarified that his stance on this issue does not represent either Houston Rockets or the NBA. From NBA\u2019s perspective, people can be interested in different subjects and freely share their opinions. We take respecting Chinese history and culture as a serious matter. We also hope that sports and the NBA, as a unified source of positive energy, can continue to build bridges between countries and bring people together. \"\n\nMorey and Fertitta (Photo: Troy Taormina)\n\nThe first sentence in each statement offers different messages \u2013 one seemingly a soft apology for Morey\u2019s tweet and the other a strong rebuke of Morey\u2019s tweet. Morey also followed up his original tweet with two more tweets saying he did not mean to offend Rockets fans and his friends in China.\n\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY Sports, Bass said the English version is the only statement.\n\n\u201cThere should be no discrepancy on the statement issued last night,\u201d Bass said in a text message. \u201cWe have seen various interpretations of the translation of the Mandarin version, but our statement in English is the league\u2019s official statement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible something was lost in translation or that the statement was altered for a mainland Chinese audience unbeknownst to the NBA.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver is in Tokyo for two NBA preseason games this week before heading to China for two more preseason games, and he spoke to reporters on Monday, reiterating his support of Morey's right to free speech.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said, according to Kyodo News.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "A statement posted in Chinese by the NBA on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like microblogging site, appeared different than the English version.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
