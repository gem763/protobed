Fans were reminded yet again why the sport is considered our nation's past time Tuesday night as Mike Yastrzemski, San Francisco rookie and grandson Boston Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski, hit a home run in his first game in Boston's stadium of Fenway Park when his team came to town to take on the Red Sox.\n\nCan\u2019t script this shit. Carl Yastrzemski\u2019s grandson hits a home run in his first game at Fenway. pic.twitter.com/S9Zpb4s4T9 \u2014 Jared Carrabis (@Jared_Carrabis) September 18, 2019\n\n\"I had to kind of take a step back and understand what was going on and appreciate that moment and not take it for granted,\u201d Mike Yastrzemski said after the game. \"I made sure to keep my head up, look around and soak it all in. You don\u2019t really get an ovation at an opposing park for your home run.\"\n\nMike's grandfather Carl is one of the most famous baseball players in MLB history, let alone Red Sox history. Here are some the elder Yaz's career stats:\n\nCarl Yastrzemski won a triple crown and MVP for the Red Sox and was an 18-time All-Star. He reached 3,000 hits, 450 homers and was over 1,800 runs and RBI -- one of seven players to hit those marks along with Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, Alex Rodriguez, Willie Mays, Albert Pujols and Stan Musial.\n\nPrior to the game, Carl and Mike strolled around Fenway Park.\n\nHow similar are their swings?
