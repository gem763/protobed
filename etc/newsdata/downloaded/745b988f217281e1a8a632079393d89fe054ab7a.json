One of them quoted Trump as saying something along the lines of: 'I didn't even want to make the call [to Zelensky].'\n\nAnother source said that Trump, referring to Perry, had told House Republicans that 'more of this will be coming out in the next few days'.\n\nAt no point did Trump suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nDuring the CBN interview, Perry insisted that Biden never came up during his dealings with the Ukraine.\n\n'I never heard, and I talked to the president about this,' he told CBN News.\n\n'I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once, as God is my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son, ever mentioned.\n\n'Corruption was talked about in the country but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you.'\n\nSpeaking to CBN News on Friday, Perry said he likely has closer relationships with Ukrainian officials than any other cabinet secretary because he spearheaded US efforts to clean up corruption in the eastern European nation. However, he insisted Biden never came up during his many conversations with members of the Trump administration or Ukrainian officials\n\nPerry said he will cooperate fully with Congress as House Democrats conduct an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee wants to learn more about Perry's trip to the Ukraine for Zelensky's inauguration in May, as well as his other discussions with Ukrainian officials.\n\nPerry's spokeswoman told the Associated Press on Sunday that Perry had in fact encouraged Trump to speak to Zelensky - but on energy and economic issues.\n\n'Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development,' Perry's Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before Trump's call with House Republicans, Politico reported that Perry is expected to resign in November, citing three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nPerry was said to have been planning his resignation for several months.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before Trump's call with House Republicans, Politico reported that Perry is expected to resign in November, citing three sources familiar with the matter\n\nAlthough Perry has been able to steer clear of the various controversies that have embroiled and led to the exit of others in Trump's administration, he is now facing impeachment inquiry scrutiny over his recent trips to the Ukraine.\n\nThe House has subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani for documents related to Perry's 'involvement with Ukrainian leaders last spring', according to Axios.\n\nHowever, there does not appear to be any evidence that Perry was involved in the efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials into investigating the Bidens.\n\nDespite Trump's apparent claims that Perry urged him to make the call, text messages between White House aides and Zelensky's aide indicate it was actually Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who pushed for the call\n\nIn fact, recently released text messages exchanged by Trump administration officials and Zelensky's top aide, Andrey Yermak, appear to suggest that Giuliani - in his role as Trump's personal lawyer - was the one pushing for the call between the two leaders. There also does not seem to be any message of Perry having been involved in the call planning.\n\nPerry was not mentioned in the five-page memo of the Trump-Zelensky call that was released by the White House after the whistleblower complaint went public.\n\nPerry's spokesperson told Axios that the Energy Secretary 'absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development'.\n\nThe spokesperson said Perry 'continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security', which is why he is traveling to Lithuania on Sunday for a Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC) meeting.\n\nAn energy leader from the Ukraine will attend that meeting, along with nearly two dozen other officials from central and eastern Europe.", "description": "Energy Secretary Rick Perry addressed Trump's claim that he pushed for the president's July call with his Ukrainian counterpart\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview Friday.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/16/19364956-0-image-a-26_1570377455080.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
