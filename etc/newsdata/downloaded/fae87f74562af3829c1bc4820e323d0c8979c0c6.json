Am I going to continue to serve you faithfully?\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter a fit of laughter from the crowd, Folau continued: \u201cAnd God prepared this (his current legal situation) for me. So, be careful what you wish for. God can give it to you.\u201d\n\nFolau\u2019s comments have cost him a high-paying position as a professional Rugby Union player, as well as potentially blacklisted him from any sort of professional rugby position in future. But despite all of the backlash, Folau said he \u201cwould absolutely\u201d do it again, thus proving that he hasn\u2019t learned his lesson.\n\nHe then continued the speech, warning the audience to prepare themselves for a similar reaction if they choose to publicise their homophobic views online.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that you\u2019re ready because I can guarantee you that it\u2019s happened to me now, but it\u2019s certainly going to happen to many other people sitting in this room now,\u201d he said.\n\nFolau elaborated on this, telling the audience not to \u201ccompromise and conform to the way that society and culture is,\u201d likely referring to that *horrible* thing we call \u2018not being wildly offensive\u2019.\n\nPrior to his appearance, Folau and his wife and fellow athlete Maria shared a video on social media urging fans to support the event.\n\n\u201cWe are not ashamed to follow Jesus and we\u2019re not ashamed to follow truth,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nFolau\u2019s rugby contract was terminated after he was found to have violated the professional players code of conduct. However, Israel has challenged this on the grounds of religious freedom of speech.\n\nIsrael Folau\u2019s unfair dismissal lawsuit will resume in court for mediation on December 17, before likely heading to trial in early February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE Israel Folau Set To Play For Tongan Rugby League Team Against Australia After Sacking", "description": "Former rugby union player Israel Folau has declared that he would \"absolutely\" post the infamous Instagram image that cost him his job again.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1158738370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
