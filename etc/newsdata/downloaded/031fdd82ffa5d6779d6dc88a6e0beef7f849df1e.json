So it was especially satisfying on Tuesday when Britain\u2019s Supreme Court soundly and unanimously slapped down Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s brazen attempt at an end-run around Parliament to pull Britain out of the European Union.\n\nThe intervention of Britain\u2019s highest court in the tradition-encrusted world of British politics was in itself extraordinary. Created only a decade ago, albeit on the venerable foundation of the House of Lords, the Supreme Court goes about its business without the powdered wigs and flowing robes of lesser courts. In fact, Baroness Brenda Hale, the president, wore a widely noted giant spider brooch when she gave the court\u2019s judgment that Mr. Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect.\u201d\n\nLady Hale made it clear that she was aware of the moment: \u201cThe question arises in circumstances which have never arisen before and are unlikely to arise again,\u201d she declared.\n\nThat may have been a mite optimistic, given the inordinate strains that the anguished debate over Brexit has put on the traditions, practices and conventions that make up Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution. Yet until Mr. Johnson became prime minister in July, the rowdy debates and inconclusive votes at least stayed within the bounds of democratic rules. If there was deadlock, it was a reflection of a bitterly divided nation, and not a flawed political system.", "description": "Britain\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that he misled the queen to illegally suspend Parliament.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/opinion/24johnsonWeb/24johnsonWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
