After a week of teasing on Instagram and Times Square billboards, the singer-slash-actress -- who\u2019s spent the past few years appearing on Kygo tracks and in Jim Jarmusch movies -- finally released her new single \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d earlier today. If the lyrics are anything to go by, she\u2019s going deep this era.\n\nThe song, which was co-written by pop magicians Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, is a stirring ballad that sees SelGo touch on a number of things that have affected her since the release of her last album, Revival, four years ago. Co-produced by Mattman & Robin and FINNEAS, Billie Eilish\u2019s brother and collaborator, \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d is all about reclaiming your narrative after surviving a toxic relationship. Selena sings about her experiences of being gaslit by a partner, as well as the impact that had on her mental health and self-worth.\n\nFor a big pop release, it\u2019s surprisingly raw and visceral. Selena may not have the biggest voice, but it\u2019s so evocative and emotive that you can hear all the hurt she\u2019s feeling. When it comes to wobbly bottom lip sad pop, no one does it better. The video is a black-and-white affair shot on an iPhone. Directed by Sophie Muller, who also did the video for Selena\u2019s last solo single \u201cBack to You\u201d, the clip is fairly simple, putting SelGo front and centre as she cycles through a number of emotions.\n\n\u201cThis song was inspired by many things that have happened in my life since releasing my last album,\u201d Selena said. \u201cI thought it was important to share the music, as I know many can relate to the fact that the road to self-discovery generally comes through the scars in one\u2019s life. I want people to feel hope and to know you will come out the other side stronger and a better version of yourself.\u201d\n\nDespite releasing a number of huge singles over the past two years, including the brilliant \u201cBad Liar\u201d, Selena stans have been waiting for a follow-up to that aforementioned 2015 record. It\u2019s been a period of intense change and difficulty for the singer. In 2017, she checked into rehab after struggling with depression and anxiety, before entering a medical facility to help with her mental health. She also underwent a kidney transplant in that period after complications following her diagnosis with lupus.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that there hasn\u2019t been whispers of a record coming. In June this year, the singer appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she said that she had finished recording the follow up to Revival. There have also been those one off songs and collaborations, including the Cardi B-assisted \u201cTaki Taki\u201d and \u201cAnxiety\u201d, a duet with Julia Michaels. She is also the executive producer of two Netflix shows, teen drama 13 Reasons Why and new documentary Living Undocumented, which follows families affected by the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy towards undocumented migrants.\n\nWhether \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d is the lead single for a full-length album remains to be seen. Regardless, it\u2019s nice to have Selena Gomez back again.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "\u2018Lose You to Love Me\u2019 is all about finding yourself after being gaslit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db031233b2a81008d81d713/lede/1571828329832-73307154_2903676529662490_939355296713802008_n.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.562xh;0xw,0.1553xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
