We never had facilities like this.\n\n\u2018In the early days I had to travel to the US to train in a place that wasn\u2019t even as good as this.\n\n\u2018Now it\u2019s in my home town, I know there will be so many young fighters who will benefit from it \u2013 I\u2019m kind of jealous I\u2019m not one of those young fighters.\u2019\n\nThe UFC Gym in Nottingham opened this month and MMA legend Bisping will be in attendance on 9 November for the official launch. Bisping reigns as the UK\u2019s greatest ever fighter after becoming the first Brit to capture the UFC title in 2016.\n\nHardy oversees coaching for UFC Gyms (Picture: UFC)\n\nTill fell short in his championship bid against Tyron Woodley 13 months ago and is set to move up to middleweight next month.\n\nMolly McCann and Leon Edwards may be in the midst of stunning winning streaks, but Hardy\u2019s mind immediately went to rising bantamweight star Shore when asked who the UK\u2019s next champion could be.\n\n\u2018The one I\u2019m watching is Jack Shore,\u2019 Hardy replied. \u2018He\u2019s the superstar right now. We\u2019ve got to keep an eye on him. He\u2019s a very special fighter.\n\nMcCann is another hot contender in the UFC (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He just made his UFC debut in Copenhagen. He looked amazing. I think we\u2019ve got a lot of good contenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The ones closest are obviously Darren Till, Molly McCann and Leon Edwards.\n\n\u2018The ones who are up and coming are going to be even better than the ones before and I\u2019d say Jack Shore is in that group.\u2019\n\n\u2018Tom Aspinall has just signed with the UFC, which is huge news,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018He can make some real waves in the heavyweight division. We\u2019ve also got younger fighters who have just signed [with great potential], Nathaniel Wood has had a couple of fights in the UFC now.\u2019", "description": "Dan Hardy believes Jack Shore can be the UK's next UFC superstar after the Welshman's impressive debut last month.
