You won't destroy me, and you won't destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\"", "description": "In a series of Twitter posts, the president advanced widely discredited allegations that Biden interfered improperly to protect his son Hunter from suggestions of corrupt dealings in Ukraine, and that the younger Biden also made $1.5 billion in a questionable deal in China. \"Based on all of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KXn3JM13ugouw.yansKrzA--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/82ea39b251eab2679749862800ec2cb96c34755d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
