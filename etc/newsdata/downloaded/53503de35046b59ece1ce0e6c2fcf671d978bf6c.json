In 1984, Maradona, already considered the best player in the world, leaves Barcelona, one of the best clubs in the world, for lowly Napoli. As a director, Kapadia is not one to provide a lot of context. We are just there, viewing Naples\u2019s mean streets through the grimy windshield of a car, as synthesizers loop over the soundtrack. We only get a vague sense of why Maradona left Barcelona (injuries, extracurricular scandals), though it\u2019s clear he departed under a cloud of disgrace and disappointment, conveyed through footage of him lustily engaging in the kind of on-field brawl that is unique to soccer (instead of punching each other, they kick).\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the pitch,\u201d Maradona says, \u201clife goes away.\u201d\n\nThere is also the insinuation that Naples\u2014poorer and scruffier than its fancy northern neighbors, home to the Italian powerhouses Juventus, AC Milan, and Inter\u2014is a better cultural fit for a guy who grew up in the slums of Buenos Aires. (\u201cA shitty little black kid from the slums,\u201d as he is called in this documentary.) In the only extended flashback of a film that is otherwise tightly focused on the Napoli era, we see his abject origins in the shantytown of Villa Fiorito: dirt roads, shacks of corrugated iron. We see him become his family\u2019s breadwinner, pulling them out of poverty by earning an apartment at the age of 15 that is close to the stadium of his first club, Argentinos Juniors. His beaming parents hug him as he grins sheepishly, a kid still, with the weight of their small universe on his shoulders. For such shining talent to emerge from such a hopeless place as Villa Fiorito\u2014how could it not strengthen his family\u2019s already ardent religious feeling? How could it not suggest that Maradona was born to save them?\n\nHe carries a similar burden in Naples, a city that is taunted by the fans of the northern teams for being backward. \u201cYou are the shame of the whole of Italy,\u201d they chant. They unfurl banners that say, \u201cHello Cholera Sufferers,\u201d depicting Naples as a godforsaken capital of diseased outcasts. \u201cI felt as though I represented a part of Italy which counted for nothing,\u201d Maradona tells Kapadia, in voiceover that runs throughout the movie over archival footage, some of which is from Maradona\u2019s private collection. He is an underdog, a commoner, the people\u2019s champion. His portrait is hung on the walls of Neapolitan homes, right next to the portraits of Jesus.\n\nHe is also still, in many ways, that grinning teenage kid who has been handed the keys to a new apartment. At his first press conference as a Napoli player, when a reporter asks what he knows of the Camorra, which wields some undisclosed yet obviously significant influence over the club, he retains a dopey look on his face, all childish ignorance.\n\nHis childishness is like a light that never goes out. No matter how many stupid, irresponsible things he does, he still manages, like some puppy, to elicit our forgiveness. He becomes drinking buddies with the leaders of the Camorra, earning their patronage and protection, but it\u2019s only in good fun: \u201cIt all looked like something out of The Untouchables, Al Capone,\u201d he tells Kapadia. He also grows close to Napoli\u2019s ultras\u2014the hardcore, thuggish fans who battle the hardcore, thuggish fans of other clubs\u2014yet their sordidness, blending elements of fascism, racism, and mafia corruption, just slides off him like so much mud on the pitch. He womanizes; he parties too much; he dances like a low-rent version of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, all chest hair and gold necklaces. He is mired in the muck of Naples, yet somehow as pure as a saint all the same.", "description": "A new documentary cuts through the myths about the Argentinian soccer star.", "authors": ["Ryu Spaeth"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/9d7151cfc7b6de369b1b0a5fbda01c1df2ff1f53.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
