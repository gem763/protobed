HI INSTAGRAM,\" the actress wrote.\n\nAfter her profile appeared not to accept new followers for a short time because of a technical difficulty, Aniston joked: \"Sorry, I think I broke it.\"\n\nHer post has been liked by more than eight million users, while her current follower count stands at 7.3 million.\n\nThe actress reportedly gained more than 116,000 followers within 30 minutes of creating her account.\n\nIt's likely she now holds the record for having the fastest Instagram account to reach one million followers.\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have held that title since April when their joint account reached that milestone in five hours and 45 minutes.\n\nIt is believed Aniston's account surpassed that record in a far shorter period, though this has yet to be officially verified.\n\nMariah Carey, Kate Hudson and Reese Witherspoon are among a number of celebrities who have posted messages welcoming Aniston to the platform.\n\n\"YASSSS!!!
