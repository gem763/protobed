Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s response was to laugh. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never felt it\u2019s too big for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident in what we\u2019re trying to do and I\u2019m confident in my staff. The coaching and what\u2019s happening here every single day, I\u2019ve been so impressed. The improvement is there to see for us but it\u2019s about results: start winning games, start scoring goals. We need to create more chances because at the back we\u2019ve looked solid.\n\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t been adventurous enough, taking enough risks. If you watch the best teams they take more risks with the ball, they make more runs in behind and that\u2019s part of the process for the boys. When they\u2019re losing confidence maybe they want to play it a bit more safe but it\u2019s not safety that does it here \u2013 at this club you do take risks.\u201d\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs more time and respect at Manchester United | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nThe surprise has been just how flat United have looked. Solskj\u00e6r started the season promising vibrant play but the defeat at Newcastle United before the last international break again lacked spark. The team there were without Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard. Pogba remains injured and it is not certain the other two will be fit to face Liverpool.\n\n\u201cOf course, when you lose the majority of your creativity that we started [the campaign] with, you\u2019re going to struggle to create as many chances as you\u2019d like,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cAgainst Newcastle we had 75% possession but [we] can\u2019t carve that opening. The pressing up high has been very good, all the attitude and desire has been good but not enough chances have been created \u2013 and, chances haven\u2019t been taken.\n\n\u201cSometimes that\u2019s confidence; that\u2019s human nature \u2013 you see players missing chances they won\u2019t normally miss. But it\u2019s up to us to keep working and get the ball in between the posts. That goal never moves.\u201d\n\nPogba has been photographed with Zinedine Zidane in Dubai, where the midfielder has been working on his rehabilitation, but Solskj\u00e6r brushed that aside despite Real Madrid\u2019s manager wanting to sign the player last summer. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard Paul say he doesn\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cPaul wants to stay here and play well. Paul is part of our plan. When you\u2019re at Man United, you do get pictures, speculation. I don\u2019t have any problem with that at all.\u201d\n\nLiverpool are European champions and boast a maximum eight wins so far this season but Solskj\u00e6r was informed the 49 points he has from his first 27 matches gives him two more than J\u00fcrgen Klopp got from the same number with Liverpool. It is a welcome positive note as the Norwegian seeks to arrest United\u2019s nosedive towards the relegation zone that they sit only two points above. \u201cI don\u2019t hold on to stats like this,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re heading somewhere, we feel, but need results and I expect the players to come out and prove why they\u2019re at Man United.\u201d\n\nSince March 2009 Liverpool have claimed only one league win at United, the 3-0 victory against David Moyes\u2019s side in March 2014. If Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team are not favourites he does not repeat the error Moyes made when billing Liverpool as such before that loss.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe Scot was criticised for this and Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s take is cuter. \u201cThey\u2019re doing well in the league but we\u2019re looking forward to this game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect game for our players, the perfect game for our fans. We\u2019ve had a tough time, a difficult time lately, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll give them a good game.\u201d\n\nThe challenge is made tougher by their depleted ranks. David de Gea and Pogba are unavailable because of muscle and ankle problems respectively. Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah are long-term absentees, and Solskj\u00e6r is unsure whether Luke Shaw, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Martial, Diogo Dalot, Phil Jones, Mason Greenwood \u2013 who has signed a new contract to 2023 with the option to extend by a year \u2013 and Lingard will be ready.\n\nAs always, Solskj\u00e6r strove to be upbeat. \u201cThe mood here is always good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way on what you call the culture, the environment we\u2019re working in, and it\u2019s a positive one; it\u2019s working towards something. The staff and players know when it\u2019s Liverpool coming up, it\u2019s a game that\u2019s going to be watched by so many and when you sign for Manchester United this is the first one you look forward to.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said the Manchester United job is not too big for him as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s visit of leaders Liverpool", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fec3df5cad251364104042427e0c20c91c6985/47_153_2925_1755/master/2925.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2ef04697f4a2d82ba2eb1e29f800a88", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
