CBC/Radio Canada named and added the journalists to the application because their images and content were used inappropriately. In order to avoid any confusion about the role of Rosemary Barton and John Paul Tasker we intend to file an amendment to remove their names as applicants when the court opens on Tuesday,\" the statement said.\n\nCBC-Radio Canada named the journalists in the lawsuit, according to the statement, \"because their images and journalism were misused for partisan purposes negatively impacting perceptions of their independence.\"\n\nThe application says the video, titled \"Look at What We've Done,\" was published around Oct. 4 on a Conservative Party website (notasadvertised.ca), a Facebook page and a YouTube page.\n\nIt says the video includes footage from The National, Power & Politics and a CBC Politics broadcast of a town hall attended by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It includes footage of Barton and Tasker, as well as At Issue panelist Andrew Coyne and commentator Rex Murphy.\n\nCBC/Radio-Canada holds the copyright on all those clips, the application says.\n\nIt also says the clips were \"taken out of context and are edited and relied on to make partisan points for the benefit\" of the party.\n\nIn response, the Conservatives used the lawsuit as a fundraising pitch, arguing in an email to supporters that CBC \"footage should be useable by those who fund them.\"\n\nThe party is asking for donations so that it can \"hit back hard\" against \"this attack on free expression.\"\n\nThe court document says several letters were sent to the Conservative Party to take down the ad on Oct. 7 and 8. It came down on Oct. 10.\n\nThe application also says the Conservative Party has repeatedly made similar violations, both recently and in the run-up to the 2015 election.\n\nIn their statement, McGuire and Julien said they received no assurance from the Conservative Party that it wouldn't happen again so \"it is therefore critical for us to provide clarity through the court to safeguard the integrity and professional independence of our journalism and our journalists.\"", "description": "The CBC is taking the Conservative Party of Canada to court for using the broadcaster's footage in an online advertisement.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5152379.1570845499!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ont-cbc-reporter-licked-20190227.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
