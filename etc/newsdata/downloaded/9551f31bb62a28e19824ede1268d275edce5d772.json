It\u2019s up to him,\u201d Trump told reporters, apparently unaware of the visa issue. \u201cIf it was up to me, I would let them come. I\u2019ve always felt the United Nations is very important. I think it\u2019s got tremendous potential. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever lived up to the potential it has, but I would certainly not want to keep people out if they want to come.\u201d\n\nHowever, in answer to the same question while on the way to Saudi Arabia, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was dismissive.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about the granting or absence of granting of visas,\u201d Pompeo told journalists. \u201cI would say this: if you\u2019re connected to a foreign terrorist organization, it seems to me it would be a reasonable thing to think about whether they ought to be prevented to attend a meeting which is about peace.\n\n\u201cThe actions that the Iranian regime took violated the UN charter,\u201d the secretary of state added, saying he had raised the issue with the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Tuesday.\n\nThe US has imposed broad and far-reaching sanctions against Iran, including personal sanctions against Zarif, for his connection to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Rouhani has not been personally designated, but has said there can be no talks with the US until sanctions against Iran are lifted.\n\nThe Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is also unlikely to attend the general assembly, in the wake of abdominal surgery. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has cancelled his appearance after elections put his political future in doubt.", "description": "Hassan Rouhani and Mohammad Javad Zarif have yet to receive US visas for next week\u2019s United Nations general assembly summit", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c9b0dd8d2200b4a5be4c462a5d7de6a6aa4085/0_111_3318_1991/master/3318.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3d9e9348b9213dce4010a01ca5687ed", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
