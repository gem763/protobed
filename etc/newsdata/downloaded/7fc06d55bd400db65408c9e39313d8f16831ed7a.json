Since then, United have been managed by Ryan Giggs as a caretaker, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and the current boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nHere Sportsmail looks at every signing Manchester United managers have made since Ferguson left the club...\n\nDavid Moyes and a succession of managers have spent huge amounts at Manchester United\n\nDavid Moyes\n\nJuan Mata (\u00a337million)\n\nThe Spaniard joined from Premier League rivals Chelsea in January 2014 having been their Player of the Year the season before but then falling out of favour under Jose Mourinho, who had returned for a second spell in charge at Stamford Bridge.\n\nMata still regularly features in the Manchester United side and is one of the most experienced dressing-room figures.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nJuan Mata has been an important part of the Manchester United squad since arriving in 2014\n\nMarouane Fellaini (\u00a328million)\n\nThe Belgian joined Manchester United on transfer deadline day in the summer of 2013, following Moyes from Goodison Park.\n\nHe failed to make an impact under Moyes and the managers who followed and quickly became an impact substitute instead of a starter.\n\nWas responsible for some of United's biggest moments post-Fergie. More of a success than most.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nLouis van Gaal\n\nAngel di Maria (\u00a359.7 million)\n\nThe Argentine joined from Real Madrid with plenty of fanfare and the fee was the highest ever paid by a British club at the time.\n\nIt's safe to say, his time in Manchester was not the best with just four goals in all competitions. Never truly settled in England after suffering the shock of being home with his family when burglars attempted to break into his property. He has since revived his career and is an integral part of the PSG squad.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nAngel Di Maria had a torrid time at Manchester United, lasting just one Premier League season\n\nAnthony Martial (\u00a336million)\n\nThe Frenchman joined United in a deadline-day scramble for a striker and add-ons meant the fee could rise to \u00a358m if certain conditions were met. There was plenty of pressure on Martial, who hit the ground running with three goals in his first two matches.\n\nHis time at the club has had frustrating spells though; falling behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcus Rashford under Mourinho. But when fit he now he looks to be an important part of Solskjaer's plans going forward.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin (\u00a331million)\n\nAnother player from the Van Gaal era that was meant to make a significant impact, but didn't. Signed from Southampton, the central midfielder was one of the hottest prospects in the Premier League but failed to show his worth in Manchester United red.\n\nThe 29-year-old has since left the club for Everton, where is still trying to rediscover the form from his Southampton days.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin failed to make an impact at United and has since moved to Everton\n\nLuke Shaw (\u00a330million)\n\nShaw had a hard time settling in at Manchester United due to injury problems in his first couple of seasons. He looked destined for the door after he lost his place in the side to the likes of Daley Blind and Marcus Rojo but turned things around last season to win the club's Player of the Year accolade.\n\nShaw still has plenty of potential and has demonstrated great character to fight his way back into the squad.\n\nVERDICT: JURY'S OUT\n\nAnder Herrera (\u00a328million)\n\nThis was a hard-fought transfer saga for United after having numerous bids rejected by Athletic Bilbao in Moyes' reign.\n\nHerrera added energy in the midfield and was an effective defensive screen in front of the back four. In the summer, he left and joined PSG on a free transfer in a move that left many Manchester United fans frustrated.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nAnder Herrera made a positive impact in Manchester in his five-season stay at the club\n\nMemphis Depay (\u00a325million)\n\nThe Dutchman could not find his feet in England with just seven goals from 53 matches. He left to join Lyon where he has become one of the most dangerous forwards in European football.\n\nSince leaving, Depay has been honest about his short time at United: 'I have no bitterness towards Mourinho. I think I was not good enough for him.'\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nMarcos Rojo (\u00a316million)\n\nAfter reaching the 2014 World Cup final with Argentina, Rojo was on the watch lists of many clubs but it was Van Gaal who snapped up the defender.\n\nHe joined on a five-year deal and hit the ground running, being able to play at left-back or centre-back. Since, he has become a lacklustre figure in the current squad and fans are unsure whether he is good enough.\n\nVERDICT: JURY'S OUT\n\nMarcos Rojo has been an indifferent signing for United, but still has the chance to improve\n\nDaley Blind (\u00a313.8million)\n\nBlind joined the club having worked with Van Gaal previously for the Holland national team.\n\nWhile he never set the world alight, he was a solid player during his time at Old Trafford but slightly lost his way in the Mourinho era and now plays for Ajax. In today's market, \u00a313.8m seems more than reasonable for his contribution.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nMatteo Darmian (\u00a312.7million)\n\nDarmian was an exciting acquisition when he was signed from Torino on a four-year contract. He had the perfect opportunity to become a regular in the side with Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia heading into the twilight of their careers.\n\nUnfortunately, he often looked out of his depth and returned to Italy with Parma in the summer.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nMatteo Darmian failed to take his chance and returned to Italy with Parma\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger (\u00a36.5million)\n\nFor just \u00a36.5m, the German looked to be a fantastic piece of business. Sure he wasn't young, but he had unrivaled experience anchoring the Bayern Munich midfield to numerous trophies.\n\nHe showed glimpses of his ability but all too often looked off the pace at United and quickly went downhill as he was demoted to the Under 23s before getting shipped to the MLS with Chicago Fire.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nRadamel Falcao (\u00a36million, on loan)\n\nFalcao joined Manchester United from Monaco as one of the world's most famous and feared strikers - and left a flop.\n\nUnited fans believed Falcao would spearhead the attack that could win them another Premier League title, but it didn't quite work out that way. The Colombian scored just four goals before joining Chelsea on loan, where he also failed to impress.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nRadamel Falcao couldn't find his feet in the Premier League with loans at United and Chelsea\n\nSergio Romero (Free transfer)\n\nRomero signed for the club to play understudy to David de Gea, however, has had more time on the pitch than he would have expected.\n\nThe goalkeeper has remained a steady figure at Old Trafford and is still getting minutes, mainly in cup competitions.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nJose Mourinho\n\nPaul Pogba (\u00a389million)\n\nEasily the most talked about and criticised transfer in Manchester United's modern history. Pogba joined for a world-record fee of \u00a389m from Juventus having left Old Trafford for next to nothing just a few years before.\n\nLove him or hate him, he has been important to United's team in recent seasons and has put in some show-stopping performances. His problem has been consistency and with his future constantly being speculated, his days at the club may be numbered.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nPogba is linked with moves away to both Real Madrid and Juventus in the upcoming window\n\nRomelu Lukaku (\u00a375million)\n\nLukaku's time at Manchester United divides opinion. Certain aspects of his game came under great scrutiny, but he scored 28 goals in 66 Premier League appearances - an impressive return for any striker.\n\nHe was an effective player but not an aesthetic one and criticised for not performing against the big guns. His recent exit to Inter Milan was a disappointing end to his time at the club.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nFred (\u00a352million)\n\nOne of the most underwhelming transfers in recent seasons. For such a large fee, Fred was expected to walk into the starting XI and form a formidable partnership with Pogba.\n\nHowever, his time at Old Trafford has been anything but easy as he has struggled to prove his worth and is lucky to get minutes over young Scott McTominay.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nFred, 26, is not getting many minutes in a Man United shirt after a run of poor performances\n\nNemanja Matic (\u00a340million)\n\nMatic was another central-midfield signing that never settled. Previously, he had a successful time at Chelsea but when United offered \u00a340m for the 28-year-old the Londoners simply had to accept.\n\nAfter a decent start, his time at Old Trafford has petered out and he has failed to make a lasting impact.\n\nVERDICT: JURY'S OUT\n\nVictor Lindelof (\u00a335million)\n\nThe centre-back joined in testing times and has weathered the storm to keep his place in the team.\n\nThe recurring injury problems for Eric Bailly have helped the Swede become a mainstay and he seems to be growing as a player. Fans are excited about his new partnership with Harry Maguire and the future looks promising for the 25-year-old.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nLindelof is making steady improvements after joining United in the summer of 2017\n\nEric Bailly (\u00a330million)\n\nThe Ivorian joined United in 2016 and went straight into the starting line-up. However, he has been a picture of frustration since with injury problems halting his progress.\n\nHe is soon to return to full fitness and faces stiff competition with Lindelof and Maguire forming a strong bond.\n\nVERDICT: JURY'S OUT\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan (\u00a330million)\n\nThe Armenian joined from Borussia Dortmund at the peak of his career and fans were excited for him to transfer his creative and clinical edge to the Premier League.\n\nDespite his talents, Mourinho's system didn't seem to suit him and while he showed glimpses of what he could offer, he never found any form to make a strong case that he was a good signing. He was used in a swap deal for Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez and suffered the same fate in north London before moving to Roma.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nMkhitaryan struggled to make a positive difference under Mourinho and left for rivals Arsenal\n\nManchester United's five biggest signings 1) Paul Pogba - \u00a389m 2) Harry Maguire - \u00a380m 3) Romelu Lukaku - \u00a375m 4) Angel Di Maria - \u00a359.7m 5) Fred - \u00a352m\n\nDiogo Dalot (\u00a319million)\n\nIt's hard to not watch Dalot and see shades of Darmian. Both young, exciting talents who didn't seize the opportunity when it came.\n\nLast season was the Portuguese's chance to make his mark, however, he flattered to deceive and has lost his place to marque signing, Aaron Wan-Bissaka. At just 20 years old, he still has time to turn things around and learn from his peers.\n\nVERDICT: JURY'S OUT\n\nLee Grant (\u00a31.5million)\n\nLee Grant was signed as a squad player and has been exactly that. The goalkeeper has made just one start for the senior side in League Cup last season and now features for the Under 23s.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic (Free transfer)\n\nIt was short, but my word was it sweet. Ibrahimovic joined on a free, one-year deal at the age of 34. Despite some saying he was past it, the Swede scored 17 goals in his first, and only, Premier League campaignfor United.\n\nWith the Europa League, EFL Cup and a Community Shield lifted in one season, his time in Manchester can only be classed as a success. He is still scoring goals playing for LA Galaxy in the MLS.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nIbrahimovic was brilliant in his one full season at Manchester United, scoring 17 league goals\n\nAlexis Sanchez (Swap deal including Henrikh Mkhitaryan)\n\nOne of the most confusing and shocking flops in recent Premier League history. The Chile international joined from Arsenal, where he was one of the league's most prominent players, but looked a shadow of his former self from the start at United.\n\nHe looked low on confidence, unfit and indecisive in the final third. Quickly relegated to the bench and has now been loaned out to Inter Milan. Started well in Italy but faces a spell on the sidelines after an injury on international duty.\n\nVERDICT: MISS\n\nAlexis Sanchez is on loan at Inter Milan, where he made a decent start before an injury\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\n\nHarry Maguire (\u00a380million)\n\nMaguire joined United this summer from Leicester City to become the world's most expensive defender. United were in dire need of a centre-back and finally landed the England man they had been linked with for some time.\n\nHe has made a promising start under Solskjaer and looks to be future captain material.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nMaguire became the world's most expensive defender this summer when he joined United\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka (\u00a350million)\n\nWan-Bissaka was one of the brightest stars in the Premier League's bottom half and was a necessity for United - with other right-back options either ageing or under-performing.\n\nThe 21-year-old has quickly become a fan favourite, possessing bags of energy and a physical presence, despite his small frame.\n\nVERDICT: HIT\n\nDaniel James (\u00a315million)\n\nThere was little expectation on James' shoulders after arriving from the Championship with limited senior experience.\n\nHowever, he has stunned everyone with some well-taken goals and his lightning pace down the wing. James won the club's player of the month award for August and is now one of the key elements of United's attack.\n\nVERDICT: HIT", "description": "Manchester United have spent close to \u00a31 billion since Alex Ferguson left the club in 2013.
