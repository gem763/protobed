That means that Epix will now be bundled with HBO and Showtime instead of being available only a la carte.\n\nStarz also announced on Wednesday that it has warned millions of Xfinity customers that they could lose access to the premium network on December 10 \u2013 the same day Epix\u2019s deal takes effect.\n\n\u201cStarz has been working diligently to reach a fair market distribution agreement with Comcast Xfinity in order to continue providing our shared customers with access to our acclaimed line-up of premium television content,\u201d the Lions Gate-owned company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, months before our contract deadline and in spite of our best efforts to engage in meaningful discussions, Comcast has publicly stated their intention to drop our networks from all packages and bundles, ignoring industry precedent and demonstrating a total disregard for its customers, communities, suppliers and other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nComcast subscribers are facing the prospect of losing 17 Starz channels - including Starz and Starz Encore \u2013 and its on-demand and online services without being given a refund from Comcast. Starz has many hit shows including Power - which continues to rank as the top-rated premium series among African American audiences - Outlander, Vida and American Gods. The network also has a catalog of over 7,500 distinct premium television episodes and exclusive blockbuster films.\n\nLast month, in an appearance at an investor conference, Lions Gate vice chairman Michael Burns said the Comcast negotiations \u201ccould get nasty\u201d and the companies could end up \u201cgoing to war.\u201d\n\nStocks in this Article CMCSA COMCAST CORP. $45.60 -0.07 (-0.15%)\n\n\u201cThe only thing (industry observers) can come up with, is Comcast trying to buy Lions Gate, are they trying to buy Starz, that\u2019s really the only thing I can think of,\u201d said Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at TVREV. \u201cOr, they were really just that far off in negotiations because it doesn\u2019t really make any sense why they would dump them for Epix rather than just add Epix; it\u2019s no skin off of Comcast\u2019s back. It seems to impact Starz negatively because a large percentage of their viewers come from Comcast. It\u2019s sort of unclear what\u2019s going on there. I think everybody had thought that, initially, it was just a squeeze play and they would figure it out. Obviously, somebody got somebody mad at some point.\u201d\n\n\"Comcast has publicly stated their intention to drop our networks from all packages and bundles, ignoring industry precedent and demonstrating a total disregard for its customers, communities, suppliers and other stakeholders.\u201d - Starz in a statement on Comcast negotiations\n\nThe Sports Entertainment package that TCM will be a part of comes with a fee of $10 per month, and the company explained their decision on Monday \u2013 and could be a look into their thinking on Starz and Epix.\n\n\u201cWe regularly review our programming and sometimes make changes to ensure we're offering a wide variety of programming at the best value,\u201d Comcast said on an frequently-asked question page about their decision to move TCM off the basic package. \u201cWe look at a variety of factors, including customer viewership and programming costs when making these decisions. Viewership of TCM is low, as over 90 percent of our customers watch less than two movies per month. Given this, we decided to move TCM to the Sports Entertainment Package, which will help us manage programming costs that are passed on to our customers while continuing to make the channel available to those who want to watch it.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWolk said Comcast\u2019s move to put TCM on a separate tier \u201cmade no sense either, especially since Turner Classic fans are pretty loyal. That\u2019s one of those networks that has an incredibly loyal and passionate fan base, you know, something that often gets cited as the value of a small, passionate fan base rather than a larger, somewhat indifferent fan base.\u201d\n\nTCM is owned by AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia, which is preparing to debut its HBO Max streaming service next year.
