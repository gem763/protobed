He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\n\nMr. Weber, 70 years old, was an employee of the Indian Health Service from 1986 until he resigned amid an investigation of sex-abuse allegations in 2016.\n\nThe verdict, in federal court in Rapid City, S.D., came after testimony from victims, including one 36-year-old man who described how he was 8- or 9- years-old when the former doctor sexually assaulted him in a hospital exam room.\n\nThe verdict was the second sex-crimes conviction for Mr. Weber. He was convicted last year of abusing two boys at another government hospital in Montana before his 1995 arrival at Pine Ridge. He was sentenced in January to 18 years and four months in prison. He has appealed the Montana verdict.\n\nFor more than two decades, government pediatrician Stanley Patrick Weber raised suspicions that he was a pedophile. The Wall Street Journal and Frontline investigate how the Indian Health Service doctor was transferred from reservation to reservation and allowed to continue to treat children despite accusations he was sexually abusing Native American boys. Photo composite: Adele Morgan and Mike Shum/Frontline/WSJ\n\nHis case has shaken the U.S. agency that provides medical care to 2.6 million Native Americans after an investigation by The Wall Street Journal and the PBS series Frontline in February showed officials up and down the agency\u2019s chain of command ignored warning signs about Mr. Weber, tried to silence whistleblowers and moved the physician from one reservation to another amid suspicions he had abused boys.\n\nThat report triggered a reappraisal of the agency\u2019s policies for handling sex-abuse, Senate hearings and at least four additional federal investigations. A White House task force convened to examine the case and come up with a plan to address the agency\u2019s systemic failures.\n\nThe agency has said it wouldn\u2019t tolerate abuse and has made changes to prevent such an episode from repeating.\n\n\u201cStanley Patrick Weber was a walking and talking nightmare for the Pine Ridge reservation and the people who live there,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons in an interview after the verdict. He said the episode underscored \u201can obligation that is shared by us all to do what we can to ensure nothing like this ever happens again in any of our communities.\u201d\n\nMr. Weber\u2019s conduct wasn\u2019t a secret at the Pine Ridge hospital. \u201cDr. Weber, he liked, I guess, the boys,\u201d said Evelyn Weston, a nurse and former outpatient supervisor there, who testified at the trial.\n\nShe described them coming to see him at the hospital without an appointment and said Mr. Weber handed out money to his young male patients in plain view \u201con a daily basis,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother current IHS nurse testified that she observed people coming and going from his house late at night, and how, \u201cby the stature and shadows I would see it looked like boys.\u201d\n\nMr. Weber remained in his position of power at the facility, serving at times as its top medical official, agency employees said in court.\n\n\u201cWe know that it will not completely heal the wounds inflicted on Dr. Weber\u2019s victims,\u201d said Rear Adm. Michael Weahkee, the agency\u2019s current leader, in a statement on the verdict. He said the agency will pay for counseling for Mr. Weber\u2019s victims, including at private facilities outside the IHS system.\n\nIn his opening statement, federal prosecutor Eric Kelderman, said \u201cyou are going to hear, or maybe think, the system failed these boys.\u201d But he urged jurors to set aside that question for another day and focus on Mr. Weber\u2019s crimes.\n\nThe defense team, led by Denver attorney Harvey Steinberg, known for his representation of NFL stars, argued that the accusers had targeted Mr. Weber because he is an \u201codd duck,\u201d who stood out on the insular Pine Ridge reservation, one of the poorest communities in the U.S. \u201cHe was in an environment where he stood out,\u201d he told the jury.\n\nMr. Steinberg didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Steinberg called no witnesses.\n\nThe prosecution brought six men before the jury who described in often graphic detail how Mr. Weber had sexually assaulted them at the government hospital or his home on its campus, as well as at an IHS outpost in Browning, Mont.\n\nIn June 1995, Mr. Weber moved from Browning to Pine Ridge under pressure from IHS officials in Montana who had begun to suspect he was engaged in misconduct with youths, the Journal reported earlier this year.\n\nOne witness, a now 40-year-old man, told the jury of an assault by Mr. Weber just weeks after that move, in August 1995. During a sports physical at age 16, he said, Mr. Weber had snapped a blue glove onto his hand and inserted a finger into the boy\u2019s anus for no medical reason.\n\nThe men described how Mr. Weber stroked their private parts and violated them under the guise of medical treatment, and lured them to his home with Budweiser, Bacardi Raspberry, OxyContin and cash.\n\nMany of the youths described difficult childhoods that led them to be susceptible to such approaches.\n\nOne, a 32-year-old from Pine Ridge who is now incarcerated, said he became homeless at about age 11. He would sometimes stay with an aunt, but she demanded money or drugs in exchange for shelter. He said he sought cash from Mr. Weber to meet that need.\n\nThe Journal doesn\u2019t disclose the names of sexual-assault victims without their permission.\n\nMr. Weber, who has been incarcerated since the Montana trial a year ago, watched the young men describe his crimes with little display of emotion, dressed in a black jacket and white shirt. Some of the victims\u2014three of whom are also incarcerated\u2014appeared in striped prison jump suits and shackles.\n\nOne surprise in the trial came when defense lawyers pressed the 32-year-old and another victim, now 28, about a 2006 incident in which they and a third man assaulted Mr. Weber at his home.\n\nThe 28-year-old said he was motivated to assault Mr. Weber by sexual abuse he had suffered previously. \u201cHe opened the door and we gave him what he deserved,\u201d the man testified.\n\nThe 32-year-old described a conflicted relationship with Mr. Weber.\n\n\u201cThe love you feel for your dad is how I felt about Dr. Weber,\u201d said the man, who had saved letters Mr. Weber had sent him in prison as recently as 2014. Around that time, he told jurors, watching the television show \u201cLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d prompted him to reappraise the sexual relationship he had begun at about age 13 with the former doctor.\n\n\u201cWhen I realized what was happening was wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cit broke my heart.\u201d\n\nWrite to Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nStanley Patrick Weber was found guilty Friday.
