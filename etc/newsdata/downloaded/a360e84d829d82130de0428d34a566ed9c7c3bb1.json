What are the consequences of this change to the car's previously generous cargo-hauling capabilities?\n\nThe new Stingray now offers two storage spaces: one behind the engine and one ahead of the passenger compartment. That's similar to mid-engine rivals such as the Porsche 718 Cayman and 718 Boxster. We wondered, how would the Vette's carrying capacity compare to the Porsche's?\n\nPhoto credit: Michael Simari - Car and Driver More\n\nWe happened to have a 718 Cayman GTS in for testing at the same time as the 2020 Corvette, so we loaded both up with carry-on suitcases to see which one offers the most room for suitcases, grocery bags, or golf clubs. The Corvette's two cargo holds comprise 13 cubic feet of cargo space while the Cayman's serve up 15, so based on the numbers it's a close race. Buyers of these two performance cars may not have cargo capacity high on their priority list, but for those few who plan to drive their Corvette or Cayman daily, or road-trip in them, this is crucial data.\n\nUltimately, the Porsche's two extra cubic feet paid off and allowed us to fit one extra carry-on suitcase inside it, two in the front trunk and two in the rear. The Corvette's smaller front trunk accommodated just one carry-on bag, but we fit two in the rear compartment.\n\nWe test using hard-sided cardboard boxes in the exact shape of the maximum TSA-approved carry-on suitcases, but in the case of both cars, using soft-sided luggage or smaller suitcases will free up more space for extra cargo.\n\nPhoto credit: Michael Simari - Car and Driver More\n\nChevrolet boasts that the Corvette can fit two sets of golf clubs in its rear compartment, stacked one on top of the other. We easily fit our set of Titleist test clubs with room to spare, so there's likely truth to that claim. Fitting even one set of clubs in the Cayman, however, is hindered by the fact that the rear cargo area is divided by a large silver shock-tower cover.\n\nAside from the test results, our subjective evaluation puts the two cars nearly neck and neck, as both offer similar space for grocery runs and weekend getaways. Where the Corvette finds its advantage is in hauling longer items such as golf clubs. That's practical for those who like to swing a set of sticks now and again and want to get to the course post haste.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The new mid-engined Corvette holds one less carry-on suitcase, but it has space for two sets of golf clubs.", "authors": ["Drew Dorian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eF4TEwSGgPn4snCWHU.mJA--~B/aD04ODA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/72fb4a4b31fbdd4964291066715bf4c1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
