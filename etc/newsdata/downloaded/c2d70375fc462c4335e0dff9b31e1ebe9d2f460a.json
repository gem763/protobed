Yet there are still concerns from some SADC states and their airlines regarding its implementation.\n\nAt a SAATM workshop hosted by the AU in Kigali in July this year, outstanding regulations preventing implementation were discussed. An attempt was made to ensure that airline interests are taken into account and that there would be reciprocal benefits for all parties when SAATM is put into practice.\n\n'It is a scandal to go via Europe'\n\nRamasia admits that SAATM is no silver bullet, but she is still convinced of its benefits to the continent and individual countries.\n\n\"It is almost a scandal that from Africa you often have to go via Europe to come back to Africa to travel between different African countries,\" she said.\n\nShe would also like to see that the burdens of cost involved in intra-Africa aviation \u2013 for instance airport taxes and ground handling \u2013 are not placed on airlines alone.\n\n\"We have to look at these barriers. It can\u2019t be only up to airlines to handle all these costs of doing intra-Africa business. We need to champion the change we want to see. We have identified SAATM as one of the enablers, although it is not a silver bullet,\" she said.\n\n\"There is potential and we need to get in there and create those (intra-Africa aviation) markets. We need to make the African Airlines Association (AFRAA) restless, so it helps us to get where we want to be, so we can see at next year\u2019s AASA AGM that we have achieved something.\"\n\nFurthermore, by working in alliances or partnerships a lot can be achieved, in her view.\n\n\"That is why SAA is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines and we also have many code-share partners. That means we don\u2019t need our own planes to arrive at a destination. We have a network all over the world without having to be physically present,\" she said.\n\nIn the view of Aaron Munetsi, director of commercial at AFRAA, Africa is ready for SAATM - those who say the playing field is not even, are African airlines who are themselves not ready for the initiative.\n\nFin24 was a guest of AASA at its AGM.", "description": "African airlines allowed foreign ones to \u201ceat their lunch,\u201d says Zuks Ramasia, acting CEO of SAA..", "authors": ["Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8973/a2ae8947030a4014a08fd5f5128e9b23.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
