Mitchell Trubisky threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson and then completed a 2-point conversion to make the game 36-18.\n\nAfter recovering an onside kick, Trubisky then found Javon Wims for a 6-yard score and cut the Saints\u2019 lead to 11 points with less than 1 minute to play.\n\nNew Orleans would end up holding off Chicago and win the game, 36-25.\n\nEX-NFL DEFENSIVE LINEMAN ACCUSED OF SHOOTING WOMAN, TOLD POLICE HE WAS HIDING FROM RUSSIAN MAFIA\n\nApple, one of the players who mocked Cohen, ended up injuring his knee with less than a minute to play in the game.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Apple did to his knee.
