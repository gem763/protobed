This is a matter for the court to decide. It's important to note the dramatisations made in Sonni's declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Jeremy's representatives for comment.", "description": "The Avengers star, 48, and his ex wife Sonni Pacheco are in court as she tries to get sole custody of their daughter Ava", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Getty Images North America", "Gc Images", "Instagram", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12422228.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-Cocktail-Party-For-Wind-River.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
