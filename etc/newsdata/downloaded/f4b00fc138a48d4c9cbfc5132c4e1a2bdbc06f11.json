He was never in a dark place as long as he could drive. He would thrive off his cars and driving them.\n\n\u2018As soon as he got paid he spent it all on doing a car up and selling it on for more value. He was a proper Del Boy like that.\u2019\n\nShe told Hull Live that despite only being in his early twenties, Dillon had a tough life throughout his mid-teens.\n\nTheir parents died just two weeks apart, but Dillon found solace in his love for cars and remained strong for his family, she added.\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t have a bad upbringing at all, just a very emotional one. He loved time to himself and was always in his car or fixing someone else\u2019s \u2013 his car was his man cave on wheels,\u2019 Roxann said.\n\nRelatives paid tribute to the \u2018gentle giant\u2019 (Picture: Hull Daily Mail/MEN Media)\n\nShe described getting a frantic phone call from one of her brother\u2019s friends who initially thought the car had run out of petrol in the carpark.\n\n\u2018The windows were steamed up so you couldn\u2019t see if anyone was inside,\u2019 she went on.\n\n\u2018Then all I heard was screaming down the other end of the phone.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s when I knew.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said her brother fell asleep, adding that the exhaust fumes seeping into the vehicle from a hole in the pipe caused her brother\u2019s death.\n\n\u2018He went through so much in his short life, he had so much more to live for, so much to look forward to,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018He was just chilling out in his car, reclined in his seat. He used to visit the car park to use the wifi and watch movies on his phone.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m still absolutely devastated. So many people have said nasty things about my brother at the time, but he didn\u2019t have a bad bone in his body and would do anything for anyone. He really would.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
