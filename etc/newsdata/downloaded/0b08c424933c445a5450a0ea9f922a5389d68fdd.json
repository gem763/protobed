Rather they see a risk of further deterioration ahead.\u201d\n\nThe findings put further pressure on the government to stimulate the economy through more tax cuts and infrastructure spending, as well as pursue tax reforms and deregulation to enhance productivity growth.\n\nSome 74 per cent of directors said infrastructure spending was too low, with more investment needed in water supply, renewable energy sources and regional infrastructure.\n\nAbout one-third of respondents said tax reform should be a priority to lift growth.\n\nAICD chief executive Angus Armour said that with Australian economic growth having slowed to its weakest point since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, directors are calling for a new approach.\n\n\u201cWith conventional monetary policy now reaching its limits we need to look at other options,\" he said.\n\n\u201cDirectors have identified increased infrastructure spending and further personal income tax cuts, perhaps by bringing forward already-planned tax measures, as options the government should prioritise.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTax cuts acceleration?\n\nAngus Armour, chief of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, is worried about the economic outlook. AFR\n\nThe call is in line with a campaign by shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers for the government to accelerate stage 2 of its legislated income tax cuts due to commence in July 2022 and to bring forward infrastructure projects.\n\nStage 2 of the tax cuts are for those for earning $37,000 to $120,000.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has pledged to stick to the government's budget surplus plans this financial year, leaving minimal room to build on its existing tax cuts and $100 billion in infrastructure spending over a decade.\n\nNew Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy on Wednesday dismissed the need for fiscal stimulus to pump prime the economy, saying monetary policy was best placed to deal with the swings in the economic cycle and that discretionary government spending boosts should be limited to times of \"crisis\".\n\nRegulation overwhelming\n\nThe AICD's Mr Armour said directors were \"overwhelmed\" by the accumulation of regulation and the compliance burden from government red tape.\n\n\u201cToo much emphasis on compliance obligations is driving a risk-aversion in boardrooms and stifling the ability of boards to drive strategy and innovation,\u201d Mr Armour said.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia business activity index softened in October, falling to 50.7, down from 52.0 in September, with both the rate of growth in services and manufacturing activity softening this month.\n\n\u201cAustralian manufacturing and service firms are not immune to global trends and the ongoing weakness in the flash PMI readings for October should be judged against this backdrop,\u201d said CBA chief economist Michael Blythe.", "description": "More than half of company directors expect the local economy to deteriorate next year, prompting board members to call for the Morrison government to bring forward tax cuts and infrastructure spending to boost economic activity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ee531686f8babd92d410ea04a4d729e0fa320a8b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
