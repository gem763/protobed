The 39-year-old pilot had abandoned the ultralight, but agents eventually found him hiding in a nearby wash.\n\nHe\u2019s being held for violating immigration law, authorities said.\n\nUltralights are small, compact aircraft that usually flow low and slow.\n\nLocal sheriff\u2019s departments in Arizona have long warned of ultralights, drones and other technology used by smugglers to get drugs across the border in their state, where the terrain is particularly vulnerable to those devices.\n\nThe government has struggled to come up with a way to combat small aircraft.\n\nIn 2017, agents in California managed to spot a drone crossing the border and tracked it to its landing point. They arrested a 25-year-old man who they said was on hand to pick up the 13-pound load of meth flown over on the drone.\n\nOne former Arizona sheriff suggested shooting down unauthorized aircraft, but federal officials say that\u2019s probably an impossible policy to impose.\n\nFiguring out the origins of an aircraft isn\u2019t easy, and firing into the sky is fraught with risk.\n\n\u201cThose are real challenges,\u201d one member of Congress told The Washington Times in 2017.\n\nCBP said it nabbed another ultralight on May 25, when it found one carrying nearly 150 pounds of synthetic narcotics. Nobody was arrested in that incident.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
