Last time, they underestimated the number of votes for Likud and also for some of the religious parties allied to Mr Netanyahu.\n\n\"There is no point starting to work out a coalition based on these numbers as they will change,\" Eli Hazan said.\n\nBut Blue and White was \"cautiously optimistic\" that Israel would get new leadership, spokeswoman Melody Sucharewicz told the Times of Israel.\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nThe BBC's Tom Bateman says that if the polls are correct Mr Netanyahu has no simple route to government. In fact, the figures put him in an even weaker position than after April's election, when coalition talks collapsed, he adds.\n\nMr Gantz could emerge as leader of the largest party, but he could have an even more complex job to form a government.\n\nMr Lieberman, an ally-turned-rival of the prime minister, could be crucial in deciding who takes office.\n\nHe prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after the last vote because he refused to back down over a longstanding dispute with religious parties over a bill governing exemptions from military service for ultra-Orthodox young men.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Avigdor Lieberman wants a \"broad, liberal, national government\"\n\nAt a rally in Jerusalem on Tuesday night, Mr Lieberman reiterated a call he made during the campaign for unity government.\n\n\"We only have one option,\" he told supporters. \"A broad, liberal, national government made up of Yisrael Beiteinu, Likud and Blue and White.\"\n\nOur correspondent says such a coalition only seems feasible if Mr Netanyahu were toppled as leader of Likud, as opposition groups have vowed not to sit with him at the helm.\n\nOther possibilities could well play out first, including a third election, complicated by Mr Netanyahu's looming hearing on corruption allegations, he adds. The prime minister denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIf the official results prove to be inconclusive, it will fall to President Reuven Rivlin to decide who gets the mandate to try to form a government. That person will have 28 days to do so, with a possible extension of not more than 14 days.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Rivlin said he would hold consultations with party representatives \"after he receives a clear picture of the results, and as soon as possible\".", "description": "Exit polls suggest there will be no clear winner in the country's second election in five months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11020/production/_108846696_mediaitem108846692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
