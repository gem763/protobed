The wounds are opened and salted regularly.\n\nIn the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, the evil lord Sauron sweeps the world with a beam from his flaming eye, looking for the ring of power and its carrier, Frodo. Back and forth it goes, relentlessly searching for its prey.\n\nLikewise, the Left\u2019s Beam o\u2019 Racism sweeps over the nation, searching for a camera-ready example. Those caught in its ray are quickly made into examples.\n\nCarson King, an Iowa sports fan, jokingly held up a sign for beer money in September. It went viral and he wound up donating more than $1 million to a children\u2019s hospital. But a Des Moines Register reporter dug up racist tweets from Mr. King when he was 16. Although Mr. King said he was appalled by his tweets from 2012 and apologized, the controversy killed the golden goose for the sick kids. The reporter himself then admitted deleting his own racist tweets and was fired.\n\nEven the Washington Post\u2019s Food section this past week deployed the Beam o\u2019 Racism. The front-page story was headlined: \u201cAre \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisles racist?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. The ethnic food aisles of Safeway, Kroger, Harris-Teeter and Giant are dark reminders of America\u2019s unique evil.\n\nWashington Post restaurant critic Tim Carman wrote the piece, inspired by a podcast from David Chang, \u201cthe chef and restaurateur at the helm of the Momofuku empire.\u201d Momofuku operates 14 restaurants in North America.\n\nMr. Chang calls ethnic food aisles \u201cthe last bastion of racism that you can see in full daylight in retail America.\u201d Lamenting the plight of \u201cchildren of immigrants,\u201d Mr. Carman says that visiting their local supermarket is a ticket to trauma.\n\n\u201cThe sting occurs whenever they walk down the \u2018ethnic\u2019 food aisle, the section of the supermarket that, to some, plays out like a remnant of the Jim Crow era, when laws established separate facilities for African Americans in the post-Reconstruction South,\u201d Mr. Carman writes.\n\nJim Crow was the work of Democrats, by the way. They resisted passage of Republican-sponsored civil rights legislation even during the Eisenhower era and still promote abortion clinics in black communities. The party of the KKK was finally beaten in 1964 when a larger percentage of Republicans than Democrats voted for the Civil Rights Act and in 1965 for the Voting Rights Act.\n\nFor a detailed account, see \u201cThe Truth About Jim Crow\u201d published by the American Civil Rights Union.\n\nMr. Carman goes on, targeting the \u201cAsian\u201d and \u201cLatino\u201d food aisles, which constitute \u201cde facto segregation, another kind of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 policy that marginalized African Americans for generations.\u201d\n\nMaybe he and Mr. Chang are right. Maybe placing cans of refried beans next to taco shells really is racist, regardless of how handy it is for shoppers who like Mexican food. Maybe the nativist supermarket clerks smirk with delight as they malevolently place chop suey next to soy sauce.\n\nMr. Carman further quotes Mr. Chang, who opines that ethnic food aisles are a reminder of \u201c1950s America, which was not a particularly good place to be, especially if you were Asian.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019re getting to it. The Left has been recasting the story of America as 400 years of oppression, nothing else.\n\nThe Left especially hates the 1950s. That\u2019s when America was strong after winning World War II and when TV's \u201cFather Knows Best,\u201d \u201cOzzie and Harriet\u201d and \u201cLeave It to Beaver,\u201d projected prosperity, vibrant families and healthy normalcy. It did take a few more years before Jim Crow was defeated and black and Hispanic families had their own shows, and later, Asians.\n\nBut the biggest rub was not so much all-white casts but rather the shows\u2019 emphasis on intact families and clear distinctions between right and wrong.\n\nFor the past couple of decades, between superhero blockbusters, Hollywood has been churning out movies that focus on evil, featuring a villain at the center. Current examples include \u201cThe Joker\u201d and \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil.\u201d Even the 2008 Christopher Nolan epic \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d was more about Health Ledger\u2019s uber-evil Joker than Christian Bale\u2019s Batman.\n\nShakespeare had memorable villains, and Blaise Pascal wrote that the best way to understand evil is to stare it in the face. But a steady diet of this cannot be good for the soul.\n\nIn any case, Hollywood seems to have a blind spot when it comes to evil. They\u2019ve made many films about the Nazis, but Tinseltown has virtually ignored the greatest mass murder cult in history \u2013 communism.\n\nGetting back to Mr. Chang\u2019s complaint about the plight of Asians in 1950s America, we might want to remember that Chairman Mao\u2019s Communist China at that time was slaughtering its people by the tens of millions.\n\nBut at least they were spared the horrors of America\u2019s ethnic food aisles.", "description": "Let\u2019s take a break from the media\u2019s Trump Derangement Syndrome .10/08/2019 1:13:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Robert Knight", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/248/7485ff78-6e9e-487c-824c-3861499c9349.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
