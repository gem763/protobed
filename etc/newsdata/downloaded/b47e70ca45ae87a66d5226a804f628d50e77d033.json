It now appears that many users have made good on that threat: Tumblr\u2019s traffic has dropped nearly 30 percent since December.\n\nTumblr\u2019s global traffic in December clocked in at 521 million, but it had dropped to 370 million by February, web analytics firm SimilarWeb tells The Verge. Statista reports a similar trend in the number of unique visitors. By January 2019, only over 437 million visited Tumblr, compared to a high of 642 million visitors in July 2018.\n\nThe ban removed explicit posts from public view, including any media that portrayed sex acts, exposed genitals, and \u201cfemale-presenting\u201d nipples. Some users say enforcement of the ban has been spotty \u2014 one user wrote into The Verge to say that they\u2019re still seeing porn on the platform \u2014 but even so, users have apparently left Tumblr in droves. We know that the platform was mainly known for its NSFW content, which was often not just porn that could be found on any number of alternative sites. It also included unique communities that discussed sexuality in healthy ways.\n\nOn December 3rd, when Tumblr first told The Verge that it would ban porn by the 17th, CEO Jeff D\u2019Onofrio said in a statement at the time that users had other options. \u201cThere are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content,\u201d he said. It looks like users have taken D\u2019Onofrio up on his offer and gone to other sites.", "description": "Tumblr announced its porn ban in December, and users have reacted by explaining that they mainly used the site for browsing not-safe-for-work content.
