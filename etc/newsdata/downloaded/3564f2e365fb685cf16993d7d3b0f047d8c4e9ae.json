FOREX-Oil-exporter currencies, safe havens rally after Saudi attacks\n\n* Norway's crown, Canadian dollar gain\n\n* Oil importers Turkey, India see currencies weaken\n\n* China's industrial output slows, yuan falls\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tommy Wilkes\n\nLONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Currencies linked to the price\n\nof oil rose on Monday after an attack on Saudi Arabian refining\n\nfacilities disrupted global oil supplies, while the Japanese yen\n\nand Swiss franc strengthened as nervous investors sought safety.\n\nOil prices surged nearly a fifth at one point following the\n\nstrikes on two plants, which knocked out more than 5% of global\n\noil production Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group\n\nclaimed responsibility, but the United States blamed Iran.\n\nThe Norwegian crown surged as much as 0.7%, then settled at\n\n8.964 crowns NOK=D3 against the dollar, up 0.3% on the day. It\n\nwas also 0.3% ahead versus the euro EURNOK=D3 .\n\nThe Canadian dollar rose 0.2% to C$1.3259 CAD=D3 . The\n\nRussian rouble was also higher.\n\nThe currencies of oil importers such as Turkey and\n\nIndia underperformed.\n\nOverall, the forex market reaction was limited. A bigger\n\nconcern was that a supply-side shock and growing geopolitical\n\ntensions would damage an already fragile global economy, MUFG\n\nanalyst Lee Hardman said.\n\n\"Downside risks for the global economy would intensify if\n\ngeopolitical risks in the region continued to escalate, creating\n\na more unfavourable environment for high beta emerging market\n\nand high yielding currencies,\" he said.\n\nThe Japanese yen, a common choice for investors seeking\n\nshelter from market uncertainty, rose 0.2% to 107.85 yen per\n\ndollar JPY=EBS . The Swiss franc rallied versus the euro but\n\nwas only up 0.1% at 1.0959 EURCHF=EBS by 0730 GMT, suggesting\n\nsome calm had returned to markets.\n\nThe U.S. dollar slipped 0.1% against a basket of currencies\n\n. It was little changed versus the euro at $1.1079\n\nEUR=EBS .\n\nCHINA WEAKNESS\n\nIn China, data released on Monday showed industrial output\n\ngrew in August at its slowest pace in more than 17 years and\n\nretail sales rose less than expected That added to\n\npressure for stimulus, and in offshore trade the Chinese yuan\n\nCNH=EBS weakened 0.3% to 7.0653 per dollar.\n\nThe market focus on Monday was the Middle East, but\n\nattention will also remain on central bank meetings in the\n\nUnited States and Japan. Expectations the Federal Reserve would\n\ncut interest rates on Wednesday had lessened; now investors are\n\nsure they'll fall and are divided only over how much. FEDWATCH\n\nA third of economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank of\n\nJapan to announce ramped-up stimulus on Thursday. But sources\n\nsay it may be a close call -- policymakers will wait to assess\n\nmarket reaction to the Fed's decision hours earlier.\n\nJapanese markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.\n\nSterling, which has soared over the past week on growing\n\ninvestor confidence that a no-deal Brexit is off the table, fell\n\n0.3% to $1.2466 GBP=D3 . It was down 0.5% against the euro at\n\n88.970 EURGBP=D3 .\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Oil-exporter currencies, safe havens rally after Saudi attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6T15I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
