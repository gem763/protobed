Yet even after the Miami Herald, multiple lawsuits and law enforcement authorities detailed how he sexually abused dozens of teenage girls and sometimes raped them, the late Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s spell apparently remains strong.\n\n\u201cLook, take this about Jeffrey. He is the poster boy for rehabilitation,\u201d said the 83-year-old Epstein (no relation to the convicted sex offender who authorities said hanged himself in his jail cell at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center a month after his July arrest on new federal charges of sex trafficking with minors). \u201cHe went to prison [after pleading guilty to reduced charges in 2008]. He served his term [13 months, nine of them on work-release that allowed him daytime visits to his Palm Beach, Florida, office]. He got out. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office said he stuck completely to the terms of his parole. He registered as a sex offender\u2014which is no fun, but which was something he was supposed to do. And he made $500 million.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Edward Epstein added: \u201cI did hang around with Jeffrey because I was fascinated with him. For one thing, the women around him were some of the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. These were not underage women. They were women like [former model and Miss Sweden] Eva Andersson and [actress] Morgan Fairchild. None of them were really girlfriends of his, but they hung around him\u2026\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand Jeffrey,\u201d Edward continued. \u201cI can\u2019t conceive of why he would go out with an underage woman, unless your theory\u2019s right that he\u2019s a pedophile\u2026It wasn\u2019t like he was some sort of ugly gnome that couldn\u2019t get a girl\u2026When I knew him, I never saw so many good-looking women who stayed in his little orbit.\u201d\n\nEdward Epstein also cast doubt on the notion\u2014advanced by the November 2018 Miami Herald investigation of Jeffrey\u2019s extraordinarily lenient 2008 sentence for soliciting prostitution and sex trafficking with a minor, an article that ultimately prompted the resignation of Donald Trump\u2019s labor secretary, former U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, and new federal charges from the Southern District of New York\u2014that Jeffrey destroyed dozens of young lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure he destroyed their lives,\u201d Edward said. \u201cHe paid them money, and they went on for six or seven years giving him massages. I don\u2019t know if that destroyed their lives. Getting a massage or getting a girl to masturbate you doesn\u2019t necessarily destroy your life.\u201d\n\n(One of Jeffrey\u2019s victims, Jennifer Araoz\u2014who is now suing his estate and says the financier raped her at age 14\u2014told a courtroom after Epstein\u2019s suicide, \u201cThe fact that he felt entitled to take away my innocence\u2026hurts me so much.\u201d)\n\nEdward added: \u201cEverything about Jeffrey was a con. I never thought, \u2018here\u2019s an honest guy.\u2019 I just thought here\u2019s a New York character\u2026I think it\u2019s a terrible thing, and a stupid thing, and a perverse thing, to have any sex with underage girls\u2026I don\u2019t believe many of the stories about Glenn Dubin, Prince Andrew\u2014I don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re stupid enough, if they knew the girl was underage, why would anyone? You could be compromised, you could be blackmailed, especially by Jeffrey. Bill Clinton? They\u2019d have to be out of their minds.\u201d\n\nEdward stressed: \u201cI never even discussed these things with Jeffrey\u201d\u2014whom he described as an unreliable witness and \u201ca liar,\u201d once claiming to Edward that he was, among other things, a private detective, and, another time, that he flew every month to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin. \u201cMaybe he was a calculated liar, but I had a feeling it was pathological.\u201d\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know if that destroyed their lives. Getting a massage or getting a girl to masturbate you doesn\u2019t necessarily destroy your life. \u201d \u2014 Edward Jay Epstein\n\n\u201cIf you say he\u2019s a pedophile and he\u2019s going out with children, that\u2019s not anything I know,\u201d Edward said, noting that he never rode on Jeffrey\u2019s jet, visited any of his homes beyond the East 71st Street townhouse, or was offered a massage. \u201cNineteen is \u2018teenage\u2019 too.\u201d\n\nPressed in the interview to account for credible allegations in official government documents as well as the media, Edward conceded that young women working for Jeffrey \u201crecruited underage girls\u2026mainly from massage parlors, by the way\u2014that\u2019s what his lawyers say, but that doesn\u2019t make it any more legal,\u201d Edward said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what happened, ok? I think he asked for younger and younger women. That\u2019s just my guess.\u201d\n\nYet Edward suggested that Jeffrey\u2019s July 2019 arrest and the new charges\u2014a decade after he served his original time\u2014were an act of bad faith on the federal government\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cIf he bribed [Acosta or other officials] to get the deal, then obviously that\u2019s a whole other criminal business,\u201d Edward said. \u201cBut if they gave him the deal, if he negotiated and got it, then that was the price that society agreed on, and that was the price that he paid.\u201d\n\nDespite news reports about a U.S. Marshals investigation of Jeffrey\u2019s 2018 plane trips with apparently underage girls as young as 11 or 12, Edward said he\u2019s unaware that his onetime friend was acting suspiciously and possibly violating the terms of his sentencing agreement.\n\nEdward Jay Epstein, who has contributed articles to The Daily Beast, spoke by phone as Graydon Carter\u2019s new online magazine, Airmail, published My Tea with Jeffrey Epstein, a lengthy and oddly non-judgmental chronicle of Edward\u2019s 32-year, on-again, off-again friendship with the mysterious, Gatsby-like financial adviser.\n\n\u201c Look, take this about Jeffrey. He is the poster boy for rehabilitation. \u201d \u2014 Edward Jay Epstein\n\nAfter Jeffrey\u2019s arrest in July, Edward refused a request from The Daily Beast to discuss his unusual pal.\n\nHe did so, he explained, \u201cbecause Jeffrey was alive, and I didn\u2019t want to add to the misery of someone who was in prison.\u201d\n\nKnown for his book-length investigations of the JFK assassination, the financial shenanigans of Hollywood, and the secret wars between the American and Russian spy agencies, Edward Epstein said he befriended the self-avowed financial whiz in the late 1980s, accepted personal favors from him\u2014including first-class plane tickets and free lodging\u2014but then didn\u2019t speak with him for 24 years. (At least one other journalist has admitted taking favors from Jeffrey Epstein\u2014former New York Times business reporter Landon Thomas Jr., who wrote a puff piece about him while he was facing criminal charges and successfully solicited a $30,000 charitable donation from Epstein for a Harlem school.)\n\nThe breach with Edward occurred after Jeffrey cut him off over Edward\u2019s thinly-veiled 1989 Manhattan, inc. \u201cWall Street Babylon\u201d column (in which Jeffrey wasn\u2019t named but was described in detail) that exposed some of his dubious business practices and brought unwelcome attention from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn the Airmail article, Edward wrote about a \u201cfrantic call from an executive at Simon & Schuster\u201d who had met Jeffrey at Edward\u2019s December 6, 1988 birthday dinner.\n\n\u201cHe told me that he had given Epstein $70,000 to invest in a deal to take over the chemical company Pennwalt. After sending the money, he had not received the necessary papers, and Epstein was no longer returning his calls. He phoned one of the principals in the deal, who said he had never heard of the executive,\u201d Edward wrote.\n\nEdward recounted how he used a computer program Jeffrey had provided him to browse through Jeffrey\u2019s financial transactions, where he found dozens of demands for the return of investment money and evidence of a twice-bounced check.\n\n\u201cAs I read through this material, I found nothing about the publishing executive\u2019s money, but I grew increasingly queasy about Epstein,\u201d Edward wrote, adding that he never discovered anything about the Simon & Schuster exec\u2019s money.\n\nOn the phone, Edward repeatedly refused to identify the publishing mogul, who he recalled had offered Jeffrey and his date at the birthday dinner a ride to Palm Beach on his corporate jet.\n\n\u201cI feel guilty about the whole thing because I introduced them,\u201d Edward confided. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna tell you who it is\u2014and the only reason is that I don\u2019t want him screaming and shouting at me\u2026He\u2019ll go ballistic. You can guess who it is\u2026To tell you the truth, he was a friend of mine and at a certain point he told me he did get his money back.\u201d\n\nAttempts to reach Simon & Schuster\u2019s larger-than-life former chief executive, Richard E. Snyder, were unsuccessful, so The Daily Beast cannot confirm whether he is the publisher in question.\n\nDescribing their falling-out in the Airmail article, meanwhile, Edward wrote that he didn\u2019t identify Jeffrey in his Manhattan, inc. column \u201cbecause he refused to speak to the fact-checker.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou caused me a lot of trouble,\u201d Edward\u2014in his Daily Beast interview\u2014recalled Jeffrey fuming in a furious phone call over the column, which suggested he had improperly used inside information in one of his deals.\n\n\u201cI never disliked Jeffrey, by the way,\u201d Edward said. \u201cHe disliked me, but I never disliked him.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship\u2014which had included invitations to parties at Edward\u2019s Upper East Side apartment and piano-concert soirees at the home of music and art philanthropist Stuart Pivar\u2014suddenly resumed in 2013, Edward Epstein said, after he published a New York Review of Books essay about his old college professor and mentor Vladimir Nabokov, and Jeffrey invited him to his East 71st Street mansion to discuss the author of Lolita, Jeffrey\u2019s favorite novel.\n\n\u201c I never disliked Jeffrey, by the way. He disliked me, but I never disliked him. \u201d \u2014 Edward Jay Epstein\n\nJeffrey boasted that he kept copies of Nabokov\u2019s masterpiece in various bedrooms of his residences and aboard his private jet, nicknamed by the press the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship continued well into 2019, with personal visits, tea at the mansion, walks in Central Park and email exchanges, Edward said.\n\n\u201cThe last time I communicated with him was actually over emails, when Robert Kraft was arrested,\u201d he recounted, citing Jeffrey\u2019s curiosity about the New England Patriot owner\u2019s February arrest for receiving handjobs in a Florida massage parlor. \u201cHis position was pretty interesting: If Robert Kraft and all the people going to that parlor were committing a crime, can the police just sit there and watch lots of people committing crimes and not interfere? That was the question I asked him.\n\n\u201cAnd he answered that \u2018the police were going through my garbage and everything, and if they had found that the girls were underage\u2019\u2014and he never himself admitted that they were underage\u2014\u2018they should have stopped it.\u2019 In other words, Jeffrey\u2019s point was that the girls were acting illicitly if they were underage.\u201d\n\nThe Airmail article\u2014actually Chapter 46 of Edward\u2019s unpublished memoir, he said\u2014also reports ethically problematic details about its author: that Edward accepted free lodging in the Santa Monica, California, apartment that Jeffrey rented for then-girlfriend Eva Andersson, and also accepted free first-class airline upgrades\u2014which turned out to be illegal\u2014from Jeffrey, who was later the subject of one of his columns for the now-defunct business magazine Manhattan, inc.\n\nIn Airmail, Edward recounted an early meeting with Jeffrey in 1987: \u201cAs we finished the tea, I mentioned I was leaving for Spain on Monday. \u2018How do you go?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Iberia Airlines,\u2019 I said, adding that I always flew coach. \u2018If you like, I can upgrade you to first class. Much better food.\u2019 \u2018How?\u2019 \u2018Drop your ticket off with my doorman tomorrow morning. It won\u2019t cost you a penny.\u2019\n\nEdward told The Daily Beast that he took advantage of Jeffrey\u2019s plane-ticket largesse a few more times after that, until an official at a Japanese airline rejected his first-class ticket because it was bogus, and sent him back to the economy cabin.\n\nEdward said he understood that Jeffrey somehow had gained access to various airlines\u2019 computer systems and was able to claim first-class seats.\n\nAfter the Japanese airline embarrassment, \u201cI certainly did confront him,\u201d Edward said, describing the fake first-class tickets as \u201ctheft of services.\u201d \u201cHe said \u2018don\u2019t ask me anything. It works one-third of the time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAsked if it gave him pause as a journalist to be accepting favors and freebies from a potential subject of his journalism\u2014and one who Edward acknowledged clearly wanted to be written about\u2014he breezily replied: \u201cI wasn\u2019t writing about Jeffrey, but it gave me great pause,\u201d but only because the first-class plane tickets turned out to be fake.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to write anything about him [back in the late \u201880s]. He was no one,\u201d Edward said by way of justifying his acceptance of Jeffrey\u2019s gifts. \u201cYeah, Jeffrey wanted a column, but I had no intention of writing it\u2026And if I wrote it, I\u2019ve never written a favorable column about anyone\u2026I take that back. I have written one or two favorable columns. But normally, you know, people hated me\u2026I would never have accepted a favor if I planned to write a column about him. But an interview\u2019s a favor. When [former International Monetary Fund director and alleged rapist] Dominique Strauss-Kahn gave me an interview, it\u2019s a favor to a journalist to get an interview, because otherwise you can\u2019t sell the story.\u201d\n\nOf course, as Edward Epstein acknowledges, he did end up writing about Jeffrey in the column that interrupted their relationship.\n\nBut he said he has no regrets. \u201cIf you asked me this a few years ago, I would have said I regret writing that piece that got him angry at me. But now I\u2019m sort of happy I wrote that piece and he stopped speaking to me because at least I have no connections to his perverse acts\u2026Whatever he did, it was pretty bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hung around\u2014and gone on vacation with\u2014lots of dubious characters,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh. \u201cRemember there was a character on the radio called Boston Blackie? His logo was \u2018friend of those who have no friends.\u2019\u2026I don\u2019t make personal judgments. That\u2019s not my business.\u201d", "description": "In an exclusive interview, Edward Jay Epstein expands on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and claims the pedophile financier was the \u201cposter boy for rehabilitation.\u201d", "authors": ["Lloyd Grove", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568478376/190913-grove-epstein-tease_hnyeqd", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
