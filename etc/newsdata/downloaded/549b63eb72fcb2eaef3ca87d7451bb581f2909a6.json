The only way to get respect from the people it\u2019s hardest to get it from is to beat them.\u201d\n\nEngland also beat the fourth Rugby Championship team and 2015 semi-finalists Argentina in the pool phase.\n\nDallaglio was a key part of England\u2019s back row when they triumphed in 2003 and he came off the bench in their 2007 final defeat by South Africa. The former captain said last Saturday\u2019s performance was undoubtedly one of the best from his country.\n\n\u201cIt was very, very impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the all-time great performances, especially when you factor in the occasion, what was at stake and the quality of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThe really impressive thing was there was a game plan that was clearly put together and it was executed by the players from minute one to the end.\u201d\n\nDallaglio said Saturday\u2019s performance was not out of the blue but the culmination of the last three years of development. The team have a \u201ccore of serial winners\u201d - used to success for England and for Saracens\n\nBut what they delivered in the semi-final was still of a \u201cdifferent dimension\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat was so wonderfully refreshing was the courage they played with,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had the mindset of \u2018we\u2019re not going to just beat you, we are going to totally beat you\u2019.\u201d\n\nMuch as he enthused about the performance, Dallaglio warned fans to temper their expectations of a repeat in Saturday\u2019s final against a South African team who, as they showed in their semi-final victory over Wales, will bring a different threat.\n\n\u201cNobody should expect England to replicate that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy and it won\u2019t be pretty. South Africa are very proud, very strong and will be a tough nut to crack. They\u2019re not easy on the eye but they don\u2019t need to make an excuses for that.\u201d\n\nDallaglio said the Springboks stick to a tried and tested pattern when in their own half but allow themselves a little more freedom when on the offensive over the halfway line.\n\n\u201cIt works for them \u2013 it\u2019s pragmatic - not pretty, but effective,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people predicted they would win the World Cup so it\u2019s not a surprise they are still here \u2013 even the pool game they lost to the All Blacks was a lot closer than the score (23-13)suggested.\n\n\u201cI think that game showed that to beat them you have to get out in front, then that structured approach in their own half gets challenged.\u201d\n\nDallaglio said that if England do triumph on Saturday he does not think there would be a repeat of the post-World Cup slump that overcame them in 2004 when they went from \u201cbest in the world to worst in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe planned for winning but not for success afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cThis group won\u2019t have that as they are still very much on that journey. The All Blacks set the bar so high and that\u2019s what motivated Eddie Jones and the players. Now it\u2019s England\u2019s turn to try to keep driving those standards.\u201d", "description": "If England were to complete the first \"Southern Slam\" by beating South Africa in Saturday's Rugby World Cup final, it would be the greatest performance by any of the winners to date, former champion Lawrence Dallaglio says.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446463466&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0JG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
