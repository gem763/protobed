But the White House has no real reason to worry yet.\n\nAny shift, however small, could have dire consequences for a White House that, as of this week, formally faces a very real threat of impeachment. Democrats are incensed over and even a few Republicans are unhappy about Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President, during which Trump requested that its government investigate the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a potential Trump rival for the White House in 2020. (There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine.) Left in the balance? Almost $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nA U.S. whistleblower was so concerned with Trump requesting a foreign government\u2019s assistance that would benefit the President politically, that he or she submitted a formal complaint, setting off a fast-moving impeachment wildfire at the Capitol. That confidential complaint made its way to Congress late Wednesday at McConnell\u2019s urging and was the topic of Thursday morning\u2019s open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The three-hour session did only added to the belief in Washington that impeachment would dominate what remains of this Congress and into 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut don\u2019t look for McConnell himself to join the sprint, Republicans inside and without his orbit said, and said the canny Majority Leader has a knack for leveraging any event to maximum political gain.\n\n\u201cMcConnell is going to take this very slowly and let House Democrats dominate the news in their rush to impeach the President, while he lets it shake out among his members,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist who worked in the House during the last impeachment trial. Bonjean\u2019s boss at the time? Rep. Michael Castle, a GOP lawmaker who voted against one of the impeachment articles facing Bill Clinton in 1999.\n\n\u201cDemocrats in the House are really going to drive the train,\u201d Bonjean said. But they also may be walking into a trap, he added.\n\n\u201c(McConnell) needs to figure out what committees may want to do hearings on what. For instance, they may want to look into the Bidens,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s name gets trampled under this machine.\u201d\n\nJust as hearings into Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, and her handling of State Department emails produced no stunning revelations or criminal charges, both dogged her campaign. And, in that, McConnell may find utility to entertaining the impeachment asteroid that seems inevitable to wind up on his side of the Capitol.\n\nIt has already been quite the stunning week.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi made official Democrats\u2019 drive to remove Trump from power on Tuesday. She may be within striking distance of having enough support to make impeachment a sure thing, even though lawmakers are far from even sketching possible articles of impeachment, which are similar to an indictment. If those find a majority in the House, then they\u2019d be referred to the Senate, where Trump would, in effect, be put on trial.\n\nFor a conviction, Democrats would require two-thirds of the McConnell-led Senate to go along with charges that the President abused his office\u2019s muscle in asking Ukraine to look into a potential probe into Biden.\n\nSuccess for Democrats seems highly unlikely. Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate and Vice President Mike Pence can break a tie. That means, for Democrats to prove successful, they\u2019d have to persuade 20 GOP lawmakers to defect and support removing Trump from office. Trump, it is worth remembering, has an 85% job approval rating in the most recent Quinnipiac University Poll. At this point, bucking a popular President from your own party seems like a surefire way to draw a primary challenger.\n\nStill, the impeachment whiff once again elevates McConnell\u2019s power, and there was a visible frustration on his part this week. McConnell is a student of the Senate and a defender of legislative powers. That Trump unilaterally held up aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved annoyed McConnell greatly. That he couldn\u2019t get answers from the Pentagon and State Department made him even grumpier.", "description": "Don\u2019t look for Mitch McConnell himself to join the sprint to impeaching President Donald Trump, Republicans inside and without his orbit said", "authors": ["Philip Elliott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZCPQEL_4kT3YAo7bDKoUkQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/06064cee5349ec106e8458d2ef0d0f7b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
