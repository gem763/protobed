USA TODAY\n\nYour turn, Jaylen Waddle.\n\nHow do you stop the deafening roar of a record crowd at Texas A&M's Kyle Field? Give the ball to playmakers in space.\n\nThe smallest of Alabama\u2019s four NFL-bound receivers, Waddle got the call Saturday. He took one short Tua Tagovailoa pass 31 yards for a touchdown and returned one punt 43 yards and another 42. In an otherwise imperfect performance, the top-ranked Tide utilized Waddle and its vast array of explosive options to provide cushion en route to a 47-28 victory against 21st-ranked Texas A&M.\n\nAlabama wide receiver Jaylen Waddle (17) runs in for a touchdown against Texas A&M.

Tagovailoa threw his first interception of the season, giving Texas A&M hope at the half while snapping his streak of 185 throws without a pick.\n\nAnd the defense? Still a work in progress.\n\nKellen Mond led the Aggies methodically down the field on the opening possession, covering 75 yards in 15 plays, before the Tide regrouped. After Waddle answered on the ensuing drive, the squeeze was on.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nMAJOR UPSET: South Carolina shocks No. 3 Georgia in two overtimes\n\nBIG 12 SHOWDOWN: Oklahoma's stingy defense proves too much for Texas\n\nKeep in mind, this isn\u2019t a pedestrian opponent. Still, Tagovailoa\u2019s late-first half interception only delayed the inevitable. While the Aggies are solid defensively, it may take a super-human effort to slow this tsunami of offense.\n\nConsider that A&M\u2019s most dependable tackler was its punter, Braden Mann, who made a couple of touchdown-saving stops on returns. But, for some reason, the Aggies never tried him at safety.\n\nThey needed him, as Tagovailoa took turns showing off his receiving corps.\n\nWaddle finished with 176 all-purpose yards. DeVonta Smith picked up where he left two record-setting weeks ago, making A&M play for a blitz by housing a quick slant for a 47-yard score.\n\nHenry Ruggs III made his biggest contributions returning kickoffs. And Jerry Jeudy, the most lethal of Alabama\u2019s fearsome four added 50 yards on receptions \u2014 a good day during any other era.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty for Nick Saban to focus on during the weeks ahead. The running game is improving, but it\u2019s not one to take a game over yet \u2014 at least against a quality defense.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve mentioned the defense. The tackling is improving, as is the pass rush, with Terrell Lewis re-emerging after two seasons lost to injury. But Mond had his moments, as did Ryan Hilinski and John Rhys Plumlee before him.\n\nHalfway through the regular season, Saban\u2019s biggest fear has to be entitlement. Alabama has yet to be challenged.\n\nThe test will come. Maybe from an elite defense. Maybe from a powerhouse offense. Or, in the playoffs, maybe from a complete team (here\u2019s looking at you, Ohio State).\n\nBut, for now, it\u2019s as if this Alabama offense is playing against air.", "description": "Tua Tagovailoa throws an interception to end streak, but the Crimson Tide used Jaylen Waddle en route to 47-28 win  against No. 21 Texas A&M.", "authors": ["Doug Segrest", "Special To The Advertiser", "Published P.M.
