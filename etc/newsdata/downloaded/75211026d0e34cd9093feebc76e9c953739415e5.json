Stuart Armstrong made it six after a bizarre incident in the latter stages.\n\nThe ball held up with every pass in the second half, with the heavy rain continuing throughout the game. A domestic match would unquestionably have been abandoned in similar circumstances but neither team nor the French match officials were looking to try again 24 hours later, as UEFA rules dictate.\n\nStuart Armstrong scores Scotland\u00b4s sixth amid heavy rain (Steve Welsh/PA)\n\nWhile there was a limit to what can be taken from beating the world\u2019s lowest ranked team on such a pitch, Scotland did move up to fourth spot in Group I of the European Championship qualifiers. With Cyprus and Kazakhstan both losing, Scotland are now a point off third ahead of playing both teams next month, and have a chance to boost morale before the play-offs in March.\n\nSteve Clarke made six changes following Thursday\u2019s 4-0 defeat in Russia, Scotland\u2019s fourth loss in succession. Sunderland goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin won his second cap, Kilmarnock defender Findlay made his debut, Scott McTominay returned from suspension, Celtic midfielders Ryan Christie and James Forrest were recalled, and Shankland made his first start up front.\n\nScotland forced six corners inside the first nine minutes but both McTominay and Michael Devlin failed to get headers on target.\n\nShankland also had a good early chance from James Forrest\u2019s cutback but San Marino goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini pulled off an outstanding stop.\n\nJohn McGinn claimed the match ball before half-time (Steve Welsh/PA)\n\nThe opener was not long in coming though as McGinn got a deft touch on Christie\u2019s 12th-minute shot following Andy Robertson\u2019s diagonal ball.\n\nMcGinn\u2019s second came in the 27th minute after Simoncini could only palm McTominay\u2019s driven ball into his path eight yards out.\n\nThe hat-trick came in first-half stoppage-time from Scotland\u2019s 13th corner. Findlay headed Christie\u2019s delivery towards goal and McGinn turned and finished inside the six-yard box.\n\nSimoncini had earlier made another stunning stop from McTominay after another cutback from Forrest, who also forced two decent first-half saves.\n\nStuart Findlay was also on target for the Scots (Steve Welsh/PA)\n\nThe conditions deteriorated badly in the early stages of the second half with simple passes soon getting stuck in the surface water.\n\nThe game was fast becoming a farce when two of Scotland\u2019s latest additions celebrated their first goals.\n\nShankland rolled the ball home from 12 yards after McTominay\u2019s strike cracked off the bar in the 65th minute, and Findlay headed home Christie\u2019s corner from close range two minutes later.\n\nMcGinn was looking to become the first Scotland player to hit four in a game since Colin Stein in 1969, and he forced a save from long range just before being taken off in the 70th minute.\n\nDundee United striker Lawrence Shankland notched his first goal for Scotland (Steve Welsh/PA)\n\nJohnny Russell had a shot stopped before fellow substitute Armstrong benefited from a misunderstanding in the 87th minute.\n\nThe San Marino goalkeeper picked the ball up outside his box after Shankland appeared to be fouled in the centre circle. The referee had waved play on though and Scotland found themselves with a free-kick 25 yards out.\n\nSome of the San Marino players urged Scotland to give them the ball back but Armstrong showed no such generosity and curled into the top corner.", "description": "The second half was played in terrible conditions but Scotland persisted to claim a vital victory.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/19/wire-19662520-1570990128-823_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
