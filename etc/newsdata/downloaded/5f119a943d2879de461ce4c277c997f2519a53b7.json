The move came despite a last-minute plea from senior KMT leaders including Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, for Gou to back their nominee and help return the China-friendly party to power. Gou has until Tuesday to apply to run in the Jan. 11 election.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m doing the right thing, something major that will turn around Taiwan\u2019s destiny,\u201d Gou said in a statement.\n\nGou\u2019s candidacy would shake-up Taiwan\u2019s political landscape, undercut KMT challenger Han Kuo-yu\u2019s effort to unseat Tsai and potentially weaken both dominant parties. A three-way race could be a hard-fought affair, with Tsai leading with 33.7% of support, compared with 28.9% for Han and 25.6% for Gou, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Apple Daily newspaper.\n\nSince both Gou and Han support closer ties with China -- always Taiwan\u2019s most contentious wedge issue -- the Foxconn founder could complicate the KMT\u2019s bid to oust Tsai and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Tsai has been dogged by an increasingly assertive Beijing, which has been angered by her refusal to accept the Communist Party\u2019s bottom line that both sides belong to \u201cone China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe KMT will be substantially impacted by Gou\u2019s declaration to run,\u201d said Stephen Tan, president of the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Policy Association. \u201cAlthough Gou will run as an independent, his constituents have been mainly the \u2018blue\u2019 voters and the moderates whom KMT is working hard to seek for support.\u201d\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Tsai Rises From Ashes With a Hand From Hong Kong\n\nGou has continued to publicly flirt with the idea of a presidential bid despite losing the KMT primary to Han in July. The firebrand Kaohsiung mayor has become one the island\u2019s best-known -- and most divisive -- political leaders since his surprise win in the DPP\u2019s southern stronghold in November.\n\nHan said he regretted Gou\u2019s move to withdraw from the KMT. Ma, the former president, and KMT Chairman Wu Den-yih were among several senior opposition figures who published advertisements in newspapers earlier Thursday urging Gou to support their nominee.\n\nGou built Foxconn from a maker of television knobs into a global powerhouse that is now Apple\u2019s biggest supplier and China\u2019s largest private employer. He also has ties to President Donald Trump, meeting the U.S. leader at the White House in May, weeks before stepping down as chairman of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Foxconn\u2019s main listed arm.\n\nShares in companies Gou controls rose after he quit the party Thursday, with FIH Mobile Ltd. surging more than 15% in Hong Kong and the group flagship Hon Hai rising 2% in Taipei.\n\nHong Kong Immigration to Taiwan Surges as Protests Grind On\n\nGou has been sending signals that he might mount an independent run for weeks, although he\u2019ll still need to collect around 280,000 signatures to get on the ballot. After assembling a campaign team, he confirmed last month that he was considering breaking from the KMT for a stand-alone bid.\n\n\u201cThis conservative, hidebound party leadership is putting their own interests ahead of their party\u2019s and the party\u2019s interests ahead of the nation\u2019s,\u201d Gou\u2019s spokesman, Evelyn Tsai, told reporters Thursday. \u201cMr. Gou won\u2019t miss this party.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Gou quote in third paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Adela Lin.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Samson Ellis in Taipei at sellis29@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, ;John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group, threatened to throw Taiwan\u2019s presidential race into turmoil as he took a key step toward running as an independent.Gou withdrew Thursday from the opposition Kuomintang, a necessary precursor to mounting a", "authors": ["Samson Ellis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ulylg49V_WbRRctCTHYCVg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/142dbd040b61da61492b57d6141113af", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
