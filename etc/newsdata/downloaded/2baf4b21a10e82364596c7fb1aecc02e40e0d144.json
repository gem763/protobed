Ask yourself, what would scare my grandmother or piss off my grandfather? And that\u2019s a Fox story.\u201d\n\nIn the scenes with Doocy and Kilmeade, we see Kidman\u2019s Carlson gently ribbing her co-hosts for sexually harassing her on-the-air. \u201cYeah, I gotta read that manual again,\u201d the real Kilmeade jokes.\n\nWe also get a glimpse of Kelly\u2019s private reaction to Trump\u2019s \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever\u201d dig. \u201cOh my god, did he just accuse me of anger-menstruating?\u201d she asks. And there are quick snapshots of Bree Condon\u2019s Kimberly Guilfoyle rallying the troops and Alanna Ubach as Jeanine Pirro dressing down Robbie for daring to be disloyal.\n\nThe \u201cbombshell\u201d of the film\u2019s title, of course, is Carlson\u2019s real-life decision to finally expose Ailes for his decades of misconduct. There has been some fear in the media world that Bombshell would improperly valorize Kelly, even though she waited until Carlson spoke up and Ailes was already on his way out as head of the network to reveal her own stories of how he had mistreated her, saving the details for her 2016 book Settle for More.\n\nSpeaking to Ellen DeGeneres this week, Theron declined to say whether she was able to meet with or speak to Kelly during her preparations for the role. \u201cAs a team, we\u2019ve just decided to really protect our sources,\u201d she said. \u201cMegyn is fully aware of the film and I\u2019m really hoping that she\u2019ll see it.\u201d", "description": "The new trailer for \u201cBombshell\u201d reveals Nicole Kidman\u2019s Gretchen Carlson spliced into real \u201cFox & Friends\u201d footage with Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571155041/FF_qxhltz", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
