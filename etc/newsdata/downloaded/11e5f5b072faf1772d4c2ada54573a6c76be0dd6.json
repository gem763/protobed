REUTERS/Howard Schneider/Files\n\nBars and restaurants have been mainstays of a U.S. economic expansion that rests squarely on consumer spending, and if businesses like Berger\u2019s start to slow it\u2019s a short step from there to jobs, wages, business sentiment and world demand.\n\n\u201cThese were numbers we couldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Berger said of the growth in his main taproom sales and the 30% jump in output over the past year, to 20,000 barrels, at the company\u2019s main production brewery.\n\nIf the view from this open-air bar remains rosy, it\u2019s amid a decidedly mixed picture elsewhere in the United States and the world as economists and policymakers take note of what has become a consumer-dependent - and potentially fragile - global growth picture.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund this week downgraded its outlook for world growth in 2019 to 3%, the slowest pace since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. Officials cited stalled trade and investment as the culprit, leaving household spending as the main support for private-sector growth.\n\nThat may itself be coming under pressure.\n\nIn China, shopkeepers tell of waning demand that has made them more cautious, in some cases delaying personal purchases and amplifying the effect of that uncertainty. Embroiled in a trade war with the United States, China saw its economic growth slow to 6.2% in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, its weakest pace in at least 27 years. Retail sales growth is the weakest since early 2003, and Chinese car sales declined last year for the first time since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cOur business has not been so good - fewer migrant workers are coming to our shop, so I might have to save up for another two years before I can buy a car,\u201d said Luo Shuzhen, a 48-year-old shop owner in the southern city of Dongguan, who was hoping to buy this year.\n\nIt\u2019s a decision that, magnified across China, is being felt in Germany, where auto exports have slumped, and down the supply chain.\n\nIn Japan and Europe, any good news on household spending is clouded by an offset in the other direction.\n\nA Bank of Japan consumer index rose to its second-highest level on record in August, evidenced by strong sales of luxury cars as well as a shift to servings of higher-quality beef among the lunchtime restaurant crowd. But real wages fell for the eighth straight month in August, complicating the outlook for consumption that is likely to take a further hit from a hike in the sales tax this month to 10% from 8%.\n\nGerman consumers seemed spurred by recent moves by the European Central Bank to support the euro zone economy, and French consumers by recent tax relief. But there was some evidence British consumers may be starting to hunker down, shifting spending from restaurants and hotels to food to be consumed at home.\n\n\u2018STARTING TO ERODE\u2019\n\nConsumption is always a major portion of gross domestic product, accounting for roughly 70% of U.S. output and roughly 60% in China, for example. But ideally it\u2019s balanced with business investment and contributions from trade, elements that add not just to current growth but set the stage for future hiring and expansion.\n\nAs it stands, GDP for the 36 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes the United States and much of Europe and accounts for the bulk of the global economy, would have shrunk in the second quarter of 2019 if not for a strong contribution from consumer spending.\n\nGoing forward, growth will depend on how that holds up in the face of slowing global trade volumes, and particularly how U.S. consumers fare.\n\nSome policymakers have already flagged a possible recession in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Though U.S. unemployment was near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September, job and wage growth both slowed.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. consumer is really the pillar of not just the U.S. economy but the global economy. If that pillar starts to weaken then all bets are off,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist with Oxford Economics.\n\nWeakness may be expected to show up early in bar and restaurant sales, he said. As of July, growth in spending at \u201cfood services and drinking places\u201d hit its slowest pace in two and a half years, and has declined for three months running.\n\nIt might seem a narrow issue but \u201cyou get from point A to point B in that if people spend less, the restaurants have less revenue, hire fewer people, be careful with wage growth, and that will feed back into lower spending, then broaden to other sectors,\u201d be it consumer durables like autos or appliances, or business spending on new equipment or software, Daco said.\n\nBart Watson, chief economist for the Brewers Association, a coalition of more than 5,000 small producers, said it is difficult to disentangle an overall drop in beer production with a steady shift to higher-end beverages produced by companies like Denver Beer.\n\nBut within an overall draft in draught keg production of about 8%, there is also \u201csome sign of on-premise weakness\u201d among the taprooms that have been central to that part of the industry\u2019s success, Watson said.\n\n\u201cWe have to take a wait-and-see\u201d approach on what it means, he added.\n\nWith record numbers of people working and wages still growing, the immediate future may be okay, keeping Berger\u2019s beer company and the rest of the U.S. consumer complex on track.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBut Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet Wealth Management, noted that some of his preferred warning signs were flashing. Employment in the trucking industry, for example, has flatlined this year, and when that \u201cis starting to roll over, it is a cause for concern. That is a cyclical part of the economy that is starting to erode,\u201d he said.\n\nTrucking has also been a dependable source of middle-wage jobs during the recovery. It may be no coincidence that U.S. employment growth in bars and restaurants, up roughly 33% since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, has also crawled to a stop.\n\n\u201cI think we are in the last innings of the consumer cycle,\u201d Costerg said. \u201cConsumer spending may be strong for two or three quarters, but I am worried there could be a cliff effect\u201d if business spending and investment does not pick up.", "description": "If the global economy hits the skids, the warning may come from the hop-covered taproom of the Denver Beer Co, where yearly sales are up 17% and founder Charlie Berger says the new \"Juicy Freak\" India Pale Ale is a bestseller despite its $1-per-pint higher price tag.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441358358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0B3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
