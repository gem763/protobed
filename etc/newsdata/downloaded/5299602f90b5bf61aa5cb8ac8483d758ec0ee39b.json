Jason Scott\n\nHis comments came days after he called off peace talks with the Taliban, who hosted al-Qaeda leaders at they plotted 9-11.\n\nHis decision ended nearly a year of hopeful negotiations by a State Department envoy who said he was on the \"threshold\" of a peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict.\n\nMr Trump also said he visited the site of the towers, known as ground zero, shortly after they fell to assist first responders and those in need.\n\nThat claim has been disputed by Richard Alles, a retired deputy chief of the New York Fire Department, who has said the president \u201cwas not a presence\u201d at the site.\n\nThe president's suggestion that he had \"hundreds\" of friends die at ground zero and that he witnessed television coverage of Muslims in the US cheering the destruction, cannot be verified.\n\nThe moment of silence at the Pentagon is traditionally observed at 9:37 am, the time when a plane was flown into the building. But this year, the anniversary was observed 10 minutes late, at 9:47, as Mr Trump was running behind schedule.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The last kiss. The last phone call. The last time hearing those precious words, \u2018I love you'.\u201d\n\nThe president did not elaborate on who might strike America, but some commentators believe he was talking about the Taliban.\n\nAfter the peace talks collapsed, it emerged he was preparing to hold talks with leaders of the terror organisation at Camp David in Maryland.\n\nNews of the plan to host Taliban leaders on American soil \u2014 particularly near a time as sensitive as the 9/11 anniversary \u2014 sparked a swift backlash from critics on either side of the political aisle, including Republican Liz Cheney, who said on Twitter: \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot [at Camp David]. Ever.\u201d\n\nThe president began the day by observing a moment of silence on the South Lawn along with Melania Trump and White House staff.\n\nHe then moved on to the Pentagon where he delivered his speech.\n\nMembers of Congress held their own moment of silence on Capitol Hill. Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at a commemorative service in Shanksville.\n\nLess than a month after 9-11, former President George W Bush announced on 7 October, 2001, that US and British troops had begun striking Afghanistan for harbouring the al-Qaeda terrorists blamed for 9/11.\n\nThe massive air campaign initially targeted troops, training camps and air defences of the Taliban, which had ruled Afghanistan under a harsh version of Islamic law since 1996 and hosted al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nFor nearly a year, US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been negotiating with the Taliban on issues including a potential US troop withdrawal if the Taliban guarantees to keep Afghanistan from again becoming a launch pad for global terror attacks.\n\nThose talks came to an abrupt halt last weekend when Mr Trump tweeted that he had cancelled the proposed meeting with the Taliban and members of the Afghan government.\n\nMany fear his cancellation of negotiations will bring more carnage as the US and Taliban, as well as Afghan forces, escalate their attacks, with civilians in the crossfire.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the US-Taliban talks will resume, but Mr Trump has said he wants to withdraw about 5,000 of the 14,000 US service members still in Afghanistan. More than 2,400 American service members have been killed in the conflict.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Donald Trump threatened to \u201cuse power the likes of which the United States has never used before\u201d against anyone who strikes America.\u00a0 In a speech on\u00a0the anniversary of the\u00a0September\u00a011 attacks, he said:\u00a0\u201cIf anyone dares to strike our land, we will respond with the full measure of American power and the iron will of the American spirit and that spirit is unbreakable.\"", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/19/pri84318937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
