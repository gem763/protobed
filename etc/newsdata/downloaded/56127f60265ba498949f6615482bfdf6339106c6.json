Add Interest\n\nAs the White House pushes back against the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings, Trump and his defenders have tried to shift the focus back to the original whistleblower, Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, repeatedly making accusations of fraud and misconduct and questioning motives.\n\nHere is a look at of some of their most significant accusations:\n\nAccusation: The whistleblower is driven by politics\n\nIn a tweet earlier this week, Trump referred to the whistleblower as \u201chighly partisan\u201d with ties to his political rivals. But those statements aren\u2019t supported by the facts known so far, and lack important context.\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\nTrump told reporters on Wednesday at the White House that \u201cit turns out that the whistleblower is a Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been revealed but the person has previously been identified as an intelligence official, a career civil servant and a registered Democrat.\n\nAccording to the intelligence community inspector general, the person was screened for any potential bias during an interview after filing the complaint and showed \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias.\u201d Despite that, the IG said he found that the whistleblower's allegations appeared \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers say the person has never worked for any political candidate, campaign or party and \u201cspent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch.\u201d\n\nAs a career civil servant, it\u2019s very possible the person served under then-Vice President Joe Biden or provided briefings on Capitol Hill to lawmakers, but such a role would not normally be considered political.\n\nAccusation: The whistleblower got facts wrong on Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy\n\nTrump tweeted that, \u201cthe first so-called second-hand information \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 got my phone conversation almost completely wrong.\u201d\n\nBut so far, most of the allegations have been substantiated by other evidence, most notably a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call released by the White House. In that transcript, Trump asks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a \u201cfavor\" \u2013 appearing to pressure him to investigate the Biden family.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPrivate text messages exchanged by top U.S. diplomats also show at least two believed Trump wanted Ukraine to launch an investigation, and that he wanted to dangle a meeting between the two leaders in return. At least one diplomat was deeply concerned by the possibility that Trump was holding up military aid in exchange for the investigation.\n\nOne detail in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint has been disputed: that T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department official, was listening to the July 25 Trump-Zelenskiy conversation. The State Department has said he was not on the phone call.\n\nAccusation: The whistleblower has only second-hand information\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower said the information came from more than a half dozen White House and U.S. officials and acknowledges that he \u201cwas not a direct witness to most of the events described.\u201d\n\nBut the intelligence community inspector general later noted that the whistleblower had \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct.\u201d\n\nMark Zaid, an attorney representing the whistleblower, says he is now representing a second intelligence official with first-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint.\n\nTrump and his defenders also have claimed that whistleblower process was changed right before this complaint to allow one to be based on second-hand information, but the inspector general put out an unusual public statement saying that accusation was unfounded.\n\nWireImage/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAccusation: Joe Biden wanted a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son, Hunter Biden\n\nIn a September tweet, Trump wrote that Biden demanded \u201cthe Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won\u2019t get a very large amount of U.S. money.\u201d\n\nThis accusation is misleading, as there was widespread and global criticism of the Ukrainian prosecutor general at the time. In other words, there were grounds for Biden to urge his dismissal that had nothing to do with his son. Several high-profile Western leaders have said Biden's recommendation was prudent.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, for example, threatened to withhold aid to Kiev in early 2016, while the former prosecutor was still in office, citing \u201cUkraine\u2019s slow progress in improving governance and fighting corruption,\u201d according to Christine Lagarde, then the IMF\u2019s managing director.\n\nAccusation: Hunter Biden earned thousands as a member of Burisma\u2019s board\n\nHunter Biden and an associate at a business entity called Rosemont Seneca Partners both obtained seats on the board of the Ukrainian energy company about the same time.\n\nAccording to banking records reviewed by ABC News, their firm began collecting $166,666 payments each month from Burisma, owned by a Russian oligarch.\n\nAccusation: Hunter Biden had no relevant experience that qualified him for a board position at Burisma\n\nIt is true that he had no significant prior experience in the energy industry or Eastern Europe, where Burisma operated. In a statement to ABC News in June, Hunter Biden defended his \u201cqualifications for such a role based on [his] extensive prior board service,\u201d including \u201cas former Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Food Program USA\u201d and \u201cserving as former Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak).\u201d\n\nPool/Ng Han Guan/Pool/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAccusation: Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from an investment firm deal in China\n\nReports at the time indicated Hunter Biden\u2019s firm, Bohai Harvest RST, sought to raise $1.5 billion from a deal involving a Chinese-state run bank. This does not mean that either he or his firm pocketed $1.5 billion from the deal.\n\nTrump in two separate tweets that Hunter Biden\u201c\u2026got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden, George Mesires, told ABC News the fund has a registered capital of $4.2 million, and Hunter Biden holds a 10% stake. The lawyer estimated that committed capital is worth $420,000.\n\nMesires also said Hunter Biden has yet to receive a financial return on investment, adding that he only became a minority stake-holder in the company in October 2017 \u2013 after Joe Biden was no longer vice president. Prior to then, Hunter Biden served as an unpaid director.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether he invested that money himself or whether his 10% stake serves as compensation for his directorship.\n\nAccusation: Hunter Biden scored the deal right after he flew to Beijing with his father on Air Force Two\n\nIt\u2019s true that at the time of his visit to Beijing in late 2013, Hunter Biden was engaged in business there as a participant in a company called Bohai Harvest RST.\n\nHunter Biden told The New Yorker he went on the visit with his teenage daughter, who was accompanying Vice President Joe Biden and flew on Air Force Two \u2013 the Vice President\u2019s plane. He acknowledged he also met with some business associates in a social capacity during that trip.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyer said the agreement actually was signed months earlier, in June. A Chinese business license was issued shortly after his visit to Beijing in December 2013.\n\nAccusation: The US ambassador to Ukraine was \u2018bad news\u2019\n\nIn the July 25 conversation, Trump called her \u201cbad news,\u201d a former Ukrainian official alleged she gave him a \u201cdo-not-prosecute\u201d list and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has alleged she had an anti-Trump bias. And he told reporters publicly in early October that he had \"heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time.\"\n\nBut the accusations against Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch haven\u2019t lined up.\n\nThe State Department at the time said the allegation that she asked the Ukraine government not to prosecute certain people was an \"outright fabrication\" and \"does not correspond to reality.\" Yovanovitch had been trying to tackle corruption and had criticized the Ukraine official who made the unsubstantiated claim.\n\nOn Thursday, the indictment charging two Giuliani associates with campaign finance violations revealed that the duo attempted to get a member of Congress to help oust Yovanovitch as ambassador \u201cat the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials\u201d.\n\nRetired ambassador Nancy McEldowney described Yovanovitch as a \"professional of impeccable integrity, someone with a stellar career that has never had the slightest suggestion of impropriety.\"", "description": "As President Trump continues to level accusations against the Ukraine call whistleblower and the Bidens, what are the facts?", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/president-trump-gty-jef-191010_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
