Giving all Americans access to the same housing arrangements means that no one will have to live in a cramped attic. But it also means that some family members will have to part with some of their favorite furniture. \u201cOf the 160 million people who like their health care now, they can keep it,\u201d said Mr. Biden, of the virtues of his fixer-upper proposal. \u201cIf they don\u2019t like it, they can leave.\u201d By contrast, Ms. Warren emphasized the universal nature of a teardown approach: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this by saying, everyone is covered by Medicare for all; every health care provider is covered.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system envisioned by Mr. Sanders would cover more benefits than nearly any system in the world, but it would require everyone to have the same type of insurance, with no easy workarounds for patients who aren\u2019t satisfied. Ms. Harris\u2019s plan would allow more choice, letting private plans operate alongside the government system. But those tightly regulated products would not be allowed to differ nearly as much as plans that exist in today\u2019s system and would also amount to a brand-new system.\n\nThe candidates also disagree on how people should finance their ambitions. The fixer-upper candidates, for the most part, favor a system in which most Americans would still need to pay some form of rent to live in the house. The teardown candidates think everyone\u2019s housing costs should be financed by taxes instead of direct payments.\n\nA tax-financed system would mean big changes in who pays what for health care, and how. A system that preserves a mix of taxes, premiums and direct payments like deductibles would mean less rearranging of the financing of health care and would probably require more modest tax increases.\n\nThis is only a metaphor, of course. There are many ways the health care system is not like a residence. But if you\u2019ve ever renovated or built a home, you know the emotional and budgetary stakes. The health care system is personal to many Americans, just like their home. It\u2019s no surprise the debate has been so heated.", "description": "To understand the competing Democratic health care plans, consider an elaborate home construction metaphor.", "authors": ["Margot Sanger-Katz", "Tim Enthoven", "Text By", "Illustrations By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/upshot/oakImage-1568216725735/oakImage-1568216725735-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
