So why did she walk away?\n\nMost people, says Marisa Berenson, \u201ctend to live in my past. Which is fine.\u201d She smiles, well aware of the fascination. \u201cBut I tend to live in the present and in the future.\u201d A 2001 profile of the model/actor in the New York Times described her as a \u201cZelig of the zeitgeist \u2026 popping up in the right place at the right time\u201d. And there is certainly something magical about her life and the people who have passed through it. As a child (she is now 72) she was taught to dance by Gene Kelly. Greta Garbo came to her parents\u2019 parties; Salvador Dal\u00ed \u2013 a friend of her grandmother, the designer Elsa Schiaparelli \u2013 wanted to paint her. The legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland pushed her to become a model \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent would describe her as \u201cthe face of the 70s\u201d \u2013 and she was photographed by giants such as David Bailey, Irving Penn and Richard Avedon. Andy Warhol photographed her wedding.\n\nShe discovered meditation in India alongside George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was at Bianca Jagger\u2019s Studio 54 birthday party \u2013 the fabled night of the white horse \u2013 and attended Truman Capote\u2019s famed Black and White ball. Although she continues to work in film, she hasn\u2019t made a huge number of movies \u2013 but the biggest, early in her career, were Luchino Visconti\u2019s Death in Venice, Bob Fosse\u2019s Cabaret and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Barry Lyndon.\n\nBerenson lives in a villa down an unprepossessing road on the outskirts of Marrakech. Even this place seems suitably magical \u2013 \u201cmy paradise\u201d, she says \u2013 an oasis of bright colours and patterns, and lush greenery amid the scrub. We sit on her terrace, overlooking the garden and pool. Tiny birds flit in and out. Berenson, beautiful and glamorous, is wearing a long, patterned kaftan, her slight but athletic frame untroubled by the weight of her heavy jade earrings and matching tangled vine of necklaces. Her sunglasses stay on throughout \u2013 I never once see her eyes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Berenson with Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli at the Paris premiere of Cabaret in 1972.

She is thinking, she says, of writing a lifestyle book, filled with healthy recipes, and interiors and gardening advice. There is something both timeless and very current about Berenson. She was well ahead of the \u201cwellness\u201d trend, and stands at something like high priestess level now \u2013 she doesn\u2019t eat sugar or gluten, she does yoga, pilates and meditation \u2013 and has taken to Instagram.\n\nBerenson is one of a generation of supremely cultured, well-connected Euro-aristocrats (she speaks five languages), born to socialite Gogo Schiaparelli, daughter of Elsa, and Robert Berenson, a director of Aristotle Onassis\u2019s shipping company who became a US diplomat. As a child she wanted to be in the movies, her bedroom plastered with pictures of Audrey Hepburn, Rita Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich.\n\nShe grew up moving around Europe, then was sent to boarding school in Berkshire, where she concluded she was \u201chopeless\u201d at acting. \u201cThey had plays they put on and we were obliged to get up on stage and do things. And I remember running off the stage crying, because I was so terrified. So you can imagine I never thought it would ever happen.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I think Stanley liked the idea that I became very melancholic\u2019 ...

Vreeland, she remembers, \u201csaid, \u2018We have to photograph Marisa.\u2019 That was it. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d Berenson had already been turned down by one model agent, the influential Eileen Ford, but with Vreeland\u2019s backing, she became one of the most sought-after faces of the 60s and 70s. Elsa Schiaparelli wasn\u2019t too pleased. \u201cI think she was afraid for me,\u201d says Berenson. \u201cI was so young, and living in New York alone.\u201d Also, she adds with a smile, \u201cI was a little bit outrageous too. I did the first nude in Vogue, and things like that, and she was horrified.\u201d\n\nIn her spare time she was hanging out at parties with artists and rock stars, and in relationships with actors and rich heirs. She remembers doing a shoot for Vogue in Iran. \u201cIn those days, everything was accessible.\u201d She makes it sound so glamorous and bohemian. Was she a wild hippy? \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was a combination of very well-brought-up, and an old-fashioned romantic way of looking at life.\u201d She was on, she says, a \u201cspiritual quest\u201d. Being into health and meditation probably saved her. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people didn\u2019t survive. I went through that whole period on orange juice and meditation.\u201d Drugs, she says, were \u201cterrifying to me. I couldn\u2019t imagine losing it like that. And then sexually I was kind of romantic, so I never did the whole crazy thing that way.\u201d\n\nIt was on a Vogue shoot in India when she was about 18, in the late 60s, that she learned about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi\u2019s ashram, the birthplace of transcendental meditation. Two of the Beatles were there when she arrived. \u201cAnd one of the Beach Boys,\u201d she points out. \u201cSo I ended up staying there for a while, going through the initiation, becoming a vegetarian. The days went by and we would just meditate, sleeping in little huts.\u201d Did she spend much time with George and Ringo? \u201cWhen we\u2019d finish the day, George would say, \u2018Come into my room\u2019 and we\u2019d sit on the floor, and listen to them playing guitar.\u201d At the time, she says, it didn\u2019t feel like a big deal. \u201cWe were all on the same quest \u2013 there was a lot of peace and love in those days that we were all looking for.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marisa Berenson with Andy Warhol in 1975. Photograph: Ron Galella/Getty Images\n\nBack in New York, Berenson took acting classes in the evenings. \u201cAnd then I started doing very off-off-Broadway things, just to learn and to get past my insecurities and shyness.\u201d She met Visconti though her then-boyfriend Helmut Berger \u2013 he had also been in a relationship with Visconti \u2013 and he virtually cast her on sight for Death in Venice. \u201cThe first day, I thought I was going to die of fright. But then I set foot on that stage, and I just had this incredible feeling that this is where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d\n\nShe was doing Death in Venice when she got a call from a producer who said Bob Fosse wanted to see her for a film, which turned out to be Cabaret. On the set of that, she says she remembers trembling so badly that Fosse asked her why her hat was shaking. \u201cIt was terrible. It was only my second movie.\u201d Then Kubrick saw Cabaret and decided he wanted her to play Lady Lyndon in his adaptation of the Thackeray novel Barry Lyndon. He called her when she was in bed with pneumonia and could hardly speak. \u201cI was practically unconscious,\u201d she says. \u201cI just let him speak because I was speechless anyway. But he carried on for quite a while about every detail of what he\u2019d liked about my performance in Cabaret.\u201d She didn\u2019t meet him until she was on the set.\n\nBerenson moved into the wing of a draughty castle in Ireland, where they were shooting. Every day Kubrick would tell her she might be needed on set, but she never was (her scenes were filmed once the production suddenly moved to England, reportedly following a threat from the IRA). \u201cIt was the most depressing place,\u201d she says. \u201cI had visions of going riding in the Irish countryside and all that, but in the end, it rained all the time and I was so lonely. I think Stanley liked the idea that I became very melancholic there.\u201d She would cook spaghetti bolognese for the crew, just to have visitors.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Berenson in a Vogue fashion shoot in Capri, 1968. Photograph: Arnaud de Rosnay/Cond\u00e9 Nast via Getty Images\n\nKubrick was, she recalls, \u201ctotally kind and respectful, and very amusing. He never raised his voice, he was always very gentle, but he wanted what he wanted, so if he wanted a scene shot 50 times then it would be shot 50 times. Yes, he was a perfectionist and he wanted you to give the best of yourself, and he expected people to be available.\u201d She understands that, she adds. \u201cEvery great person I\u2019ve worked with, whether a director or photographer, they have this exceptional kind of rarity. You have to be demanding, you have to be a perfectionist, you have to know what you want, and you have to have the best of what you can have because otherwise you don\u2019t do extraordinary things.\u201d\n\nHer acting career had got off to an electrifying start, but Berenson walked away. \u201cI got married shortly after that, so my career sort of \u2026\u201d She pauses, then says crisply, \u201cI put everything on hold for a period of time, which was a choice.\u201d Her marriage to rivet tycoon Jim Randall didn\u2019t last. \u201cAnd then I went through a series of very challenging things in my life, so I had to kind of move through all of that and come out the other side. I had a marriage, a divorce, a car crash\u201d \u2013 she was injured, but the two people in the other car were killed \u2013 \u201cand another marriage and another divorce.\u201d\n\nShe started working again, in theatre and European films, but none of her roles have had the same impact as her first three. Does she regret not pushing her career? \u201cI can\u2019t regret anything because I had a great, beautiful daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now I have a granddaughter, so I\u2019m thrilled. With Hollywood, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if I had stayed. It\u2019s true that Barry Lyndon was such an amazing thing for me, that had I continued on that road, maybe, I don\u2019t know \u2026 But one makes choices and I made that choice at the time so I can\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem much room in Berenson\u2019s life for negativity. She takes her spiritual practice very seriously, and it has seen her through the toughest times, she says, among them the death of her sister Berry, a talented photographer who was a passenger on one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11.\n\nBerenson was also in the air that day, flying to New York, when her plane was diverted to Newfoundland, where she was stuck for several days. \u201cWe were put into this big stadium place, and there were tables they had organised with fruit and a toothbrush and a piece of soap, and medical whatever, and then a whole line of telephones on another table.\u201d She called her daughter, who had frantically been trying to track her down, and learned what had happened to Berry. She remembers accompanying a priest, a fellow passenger, to a tiny church on a hill where they said prayers and sang songs.\n\nIt must be a particularly painful loss because those images are so vivid, and are still used in reports and documentaries all the time. She nods. \u201cTo see that tower constantly, it\u2019s awful. It\u2019s so huge and so beyond anything imaginable.\u201d\n\nShe has been able to deal with it, she says, because of her spirituality. \u201cI try and look at things on a different level of consciousness, and I connect with my sister all the time. So that helps a lot.\u201d She adds, very sincerely: \u201cI believe that so strongly that I never feel alone and I always know that I\u2019m accompanied by higher powers.\u201d\n\nWhen she looks back, does she really have no regrets? \u201cSometimes I think maybe I wasted too much time on things. But in the end, I talk myself out of it \u2013 nothing is a waste of time, because everything is a growing process.\u201d\n\nBerenson isn\u2019t slacking. She spent much of last year in Paris doing a musical, realising her dream to sing and dance. Three years ago, she took on Shakespeare for the first time, performing in London\u2019s West End in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s production of Romeo and Juliet. \u201cI don\u2019t let age get in the way of my life. I continue to do the things I want to do and thank God I\u2019m able to do it.\u201d Nobody likes getting old, she says, \u201cbut it can also be glorious. I feel better about a lot of things now than I did when I was younger, and creatively I think I\u2019m much better now. I\u2019m more secure within myself.\u201d\n\nBy now it\u2019s late afternoon, and a far-off call to prayer comes shimmering through the warm air. She likes this time of day \u2013 she\u2019ll watch films, or read books. Perhaps have a swim. A time for contemplation, and planning. What does she want to achieve? \u201cLots of things. I\u2019m not finished yet.\u201d", "description": "She was photographed by Warhol, and Dal\u00ed wanted to paint her; the first films she made were Death in Venice and Cabaret.
