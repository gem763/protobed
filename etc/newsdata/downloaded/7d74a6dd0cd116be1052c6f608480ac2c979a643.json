Aged 36, she has a stacked medal cabinet with two Giro Rosas and two time-trial world titles, but this was her first road race rainbow jersey, and rarely has it been more richly deserved.\n\nA cohort of strong riders gave chase, among them Yorkshire\u2019s own former world champion Lizzie Deignan, but she was left frustrated as they failed to find any coherence, with Van Vleuten\u2019s Dutch team-mate Anna van der Breggen acting as chief spoiler.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The others stuck with her and eventually left her behind. The young American Chloe Dygert sensationally won time-trial gold this week and attempted to repeat the feat in bridging across to Van Vleuten, but she cracked in the final 10km, letting Van der Breggen sweep through to collect silver. Australia\u2019s Amanda Spratt won bronze.\n\nUp ahead Van Vleuten had already had time to celebrate down the packed home straight, before jumping over the barriers to hug her mum. \u201cIt was a crazy plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to go hard on the climb, and I did and then I saw I had a gap. I can\u2019t believe it. I am a little bit crazy, but I was ready for such a big effort. It was such a big dream for me.\u201d", "description": "We knew that the world title could be lost on the steep Lofthouse climb lurking a third of the way through this road race \u2013 Lizzie Deignan said as much to The Independent earlier this week \u2013 but we never suspected that was where it would be won.", "authors": ["Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/28/16/Annemiek-van-Vleuten.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
