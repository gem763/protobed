Kavanaugh is such an incredible editing error that it raises the prospect that it might have been an ideological intervention.\n\nWhat editor, looking to cut down an article containing a new allegation of collegiate penis exposure, would happen to remove the detail that the female object of said exposure has told friends she has no memory of it? Any sentient editor would realize that the section containing this accusation would attract intense scrutiny. Nearly every other sentence in the piece was a more likely candidate for excision.\n\nBut why would an ideologically motivated editor remove a fact that is contained in the book (\u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation\u201d) on which the article is based? This would be bias compounded by utter stupidity.\n\nIt has not helped that the Times responded to the controversy with all the transparency of an embezzling politician. At first, the Times said it was proud of the \u201cwell-reported and newsworthy\u201d piece. Then the authors of the article (Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly) blamed their editors for the cut on national television. And that the whole thing was \u201cjust an oversight.\u201d And that the sentence was removed because it contained the name of the supposed victim.\n\nThe last explanation assumes utter stupidity on the part of readers. If it is the policy of the Times not to reveal the names of possible sexual assault victims, why not just remove the name of the victim (who does not recall being a victim)? Why remove the whole sentence containing news about her not having any memory of the event?\n\nWhether the result of bias or incompetence, this is journalistic malpractice of the first order. And its happiest critic is President Trump.\n\nWhatever the initial plausibility of the case against Kavanaugh, it has grown weaker over time. The \u201cpreviously unreported story\u201d of exposure in the Times article is based on the accusations of one witness whom the authors did not interview and is disputed by the supposed victim herself. Support for Deborah Ramirez\u2019s allegation of sexual exposure remains an unconvincing collection of partial memories and second-hand accounts.\n\nAnd the reported portions of \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh\u201d do little to make Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation of attempted sexual assault more credible. Ford\u2019s main character witness is her high school friend Leland Keyser. \u201cWe spoke multiple times to Keyser,\u201d write Pogrebin and Kelly, \u201cwho also said that she didn\u2019t recall that get-together or any others like it. In fact, she challenged Ford\u2019s accuracy. \u2018I don\u2019t have any confidence in the story,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nAll of this leaves many of us in exactly the same place as before. We should take charges like these very seriously. But it should not be possible to destroy a person\u2019s reputation on evidence so thin.\n\nWhy does the campaign to discredit Kavanaugh continue with such intensity? Some critics may be concerned about his views on campaign finance reform or the unitary executive. But the matter that provokes the most passion is abortion.\n\n\u201cWhen he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade,\u201d Ford\u2019s lawyer Debra Katz has said, \u201cwe will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important: it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d The goal, it seems, is to preemptively discredit an unfavorable court decision by putting what Katz describes as \u201can asterisk\u201d next to Kavanaugh\u2019s name.\n\nThis strategy is one indicator of the unhealthy focus of our entire political system on Roe v. Wade. Because it touches on the deepest issues of autonomy and human dignity, the legal status of abortion is crucial. The problem comes when we see all politics through the lens of one issue.\n\nMany on the right justify support for Trump because his corruption and dehumanization are less important than saving lives from abortion. But it is a theory without a limiting principle. It would justify voting for some pro-life politician who is a child molester. It would, quite literally, justify voting for a pro-life president who shot someone on Fifth Avenue.\n\nMany on the left rationalize using Trump-like tactics against someone like Kavanaugh on the theory that preserving Roe justifies any means. If you can\u2019t control the Supreme Court, trash it. Call the legitimacy of rulings by the court into question. The politics of personal destruction have merged with the politics of institutional destruction.\n\nBut not all roads lead to Roe. And opposing it, or preserving it, does not justify every method.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "description": "Americans shouldn\u2019t look at all politics through the lens of one issue.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson", "September At Pm", "Michael Gerson Is A Nationally Syndicated Columnist Who Appears Twice Weekly In The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xueLWQHKjs4q4LokoHto9OraDu4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CUNAGIG3EMI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
