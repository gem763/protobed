Some 8,000 officers, more than a quarter of the city\u2019s force, had to be deployed to tackle the protest.\n\nThe result she said was \u201ca less good service to the rest of London. Partly because people get tired and partly because we just had to slow down certain types of inquiries, certain types of investigations would just be done more slowly and some things won't ever be done at all.\"\n\nNo serious crime or 999 calls had been affected, said Ms Dick, but Detectives had been called in to cover some frontline duties and officers had been taken off neighbourhood and school patrols.\n\nPeople who contacted police over a minor incident had been told \u201cwe can\u2019t deal with that now and probably won\u2019t be able to do so for a while,\u201d she said.\n\nThe \u00a321 million included \u00a33.5 million for overtime, just under \u00a36 million for officers who were drafted in from 38 other forces in England and Wales, and \u00a311.8 million staffing costs.\n\nA total of 1,828 protestors were arrested, of whom 164 have so far been charged. In April 1,148 activists were held, of whom more than 900 were charged, mostly receiving a conditional discharge. Police recovered up to 80 tonnes of equipment, including tents and toilets, that will go to landfill.\n\nSenior officers have been in talks with ministers about potential changes to public order legislation since the action in April. These could include banning orders to stop activists who repeatedly protest unlawfully, and a new criminal offence of attaching items to the road.\n\nMs Dick said there was also a \u201cconversation to be had\u201d about tougher financial penalties or recouping the costs from the protestors. The Metropolitan Police will apply to the Home Office to cover the cost of the protest action.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protests cost \u00a321 million to police and led to other investigations being stalled and some policing \u201cnot done at all,\u201d Britain\u2019s most senior police officer has revealed.
