It seemed like the events of season three finally brought them past the point of no return, but stars Aimee Carrero and AJ Michalka say there\u2019s hope for them to come back together. Only one question: Will it involve the arrival of Horde Prime?\n\nCarrero, Michalka, and showrunner Noelle Stevenson sat down in Gizmodo's studio at New York Comic Con to discuss season four of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, which they announced was getting a new 13-episode season in November.\n\nSeason three ended with Adora seemingly cutting Catra out of her life, after Catra kidnapped her and opened the portal that led to Queen Angella\u2019s disappearance. After everything they\u2019ve been through, it seems like there\u2019s nowhere left for them to go. But both actresses say they\u2019re holding out hope for one of the fandom\u2019s favourite ships.\n\n\u201cI think Adora and Catra, they\u2019re bound to become friends again at some point, I hope. Because I feel like that\u2019s the foundation of what they\u2019ve built for years as kids,\u201d Carrero, who voices She-Ra/Adora, told Gizmodo. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet, and certainly not this season.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be unusual for this series to have Catra change her ways and join the Princess Alliance \u2014 or at least no longer stand in their way. Shadow Weaver\u2019s story arc last season involved her joining Adora\u2019s side as a way to stay close to her. Plus, we saw Catra nearly abandon the Horde while travelling the Crimson Waste, so we know she wants something else out of life.\n\nAs of now, the biggest thing that could bring Catra and Adora back together would be Horde Prime, who\u2019s tracked Hordak to Etheria and seems to be planning an invasion. I asked the actresses if Horde Prime\u2019s arrival could unite Catra and Adora against a common enemy. The response was... curious.\n\n\u201cI hope so. I mean, that\u2019s kind of what happened with Shadow Weaver,\u201d Michalka said.\n\n\u201cI mean who knows, we\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Carrero added. \u201cWe cannot say more.\u201d\n\nAimee Carrero (Adora): There\u2019s always hope. Never lose hope.\n\nAJ Michalka (Catra): Yeah especially for, like, friends. I think we have such a foundation. I think Adora and Catra, they\u2019re bound to become friends again at some point, I hope, because I feel like that\u2019s the foundation of what they\u2019ve built for years as kids.\n\nCarrero: They\u2019ve been through so much together. You almost have to have a rift in order to really kind of \u2014 when you do come back together, have it be meaningful. And having grown into adults, or whatever you\u2019re going to grow into, it almost makes it stronger. But we\u2019re not there yet, and certainly not this season.\n\nMichalka: No, at the top of season four we are sworn enemies.\n\nGizmodo: What does Catra love about Adora, and vice versa?\n\nMichalka: I think in a lot of ways Catra really admires Adora\u2019s determination. In some ways, Adora has been like this \u2014 I think as a kid, this is how I pictured it at least, was an inspiration to Catra. Like, I was always at the foot of her bed. In a way, she was my older sister, even though she was my best friend. And I think that I\u2019ve seen her determination and it\u2019s what\u2019s made, in some ways, Catra grow stronger with her villainy. Is that even a word?\n\nGizmodo: Yeah, I think so.\n\nCarrero: We just made it!\n\nMichalka: It is now. And I really think that it\u2019s kind of fed Catra\u2019s need to want to win but I also think it\u2019s what\u2019s made Catra be like, \u201cOh my gosh, I have something to fight for because she won\u2019t let up, just as much as I won\u2019t.\u201d So I think I see that, like, fellow determination and that bravery, and I think it really switches something on in Catra. I think she really respects it.\n\nCarrero: I think similarly, there\u2019s a mutual sort of admiration. But more than that there\u2019s like a mutual \u2014 at least on Adora\u2019s side \u2014 like, \u201cI see you and I actually see you. I know what\u2019s in your heart, despite\u2014\u201d I think Catra\u2019s someone you peel sort of like an onion, you know, and the fact that Adora gets to the heart of her is important.\n\nAnd I think, in the same way, [Catra] sees Adora as more than a perfectionist, really good at her job. She sees her. They both see each other in a way that\u2019s real and true, even in their worst moments. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much tension and so much electricity because they aren\u2019t fooling each other. They know who each other is \u2014 are? Anyway. And so I think that\u2019s maybe that she can see her, for real, who she is.\n\nGizmodo, to Noelle Stevenson: You ended season three on such a heartbreaking note for Catra and Adora. What\u2019s the aftermath of that been like, and how\u2019s it been like writing two characters that you want to see come back together so bad but they just can\u2019t?\n\nNoelle Stevenson: Yeah. It\u2019s so interesting because I love, you know, Adora and Catra\u2019s relationship. A lot of my episodes explore them in particular because I find them so compelling. The thing that\u2019s so tragic about them, I think, is that it\u2019s two people who care about each other very deeply and yet can\u2019t quite talk to each other.\n\nThey do know more about each other than anyone else in the world, and yet they never quite hear what the other is saying. We had that episode in season one where it\u2019s them trying to reconcile and they just make it worse.\n\nI think for someone like Catra, who\u2019s like \u2014 she won\u2019t let go of this hurt and she feels like the way to remedy that is to just rise as high as she can, take everything by force, and become so powerful that no one can break her heart again. That\u2019s not a trajectory that you can pull someone off of very easily. She has to kind of find her actual fulfillment for herself because I think the big question is: Does she really want power or does she want something else?\n\nAnd I think that Adora \u2014 even though she knows Catra and she sees her, she doesn\u2019t really understand her. And she doesn\u2019t know how to get through to her. And so she\u2019s been trying to reach her over the last few seasons and I think she\u2019s finally \u2014 I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s fully given up but she\u2019s trying to give up on Catra.", "description": "The heart of Netflix\u2019s She-Ra and the Princesses of Power is the relationship between Adora and Catra, two friends on opposite sides of a devastating war.
