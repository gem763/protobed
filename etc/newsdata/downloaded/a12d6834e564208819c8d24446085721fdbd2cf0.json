He tipped his cap in return.\n\nBefore the game, someone mentioned that Soto \u2014 now 21 \u2014 would be able to toast himself with champagne. He said yes, he could.\n\nIt's been one heck of a season for Soto. After batting .282 with 34 homers and 110 RBIs in the regular season, he helped the Nationals win the NL wild-card game with a clutch single against Milwaukee.\n\nSoto hit a key home run off Clayton Kershaw in the deciding Game 5 of the NL Championship Series win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He went 4 for 7 with two doubles and a home run in helping the Nationals take a 2-0 lead over the Houston Astros.\n\nSoto said his talk with Big Papi and A-Rod was productive, hearing advice from players who had already been in these big-game situations.\n\nBorn in the Dominican Republic, Soto said his upbringing made him the person he is today.\n\n\"Not just my father. My entire family has been incredible,\" he said.\n\nSoto said Washington faced \"a little less pressure\" at National Parks after winning the first two games of the Series in Houston, but insisted, \"We're going to keep playing the same game, playing hard.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Soto, the early stage of the game, played before a sellout crowd at Nationals Park, did not go his way.\n\nSoto grounded out with a runner in scoring position to end the first. He sailed a throw from left field over the catcher trying to get a runner at the plate in the second, and was charged with an error in the third when he fumbled a ball into the corner, allowing Jos\u00e9 Altuve to reach third base on a double.\n\nSoto became the first player to make an error on his birthday in the World Series since Atlanta shortstop Rafael Belliard in 1995.\n\nOnly one player, by the way, has hit a home run on his birthday in the Series: Willie Aikens for Kansas City in 1980.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
