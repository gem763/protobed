Photo: Getty Images, SplashNews\n\nGigi Hadid may not be ready to officially call Tyler Cameron her boyfriend, but she is, apparently, serious enough about their relationship to invite him to her grandmother\u2019s funeral abroad. Congrats to the couple on this major, albeit unfortunate, relationship milestone?\n\nOn Thursday, the Hadid family came together in Rotterdam to celebrate the life of Ands van den Henrik, Gigi\u2019s grandmother, who passed away at 78 after battling cancer. But the Hadids weren\u2019t the only ones present at the funeral: In photographs published by the Daily Mail, you can see that Gigi brought along the former Bachelorette star, whom she\u2019s only been dating for a month.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Isn\u2019t it a little soon to bring your partner of one month to a funeral? Especially to one that\u2019s abroad? Maybe! But things might be different when you\u2019re famous, who knows.\n\nSince Gigi and Cameron were first spotted together in early August, they\u2019ve been on six dates, including a mini-vacation upstate. Also, Hadid introduced Cameron to Serena Williams, which feels like another significant celebrity milestone. (And Bella just followed Cameron on Instagram!)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, it appears that moving quickly with your significant other is a trend in the Hadid family. According to Elle, Anwar, who has been dating singer Dua Lipa for two months, also brought her to the funeral. In fact, he even one-upped Gigi: According to the Sun, he and Dua Lipa are already thinking about moving in together.", "description": "Gigi Hadid reportedly took her rumored boyfriend, Tyler Cameron of \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d to her grandmother\u2019s funeral.", "authors": ["Amanda Arnold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/05/5-gigi-hadid-tyler-cameron.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
