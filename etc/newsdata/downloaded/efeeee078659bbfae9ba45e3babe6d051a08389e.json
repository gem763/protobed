These families became members of a club that no one wants to join: the millions of Americans whose lives have been forever altered by gun violence.\n\nEvery day, 100 Americans are shot and killed and hundreds more are wounded. These are more than mass shootings; in recent weeks, gun violence has devastated Chicago, Canoga Park, Newport News, Gilroy and Brooklyn, among others. This is a public health crisis that demands urgent action.\n\nAs leaders of some of America's most respected companies and those with significant business interests in the United States, we are writing to you because we have a responsibility and obligation to stand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country. Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety.\n\nGun violence in America is not inevitable; it's preventable. There are steps Congress can, and must, take to prevent and reduce gun violence. We need our lawmakers to support common sense gun laws that could prevent tragedies like these.\n\nThat's why we urge the Senate to stand with the American public and take action on gun safety by passing a bill to require background checks on all gun sales and a strong Red Flag law that would allow courts to issue life-saving extreme risk protection orders.\n\nBackground checks and Extreme Risk laws (also referred to as \"Red Flag laws\") are proven to save lives. Since Congress established the background check system 25 years ago, background checks have blocked more than 3.5 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers, including to convicted felons, domestic abusers, and people who have been involuntarily committed.\n\nHowever, in the decades since, the law requiring background checks on gun sales has not been updated to reflect how people buy guns today. The Senate must follow the House's lead by passing bipartisan legislation that would update the background checks law, helping to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them, in an effort to save lives. Background checks on all gun sales are a common-sense solution with overwhelming public support and are a critical step toward stemming the gun violence epidemic in this country .\n\nPerpetrators of mass shootings, school shootings, and hate crimes often display warning signs before committing violent acts. Additionally, people who end their life with a gun also often show signs that they are in crisis before they act. Interventions in states with Extreme Risk laws have already prevented potential tragedies. Expanding Extreme Risk laws to enable families and law enforcement nationwide to intervene when someone is at serious risk of hurting themselves or others is critical to preventing future tragedies.\n\nThese proposals are common-sense, bipartisan and widely supported by the American public. It is time for the Senate to take action.\n\nNOW WATCH: Here's what airlines legally owe you if you're bumped off a flight", "description": "\"We need our lawmakers to support common sense gun laws that could prevent tragedies,\" the letter said.", "authors": ["Will Martin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lsz2mIzQThJMmRxET_WCJA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MTc3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/4b98d2e4a1d77642312319b7d3cc8c9c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
