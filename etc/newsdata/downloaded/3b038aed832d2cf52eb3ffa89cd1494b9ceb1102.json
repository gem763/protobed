Sign up here.\n\nLin Songtian, China\u2019s ambassador to South Africa, took out a half-page advertisement in a key local newspaper to attack the stance of the U.S. and President Donald Trump on global trade.\n\nIn a paid-for editorial in Business Day, South Africa\u2019s biggest financial newspaper, Lin said bullying by the U.S. will drive the world into a \u201csevere recession\u201d and accused Trump of capriciousness.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese culture emphasizes that \u2018gentlemen keep their words.\u2019 Honoring the promises and commitments is the basic ethical code and requirement for state leaders and businessmen,\u201d he said in the advert titled \u2018Voice of China.\u2019 His comments were also published in the Star newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe president of the U.S. runs his country according to his own will, dictates the world through Twitter and changes his position overnight,\u201d Lin said.\n\nThe column, part of a drive by Beijing to have its ambassadors speak out globally, reflects the deteriorating relationship between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s flagship newspaper on Tuesday accused Trump adviser Peter Navarro of lying. A day earlier, Ted McKinney, the U.S. Agriculture Department\u2019s top trade official, called Chinese President Xi Jinping a \u201ccommunist zealot.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. embassy in South Africa declined to comment.\n\nTit-for-tat import tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China are roiling world markets and upending global trade patterns.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. insisting on escalating the trade frictions with China will harm the common interests of all people around the world and no one can escape,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThe U.S. clings to the winner takes all law of the jungle.\u201d\n\nActions by the U.S. are harming its own economy as China\u2019s technological companies will need to establish new supply chains and its agricultural goods importers are already finding other sources of crops such as soybeans, which are being acquired from Brazil, he said. Trump is damaging his reputation and that of his country, he added.\n\n\u201cEven God doesn\u2019t know what he will do tomorrow,\u201d Lin said. \u201cSuch a U.S. model of democracy has become the laughing stock of all people around the world.\u201d\n\n(Adds soybean buying in ninth paragraph)", "description": "China\u2019s Ambassador to South Africa Attacks Trump Over\u00a0Trade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picfd2dc844682c9f100849d6c904de4739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
