We're improving and we're learning,\" he said.\n\nThe hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, heaps pressure on a newly rejiggered Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX following the crashes, which killed 346 people.\n\n\"You have told me half-truths over and over again,\" Senator Tammy Duckworth told Muilenburg, questioning why the manufacturer did not disclose more details about MCAS's lack of safeguards.\n\nTaking turns to grill Muilenburg during his first appearance at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first crash in Indonesia, senators suggested Boeing had not been completely honest and expressed dismay that the 2016 instant messages did not prompt an immediate reaction from the company.\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \"safe plane safer.\" Tuesday's hearing represents Boeing's broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and family members had sought.\n\nFamily members were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony and were invited at one point to stand and show large photos of their loved ones.\n\nNadia Milleron, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, said Muilenburg and the board should resign for failing to do more to prevent the crashes.\n\nAs Muilenburg departed the hearing, she implored him to look at the victims' families when he apologized. He turned to her and said: \"I'm sorry.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Stephen Coates)", "description": "By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Boeing Co Chief  Executive Dennis Muilenburg will face a second day of questions  Wednesday from U.S....", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
