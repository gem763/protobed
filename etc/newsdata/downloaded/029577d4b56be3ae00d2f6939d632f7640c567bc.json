The overall process is achieved using two light absorbers, similar to the molecules in plants that harvest sunlight, which are combined with a catalyst made from cobalt.\n\nWhen in water, one light absorber uses the catalyst to produce oxygen, while the other carries out the chemical reaction that reduces carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, forming the syngas mixture.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the artificial leaf is able to work just as well on cloudy and overcast days.\n\n\u2018This means you are not limited to using this technology just in warm countries, or only operating the process during the summer months,\u2019 said Virgil Andrei, a PhD student and first author of the paper, published in the Nature Materials journal.\n\n\u2018You could use it from dawn until dusk, anywhere in the world.\u2019\n\nVirgil Andrei holding the artificial leaf (Chanon Pornrungrog/Cambridge University/PA Wire)\n\nHe added: \u2018We are aiming at sustainably creating products such as ethanol, which can readily be used as a fuel. It\u2019s challenging to produce it in one step from sunlight using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction.\n\n\u2018But we are confident that we are going in the right direction, and that we have the right catalysts, so we believe we will be able to produce a device that can demonstrate this process in the near future.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Reisner continued: \u2018What we\u2019d like to do next, instead of first making syngas and then converting it into liquid fuel, is to make the liquid fuel in one step from carbon dioxide and water.\n\n\u2018There is a major demand for liquid fuels to power heavy transport, shipping and aviation sustainably.\u2019", "description": "Leaf it to the pros", "authors": ["Metro Science Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90989859_1571738241.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
