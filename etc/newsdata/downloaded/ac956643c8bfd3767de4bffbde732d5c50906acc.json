He described their appearances \u2014 \u201cshe was pretty \u2026 she had a beautiful body on her,\u201d he said of a woman he killed in New Orleans \u2014 as well as the fields, canals and trash heaps where he left them. He also drew portraits of their faces.\n\nThe FBI says Little targeted mostly vulnerable women. Some were sex workers or drug users. Others were transgender. Their deaths may not have attracted much attention, and authorities often cited drug overdoses, accidents or natural causes as responsible. In some of the cases, the bodies were never found.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims,\u201d FBI crime analyst Christie Palazzolo said in a statement. \u201cEven though he is already in prison, the FBI believes it is important to seek justice for each victim \u2014 to close every case possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Gary Ridgway was thought to be the country\u2019s most prolific serial killer. Nicknamed the Green River Killer, he was convicted of 49 murders. Investigators say they have not found reason to doubt Little\u2019s claims of being responsible for 93 slayings. On top of the 50 confessions verified so far, the FBI said, there are \u201cmany more pending.\u201d\n\nLittle, who may have been born in jail while his mother was incarcerated, was raised by his grandmother in Ohio, according to the New York Times. A high school dropout and onetime competitive boxer, he spent much of his life crisscrossing the country, getting arrested repeatedly for crimes such as shoplifting, armed robbery, kidnapping and rape. In the 1980s, he was charged with killing women in Mississippi and Florida, the FBI said. But he escaped indictment in Mississippi and conviction in Florida.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2014 that Little was convicted of murder. He had been arrested at a Kentucky homeless shelter and extradited to California on a drug charge. While he was in custody, Los Angeles police detectives obtained a DNA match to three unsolved homicides from the late 1980s, in which women had been beaten and strangled. Little received three life sentences for those crimes.\n\nThe FBI began looking into his background and discovered \u201can alarming pattern and compelling links to many more murders.\u201d But Little insisted he was innocent \u2014 until Texas Ranger James Holland managed to win his trust. After that, the FBI said, \u201ca breathtaking number\u201d of confessions came pouring out. Little would stroke his face and look up as he pictured a victim, and then rattle off a detailed description, Holland told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you can tell he has this revolving carousel of victims, and it\u2019s just spinning, and he\u2019s waiting for it to stop at the one that he wants to talk about,\u201d the Texas Ranger said in a segment that aired Sunday.\n\nIn the videos the FBI released over the weekend, Little appeared to have no remorse and be excited as he talked about the killings. Wearing a gray skullcap and blue prison scrubs, he described a woman he thought was named Ruth. \u201cOh, man, I loved her,\u201d he said, and then described leaving her body in a cornfield in north Little Rock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said he gave a transgender woman named Marianne a ride to her apartment in Miami, where one of her roommates asked them to buy a can of shaving cream. \u201cThis opportunity popped up,\u201d Little said, smiling, and explained that he drove her out to the Everglades instead.\n\nDespite the many details Little recalls, he is not always clear on the dates of his crimes. The FBI said that \u2014 along with the victims he targeted, the methods he used and the frequency of his moves around the country \u2014 has created challenges in identifying victims.\n\nThose aspects also begin to explain, the FBI said, \u201chow he got away with murder for decades.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Samuel Little has confessed to killing 93 people.
