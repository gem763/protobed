This is only compounded by the criminal justice system and the civil justice system.\n\n\u201cPeople spend years going through litigation, ending up with nothing or next to nothing while constantly being retraumatised by having to relive the events again and again.\n\n\u201cCriminal compensation orders were made in 124,835 criminal cases in 2017. That year, despite 6,861 child sex abusers being convicted, only 26 criminal compensation orders were made for their victims.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In our investigation we found that the criminal and civil court proceedings for redress can be frustrating, hostile and ultimately futile.\n\n\u201cMany are left retraumatised and deeply unsatisfied with the often lengthy and confusing litigation. Equally concerning is the lack of clear signposting for the compensation and support which survivors could be entitled to.\u201d\n\nThe investigation considered five key case studies from the 1960s to the present day: North Wales children\u2019s homes; Forde Park school in Devon; St Leonard\u2019s children\u2019s home in London; St Aidan\u2019s and St Vincent\u2019s children\u2019s homes in Cheshire and Merseyside and Stanhope Castle school in County Durham.\n\nSurvivors of these institutions said when they attempted to seek compensation and a recognition of their abuser, the hostility they faced compounded the trauma they had already suffered as children.\n\nSome successfully proved their case on the facts but were ultimately turned down for compensation by defendants using the law of limitation, which puts a time limit on claims.\n\nThe inquiry heard testimony of how this is particularly cruel for victims of child sexual abuse, who may find it takes years to be able to talk about their abuse, especially when they had been ignored when originally coming forward.\n\nOne witness to the inquiry had a civil claim that lasted 12 years and involved two trials but was ultimately rejected on the basis it was brought too late.\n\nThe IICSA is still considering proposals to reform the law of limitation in civil proceedings to make it easier for survivors to bring civil claims for non-recent child sexual abuse.\n\nThis investigation by the inquiry looked at the notorious Forde Park secure school and home in Newton Abbot, which harboured a particularly sadistic paedophile ring before it closed in 1985.\n\nBoys at Forde Park, which was run by the Home Office under Devon County Council control, were subjected to horrendous physical and sexual abuse by staff emboldened by a Home Office which, the inquiry heard, permitted corporal punishment of children in such institutions.\n\nPersistent reports from survivors led to eight convictions related to Forde Park, with sentences ranging from six months to 18 years, including rape, grievous bodily harm and gross indecency.\n\nOne former pupil who testified to the inquiry is Paul Sinclair. \u201cThe civil justice system let us down more than the criminal side,\u201d he said today, reacting to the report.\n\n\u201cPersonally I received compensation of \u00a32,700,\u201d said Sinclair. \u201cThe compensation most people got was an insult. It was another devastating blow after what they had been through to be sent away with a few thousand pounds and no counselling or support.\u201d\n\nThe compensation Mr Sinclair received was typical of other Forde Park survivors we talked to, who endured horrific child abuse and left school denied a full education, with negligible qualifications and a legacy of abuse to deal with.\n\nMr Sinclair added: \u201cWe had to go and make our way through life failed by the legal system. We need redress for that.\u201d\n\nAnother Forde Park survivor, who testified anonymously to the inquiry, added: \u201cSurvivors were steamrollered by the council\u2019s lawyers. This just compounded our original abuse. It has been harrowing for all of us to testify at this inquiry. I would like to see more detailed recommendations for the civil justice system, and we all think reporting of suspicions of abuse going on should be mandatory for people who work with children, who should face the weight of the law if they fail to.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse was set up by Theresa May in 2014, following Jimmy Savile and other scandals revealing how victims of child abuse were let down by the authorities charged with protecting them.\n\nThe inquiry has been examining the extent to which institutions and organisations have failed to protect children in England and Wales from sexual abuse.", "description": "Child sex abuse victims are regularly denied compensation owed to them by perpetrators, an inquiry has concluded. Survivors of child sex abuse are often re-traumatised during what can be a \u201cfrustrating, hostile and ultimately futile\u201d legal battle for justice through the courts, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA)\u00a0found.
