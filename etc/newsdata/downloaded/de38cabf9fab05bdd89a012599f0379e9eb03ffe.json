But the disease was recently detected in East Timor, a near neighbor where Australian veterinarians are working with local authorities on an eradication plan.\n\nSniffer dogs now examine luggage on direct flights from the East Timorese capital Dili to the northern Australian city of Darwin to prevent contamination.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep our pest- and disease-free status as a country strong,\u201d McKenzie told reporters.\n\nAustralian border officials have seized 27 metric tons (30 U.S. tons) of cooked pork from luggage and parcels since February. The proportion of that smuggled meat contaminated with African swine fever had increased from 15% in February to 48% in September, McKenzie said.\n\nMargo Andrae, chief executive of industry promotion body Australian Pork Limited, said the greatest threat to the industry was if the disease took hold in Australia\u2019s wild pig population.\n\nAustralia has around 2.5 million domestic pigs while the feral herd was estimated to be five times larger.\n\nAndrae said the devastation to pig herds across Australia had created export opportunities for Australian pig farmers in markets including the Philippines and Singapore.\n\nBut she said Australia did not have pork trade arrangement with China, which McKenzie said faces a 10 million metric ton (11 million U.S. ton) annual \u201cprotein deficit\u201d due to African swine fever.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Australia for the first time has canceled a tourist's visa over undeclared food as the country tries to keep itself free of African swine fever.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rod Mcguirk"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
