At the time, Apple wasn't really working on content or video services, and was focused mostly on selling hardware, like iPhones and Macbooks.\n\nBe smart: While the 2 services are quite different and serve fundamentally separate purposes, both companies will likely compete against each other for subscription budgets, talent and content deals.\n\nThis isn't the first time executives have had to shuffle board slots to make way for the streaming wars.", "description": "Disney and Apple are expected to launch rival video streaming subscription services in November.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ERYULiValRSD3puctW4ux7-Ki9o=/0x0:1365x768/1920x1080/2019/09/13/1568413770851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
