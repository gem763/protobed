A sense of love and respect for European culture and civilisation of which we are a part. A desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything \u2013 creatively, artistically, intellectually.\n\n\u201cA sense of shared destiny. And a deep understanding of the eternal need, especially after the horrors of the last century, for Britain to stand as one of the guarantors of peace and democracy in our continent, and it is our continent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s precisely because we are capable of feeling both things at once, sceptical about the modes of EU integration as we are but passionate and enthusiastic about Europe.\u201d\n\nQ&A What does the 'Benn act' say? Show Hide The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson's government leaving the EU without a deal. It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal. If neither of those conditions are met \u2013 and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on 'super Saturday' \u2013 it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act. The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests. Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 Martin Belam\n\nHe praised his Brexit agreement, which allows for a significantly looser economic relationship with the EU than the deal negotiated by Theresa May, calling it \u201ca deal that can heal the rift in British politics. Unite the warring instincts in us all.\u201d\n\nHe stressed the UK\u2019s right to leave the EU customs union and single market and negotiate new free trade deals with non-EU countries. And he insisted the government had no intention of slashing the environmental standards or social protections that will no longer be guaranteed by law under the new deal.\n\nJohnson also dropped a heavy hint that he concedes he will be forced to request a Brexit delay if MPs defeat the government and pass a backbench amendment aimed at averting no deal.\n\nHe said there was \u201cvery little appetite\u201d in the EU to delay Brexit \u201cby one single day\u201d, urging MPs to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nProfile Who is Oliver Letwin? Show Hide The unlikely Brexit rebel Sir Oliver Letwin was born in London in 1956. He studied at Eton and then Trinity College, Cambridge, and first became a Conservative MP in 1997. However, his political career had started long before then, as he had served in Margaret Thatcher's policy unit from 1983 to 1986. The poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as \u201ca trailblazer for the real thing\u201d. In 2016 Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth after the 1985 riots would only end up in the \u201cdisco and drug trade\u201d. The memo, Letwin admitted, was \u201cbadly worded and wrong\u201d. Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had promised \u00a320bn of tax and spending cuts in an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party\u2019s manifesto at the time. In many respects, the best periods of Letwin\u2019s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron\u2019s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title. Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin\u2019s big idea, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it. Letwin has emerged as an unlikely Brexit rebel, going from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January 2019 when he voted with Labour to give Theresa May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down. \u201cMy right honourable friend Sir Nicholas Soames, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,\u201d Letwin said. A month later his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d the government \u201cwould prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal\u201d. It was, he added, \u201ca terrifying fact\u201d \u2013 and one he resolved to prevent. Ultimately it was to cost him his place in the Conservative party, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the whip from 21 Tory rebels including Letwin, as his Brexit plans were thwarted yet again. Dan Sabbagh Photograph: Hannah McKay/X03696\n\nBut in what appeared to be a signal that he was ready to write the letter mandated by the Benn act, he told MPs: \u201cWhatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, rejected Johnson\u2019s defence of his deal, saying it would \u201cfire the starting gun on a race to the bottom\u201d.\n\n\u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say. Labour is not prepared to sell out the communities we represent. We are not prepared to sell out their future. And we will not back this sell-out deal,\u201d he said.\n\nPlay Video 1:20 Jeremy Corbyn says PM's Brexit deal threatens jobs, rights and environment \u2013 video\n\nIt appears likely that MPs will pass Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment, withholding support from the Brexit deal until the relevant legislation \u2013 the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 has been passed.\n\nGovernment sources have suggested that if MPs inflict a defeat on Johnson by supporting the amendment, Conservative whips will effectively boycott the vote on the motion as amended, by sending MPs home.\n\nA No 10 spokesman said Johnson\u2019s focus was on winning the vote against the Letwin amendment \u2013 and suggested the rebel MPs\u2019 aim was not to provide for better scrutiny of the agreement, but to frustrate Brexit.\n\n\u201cI do think there is required a frankness from MPs about what this amendment is about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be clear to MPs thinking of voting for Letwin \u2013 it is more pointless delay.\u201d\n\nBrexit 'super Saturday': your guide to the big day Read more\n\nIf the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed to enact Brexit.\n\nThe vote would still be expected to take place, and the motion would pass, but it would not be the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d the government had hoped for. And it would trigger the requirements of the Benn act, forcing the government to request an extension to article 50.\n\nThere could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday \u2013 which government sources suggested could effectively become the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d denied Johnson on Saturday.\n\nThe spokesman added that the public would expect MPs to work all the hours available \u2013 potentially sitting late and through weekends \u2013 to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nIn the run-up to Saturday\u2019s session, the balance of support in parliament for Johnson\u2019s deal appeared too close to call, with most of the Eurosceptics who held out against May\u2019s deal three times saying they would support it, as well as several Labour MPs, including Sarah Champion and Melanie Onn.", "description": "PM appears to accept he would have to request delay if MPs pass amendment to avoid no deal", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0514b29afaf004b7f8f669ad2386228e0345b6ef/203_0_3094_1857/master/3094.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2febd0d1e69639f6c632b334e6468432", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
