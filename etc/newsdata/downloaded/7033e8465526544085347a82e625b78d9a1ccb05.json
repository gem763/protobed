The petitioner also alleges that this software update reduces the driving range of the affected vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe reported investigation follows Tesla\u2019s disappointing delivery results, which led the stock to close with a 4% loss on October 3.\n\nInvestors grow impatient with Tesla\n\nMark Tepper, CEO at Strategic Wealth Partners, said that the core issue of Tesla goes deeper than the quarterly sales miss, stating that the firm has a history of overpromising and under-delivering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be worth betting on anytime in the near future. What you have here is you have a company that\u2019s just quite frankly notorious for overpromising and under delivering, so there\u2019s absolutely no reason to own the stock right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe negative sentiment around the performance of Tesla in Q3 and the investigation of NHTSA into a claim that 2,000 vehicles should be recalled could intensify the pressure on the stock in the short term.\n\nAre there any positives?\n\nWhile most reports have been focused on the struggles of Tesla in recent quarters, the company has started to demonstrate progress in establishing a dominant brand in the European electric car market.\n\nAccording to Rai Vereniging, the Tesla Model 3 topped the auto sales chart in the Netherlands in 2019, selling 13,587 models. The VW Polo and Ford Focus fell behind at 9,684 and 8,606 vehicles, respectively.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Dan Levy, who offered a cautious stance towards Tesla, said that the company had seen improved manufacturing efficiency with better volume.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, mix was likely richer, volume was higher (i.e. better fixed cost absorption), and Tesla likely saw better manufacturing efficiency. Yet given the price reduction at the start of the third quarter, we see gross margin weakening,\u201d said Levy.\n\nTSLA shares last traded at $231.30.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tesla-elon-musk-stare-reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
