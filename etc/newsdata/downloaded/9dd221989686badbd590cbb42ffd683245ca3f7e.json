The two companies were engaged in a legal spat since 2017 over trade secrets that ended in June.\n\n\n\nAs the report details, in December 2017, Huawei brought a lawsuit against CNEX and a former employee, Yiren Huang, claiming theft of trade secrets. Huang created CNEX three days after leaving Huawei and filed several patent applications that were allegedly based on or related to the work he performed while being employed at Huawei.\n\nShortly after, CNEX actioned a counterclaim, saying Mao had asked for one of its circuit boards for a research project and that, after it sent the board to the professor, he used it for a study tied to Huawei.\n\nAs Reuters reported, the involved jury in June decided that neither Huawei nor CNEX were entitled to damages.\n\nHuawei is currently in a series of legal battles against the US government, including one where the company is suing the US for banning US federal agencies and their contractors from using Huawei equipment due to security concerns, claiming the ban is unconstitutional.\n\nMeanwhile, the US released a pair of indictments against Huawei at the start of the year, for allegedly misrepresenting Huawei's ownership and control of Iranian affiliate Skycom to banks -- which breached UN, US, and EU sanctions -- and allegedly stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile.\n\nThe company's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, is also set to attend court on January 20, 2020 to appeal the application for her to be extradited to the US. Meng was also indicted, along with Huawei, for allegedly misrepresenting Huawei's ownership and control of Iranian affiliate Skycom to banks.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "The telco equipment was detained for two years.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/17/817dc9a8-2f27-4627-aecc-9f4e52b8b514/thumbnail/770x578/64902cba7f530991aff0a0eeaa0cc1c1/190516-01-5g-r4-huawei-1-1-antenna.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
