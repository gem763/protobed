I was publishing something for people to read, and I wanted to make sure every word was perfect.\n\nTruth be told if I handed someone a copy of what I wrote the first hour I worked on a story and the finished product after a day of revising they probably wouldn\u2019t notice a huge difference. In fact, the 1-hour version was probably even better than the 8-hour one in a lot of cases.\n\nWhile there are certainly times where \u201cperfect\u201d is something you should strive for, a Fast Company article this week highlighted the fact that something it\u2019s better to strive for \u201cMostly Fine Decisions,\u201d AKA MFD\u2019s instead.\n\nThe concept is pretty simple: Striving for constant perfection slows you down. By shooting instead for \u201cfine\u201d you\u2019re lowering your expectations, and helping yourself move forward and be more productive.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t something you should apply to all aspects of your life, but if there\u2019s something that you routinely get stuck on or keep avoiding doing because you\u2019re afraid of failing, shooting for fine rather than perfect can help motivate you to get through it.\n\nThe idea here is to just make a decision that helps propel you forward. In the case of those stories that took me a day, I should have looked at them and thought about what I thought they needed to reach that \u201cperfect\u201d status. If there wasn\u2019t a good answer, then it\u2019s time to submit it.\n\nThe same can go for booking a flight, organising a room, or almost any other task you can think of. If you can\u2019t come up with a concrete answer why something isn\u2019t perfect now, then consider settling for near perfection and moving on.\n\nShooting for \u201cfine\u201d can be a solid procrastination killer, make you more productive, and maybe eliminate a little stress as well.", "description": "When I first started writing, a short 300-500-word story like this one would take me literal days to write.
