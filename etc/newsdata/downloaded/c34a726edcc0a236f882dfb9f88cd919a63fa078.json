The complaint is nine pages long and contains some redactions.\n\nMr Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe complaint begins: \u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressurising a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General [William] Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the complaint is the July 25 phone call between Mr Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the actor turned politician who became Ukraine\u2019s president in May.\n\nWe now know from a transcript released Wednesday that Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d Mr Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine, which the US president called \u201chorrible\u201d. The Bidens have always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCritics have said that action amounts to Mr Trump using his position of office to undermine a political rival, given Mr Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.\n\nMr Trump has denied any \u201cpressure\u201d was applied, saying the call was \u201cfriendly\u201d.\n\nThe complaint lays out allegations about how White House officials behaved after the call. It says that according to \u201cmultiple White House officials\u201d a transcript of the call was placed on a computer system that manages the National Security Council Directorate for Intelligence Programs.\n\nThat is a standalone computer system \u201creserved for codeword-level intelligence information\u201d such as covert action, according to the complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower claims that some White House officials voiced concern that this would \u201cbe an abuse of the system\u201d because the information was politically sensitive rather than being an issue of national security.", "description": "The White House sought to \"lock down\" all records of a call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president where he urged an investigation into political rival Joe Biden, a whistleblower has claimed.
