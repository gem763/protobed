He spent three years capturing the most intimate moments of their everyday lives, forming a close circle of trust. But when the film found a distributor Berg\u00e9 insisted the footage never be seen, despite not having seen any of it himself.\n\nIn 2015, two years before his death, Berg\u00e9 finally gave permission for it to be shown and now, nearly two decades after filming was wrapped up, 11 years after Saint-Laurent died, Yves Saint-Laurent: The Last Collections will be released in cinemas this week. Despite what he calls an \u201cugly fight\u201d, Meyrou insists there is no bad blood.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote to him to tell him we had a distributor in 2005, he opposed it completely,\u201d Meyrou said of the film, which features footage filmed between 1998 and 2001 around the time that Saint-Laurent, then in his early 60s, was becoming increasingly reclusive and reliant on Berg\u00e9, the co-founder and business mastermind of the brand.\n\n\u201cBerg\u00e9 was a very powerful figure in the French system and he was scary to a lot of people. I was disappointed, but I didn\u2019t want to struggle with them to release it. That wasn\u2019t the philosophy of the film.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yves Saint-Laurent with Pierre Berg\u00e9 at a press conference in Paris in 2002.

But the director couldn\u2019t bring himself to attend. \u201cI was mad at him for 15 years. He pretended that I never did a film with them, that it was just for my personal archives. It was an ugly fight because it\u2019s so easy to pick on someone who is weaker than you are.\n\n\u201cWhen he asked to see the film, I said it\u2019s not because a billionaire is going to ask me to see the film that I come. Now that\u2019s a regret. The smart human thing would have been to go there and discuss it with him, but I was still hurt.\u201d\n\nMeyrou believes that Berg\u00e9 asked him to film the pair at work in the first place because he \u201cknew he would be important in that film, more than if we had shot that film 20 years earlier\u201d. When it came to its release, however, the same control became the obstacle. \u201cEven though he was completely free during shooting, I don\u2019t think he understood what documentaries were about,\u201d said Meyrou.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really close to someone for a long time, but at some point you do your own film. He wasn\u2019t used to that, because he was a man used to control.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A scene from the film.\n\nThe way control played out between Saint-Laurent and Berg\u00e9 in their relationship is a central theme to the film and one delicately depicted. While most of Saint-Laurent\u2019s daily life appears to be managed by Berg\u00e9, in a scene in which Saint-Laurent insists a particular model wears a particular dress for a show at the last minute, Berg\u00e9 reworks the line-up to make it happen. Meyrou says this respect was the most important element to convey. \u201cIt\u2019s actually why I like him today. Berg\u00e9 had a really big ego, but for 40 years he accepted that he was behind YSL and I think that\u2019s love. That\u2019s beautiful. He\u2019s not a bad guy.\u201d\n\nThis will be the first time many will have seen such closely shot footage of the designer in the last decade of his life.\n\n\u201cSome people are going to get very disturbed because Yves is old. It was a beautiful time, because you had the feeling that he was getting weaker but the house he had created 40 years earlier was supporting him,\u201d said Meyrou, recalling a scene where Saint-Laurent is stumbling on the stairs. \u201cYou could feel his suffering.\u201d\n\nTwenty years after it was filmed, Meyrou believes Yves Saint-Laurent: The Last Collections (or C\u00e9l\u00e9bration, as it has been released in the US) has been through a metamorphosis. \u201cWhen we had to restore the film it was a weird feeling. I did a contemporary documentary film, but now it is more like a testimony of an era that doesn\u2019t exist any longer. I never shot this. It took me some time to understand.\u201d", "description": "The designer and his partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 are seen at the height of their success, but permission to screen it was refused", "authors": ["Scarlett Conlon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5f8c99958a72ad46fbde8ff2f501b7d5cef1a8/0_177_1900_1140/master/1900.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=87bc38676ac4e7224b14f206290ede97", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
