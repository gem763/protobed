But I had a bit of a day.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly who she just broke up with. She\u2019s previously hinted that she was dating the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman, who is an IRL billionaire, so who fucking knows anymore. But regardless, it\u2019s over and our queen is single and ready to mingle.\n\nLinds has quite the epic dating resume, that In Touch magazine published back in 2013 in the form of a leaked scattergories \u201cfuck list\u201d. Lindsay\u2019s impressive list allegedly includes Ashton Kutcher, Evan Peters, Zac Efron, James Franco, Justin Timberlake and Aaron Carter among countless other celebs. Heck, she\u2019s even claimed to have done le fucc with Colin Farrell.\n\nMore recently, she tried to shoot her shot with the Hemsworth brothers in the comments section of an E! News Instagram post. So clearly, she\u2019s in the market for an Aussie hunk.\n\nAnd perhaps even more fittingly, Lohan has scored herself a hosting gig on Channel 10\u2019s The Masked Singer, so she\u2019s already in the good books with the TV executives.\n\nSo, Channel 10, this is my formal request to make Lindsay Lohan the Bachelorette. We don\u2019t need the Gogglebox girl and her weird spy brother, we want a Lohan season. Give the people what they want.\n\nBut I know I can\u2019t just request such a thing and expect it to happen. So I\u2019ve compiled a list of why I think Lindsay Lohan would make for the best damn Bachelorette we\u2019ve ever seen. Obviously, there are unlimited reasons why LiLo would make a great Bachelorette, but I\u2019ve tried to narrow it down for you.\n\n1. She\u2019s already in Australia\n\nLinds is already in Australia for The Masked Singer (a Network 10 production), so why not double up on the reality TV gigs and get her on The Bachelor as well? Georgia Love was a Network 10 employee (WIN News), so it\u2019s not exactly a revolutionary idea.\n\n2. She\u2019s a woman who knows what she wants\n\nAbbie was a woman who knew what she wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to express her sexuality, and it made for some SPICY television. And Lindsay is no different. She\u2019s already disclosed her fuck list, so the boys would know what she\u2019s looking for (rich, famous and hot, basically).\n\n3. Australians lose their shit over the celebrity factor\n\nWe had Sophie Monk, we had Honey Badger, so why not up the ante a little bit with an international celebrity? We all grew up watching Lindsay Lohan. We\u2019ve seen her rise, and her fall, and her reality TV rise, so you know we\u2019d be glued to our TVs if she was the Bachelorette.\n\n4. I just want to see a bunch of grown men grovel at Lindsay Lohan\u2019s feet and treat her like the kween she is.\n\nI\u2019ve loved Lindsay Lohan for as long as I can remember. For context, I had the Lindsay Lohan My Scene doll back in 2005 and treasured it like it was the Rosetta Stone. She\u2019s had her moments, which is expected for anyone who was thrown into the limelight as a child. But honestly, Lindsay Lohan is an ICON, and I will love her and want the best for her until the day I die. I think we\u2019d all thoroughly enjoy watching her find the love of her life, then yeeting him into the bin to fuck a Hemsworth brother.\n\n5. She has a type, and it\u2019s hot, Hemsworth-looking Australian men.\n\nThe late, great Heath Ledger was on her 2013 list, and she\u2019s more recently tried her luck with the Hemsworth brothers, so it\u2019s pretty clear that the Aussie accent does something for her. So why not chuck a bunch of Hemsworth-looking dudes in a mansion and have Lindsay take her pick? After all the shit she\u2019s been through in her life, she deserves to have a selection of men served to her on a silver platter.\n\n6. The rose ceremonies would be EVERYTHING.\n\nYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nYour move, Network 10. You know what to do.", "description": "Lindsay Lohan is officially single and she would make an excellent candidate for the next season of 'The Bachelorette' Australia.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1057304968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
