The most common reason was to alleviate fatigue with 64.6 percent, followed by their taste with 21.5 percent.\n\nAs many as half of all Korean high schoolers could be suffering side effects from caffeinated energy drinks such as heart palpitations, insomnia and even death, according to a small-scale study.\n\nSome 50.6 percent said they experienced side effects such as heart palpitations, insomnia, headache, dizziness and trembling hands.\n\nGirls suffered more side effects than boys because their physique tends to be smaller.\n\nProfessor Seo Hee-sun at Gachon University Gil Hospital said, \"The brains of adolescents are not as developed as those of adults, and they weigh less, so they are more likely to get hooked on caffeine. But caffeine doesn\u2019t remove the causes of fatigue in the body. It merely overrides them for a while, so dependency makes people more tired later.\"\n\nSeveral U.S. states ban underage consumers from buying energy drinks, but in Korea they are freely available in any convenience store.", "description": "Half of High Schoolers Suffer Side Effects from Energy Drinks", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/29/2019102901207_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
