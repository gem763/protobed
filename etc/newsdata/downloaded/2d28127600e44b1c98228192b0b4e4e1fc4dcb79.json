Do we stand up for the First Amendment or do we allow ourselves to be silenced? Do we defend the right to bear arms or do we allow ourselves to be disarmed? Do we stand up for the unborn or do we turn a blind eye to a modern-day genocide?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Christians to stand for their faith,\u201d evangelist Franklin Graham said on the Fox Nation special, Todd Starnes: Culture Jihad.\n\nSocialism is on the rise. The Bill of Rights is under assault. People of faith are facing persecution. Gun owners are in the crosshairs. And our public schools have been turned into anti-American indoctrination centers.\n\nA leftist mob made up of socialist politicians, academic elites, raging feminists and basement dwelling pajama boys has partnered with Antifa, illegal aliens and other radical groups to finish what President Obama started \u2013 a fundamental transformation of our nation.\n\n\u201cThe soul of our nation is at stake right now,\u201d Dr. Robert Jeffress said on my Fox Nation special. \u201cI believe that if the left ever seizes control of the White House again \u2013 and both chambers of Congress \u2013 it is not going to be incremental change, it is going to be a radical change.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence sounded the alarm during his 2019 commencement address at Liberty University.\n\n\u201cThroughout most of American history, it\u2019s been pretty easy to call yourself Christian,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even occur to people that you might be shunned or ridiculed for defending the teachings of the Bible.\u201d\n\nThe vice president was widely ridiculed for his stark assessment of the state of Christianity in America. But the truth is in recent years Christians have faced unrelenting attacks in the public marketplace from secularists and the sex and gender revolutionaries.\n\nAs the vice president so rightly said - some of the loudest voices for tolerance have little tolerance for traditional Christian beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, we live in a time when the freedom of religion is under assault. We live in a time when it\u2019s become acceptable and even fashionable to ridicule and even discriminate against people of faith,\u201d the vice president told the assembled crowd.\n\nI wrote Culture Jihad because I love America and I love freedom. And over the past decade I\u2019ve seen those freedoms fade away. I chronicle modern day efforts to ban books like \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" and \"Little House on the Prairie.\" I document crusades to ban patriotic songs and statues honoring our Founding Fathers. I tell stories about Catholic farmers banned from selling produce at a local market and judicial nominees interrogated on Capitol Hill because of their Christian faith.\n\n\u201cIt is a jihad against a people who have traditional values,\u201d former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said on the Fox Nation Todd Starnes: Culture Jihad special. \u201cNo longer are we a people who have a traditional view, or a conservative view, or a Christian view. We are people who have a view that is utterly unacceptable in today\u2019s culture.\u201d\n\nCulture Jihad is not meant to be a book about our nation\u2019s demise. It\u2019s about hope\u2014hope for a better future. And I still have hope \u2013 because my hope is not built on a political party \u2013 my hope is built on an everlasting faith.\n\nWe must be men and women of courage. It is imperative that gun-toting, Bible-clinging patriots rise up with a mighty voice and declare that this Great American Experiment is worth saving.\n\nConsider this your call to arms, happy warriors. We are tasked with defending a noble cause and a noble faith. Sure, we\u2019ve taken more than a few sucker punches and the enemies of freedom have us surrounded. No doubt that our numbers are dwindling, but we are still in the fight. Because we are Americans.\n\nOn July 2, 1776, George Washington delivered this bold challenge to his fellow countrymen:\n\n\u201cThe fate of the unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army. Let us, therefore, rely upon the goodness of the cause and the aid of the Supreme Being, in whose hands victory, is, to animate and encourage us to great and noble actions.\u201d\n\nI hope you and your family will read Culture Jihad and consider the cause. Onward to great and noble actions, my fellow countrymen.", "description": "On Election Day in 2020, Americans will stand at a .09/24/2019 9:31:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/238/a5175494-7871-460b-88fb-de05574e6875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
