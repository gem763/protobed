There was Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland following Mulvaney\u2019s lead in tying a meeting to new investigations at a July 10 meeting, as reported by a former administration official. There was Trump himself in his July 25 call with Zelensky, responding to Zelensky\u2019s mention of buying weapons with a request for a favor: investigating a theory Trump has embraced about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee three years ago.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat was just through the end of the July. We identified eight other possible links or expressed concerns through the middle of last month.\n\nSo when Mulvaney said Thursday that military and economic aid to Ukraine was withheld in part because of \u201ccorruption related to the DNC server,\u201d it wasn\u2019t a stunning revelation but a stunning admission. An admission that seemed as if it might even be calibrated to undercut concerns central to the impeachment inquiry hanging over the White House: Arguing that the DNC server issue was the predicate for the aid being halted meant that the predicate wasn\u2019t that investigation into Biden. Meaning that maybe the White House could undercut allegations of Trump\u2019s having violated campaign finance law by seeking information central to the 2020 race from a foreign power.\n\nIf that was the goal, it didn\u2019t work. Mulvaney\u2019s admission simply served to undercut the \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d claims that had been a key part of Trump\u2019s defense. Mulvaney tried to argue a few hours later that he had never used the term \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d as though that was somehow exculpatory, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have convinced anyone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, he gave it another go. Appearing on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d with host Chris Wallace, Mulvaney was pressed to explain his clumsy rationalization for the halting of the aid.\n\n\u201cThere were two reasons that we held up the aid,\u201d Mulvaney said: corruption concerns and funding from foreign countries. When the White House was satisfied that other countries were giving aid to Ukraine, the aid was released. That this decision occurred on Sept. 11, shortly before the whistleblower complaint centered on Ukraine came to light, was simply a coincidence.\n\nIn the news conference, Mulvaney identified that DNC investigation as a third reason. In fact, it\u2019s the reason he most directly linked to withholding the aid. Wallace pointed this out, playing that portion of Mulvaney\u2019s news conference.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned [to me from time to time] about the DNC server,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cHe had mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly. He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call, but it wasn\u2019t connected to the aid.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not actually true. Zelensky mentioned aid in the form of Ukraine buying U.S. antitank missiles. Trump responded by saying he needed a \u201cfavor, though\u201d \u2014 referring to that investigation into the DNC server.\n\nAn \u201cinvestigation into the DNC server\u201d is what we\u2019re calling it, but it\u2019s actually less straightforward than that phrase would suggest. Trump and his allies are looking for evidence that would undermine the origins of the investigation into Russian interference \u2014 a probe that eventually included assessments of how Trump\u2019s own campaign might have been involved. That investigation was a focus of much of Trump\u2019s first two years in office and a source of constant irritation for Trump. He has long embraced theories that the investigation was initiated unfairly he has sought to bolster his argument that he was wrongfully targeted by investigators.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIncidentally, the theory with the server is that, what? Maybe assessments that the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC network were wrong? Or maybe somehow influenced by a four-degrees-away relationship between a rich Ukrainian and an American company? There\u2019s nothing demonstrably substantive to the claim, which is itself curious. What did Trump think he would get? Or, more disconcertingly, what might the Ukrainians want to provide in order to make him happy?\n\n\u201cIt is legitimate for the president to want to know what\u2019s going on with the ongoing investigation into the server,\u201d Mulvaney told Wallace. \u201cEverybody acknowledges that \u2014 at least I think most normal people do. It\u2019s completely legitimate to ask about that.\u201d\n\nHere is the 29-page indictment returned against 12 Russian nationals by then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s office in July 2018. The DNC hacking has been investigated thoroughly. The \u201congoing investigation into the server\u201d is a phrase meant to gloss over the fact that the hacking has been thoroughly investigated and attributed to Russia but that Trump nonetheless is hoping to dig up some politically useful reasonable doubt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney\u2019s ongoing defenses of his Thursday admission amount to little more than semantic games. He said what he said on Thursday \u2014 even, at one point, saying: \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBut he did not say \u201cquid pro quo\u201d!\n\nWhen Wallace noted that Trump's call with Zelensky included a request for a favor and an ask that Ukraine investigate Biden, Mulvaney seized on the point.\n\n\u201cYou said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens. Go look at the transcript of the phone conversation,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cIt\u2019s, do me a favor, take a look at the DNC server. Then he talks about corruption in the Ukraine.\"\n\nGotcha, Chris Wallace. You said that Trump responded to Zelensky's mention of aid by asking for the favor of looking at Biden when really Trump said he wanted the favor of investigating the DNC hacking.\n\nWhich, again, is the quid pro quo that Mulvaney identified on Thursday.\n\nAD", "description": "The acting White House chief of staff's ongoing defenses of his Thursday admission amount to little more than semantic games.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OF3opMJDfUBhqtB9xIXbJHyqN3A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SOHXQUXT44I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
