But they were reportedly repeatedly interrupted by Woodward\u2014with questions that left the audience at once outraged and baffled.\n\n\u201cTomorrow there will be stories about how horribly Bob Woodward bombed this discussion. Repeatedly asked why Harvey Weinstein did what he did. The authors responded, multiple times: power. He accused them of dodging the question,\u201d ProPublica reporter J. David McShane tweeted.\n\nReporter Kara Swisher, the co-founder of Recode, described Woodward\u2019s behavior during the discussion as \u201cinterruptive, not focused on the women who were victimized by Harvey Weinstein and weirdly obsessed with that creep, it\u2019s a exercise in how not to interview.\u201d\n\nRobyn Swirling, the founder of Works in Progress, an organization that aims to confront sexual harassment in progressive spaces, wrote a tweet thread detailing the audience\u2019s frustration with Woodward, who she said repeatedly failed to let Kantor and Twohey speak.\n\nOn the topic of Weinstein, the Woodward reportedly preferred to focus on the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s motives rather what his alleged victims endured.\n\n\u201cShowing exactly why he was the wrong person to have any sort of public (or private) discussion about #metoo,\u201d Swirling wrote, Woodward repeatedly asked Kantor and Twohey why Weinstein allegedly preyed on so many young women. When they answered that they believed it was about power, Woodward reportedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s about sex also though, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe audience repeatedly booed him, though Woodward, apparently undaunted, went on to claim Weinstein\u2019s behavior constituted a \u201cweird foreplay,\u201d Swirling tweeted.\n\nLater in the discussion, he reportedly asked Kantor and Twohey, \u201cDid you find any women who made up allegations? That\u2019s very important\u201d before asking them if they believed Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations were credible enough to be published.\n\nKantor and Twohey exposed decades of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein in a bombshell New York Times report in late 2017, sparking a reckoning of sorts in Hollywood, Weinstein\u2019s downfall, and the rise of the #MeToo movement.\n\nWeinstein, who has been accused of sexual abuse and misconduct by dozens of women, faces a sexual assault trial in New York in January.", "description": "The investigative reporter repeatedly interrupted Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and reportedly suggested Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged abuse was just \u201cweird foreplay.\u201d", "authors": ["Allison Quinn", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_162/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570075754/GettyImages-1032379602_zb5giq"}
