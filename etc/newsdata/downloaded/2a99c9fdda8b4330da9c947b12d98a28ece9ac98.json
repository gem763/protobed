European captain Padraig Harrington says he checked out the location of the team room and even some of the bedrooms where his players will not get enough sleep.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed the detail that goes in behind the scenes,\u201d Harrington said.\n\nAmazed probably isn\u2019t the right word.\n\nThe idea was to get everyone talking - or at least thinking - about the Ryder Cup at a time when the Presidents Cup is still five weeks away from finalizing its teams. Europeans won\u2019t care about that and some Americans won\u2019t either, especially since the one-sided matches will finish 10 days before Christmas in Australia.\n\nIn the rearview mirror is the Solheim Cup, which was decided by the final putt of the final match on the course.\n\nRandall Mell of Golf Channel wrote a column celebrating the most exciting Solheim Cup since it began in 1990, while suggesting with cold, hard facts how the Americans and Europeans could build on the momentum by winning LPGA Tour events. Americans and Europeans have combined to win four LPGA events this year, on track for their lowest output ever.\n\nThis was greeted by a tweet from Lizette Salas - not among those four - scolding him for being a buzz kill \u201cafter we worked our (tails) off for two years,\u201d which had nothing to do with the facts presented and the hope that it can change over the last two months of the season.\n\nFor better or worse, there is endless chatter and promotion about the cups, some more than others.\n\nThey are different. They are fun.\n\nThey rarely lack for drama or passion, at least when it involves Europe against the United States.\n\nThe Presidents Cup is the youngest of the three cups and is not there yet. Only four of the 12 times has it been decided at the very end, though matches in South Africa and South Korea showed potential. The one in South Africa was declared a tie after Tiger Woods and Ernie Els halved three holes of a playoff in pressure that, under the circumstances, rivaled the Ryder Cup.\n\nWoods said it was \u201cone of the most nerve-wracking moments I\u2019ve ever had in golf,\u201d which prompted this response from Robert Allenby: \u201cThank God.\u201d\n\nAfter watching Ryder Cup highlights during the Whistling Straits media day, someone asked the normally stoic Stricker about some of his celebrations, and he looked almost embarrassed.\n\n\u201cIt brings out some crazy emotions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery time you have a Ryder Cup, it throws up something dramatic and exciting,\u201d Harrington added. \u201cIt never ceases to keep giving.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true as long as golf is being played. For the Ryder Cup, that lasts only three days every two years.\n\nOne year out, the only competition was a 14-club challenge on the par-3 17th hole along Lake Michigan. Otherwise, there was nothing to be gleaned that the captains had not already said.\n\nHarrington spoke first and was asked to comment on what worked so well for Europe in a resounding victory a year earlier in France. \u201cYou really want me to give you all the answers to what worked?\u201d the Irishman replied.\n\nStricker, the favorite son of Wisconsin golf, was an assistant captain in 2016 - a rare American victory - and was asked what he could bring from that experience to a Whistling Straits course nothing like Hazeltine.\n\nThere were no secrets. Stricker said Europe likes thick rough and slow greens. Americans prefer light rough and fast greens.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t give us much, did he?\u201d Harrington said.\n\nOne reporter from Scotland might have been onto something when he noticed that Stricker, while talking about the \u201cmainstays\u201d on the U.S. team, left out Woods and Phil Mickelson. Stricker killed that headline by saying it was an oversight, that Woods (who has had nine surgeries) and Mickelson (who turns 50 next year) are capable of making the team. In fact, he expects Woods to be playing as Presidents Cup captain in Australia.\n\nThat means Woods picks himself over whom?\n\nThere are five tournaments before Woods and International captain Ernie Els make their picks. Cameron Champ and his sublime power game get attention after winning the Safeway Open. So do Joaquin Niemann of Chile and Sebastian Munoz of Colombia for the International side. They won the other two PGA Tour events.\n\nIf nothing else, it keeps the Presidents Cup in the conversation until Woods decides whether to play.\n\nWith cups, that\u2019s not hard to do.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The next Ryder Cup starts in 360 days, the perfect occasion for the opposing captains to meet Tuesday at Whistling Straits and share absolutely nothing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Ferguson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/on_the_fringe_golf_35695_c0-106-5146-3106_s1770x1032.jpg?120df8fe5212a6edb97e64072a829b24b5dca658", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
