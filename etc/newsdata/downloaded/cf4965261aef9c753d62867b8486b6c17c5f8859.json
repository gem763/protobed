The reply from protesters and even pro-government officials was swift and sharp: Too little, too late.\n\nThe dueling messages \u2014 an olive branch from Lam and a rebuff from opponents \u2014 suggest little hope for a breakthrough to ease the increasingly violent confrontations playing out on Hong Kong\u2019s streets.\n\nThat is because the protests have gone far beyond the now-dead bill to allow extradition to mainland China. The dissent has grown into a broad base that includes shopkeepers, civil servants, students and others fearing that Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and special status within China are in jeopardy.\n\nAnd Lam\u2019s move was widely seen as falling short on many fronts \u2014 including failing to address the deep concerns over the expanding use of force by riot police.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from Lam\u2019s cabinet say their hands are tied in doing much more. That will probably extend the tumult ahead of Oct. 1 events to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n[First day of school brings class boycotts and more rallies]\n\nProtesters have threatened huge demonstrations in Hong Kong to mark the day \u2014 which could be a major embarrassment to China\u2019s state-run celebrations.\n\n\u201cWe should all think deeply whether escalating violence and disturbances is the answer,\u201d Lam said in her speech Wednesday before announcing four steps that she would take to kick-start a dialogue with the public, notably a full withdrawal of the extradition bill. That process will start once the legislature meets again in October, Lam added.\n\nBut some groups quickly turned their backs on the offer.\n\nSeveral protest leaders \u2014 in masks and hard hats \u2014 held their own news conference and called Lam\u2019s moves insufficient.\n\nSince spring, the demonstrations have grown into a general revolt against China\u2019s hand in Hong Kong affairs. Protesters fear that Beijing plans to further roll back Hong Kong\u2019s political and social openness under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d accord in which Britain handed back control in 1997.\n\nBut protesters also have set a specific five-point list that includes a long-held aspiration to allow Hong Kong voters a direct say in electing their leaders. Lam has addressed just one \u2014 and perhaps the easiest \u2014 of the five demands.\n\nAs her address played on social media, a flood of comments coming in said: \u201cFive demands! Not one less!\u201d\n\n\u201cHong Kongers will not be satisfied by a partial victory, and our thirst for freedom and justice will not be quenched,\u201d said one of the masked protesters at the news conference. \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d is not a slogan, she added, but a \u201cjoint consensus.\u201d\n\nLam stopped short of announcing a fully independent investigation into the upheavals, including the police\u2019s response and use of force. Police have arrested almost 1,200 people on protest-related charges.\n\nProtesters also want amnesty for those arrested. The Hong Kong police have been the only authority tasked with suppressing the protests and related violence, despite threats of military intervention from Beijing.\n\n[In once-quiet neighborhood, lives upended as protests find new ground]\n\nAfter meeting with her cabinet, pro-Beijing lawmakers and others in the government, Lam said in a televised address that the clashes have \u201cshocked and saddened people.\u201d\n\nHer other steps included beefing up Hong Kong\u2019s independent police watchdog, known as the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), and ordering it to look into the force\u2019s handling of protests and organized-crime-linked attacks against protesters in July.\n\nLam said she would also reach out to the community to start a \u201cdirect dialogue\u201d with people and task experts, including academics, to independently \u201cexamine and review society\u2019s deep-seated problems and to advise the government on finding solutions.\u201d\n\nProtesters deeply distrust the IPCC, which is headed by the former chairman of the city\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission, Anthony Francis Neoh, who was appointed to the top position by Lam in 2018.\n\nProtesters believe that the body, which monitors and reviews complaints against members of the Hong Kong police, is stacked with Lam loyalists and cannot be impartial. The body is also unable to summon witnesses.\n\nIt was the possibility of being extradited to face the justice system in mainland China that sparked the massive demonstrations. Lam had previously announced that she would suspend work on the bill and later termed it \u201cdead,\u201d but protesters wanted it completely withdrawn, fearing she could restart it later in her term.\n\n\n\nRegina Ip, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s Executive Council and a pro-Beijing lawmaker, said she believes Lam has responded to a \u201ccenterpiece\u201d demand from protesters.\n\n\u201cThere are no more concessions we can make,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI hope people can recognize that our government is working hard to meet the aspirations of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nProtesters gather during a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong\u2019s Tamar Park on Tuesday. (Vincent Yu/AP)\n\nMichael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who also serves as a Hong Kong delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress in China, said resistance to concessions has come in part from Beijing, which is concerned \u201cit will send a signal to everybody in Hong Kong that the baby who cries the most will get the milk.\u201d\n\nHe added that while fully withdrawing the bill was the \u201cright thing\u201d to do, it was probably too late to have an impact.\n\n\u201cThe focus since the beginning of July has completely shifted now to the confrontation between police and rioters and how the public perceives it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public is totally polarized, but it is no longer about the extradition bill.\u201d\n\nTien added that if grievances between the police and the public are not addressed, \u201cpeople are going to be carrying around this hatred for many years.\u201d\n\nLam, those familiar with her thinking say, fears a negative response from the police force if she were to open such an investigation.\n\n[With Hong Kong in turmoil, questions grow over leader\u2019s refusal to offer concessions to protesters]\n\nPolitical crises have erupted periodically in the semiautonomous territory, however, over fears that the Chinese government is seeking to exercise greater control, most recently in 2014 when Beijing rejected full universal suffrage for Hong Kong.\n\nProtests have taken on an increasingly anti-Chinese flavor \u2014 the national emblem has been defaced, the Chinese flag flung into Victoria Harbor and other symbols of Beijing\u2019s control targeted.\n\nOn Telegram, the encrypted messaging app used by protesters to help organize demonstrations, Lam\u2019s decision was met with resistance and anger. Some forwarded a quote from \u201cWinter on Fire,\u201d a documentary film about Ukraine\u2019s 2014 anti-government protests: \u201cIf we accept the government\u2019s demands, those who have died will not forgive us.\u201d\n\nHong Kong stocks surged on the reports that the bill would be formally withdrawn, closing up nearly 4 percent.\n\nSome fear, however, that the crisis has fundamentally eroded business confidence in Hong Kong and revealed the extent of Beijing\u2019s ability to pressure even multinational corporations in the city.\n\n\n\nCathay Pacific Group Chairman John Slosar attends a news conference in March 2018 on the carrier\u2019s annual results in Hong Kong. (Bobby Yip/Reuters)\n\nThe most glaring example is the upheaval and panic at Cathay Pacific, whose chief executive was effectively pushed out over concerns from China that the airline had not done enough to keep its staff from supporting the protests. On Wednesday, the airline announced that its chairman, John Slosar, had resigned, too, and would retire after a Nov. 6 board meeting.\n\n\u201cI am sure that everyone at the Cathay Pacific Group would agree that recent weeks have brought some of the most extraordinary and challenging times we have ever experienced,\u201d Slosar said in an internal memo obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cI can well appreciate that such volatility can cause concern over what the future may hold.\u201d\n\nHis retirement would mean that the airline\u2019s top leaders have been replaced in the wake of pressure from Beijing.\n\n[Turbulence at Cathay Pacific: China\u2019s threats loom over one of Asia\u2019s leading airlines]\n\nOne business executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the pressure on Cathay was a \u201creal shot across the bow\u201d that sent \u201cshock waves\u201d through the business community.\n\nJasper Tsang, a former senior official in the Hong Kong government who continues to be a confidant and adviser to Lam, said in an interview Tuesday that concessions aside, the crisis has already done serious damage to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to make a full assessment yet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even after the violent protest stops, it will take some time, a lot of patience, a lot of hard work to pick up the pieces and put them back together if we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumpty Dumpty has fallen,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we can put the broken pieces back together.\u201d\n\nAnna Kam contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nProtesters focus on Hong Kong\u2019s airport, snarling transport links after day of violence\n\nHong Kong protesters defy ban as clashes escalate on key pro-democracy anniversary\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Demonstrations have moved beyond the bill, and even pro-establishment lawmakers said the concession would be insufficient.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Timothy Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9BGP9K2kMzCb5vcf-OHVnCWIr6U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DZHHEGO7QI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
