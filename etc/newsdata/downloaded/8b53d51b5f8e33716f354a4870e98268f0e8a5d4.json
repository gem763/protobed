This time she has taken on the role of a young nobleman sent to learn to be a witcher by his family.\n\nWitcher School organiser Piotr Kucharski said the scenario in the game takes place 200 years before the events of Sapkowski's books and is told in episodes, with players often returning to develop their characters and find out how the story has evolved.\n\nSpeaking of the upcoming Netflix TV series, Balduzzi said she was excited and curious to see it. \"I know it's definitely going to be interesting,\" she said.\n\n'The Witcher', starring Henry Cavill in the title role, is expected to premiere on Netflix before the end of 2019.
