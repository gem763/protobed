(John Locher/AP)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 A long, slow boil preceded Mike Thibault\u2019s outburst.\n\nBefore the Washington Mystics\u2019 coach and general Manager finally lost his patience in the third quarter of a 92-75 blowout loss to the Las Vegas Aces on Sunday in Game 3 of the WNBA semifinals, he simmered with quiet contempt as his vaunted offense came apart with clunky possessions and inexplicable turnovers.\n\nOfficially, it was a disputed foul call on Emma Meeseman that earned Thibault a technical foul for his extended argument with the referees that required guard Natasha Cloud to step in as peacemaker.\n\nBut the Mystics, bullied all night by Las Vegas\u2019s physical front-line combination of A\u2019Ja Wilson and Liz Cambage, spent much of the second half turning to the officials for help that never arrived. Guard Kristi Toliver took the liberty of lodging one final complaint from the postgame podium.\n\n\u201c[The Aces] got away with a lot of fouls,\" Toliver said, \"and I think that makes a huge difference when in the first two games those things weren\u2019t allowed.\u201d\n\n[Aces look like a different team, and Mystics miss first chance to clinch spot in WNBA Finals]\n\nIn truth, much of the Mystics\u2019 angst was self-inflicted. Their bid to sweep through to the WNBA Finals came undone in the second quarter, when they managed just 13 points and committed eight turnovers on an uncharacteristically disjointed night.\n\nWashington, the WNBA\u2019s most dominant team this season, suffered its worst loss since Aug. 4. The Mystics\u2019 league-leading offense was held to its lowest total in nearly a month, as its prolific three-point attack managed to hit just 11 of its 33 attempts from outside. The bricks and clanks rained down so hard that Cloud clapped and shouted in frustration when she finally hit her first shot of the night in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThis is the first really stinker game we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d Thibault said afterward. \u201c[The Aces] were the more desperate team.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s pace-and-space approach exhausted and stretched Las Vegas past its breaking point in the first two games of the series. Yet the Aces returned home and countered with bruising, old-school offense and a savvy switching defense that limited the Mystics\u2019 supporting scorers and turned Elena Delle Donne into a one-woman show.\n\nLas Vegas, with its season on the line, also upped its energy, winning the rebounding battle 40-28 and providing energetic help defense in the paint. Washington continued to pursue its offensive goals against its physical and focused opponent, but they remained out of reach for the final three quarters.\n\nThe Mystics\u2019 efforts to push the tempo, especially early, dwindled as they failed to get defensive stops against Cambage, who scored a game-high 28 points and grabbed six rebounds, and Wilson, who added 21 points and eight rebounds. Washington also repeatedly stopped itself. After committing 10 combined turnovers in Games 1 and 2, the Mystics committed 13 in Game 3.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been a low-turnover team all season,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cThe eight turnovers we had in the second quarter were not good. [The Aces] put more pressure on us, and we didn\u2019t shoot the ball well. That was the difference.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics\u2019 pinpoint ball movement abandoned them during a crucial 16-2 Las Vegas run in the second quarter, as passes sailed out of bounds and bottled-up possessions died late in the shot clock. As the Aces\u2019 lead mounted in the second half, the desperate Mystics often resorted to quick three-pointers rather than patiently trusting their offense.\n\n\u201cWe felt a little stagnant,\u201d Delle Donne said after scoring a team-high 22 points. \u201cWe talk about having the ball move side to side. They\u2019re a big defense. We were keeping it on one side of the floor and attacking mismatches. I think we need to move it, move it. We need to get back to the drawing board. We\u2019ve been great all season, playing fast, in space, and we have to get back to that.\u201d\n\nThe Aces\u2019 defensive scheme deserves credit for containing the Mystics\u2019 attack, at least for a night. Coach Bill Laimbeer relied more heavily on switching, a tactic that can help a defense prevent drives without leaving itself exposed to open shooters.\n\nAlthough Meesseman feasted on mismatches and clean looks in Games 1 and 2, Las Vegas paid much better attention to her in Game 3. Forced to play in traffic and to contend with extra help, she finished with just six points Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have a series,\u201d Laimbeer said. \u201cWe knew it was a series. We had a better bounce in our step [defensively. The Mystics] didn\u2019t get the same number of open looks they did the past two games, especially Meesseman. She\u2019s been standing there all by herself for five seconds before she shot the ball. Today she didn\u2019t have those opportunities.\u201d\n\nThere were signs of open frustration from the Mystics, but hardly any panic. They remain in control with a 2-1 series lead, with a potential closeout Game 4 on Tuesday in Las Vegas.\n\nThibault wants his team to respond with better shooting and more assertive offensive decisions. He is also seeking a tighter whistle that could help negate Las Vegas\u2019s size advantage, lamenting that his frontcourt players were roughed up by Cambage.\n\nThe Aces\u2019 center, undaunted by the complaints, pledged more of the same in an ESPN walk-off interview.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t handle it, get in the weight room or get out of the post,\u201d Cambage said.\n\nRead more on the WNBA:\n\n\u2018Playoff Emma is having some fun!\u2019 Mystics\u2019 reserved Meesseman puts on a show.\n\nAces\u2019 gamble on Bill Laimbeer yields an early payoff\n\nElena Delle Donne, the WNBA\u2019s MVP, is right at home with the Mystics\n\nElena Delle Donne freed her mind, and a historic season followed\n\nCourtney Williams is the heart of the Connecticut Sun\u2019s WNBA title quest", "description": "Washington's offense sputtered in uncharacteristic fashion after Las Vegas made adjustments for Game 3 of their WNBA semifinal series.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "September At Pm", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
