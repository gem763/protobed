The outlet said Trump had been told that moderate party lawmakers gathered for a meeting at Camp David could not defend the decision.\n\nThe report contradicts the explanation for the decision given in tweets by the president Saturday, in which he claimed that he abandoned the plan because of \"crazed and irrational\" hostility from Democrats and the media.\n\nBowing to objections from Republicans would appear to acknowledge that legitimate concerns over the original choice do exist.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.\n\nThe decision to host the event at the golf course was announced by acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at a press conference last week, igniting another controversy for the White House.\n\nThe president is already struggling to battle an impeachment inquiry, and widespread criticism of his decision to withdraw US forces from Syria.\n\nThe president is reliant on the support of moderate congressional Republicans in the impeachment battle.\n\nHouse Democrats were quick to accuse the president of seeking to corruptly profit from his office after last week's announcement, and said the decision would form part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Once again, Donald Trump is using the office of the presidency and our relationships with some of our closest allies to enrich himself,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat. He backed legislation from Democrats introduced last week to block the move.\n\n\"The founding fathers worried about perks flowing to a corrupt president, but they could have never dreamt of corruption this brazen.\"\n\nMulvaney, when announcing the venue of the summit last week, said that Trump would make the resort available \"at cost\" and would not profit.\n\nCritics said the resort would clearly benefit from the windfall of publicity even if it made no profit on paper.\n\nA decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and effectively abandon the US' Kurdish allies has also drawn bipartisan condemnation, including from Republican congressmen such as Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a Trump ally.", "description": "Trump blamed the decision on \"crazed and irrational hostility\" by Democrats and the media, but it was reportedly his own party that sank the plan.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dad77ca4af9095a7e29cc92?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
