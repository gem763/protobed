An autopsy determined that he had suffered an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.\n\nFentanyl is a cheap, relatively easy-to-synthesize opioid painkiller 50 times more potent than heroin that has played a major role in the devastating U.S. opioid crisis.\n\nOn Sept. 4, an accused Los Angeles drug dealer, 28-year-old Cameron James Pettit, was arrested on federal drug trafficking charges after prosecutors said he gave 10 pills containing fentanyl to Miller two days before the musician\u2019s death.[L2N25V1EN]\n\nThis week, Ryan Reavis, 36, was arrested at his home in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, over the investigation.
