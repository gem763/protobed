Even when anti-Semitism has sprouted, Americans\u2019 ingrained decency and love of liberty has triumphed, squelching any budding bigotry.\n\nToday, alas, college campuses are witnessing an un-American outbreak of Jew hatred, not \u201cjust\u201d anti-Zionism. \u201cNearly three quarters\u201d of Jewish students in last summer\u2019s Cohen Center at Brandeis University survey reported being exposed to at least one anti-Semitic statement in the 2014-2015 academic year. The Amcha Initiative, a group that tracks anti-Semitism on U.S. campuses, inventoried 302 incidents at 109 schools in 2015, including a vandalized menorah, swastikas spray-painted on Jewish student centers, a Jewish student punched in the face, and a YikYak message posted at the University of Chicago that sneered: \u201cGas them, burn them and dismantle their power structure. Humanity cannot progress with the parasitic Jew.\u201d\n\nIn an age of zero-tolerance for subtle microaggressions, these macroaggressions should be generating widespread outrage\u2014rather than being ignored, or even excused sometimes. To resist this scourge, Jews and non-Jews alike should learn about Americans\u2019 historic and unending disgust for anti-Semitism. A characteristic but forgotten moment occurred in 1809, when a Republican rival tried expelling the Federalist Jacob Henry (PDF) from North Carolina\u2019s state legislature\u2014because Henry was a Jew.", "description": "Americans besieged by today\u2019s hateful rhetoric would be wise to look up Jacob Henry, whose defense of his own faith\u2014and others\u2019\u2014was once memorized by schoolchildren everywhere.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492120428/articles/2016/01/24/the-jew-who-silenced-america-s-earliest-anti-semites/160123-troy-silenced-bigots-tease_niz18x", "published_at": "2016-01-24"}
