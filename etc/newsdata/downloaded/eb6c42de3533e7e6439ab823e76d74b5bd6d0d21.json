Sources with knowledge of the case said Hyosung allegedly hired lawyers who used to work as high-level prosecutors to help the group\u2019s chairman and his family deal with a number of legal cases mostly linked with embezzlement.Officers believe Hyosung Vice Chairman Lee Sang-woon was aware of the illegal transactions. Lee, 67, who isn\u2019t a part of the Cho family, was still summoned as a suspect on Oct. 14 on allegations of helping the family embezzle corporate money.Hyosung Group\u2019s Honorary Chairman Cho Suck-rai, 83, could be next in line to be summoned, though police officers say they might ask him to appear at a later date due to his poor health.The People\u2019s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a local nongovernmental organization that advocates democracy and labor rights, filed a complaint against Hyosung\u2019s chairman and honorary chairman with the prosecution in April, asking them to punish the father and son on charges of embezzlement, dereliction of duty and evasion of taxes.The group claimed that the duo siphoned nearly 40 billion won ($34 million) from Hyosung and six of its affiliates to pay their lawyers in legal cases.BY KIM MIN-WOOK [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/30195458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
