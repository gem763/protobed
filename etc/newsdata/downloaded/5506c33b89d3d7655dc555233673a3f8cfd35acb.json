I opened the car door and she was lying down but regained consciousness to talk to me. I said to her, 'Baby, I'm here.' She replied that everything was fine, but that she had a severe pain in the back of her neck. At that moment, I became a rescuer, as I have been for seven years with the Fire Department.\"\n\nDECLARED BRAIN DEAD\n\n\u201cI took her out of the limo, started first aid and asked for help from my firefighter friends who were there as guests,\u201d he said.\n\nGuedes was taken to a state maternity hospital in central S\u00e3o Paulo. However, due to the complexity of the case, she was transferred to the private Pro Matre Paulista Maternity Hospital.\n\nAccording to the medical report, the mother had a stroke, due to preeclampsia and internal bleeding that meant surgeons were forced to remove the uterus.\n\nMOM CELEBRATES SON'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL AFTER BEING TOLD HE WOULD LIKELY DIE AS INFANT\n\nGiven the severity of the case, the medical team performed an emergency C-section to save the 29-week-old baby's life and the young mom, who had been declared brain dead, died after the operation.\n\nSophia was born weighing 2.05 pounds and is 13.5 inches long and is in the neonatal intensive care unit. She is likely to be in the hospital for at least two months.\n\nA relative of the victim, said: \u201cJessica was attending prenatal care, had no high blood pressure during her pregnancy and was healthy, doing physical activity and eating well.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the hospital confirmed that Guedes was admitted to the maternity department last Sunday.\n\nBABY DAUGHTER SOPHIA\n\n\"At the moment, the entire Maternity team is prioritizing the support, comfort and attention of the families of Lieutenant Gon\u00e7alves and the patients\u2019 (by) helping them with all necessary measures,\" a hospital spokesperson said.\n\nA video of the last moments of the bride shows her happily waving to the camera in her gown on her wedding day. But within a few hours, she was dead, and her groom was left with bittersweet emotions as he learns to come to terms with the loss of his bride while taking comfort in the birth of his child.\n\nImages capture the incredible moment the premature child responds to her father\u2019s voice by opening her eyes, turning to look at him and seemingly reaching for him with an outstretched hand that creeps out from underneath the covers.\n\n\u201cJessica was a really cheerful person who loved life, an enlightened and strong being of light,\" Goncalves said. \"I was so looking forward to becoming her husband and becoming a father. I will be strong and I will not weaken in the face of adversity. The love of my life taught me how to respect and treat a woman well so that I could learn how to take care of our daughter.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe this has happened. It seems like I'm in a sad movie, and you cry, cry, cry, but leave the movie theatre knowing it was just a movie,\" he said. \u201cHowever, in my case, the movie will never be over, and the suffering will go on forever.\u201d\n\nFollowing the unforeseen tragedy, the new father discovered that his health plan failed to cover private maternity care.\n\nBut within a couple of days of friends set up an online fundraiser, and colleagues from the military police helped raise more than needed to cover the expenses.\n\nThe family decided to respect Guedes\u2019 request to donate her organs and she was buried yesterday following the release of her body.\n\nIn August this year doctors in the Czech Republic delivered a healthy baby girl 117 days after her mother was declared brain dead.\n\nThe unnamed mom, 27, suffered a stroke in April and was kept on life support to keep the pregnancy going, and regularly moved her legs to simulate walking to help the child\u2019s growth.\n\nClick for more from The Sun.", "description": "The 30-year-old nurse, was six months pregnant and apparently healthy when she fell ill in the limo on the way to the church last Sunday in S\u00e3o Paulo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/pregnant_bride_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
