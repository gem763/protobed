The answer is a qualified no, as the initial rush from seeing Aaron Paul back in the role -- coupled with an assortment of clever callbacks -- don't fully warrant cooking up this sequel.\n\nLest anyone have forgotten, the series signed off six years ago with Paul's Jesse Pinkman having been liberated from captivity by his one-time partner Walter White, riding into an unknown future.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the movie -- written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan -- basically picks up where the show left off (as \"Bad\" prequel \"Better Call Saul\" has demonstrated, Gilligan doesn't really sweat time lapses), charting Jesse's next moves from there.\n\nOf course, the \"Bad\" finale sent the character into the night with a cathartic yell, but there was the little matter of what one does after such an ordeal, especially with that many dead bodies in the rear-view mirror as baggage.\n\nAaron Paul in 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie'\n\nWhat ensues, though, is essentially a rather low-octane thriller, punctuated by trips down memory lane. And while there are some fine moments buried within all that -- some showcasing Gilligan's quirky streak, like an incongruous rendition of the song \"Sharing the Night Together\" -- it still feels a trifle unnecessary.\n\nRead More", "description": "Aaron Paul reprises his role in Netflix movie, which doesn't wholly justify cooking up this new, weaker batch", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191001155254-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
