That view though is price-dependent. At the right price, India probably still has capacity to export more,\" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Tobin Gorey wrote in a market note.\n\n* December white sugar settled up $1.6, or 0.5%, at $341.4 per tonne, just below a six-month high of $342 set on Thursday.
