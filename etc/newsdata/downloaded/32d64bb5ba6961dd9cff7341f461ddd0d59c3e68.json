That was very important to me and I thought it would be good,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Kendall was deeply disappointed by Obama\u2019s health care reforms, blaming them for a surge in her insurance premiums. Even so, she voted for him again when he ran for reelection. \u201cI liked his foreign policies. The way that he was dealing with Al-Qaeda. I thought he was doing a really good job of dealing with terrorism, keeping the country safe,\u201d she said.\n\nThen came 2016.\n\nKendall said her vote for Donald Trump was more a rejection of Hillary Clinton who she regards as dishonest. Now she is a fan of the president and deeply defensive of her vote for him. \u201cPeople say Trump is horrible. He probably is a horrible person.\n\n\u201cBut right now I am about the economy. It\u2019s helping me and my family. I\u2019ll be voting for Trump again,\u201d she told incredulous Democratic activists at the county fair.\n\nHer company employs 12 people renovating buildings in Detroit, about 25 miles north of Monroe county, which is a 90% white and mostly working class county of about 150,000 people. Its main city, also called Monroe, has a population of around 20,000 and much of the county\u2019s industry.\n\nKendall\u2019s vote contributed to one of the largest swings across the US from Obama to Trump. America\u2019s first black president won Monroe county, Michigan, twice, albeit by a slim margin in 2012. Four years later, Trump trounced Clinton in the county, winning 58% of the vote, the largest proportion there since Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nThat delivered the president\u2019s slim victory in Michigan which in turn was crucial to putting him in the White House. Trump won the state by just 10,704 votes, the narrowest margin of victory in the history of presidential elections in Michigan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The Trump tide came in and still hasn\u2019t receded yet,\u2019 says Bill LaVoy who lost his seat as a Democratic state representative for the county in the Trump surge of 2016.

Show Hide The voters who swung to Trump Voters swung from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa in 2016\u2019s presidential election \u2013 helping propel him to a narrow victory.\n\nChris McGreal will report from three key swing voter counties in these states as the 2020 election campaign unfolds, regularly travelling around them, talking to voters, workers, business owners, party activists and strategists.\n\nWill these voters stay with Trump in 2020? Our series will feature regular in depth reporting from: Monroe county, Michigan. Trump won 58% of the vote in 2016 in this mainly white, working class county of around 150,000 people, which is about 25 miles south of Detroit. Some industrial jobs remain in steel and at a nuclear power plant but those who needed to move to find work frequently took non-unionised jobs in healthcare. Forest county, Wisconsin. The northern rural county voted overwhelmingly for Trump having twice backed Barack Obama. In 2008, Obama took 56% of the ballot in the county. Eight years later, Trump won 61%. Howard county, Iowa. One of a bloc of agricultural counties in northeastern Iowa that flipped by large margins and helped deliver the state for Trump. In 2012, it voted 60% for Obama. Four years later, the county went 58% for Trump.\n\nThis week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is reporting from three midwest counties that swung from Obama to Trump in crucial states.\n\nOn the face of it, Trump\u2019s slim margins of victory in 2016 key states are good reason for the Democrats to believe they can snatch them back from a president perpetually mired in controversy from his incessant tweeting and lashing out at even the mildest criticism to the launch of impeachment hearings.\n\nAnd yet the Democrats would be wise not to count on Monroe County \u2013 which almost always votes for the ultimate presidential winner \u2013 to deliver victory for them, and local party activists know it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Monroe county fair in Monroe, Michigan, is a highlight of the county\u2019s summer. Photograph: Tom Carter/Alamy\n\nThe Trump tide\n\n\u201cThe Trump tide came in and still hasn\u2019t receded yet,\u201d said Bill LaVoy who lost his seat as a Democratic state representative for the county in the Trump surge of 2016. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if these are permanent Republican voters now or it\u2019s just temporary,\u201d said LaVoy, also speaking at the Monroe county fair, which dates back to the 19th century.\n\nDemocrats in Monroe county face the same dilemma as their party nationally. Do they try and win back voters who swung from Obama to Trump by opting for a \u201csafe\u201d candidate in Joe Biden? Or do they look for another path to victory by mobilising those who stayed away in 2016, by giving them something to vote for with a candidate pushing more radical policies?\n\n\u201cSome think that the party needs to move more to the left. I\u2019m not so sure that works around here,\u201d said LeVoy. \u201cI\u2019m a moderate and I\u2019m actually the last Democrat to win around here for the state house. I lean more towards Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nA party activist, Christopher Slat, interrupted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Slat, a Democratic party activist in Monroe county, Michigan, backs Joe Biden. Photograph: Chris McGrath\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to not run to the left and that hasn\u2019t worked so why don\u2019t we try something different?\u201d said Slat, a 30-year-old who makes videos for the local school district.\n\nSlat suspects Trump voters aren\u2019t coming back no matter who the Democratic candidate is. \u201cWe ran Anybody But Trump last time and she didn\u2019t win. We might run Biden and he\u2019s the same thing,\u201d said Slat.\n\nNothing stays still with Trump for long and impeachment has now swung into view. It\u2019s a seismic political drama in Washington and dominates the analysis and argument of cable news. But it has yet to have the same impact in America\u2019s heartland. Perhaps it will in time if the revelations are shocking enough or Trump\u2019s political allies begin to turn on him. For now, Trump\u2019s core voters mostly seem to chalking the investigation up to another Russia-style \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.\n\nSlat, the Democratic activist who backs Sanders over Biden, said the real impact may not be on Trump at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change people\u2019s minds that much, especially if they\u2019re already loyal to Trump. People are going to be more concerned with \u2018what are the candidates going to do for me?\u2019 instead of worrying about this drama stuff. I think there\u2019s a sentiment even among some progressives that all presidents do this kind of stuff. This is a hit job, just another Russia investigation,\u201d he said at the weekend.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s bad news for Joe Biden. I think it\u2019s going to be a really hard sell if the impeachment is going on through the election cycle for Joe Biden to make the case if his son was taking $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company while he was vice-president, and he\u2019s saying there\u2019s nothing illegal about that. Even if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s going to put him in the same bucket as Hillary where people say they\u2019re all crooks so I\u2019m going to stay home.\u201d\n\nJob market shifts\n\nMonroe county, like Detroit, was once strong union territory. In 2008 the Ford car plant closed with the loss of 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit.\n\n\u201cThink about 3,200 people,\u201d said Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official. \u201cProbably 2,000 or more of them living in this community, spending money in this community. Gone. Some of them may still live here but they work in Dearborn or Flat Rock. So that\u2019s where they spend their money. The impact was huge.\u201d\n\nIndustries have come and gone from Monroe before. More than a dozen paper mills that once employed thousands making corrugated cardboard boxes were mostly closed by the 1970s. Some of the workers found jobs at the new Ford plant which became Monroe\u2019s largest employer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory, where 3,200 jobs were lost when the factory closed in 2008, for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official.

Others were locked out by the banks.\n\nMonroe struggled as shops went to the wall. The local mall is a shell of its once bustling self after major stores such as Sears and Target abandoned it in recent years.\n\nSome industrial jobs remain in steel and at a nuclear power plant. But those forced to find work elsewhere in the county frequently took cuts in pay as they shifted to non-unionised jobs in health care which, like many other struggling parts of the midwest, provides an increasing proportion of employment.\n\nWith the national economic shock of the recession and the local impact of the Ford closure, the majority white county began its shift away from long standing support for the Democrats by electing Republicans to local and state offices even if voters also backed Obama. In those circumstances, the move from Obama to Trump does not look quite so jarring.\n\nKeck, who worked in the Ford factory, thinks it was at least in part an act of desperation by those disappointed that Obama did not make the dramatic changes his historic election promised.\n\nTo some, Obama seemed more interested in looking after the banks more than unemployed workers struggling to pay their mortgages. Clinton represented more of the same in 2016.\n\nThe UAW ordered Keck to campaign for her even though he was at heart a Bernie Sanders supporter. Three years later he remains bitter at what he regards as Clinton\u2019s out of touch campaign.\n\nAgainst that, Trump appeared to be listening to people in Monroe county.\n\nThe anger that burst out at the ballot box in 2016 has only escalated. Some of it comes from Trump supporters horrified at what he has become.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Misty Kendall Photograph: Chris McGrath\n\nThen there are those like construction boss Misty Kendall who voted for Trump less as a statement of support than in opposition to Clinton and who now regard criticism of the president as a personal attack on them. That has helped solidify support for the president among those prepared to set aside his sins, personal and political.\n\nA few will defend his tweets and diminishing the dignity of his office as evidence that he is standing up to the elites and telling it like it is.\n\nKendall is prepared to acknowledge criticism of Trump\u2019s language, calling him \u201ckind of crass\u201d. But she regards much of what exercises the president\u2019s critics, from migrant detentions to his climate policies, as faux concerns fabricated as a means to attack him.\n\n\u201cEverybody gets so offended if you\u2019re a Trump supporter,\u201d said Kendall. \u201cI just wish that everybody had a more open mind about the situation. We don\u2019t all have to agree. I think he\u2019s a great president. He\u2019s my president. If a Democrat gets elected, guess what? It\u2019s still my president. I might not like it but I have to abide by it because I\u2019m an American.\u201d\n\nHealthcare: a huge issue\n\nOn the other side, anger at Clinton on the Democratic party\u2019s left in 2016, which led some voters to stay away, has turned on Trump and fuelled a surge in activism and engagement with the primaries.\n\nThe challenge for the party in places such as Monroe county is to find the crossover issues to lure at least some Trump voters back and get wavering voters to the polls.\n\nFor some, the best issue may be the one which proved most damaging to Obama among many voters - health care reform.\n\n\u201cPeople were not happy with Obamacare around here when it raised the cost. This isn\u2019t a wealthy area,\u201d said LaVoy, the former Democratic state representative. \u201cBut health care needs to be fixed. That\u2019s something Trump ran on and he didn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d\n\nJeff Morris, president of the local UAW branch who has worked for 29 years at the Gerdau steel mill in Monroe, said it is the primary political issue for most of his members.\n\n\u201cHealth care for my 500 members is huge. They ask if a candidate is gonna fix health care. That\u2019s the whole nine yards,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic debates: how healthcare is defining and dividing 2020 candidates Read more\n\n\u201d\n\nThe challenge for the Democratic party in counties such as Monroe is to present a policy such as healthcare reform that can win back some working class voters and mobilise the young without scaring off other voters with charges of socialism or government overreach.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump acknowledges auto workers at the American Center for Mobility on March 2017 in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Photograph: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\n\u2018Now we\u2019re scared\u2019\n\nPart of the challenge is to keep the political debate focussed on policies such as healthcare as the president works to get Americans to look elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIn the 80s when I was growing up it was always abortion and guns,\u201d said Morris. \u201cThere\u2019s a version of that going on right now with immigration. It\u2019s a huge distraction and it\u2019s intentional.\u201d\n\nAnd it works. Ask what the president is getting right and Kendall vigorously defends his immigration policies as preventing a flood of people across the border to live on her taxes. She disparages reports of separation of families on the border as political propaganda.\n\nAgainst that, LaVoy looked on in alarm at the Democratic primary debates as candidates batted around proposals to weaken border controls or ease restrictions on asylum applications \u2013 \u201copen borders\u201d as Trump characterises it. LaVoy regards the debate as a quagmire that will suck the party down.\n\n\u201cThe immigration stuff, this county is 90% white. That doesn\u2019t play well around here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic party should be careful because if Trump wins Michigan, he wins the presidency because that means not much has changed in the midwest.\u201d\n\nAt the County Fair, a Democratic activist, Yvonne Morrison, is certain that Trump\u2019s framing of immigration is working for him. \u201cThis terrible resentment has bubbled up like a cesspool,\u201d she said. \u201cLast time we laughed at Trump. Now we\u2019re scared . I think he\u2019ll win again. His support hasn\u2019t moved an inch.\u201d", "description": "In this first piece in our new series on swing voters, Chris McGreal reports from Monroe county, Michigan, where industrial jobs are under pressure, and asks voters who once backed Obama if they will vote for Trump again", "authors": ["Chris Mcgreal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e331bec36d004131d64f3859d4f9c17680730e3/0_327_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0556f0faf33a8d74c55d5bbab7dd221", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
