It is NOT the Kavanaugh accuser whose own father warned that she had psychological problems.\n\nThis is the one who didn\u2019t remember what Kavanaugh did to her for more than 30 years, until a few lefty friends helpfully reminded her that they\u2019d heard something about it from a guy, who heard it from a guy, whereupon she spent six days \u201cassessing her memories\u201d during the nomination hearings -- and darned if it didn\u2019t all come back to her!\n\nWhat the guy who heard it from a guy heard was that, at a drunken party in a freshman dorm, Kavanaugh unzipped his pants and stuck his penis in Ramirez\u2019s face.\n\nContrary to Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s claim that \u201cat least\u201d seven people \u201cheard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge,\" this vast array of witnesses includes only one person whose secondhand, rumor-mill story includes both Kavanaugh and Ramirez: Kenneth Appold.\n\n(All we know about Appold is that he is a professor at the Princeton Theological Seminary, meaning that he is less likely to believe in God than any person not a professor at the Princeton Theological Seminary.)\n\nThe guy Appold claims he heard it from doesn\u2019t remember it.\n\nAre you following how absurd this is?\n\nThis is not merely hearsay; it\u2019s double hearsay offered by only one person, and he wasn\u2019t there, but he heard about it from another person, who denies knowledge of it. And the corpus delecti is something that happened with a group of drunk teenagers 35 years ago.\n\nThe main point made by the excerpt is to remind us that truth means nothing to liberals.\n\nHere\u2019s the book\u2019s big new scoop:\n\n\u201cWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms.Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nThis story was on the Times\u2019 website for more than 24 hours when -- at close to midnight on Sunday -- the paper issued an \u201cEditors\u2019 Note\u201d admitting that the victim does not remember it. <\n\nI\u2019m not even going to mention that Stier was a lawyer for Bill Clinton, defending him for whipping it out in front of Paula Jones, as governor of Arkansas. Obviously, that\u2019s not as serious as doing it as a college freshman.\n\nBut could some good reporter -- which excludes anyone in the mainstream media -- look into Stier\u2019s undergraduate years? Any embarrassing incidents when he was a freshman? Any rumors or third-hand accounts? While we\u2019re at it, can we get Stier\u2019s tax returns for the last 30 years? Where\u2019s Chuck Johnson when we need him?\n\nLet\u2019s consider just the physics of Stier\u2019s story.\n\nHow can anyone, let alone two or more people, \"push\" a man's penis into another person's hand? Just how big is Brett Kavanaugh's penis, anyway? Wouldn't a man's penis, if it were able to be \"pushed\" by one's friends into third parties, need to be erect and at least 3 feet long? Don't push my penis, bro!\n\nThe best part of the Times excerpt is the Women\u2019s Temperance League tone of the piece.\n\n\u201c(Ramirez\u2019s Yale classmates) also had experience with drinking and sexual behavior that Ms. Ramirez -- who had not intended to be intimate with a man until her wedding night -- lacked. ... \u2018I had gone through high school, I\u2019m the good girl, and now, in one evening, it was all ripped away,' she said in an interview. ...\u201d\n\nIf someone from Bob Jones University said that her dreams of marital purity were \u201cripped away\u201d because she saw a man\u2019s penis in college, liberals would never stop laughing.\n\n\u201c(Kavanaugh) was ... known to attend an annual teenage bacchanal called \u2018Beach Week,\u2019 where the hookups and drinking were more important than the sand and swimming.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t much of a \u201cbeach party\u201d -- if you want to call it that. Instead of wholesome fun, the young people consumed alcoholic beverages and engaged in inappropriate flirting. Everyone said it was inappropriate -- not just us.\n\nMost shocking, from a \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d perspective, was this:\n\n\u201cPeople ... would start to say \u2018Debbie does ...\u2019 playing on the 1978 porn movie \u2018Debbie Does Dallas.\u2019 But Ms. Ramirez didn\u2019t understand the reference.\u201d\n\nRemind me: Aren't these the same people demanding that we teach kindergartners about \u201cfisting\u201d?\n\nBut the \u201cDebbie Does Defamation\u201d authors weren\u2019t finished.\n\n\u201c(Kavanaugh) came of age during the era of \u2018Porky\u2019s\u2019 and \u2018Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\u2019\u201d\n\nHa! What do you say, NOW, Trumpsters?\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg \u201ccame of age during the era of\u201d the Bay of Pigs and the Vietnam War. Can we impeach her?\n\nI\u2019m beginning to suspect that, instead of writing the book, Pogrebin and Kelly screwed around for six months, then pulled an all-nighter the day before it was due. Also, \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d was big!\n\nBut half the Democratic candidates for president are demanding Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment on the basis of this sublime idiocy.
