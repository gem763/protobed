It was acquired by the present, anonymous owner from the collection of jazz guitarist George Benson, according to Christie\u2019s.\n\nThe set\u2019s red version has remained in the musician\u2019s family since his death in 1991, while the black one is buried at his side in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City.\n\nThe deep blue trumpet will be offered at \u201cThe Exceptional Sale\u201d at Christie\u2019s New York on Oct. 29.\n\nThe trumpet features crescent moon and stars. Courtesy of Christie's\n\n\u201cMiles Davis' music has that same magical, transformative power to move us that a great masterpiece of painting or sculpture does,\u201d Becky MacGuire, director of the sale, said in a statement. \u201cHis iconic trumpet couldn\u2019t be more perfect for this \u2018best of the best\u2019 auction.\u201d\n\nThe trumpet is both a fine piece of craftsmanship and marks a crucial moment in Davis\u2019 career. Davis produced many critically acclaimed albums over the decades, from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. His 1959 album, Kind of Blue, remains the best-selling jazz album ever.\n\nHowever, he stopped making music around 1975 due to a combination of exhaustion and drug addiction, and wouldn\u2019t pick up an instrument again in earnest until the early 1980s, which was when the \u201cMoon and Stars\u201d trumpets were created, according to Christie\u2019s.\n\nThe trumpet, alongside other highlights of \u201cThe Exceptional Sale,\u201d will be open to public viewing from Oct. 24-28 at Christie\u2019s Rockefeller Center galleries in Manhattan.", "description": "The instrument could fetch up to $100,000", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104013/social"}
