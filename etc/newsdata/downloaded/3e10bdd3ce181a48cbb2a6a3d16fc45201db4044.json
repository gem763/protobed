(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Walmart(NYSE: WMT) have been in an arms race to win over customers. Each wants to crowd out the other to gain market share, and both have pulled out all the stops.\n\nWhat was once a baseline of two-day shipping has moved to one-day, and same-day has become a bigger part of the plan for both companies. It's a competition that has been good for consumers, giving them a strong choice to make.\n\nWalmart does not have the same digital selection as Amazon, but it probably has what you need. Here are three reasons to make that choice.\n\n1. You don't want to pay a membership fee\n\nAmazon Prime charges $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, the main benefit being free two-day shipping (which is slowly becoming free one-day shipping). Prime includes a robust video service and a lot of other perks, but many customers probably join for the free shipping.\n\nWalmart offers free two-day shipping (to eventually become one-day) on a few million items for orders more than $35. If you regularly order enough to meet that threshold, it may make sense to not pay for Prime.\n\nManaging your credit cards: 2 in 5 millennials make a big credit card mistake\n\nHave a high credit score?: You can enjoy these 5 benefits\n\n2. BOPIS and BORIS\n\nWalmart allows customers to buy online and pick up in-store (BOPIS) and to buy online and return in-store (BORIS). Amazon takes returns at its Whole Foods locations and through its partnership with Kohl's, but there are far fewer of those locations than Walmart has. Amazon has more limited BOPIS options at Whole Foods and through pickup point locations.\n\n3. You like to see what you buy\n\nWalmart has a massive brick-and-mortar footprint. Amazon has Whole Foods and a smattering of physical store locations. Customers can walk around a Walmart, put their hands on various items, then order them for home delivery.\n\nThat's something many people want to do when it comes to bigger-ticket items such as electronics. If you want to buy a TV from Walmart, you can go see exactly how big it is and what the picture looks like. You can't do that in most cases as a Prime member.\n\nIt may not be worth $119 for Prime\n\nIf you place small orders frequently and want a near-unlimited selection, then Prime may be worth the money. For those willing to place bigger orders and who have some flexibility on exactly what they buy, then it may make sense to go with Walmart.\n\nThe real question to ask yourself is \"How hard would it be to not be able to just order on a whim?\" If that's not a big deal for you \u2013 and you may enjoy the advantages of dealing with a company with an extensive brick-and-mortar presence \u2013 then it's worth skipping Prime and giving Walmart a try.\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.
