But in reality, it is a party that knows nothing but outrage'.", "description": "While popular premier far-left Die Linke party easily retained the top spot with about 30 per cent, the Alternative for Germany scored at least 23 percent - more than doubling its result in 2014.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/18/20251978-0-image-a-9_1572201534147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
