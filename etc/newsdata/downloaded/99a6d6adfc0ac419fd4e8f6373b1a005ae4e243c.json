The FDA said earlier this month it found unacceptable levels of NDMA in drugs containing ranitidine.\n\nBut FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said the regulator is now \"working to understand what happens to NDMA levels in the body, after ranitidine has been exposed to acid in the stomach.\"\n\nZantac has been on the market for more than 35 years and was originally sold by Glaxo Holdings Ltd, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC. (L: ) At one point it was the top-selling drug in the world.\n\nRepresentatives of GSK and Sanofi were not immediately available for comment.\n\nValisure's Chief Executive David Light said it was important that the FDA is investigating the issue because the company's data suggests the NDMA levels that can be formed in the body \"are many magnitudes of order higher than what's been talked about in the contamination.\"\n\n\"This is one of the main red flags we've raised the whole time -- not just contamination but the fact that this is happening in the human body,\" Light said.\n\nSanofi said last week it would recall the drug in the United States and Canada. Other drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis (S: ) have recalled or halted distribution of their versions of the drug.\n\nRetailers including Walmart Inc (N: ), CVS Health Corp (N: ), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O: ) and Rite Aid Corp (N: ) have stopped selling ranitidine.\n\nThe FDA said on Wednesday that early tests of alternatives to Zantac such as Pepcid, Tagamet, Nexium, Prevacid and Prilosec have not been found to contain NDMA.\n\nNDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers. Those impurities are believed to have been introduced by recent changes in the manufacturing process.", "description": "FDA investigating whether Zantac causes carcinogens to form in users", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N214_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
