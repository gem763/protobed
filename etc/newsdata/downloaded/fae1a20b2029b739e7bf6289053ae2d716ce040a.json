Got her in the leg. She didn't do it herself. I had a dog in here and he stepped on the gun,' Parks says.\n\n'The dog shot her?' the dispatcher asked. Parks answered: 'Yea, he stepped on it and it went off. But anyway, can you get an ambulance out here.'\n\nMeanwhile, Springer is heard in the background saying, 'I don't feel good' and 'tell my kids I love them'.\n\n'She's bleeding pretty bad,' Parks is heard saying.\n\nThe then says that she needs to lay down.\n\n'She's alert but she's losing blood bad.
