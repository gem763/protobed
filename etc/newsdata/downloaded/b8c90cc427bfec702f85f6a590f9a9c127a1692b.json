(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has spent his time in office trying to bend the conventions of the American presidency to his will. Now he appears to be trying to override a core principle of democracy: that no one is above the law.\n\nFaced with an impeachment inquiry, Trump has openly defied the core constructs of the Constitution. He chafes at the idea of co-equal branches of government and rejects the House's right to investigate him.\n\nHe has deployed a convoluted logic in which he has declared that the courts can't investigate him because as president he cannot be charged with a crime, but also Congress cannot impeach him because its inquiry is politically illegitimate.\n\nIt's a \"heads he wins, tails you lose\" formulation.\n\n\"It's anathema to his character and his life story to be checked and balanced by anything,\" said presidential historian Jon Meacham, a professor at Vanderbilt University. \"The Constitution was formed to contain appetite. And we now have the president who is driven entirely by appetite.\"\n\nIn a scathing eight-page letter this week, the president's lawyers served notice there will be no cooperation with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's White House has ignored document requests and subpoenas. It readily invokes executive privilege \u2014 going so far as to argue that the privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who never held White House jobs. And his team all but dares Democrats to hold them in contempt.\n\nThe impeachment standoff follows a pattern Trump has established throughout his presidency as he has jettisoned experienced advisers and flouted conventions.\n\nThe fact that he survived the special counsel's Russia investigation without paying much of a political penalty left him all the more emboldened.\n\nOne day after Robert Mueller's faltering testimony brought an end to that threat, Trump unleashed a new one by asking Ukraine's president to investigate his political foe Joe Biden. That prompted the fast-moving impeachment inquiry that Trump now resists.\n\nAfter two weeks of a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe, the White House letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week was a declaration of war.\n\nWhile it was filled with dubious legal arguments, its intent was clear: Trump would not play ball, claiming that the game was rigged against him.\n\nAs for all the subpoenas flying from House Democrats, an exasperated Trump said Thursday, \"You're running a country, I just don't think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you've had.\"\n\nAnd as for the Democrats, Trump claimed Wednesday they're the ones playing dirty \"because they have a tiny margin in the House.\"\n\n\"They have eviscerated the rules,\" he said. \"They don't give us any \u2014 any fair play. It's the most unfair situation people have seen.\"\n\nThe Constitution gives the House \"the sole power of impeachment.\" But it confers that authority without providing any guidelines, which the White House has seized upon in demanding that Pelosi call for a vote to authorize the inquiry as happened in the last two impeachment inquiries.\n\nNo vote is required, and Trump's strategy risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment for obstructing their investigations.\n\n\"The president does not have all-consuming power,\" said Nick Ackerman, a member of the Watergate prosecution team that investigated President Richard Nixon. \"We play by certain rules and we expect the rule of law to apply. We don't have checks and balances if he ignores them. That itself is an impeachable defense, which is what Nixon faced.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment.\n\nTrump, for his part, has never been one to rely on legality or logic in making his arguments.\n\nIn the last week alone, he called for the impeachment of Sen. Mitt Romney and Rep. Adam Schiff \u2014 events that can't occur \u2014 and in part justified his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, leaving the Kurds vulnerable to Turkish attacks, by saying the Kurds did not assist at Normandy during World War II.", "description": "Donald Trump has spent his time in office trying to bend the conventions of the American presidency to his will.
