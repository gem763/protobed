It did.\n\nHe said he probably won't return to the same park again, because he has \"this weird feeling that the bison there really don't like me.\"\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen a bison charged at Kyler Bourgeous in June, it punctured his hip and armpit. Then it trampled him, breaking his ribs and collapsing his lung.\n\n\"I thought my incident was a freak accident with really bad luck with the positioning,\" Bourgeous, 30, told The Standard-Examiner.\n\nBut despite the injuries, he walked out of the hospital just days later. He started hiking again less than two weeks after the incident.\n\nIt happened again\n\nThe story of being gored was so wild he even used it to break the ice with a girl he met online, giving her some sage advice for any future bison encounters: \"Stay still, so it doesn't come after you again.\"\n\nbison More\n\nFlickr/Brian Gratwicke\n\nThat warning came in handy sooner than Bourgeous had expected, when the pair went on a date at Utah's Antelope Island State Park \u2014 the same place he was gored.\n\nNot long into their date, the pair were running down a trail when a bison charged at 22-year-old Kayleigh Davis, using its head to flip her into the air and puncture her thigh.\n\nRead more: A bison stampede stopped traffic in Yellowstone, and one family filmed the horrible moment a bison plowed into their car\n\nWhen she landed on the ground, she remembered Bourgeous' warning and tried to remain motionless while the bison sniffed and dug at her with its hooves.\n\n\"While I was up in the air, I was like, 'Am I going to hit my head or my back? I don't know.' I was scared,\" Davis told KSTU. \"He was \u2026 digging at the dirt like he's going to charge after me, but I stayed still and he stopped.\"\n\nPark officials have advised visitors to back away or 'give the animal a very wide berth' if they encounter a bison\n\nDespite the two rare attacks, Utah State Parks Lt. Eric Stucki told the Standard-Examiner that neither Davis nor Bourgeous were at fault or \"did anything out of the ordinary\" that provoked the bison.\n\nA number of recent news reports have documented tourists misbehaving around bison, taunting them, petting them, or simply getting too close.\n\nThe National Park Service even released a tongue-in-cheek infographic mapping out which parts of a bison are okay to pet (none of them are).\n\nUtah State Parks noted in a statement that visitors who encounter bison on trails should immediately back away, return the way they came, or leave the trail and \"give the animal a very wide berth when passing it.\"\n\nAs for Bourgeous and Davis, The Washington Post reported that they're still dating, and Bourgeous visited Davis multiple times in the hospital before she was released Monday. He said he doesn't intend on returning to the same park anytime soon, though.\n\n\"I generally am not superstitious, but I have this weird feeling that the bison there really don't like me,\" he said.\n\nNOW WATCH: This dog goalie holds 3 Guinness World Records", "description": "Kyler Bourgeous says he probably won't return to the same park again, because he has \"this weird feeling that the bison there really don't like me.\"", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ke1ZBQ5loT1fJLzuY1_6hw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/736b1d6c7f21f89dff0f633b2738d4c7"}
