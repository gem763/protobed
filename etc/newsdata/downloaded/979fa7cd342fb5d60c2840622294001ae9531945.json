They all bemoan (the headline writer got that right) the lack of discussion of these subjects in the federal election campaign.\n\nThe business leaders evidently feel what the campaign lacked was a Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has a plan for this, a plan for that, a plan for everything (except, it turns out, financing her biggest spending project of all, universal medicare). What we apparently need as a country is a plan for economic growth and prosperity.\n\nWell, maybe.\n\nDespite Sen. Warren, a plan is a good thing to have only if it\u2019s a good plan. Rube Goldberg had lots and lots of plans, but none you\u2019d actually want. For the benefit of younger readers, Rube Goldberg (1883-1970) was a trained engineer who became a successful American cartoonist, producing innumerable drawings of extremely complicated machines designed to accomplish extremely simple tasks. An example is 1931\u2019s \u201cSelf-operating napkin.\u201d Reproduced on a U.S. postage stamp in Goldberg\u2019s honour, it depicts a machine that uses levers, ladles, clocks, parrots, and even small rockets to enable a person to wipe soup from his moustache.\n\nWhen you see one of these Rube Goldberg machines, government may actually be what comes to mind. Anyone who has done work for a government will have been impressed by the paperwork required to move a cheque from it to you \u2014 much more than the private sector ever requires. People seeking government finance for projects speak of the many levels of approval they must obtain.\n\nDespite the bemoaners, it\u2019s wrong to suggest we don\u2019t have an economic plan. The 2017 federal budget \u2014 how quickly we forget! \u2014 had a big section on securing economic growth. My favourite sentence from it was almost an homage to Rube Goldberg: \u201cThe Government of Canada\u2019s vast array of innovation programs makes it difficult for businesses to find and secure the support they need.\u201d Yes, its \u201cvast array!\u201d We are so helpful you can\u2019t get any help from us.\n\nThe 2018 budget followed up dramatically. One passage included the number \u201c92\u201d printed in very large font. It turns out 92 is \u2014 or was \u2014 the number of federal programs already aimed at encouraging innovation. Ninety-two! The budget promised a two-thirds reduction to consolidate these 92 into \u201c35+\u201d programs \u2014 so businesses could have 35-stop shopping. I guess that\u2019s better than 92-stop shopping. But not much. Maybe they should ask Amazon in and have Jeff Bezos\u2019 people turn it all into a handy search engine that would automatically pull up the federal program that exactly meets your business\u2019 needs.\n\nThe 2018 budget did not make clear, by the way, whether the 92 included the several new initiatives the 2017 budget had introduced, such as the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, Innovation Canada (a new policy \u201cplatform\u201d), the Strategic Innovation Fund, the Venture Capital Canada Fund, and a supposedly private but certain to be manipulated Canadian Business Growth Fund, together with six \u201cEconomic Strategy Tables\u201d \u2014 yes, tables were on the table \u2014 designed to set \u201cambitious growth targets for Canadian innovators.\u201d The 2017 budget also set official Soviet-style numerical targets for exports and high-growth small firms.\n\nHave the bemoaning business leaders forgotten all this? If Maxime Bernier were Liberal leader, he would probably tell them: \u201cLook, we addressed all this. What more do you want?\u201d Of course, if Maxime Bernier were Liberal leader, he\u2019d only ask \u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d\n\nProductivity, the key to prosperity, isn\u2019t actually that hard an idea. You do more with the same resources. Or do the same with fewer resources. How? I haven\u2019t a clue. You\u2019re the person who knows \u2014 or should know \u2014 how your enterprise works. It\u2019s very hard for anyone else, least of all government, to develop \u201cknowledge of the particular circumstances of (your) time and place,\u201d to use Ludwig von Mises\u2019 famous summary of what a free economy generates and makes use of. Figuring out exactly how you raise the ratio of output to resources won\u2019t necessarily be easy, though in some circumstances it won\u2019t actually be that hard.\n\nHow to encourage productivity? One general rule is to minimize the number of people who aren\u2019t contributing to the mission. (Does that sound like government?) Another is to reward it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a business and you raise your productivity, your profits should go up. So what do we do? We tax profits. Not even Rube Goldberg could make that work.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "The Government of Canada is so helpful you can\u2019t get any help from it", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
