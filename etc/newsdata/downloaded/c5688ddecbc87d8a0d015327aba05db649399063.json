They believe he has consistently exaggerated the economic risks of Brexit and sought to frustrate planning for no deal while in charge of the Treasury.\n\nThe Runnymede and Weybridge MP has said he will vigorously contest any attempt to deselect him as a candidate in the next election, potentially through legal action. That threat has been issued by the Conservative whips' office in an attempt to bring would-be rebels into line.\n\nDavid Gauke\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nTheresa May's former justice secretary is another key figure - so much so that he and his anti-no-deal associates have been dubbed the \"Gaukeward squad\".\n\nThe 48-year old former solicitor - who was George Osborne's number two at the Treasury in pre-referendum days - has said a no-deal exit would be a \"big mistake\" for the UK and he would not be \"complicit\" in something which would see people lose their jobs.\n\nThe South West Hertfordshire MP faced calls earlier this year from some activists in his constituency to deselect him.\n\nConfronted with the same threat now from No 10, he said he was prepared to put the national interest ahead of his own future career prospects by voting against the government. He said he believed Downing Street wanted to carry out a \"purge\" of dissenting voices.\n\nDominic Grieve\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nUnlike Mr Hammond and Mr Gauke, Mr Grieve has been a frequent and high-profile rebel over Brexit during the past two years - opposing Theresa May's withdrawal deal three times.\n\nThe former attorney general is a strong supporter of another referendum on the UK's future in Europe, with the option to remain.\n\nThe 63-year-old says he regards a no-deal exit as \"unacceptable\" and will always vote against it - even if his career takes a hit.\n\nThe Beaconsfield MP has said he wants to fight the next election as a Conservative but being deselected is a price he is willing to pay.\n\nEarlier this year, he lost a vote of no confidence by local Conservatives following a \"robust discussion\" about Brexit.\n\nKen Clarke\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAnother former chancellor, Mr Clarke is the most strongly Europhile member of his party and has long been out of step with its views on Europe.\n\nHe opposed the 2016 Brexit referendum and was the only Tory MP to vote against triggering the Article 50 process for leaving the EU.\n\nHe has gone as far as to suggest he would vote against the government in a vote of no confidence in order to stop a no-deal exit.\n\nThe 79-year old has previously suggested he might stand down as MP for Rushcliffe at the next election.\n\nSir Oliver Letwin\n\nImage copyright House of Commons\n\nThe ex-cabinet minister was a ringleader in attempts by MPs in April to hammer out a Brexit compromise by seizing control of the parliamentary timetable.\n\nHe also spearheaded a cross-party bill which would have compelled Theresa May to seek a Brexit extension earlier this year, and will be the one to make the application to the Commons Speaker for an emergency debate later.\n\nA consummate Westminster insider, he is a leading \"soft Brexiteer\" who believes the referendum result must be honoured while maintaining close economic links with Europe.\n\nThe West Dorset MP has said he will not contest the next general election.\n\nJustine Greening\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThe former education secretary announced on Tuesday she would stand down as MP for the overwhelmingly pro-Remain constituency of Putney in south-west London whenever the next election comes.\n\nShe warned that Parliament's ability to be a force for change, particularly in terms of improving social mobility, was being compromised by \"Brexit myopia\".\n\nShe voted three times against Theresa May's Brexit agreement, saying it neither delivered on the promises made to Leave voters or gave younger Remain voters anything.\n\nWarning her party was morphing into The Brexit Party, she said she would support legislation to keep all Brexit \"options on the table\" and to ensure Parliament has a real say in the outcome.\n\nRory Stewart\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nThe former international development secretary released a video confirming he would vote against the government and explaining the reasons why.\n\nHe said claims a no-deal exit would be a \"clean and easy break\" from the EU were disingenuous as, in reality, it would lead to years of economic and political uncertainty.\n\nMr Stewart, who during the Tory leadership campaign accused Mr Johnson of not being straight about his views on no deal, suggested such an outcome would be \"remembered for 40 years\", and would permanently damage the party's reputation.\n\nOther MPs who rebelled:\n\nGreg Clark: The former business secretary was one of the strongest advocates of Theresa May's Brexit deal. He has said no deal would be \"ruinous\".\n\nSam Gyimah: The former universities minister said there was \"no mandate\" for a no-deal exit which would be \"damaging and disruptive\" for his constituents.\n\nAntoinette Sandbach: The MP for Eddisbury said it was \"important to act\" to stop any chance of no deal and she would put her constituents' interests ahead of her own.\n\nAlistair Burt: The former Middle East minister, a respected figure in the party, has said he has an \"fundamental and un-resolvable\" disagreement with the party leadership over Brexit and he will be standing down as MP for NE Bedfordshire at the next election.\n\nStephen Hammond: He has accused Tory Brexiteers of \"lecturing others\" about loyalty. He told the BBC's World at One he would \"reluctantly\" vote against the government.\n\nSir Nicholas Soames: Winston Churchill's grandson was among those who met the PM on Tuesday for last-ditch talks.\n\nMargot James: The former digital minister has been highly critical of no deal on social media and backed Mr Gauke's comments.\n\nRichard Harrington: The 61-year old has rebelled over Brexit before and recently announced he would stand down as MP for Watford at the next election.\n\nGuto Bebb: The Aberconwy MP, who is also quitting at the next election, says a vote against no deal is \"truer to Conservative tradition than anyone who traipses through the lobbies out of fear, opportunism or simply unthinking loyalty\".\n\nCaroline Nokes: The Romsey MP has said her constituents would be worse off under a no-deal Brexit and their futures mattered more than her own as a Conservative MP.\n\nEd Vaizey: The ex-culture minister has said a no-deal exit would hurt the digital economy although he told Buzzfeed News he had yet to decide which way to vote.\n\nSteve Brine: The former health minister said last week he was prepared to hold the PM to his claim a no-deal exit is a \"million to one chance\".\n\nAnne Milton: She has kept a low profile since quitting as a minister in July but attended a meeting with other likely rebels in Westminster earlier on Tuesday.\n\nRichard Benyon: The MP for Newbury is a former fisheries minister in the coalition government.", "description": "Which ex-ministers defied Boris Johnson by voting to stop a no-deal exit on 31 October?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E0EB/production/_108597575_mediaitem108596731.jpg"}
