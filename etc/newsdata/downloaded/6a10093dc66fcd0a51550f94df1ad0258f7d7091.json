His initial eight-week suspension was reduced after he agreed to see a sports psychologist.\n\nHe lost in the first round of the Zhuhai Championships on Wednesday, after which he said that he could sit out the rest of the season because of a collarbone injury.\n\nKyrgios has already pulled out of next week's China Open and will head home to Australia to recover.\n\n\"Unfortunately a collarbone injury I sustained at Laver Cup has escalated and has forced me to pull out of the Asian swing,\" Kyrgios wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"I'll be heading back to Australia to rest and recover. See you all soon,\" he added.", "description": "Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios received a suspended 16-week ban from the ATP on Thursday and was placed on probation for six months for \"aggravated behaviour\" following a number of on-court outbursts over the past year.
