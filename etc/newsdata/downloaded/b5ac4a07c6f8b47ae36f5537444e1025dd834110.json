The WWF team uses tele- or video-conferencing as much as possible. To reduce our flight carbon emissions at WWF-Australia, WWF-Australia has \u201cNo-fly January\u201d, which has resulted in a 70 per cent reduction in flights in that month. Some long train and bus trips have become part of my travel routine.\n\nO'Gorman uses the iNaturalist app to record sightings or look up unusual critters. Supplied\n\nWhat are your preferred airlines and your top frequent flyer loyalty cards?\n\nBecause we\u2019re a not-for-profit, we tend to go with the most cost-effective options, so I\u2019m a member of a number of frequent flyer programs, including Qantas. We offset all air travel using Gold Standard-certified offsets. When I visit the Kimberley region in Western Australia, I always stay at Kooljaman at Cape Leveque, an incredible eco-destination owned and run by the local Bardi Jawi people.\n\nWhat was your last trip?\n\nOne of the best things about my job is that we work everywhere from the boardroom to the Great Barrier Reef. On my last trip to north Queensland, I met with cane farmers on properties in the Burdekin working to reduce run-off onto the reef. Next day I was out on boats with local Indigenous rangers tagging sea turtles and meeting leading scientists to discuss the latest research. The Gudjuda Deck Cafe in Ayr is one of my favourite north Queensland stops.\n\nWhat's your top business travel tip?\n\nUse travel as an opportunity to meet and connect with your customers. For me, that means making the effort to meet the supporters, partners and communities we work with. Sometimes I\u2019m lucky enough to take part in on-ground conservation efforts, working with the wonderful people \u2013 and wildlife \u2013 of our country.", "description": "As CEO of WWF-Australia, Dermot O'Gorman does his fair share of travelling, but he tries to keep any environmental impact to a minimum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3235%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_181%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fa8c295c12fa7bab95fcbec3a01c941e20572108", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
