Eating meat, eggs and dairy products hurts the environment in a number of different ways. Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. While there is less methane in the atmosphere than other greenhouse gases, it is around 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change. More trees are cut down to convert land for crop growing, as around a third of all grain produced in the world is used to feed animals raised for human consumption. Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast. As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. Overall, studies have shown that going vegetarian can reduce your carbon emissions from food by half. Going vegan can reduce this further still.\n\n'The next generation requires us to act quickly to reduce carbon footprints in every sphere of life.\n\n'Breastfeeding is a part of this jigsaw, and urgent investment is needed across the sector.'\n\nThe researchers found just 41 per cent of the 141million babies born annually are exclusively breastfed until six months.\n\nThey then delved into the carbon footprint of formula milk, publishing their claims in the British Medical Journal.\n\nMost baby formulas are based on powdered cows' milk. Methane from livestock is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to a third of global warming.\n\nThe powdered milk can only be safely made with water that has been heated to at least 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F).\n\nHeating the formula gives off the same amount of energy use as charging 200million smartphones a year, the researchers say.\n\nA 2009 study showed that 550 million infant formula cans are added to landfills every year, equating to 86,000 tons of metal and 364,000 tons of paper.\n\nExperts warn that, on top of decimating the environment, low breastfeeding rates deprive thousands of babies of important health benefits.\n\nBreast milk protects babies from infections and provides essential vitamins and minerals.\n\nAs powdered cows' milk is not as nutritious, the formula is stuffed with additives such as palm, coconut, and various oils.\n\nExtracting these ingredients adds to the damage inflicted on the environment, the researchers argue.\n\nMothers switching from formula to breast milk would be like taking 77,500 cars off the road each year, environmentalists say\n\nOther costs to the environment include transportation at multiple stages in the production, marketing and sale of breastmilk substitutes.\n\nWriting in the study, the researchers said: 'In contrast, breastfeeding uses few resources and produces minimal or zero waste. This is a societal responsibility to which we can all contribute.'\n\nIS BREAST REALLY BEST? Breast milk contains antibodies passed on from the mother, which boost a baby's immune system and help it fight infections and viruses. There is also evidence that breastfed babies have higher IQs and are less at risk of obesity - because formula milk is higher in fat. Breastfeeding is also deemed beneficial for the mother because it enables her to bond with the newborn. It also enables her to lose weight, as nursing mothers burn up to 500 calories a day extra. In Britain, health watchdog NICE recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for their first six months. Yet just 1 per cent of mothers actually follow this guidance.\n\nThey added that a 'multi-targeted approach is required', calling for investment in medical education and better access to milk banks.\n\n'Cultural change is long overdue to remove the myriad obstacles to breastfeeding faced by new mothers,' the team wrote.\n\n'The UK government recently opened a public consultation to help improve breastfeeding rates, which offers an opportunity for all of us to act.'\n\nSue Ashmore, director of Unicef UK\u2019s Baby Friendly Initiative said: \u2018Infant feeding is a public health imperative for which government, policy makers, communities and families all share responsibility.\n\n'We need to change the conversation around breastfeeding in the UK and acknowledge that improving outcomes for all children includes reducing unnecessary consumption and production of infant formula.\u2019\n\nA study of 9,000 people last year found those who were breastfed went on to earn more as an adult.\n\nScientists found those who were breastfed in infancy had 10 per cent higher household income when they were over 50.\n\nThey believe breastfeeding improves the development of the brain and reduces the risk of allergies and illness.\n\nOnly 34 per cent of British children are breastfed until six months, compared to 49 per cent in the US, 50 per cent in Germany and 62 per cent in Switzerland.\n\nTHE 11 COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST RATES OF BREASTFEEDING Sri Lanka Bhutan Nepal Madagascar Niger Rwanda Kenya Gambia Burundi Uruguay Peru 99.4% 99.3% 99.1% 99% 98.8% 98.8% 98.7% 98.7% 98.7% 98.7% 98.7%\n\nTHE 10 COUNTRIES WITH THE LOWEST RATES OF BREASTFEEDING Ireland France US Spain UK Germany Italy Republic of Korea Montenegro Guyana Source: UNICEF 55% 63% 74.4% 77% 81% 82% 86% 88% 88.3% 89%\n\nAnd only one in every 200 children in the UK - just 0.5 per cent - are breastfed until the age of 12 months, the lowest level in the world.\n\nThe study, led by Queen's University Belfast, suggested spending money on public programmes to increase breastfeeding will reap rewards in the long-term.\n\nIt comes after NICE published a report warning that inhalers also contributing to carbon output.\n\nThe announcement was the first time the health watchdog ever, published information on the carbon footprint of a medicine or device.\n\nThe devices have an estimated carbon footprint of 500g of carbon dioxide equivalent per dose.\n\nFive doses from a metered dose inhaler can have the same carbon emissions as a nine-mile (14km) trip in a car, Nice said.", "description": "Scientists from Imperial College London showed the switch could see the UK slash its carbon output by 1,500 tonnes annually.
