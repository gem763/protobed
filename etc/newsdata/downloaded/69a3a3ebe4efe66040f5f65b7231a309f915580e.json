He was being chased by a fire-hose.\n\n\"I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in the chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of the book firmly set in my mind.\"\n\n(Image: Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nStephen and Tabitha stayed in Room 217, which the hotel itself describes as a room with \"high paranormal activity\" (since their stay, the room's been renamed the Stephen King Suite).\n\nHowever, it's not the only room where there are said to be some paranormal presences.\n\n(Image: Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nRooms 401, 407 and 408 are also particularly popular with ghost hunters, as guests have reported everything from waking up to a ghostly cowboy stood at the end of their bed, to general bumps in the night such a lights flickering off and on, doors slamming shut abruptly, and mysterious shadows.\n\n(Image: Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel's Concert Hall is where some guests have reported hearing a piano playing ominous tunes in the dead of the night - but no performers could be found.\n\nJust like Danny meets the identical twin sisters in The Shining, guests have had spooky experiences with ghostly children - in fact, there are reports of giggling children on the fourth floor.\n\nThere's been so much paranormal activity that the Stanley Hotel even runs night tours where you can explore the hotel's history, architecture and folklore all after dark.\n\nYou don't need to be a hotel guest to take part, although you do need to book in advance - you can find out more on the Stanley Hotel website .\n\nHowever, if it's the filming locations for Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of The Shining that you're after, then it's actually The Timberline Lodge in Oregon that needs to be on your list, as this is the hotel which was used for exterior shots of the Overlook.", "description": "Stephen King came up with The Shining after a stay at the creepy hotel where guests report seeing ghosts and hearing ominous sounds", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Moviepix", "Lightrocket Via Getty Images", "Denver Post Via Getty Images", "Warner Bros Hawk Films Kobal Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748592.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Shining-1980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
