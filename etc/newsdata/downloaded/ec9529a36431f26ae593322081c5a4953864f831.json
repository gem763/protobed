There was even a man wearing a black sleeveless shirt and blue suede cowboy boots.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera began regular Sunday-afternoon staged performances for the first time in its 136-year history with Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot,\u201d an effort to boost ticket sales and revenue.\n\n\u201cI love it. Outstanding,\u201d said E.G. Fisher, a 51-year-old New Yorker who was attending the performance with his 15-year-old daughter, Bella, a high school junior. \u201cWe get to watch the whole opera and don\u2019t have to go home early and do homework.\u201d\n\nAs part of three-year labor contracts agreed to in the summer of 2018, the Met has the right to present up to 17 Sunday matinees this season and 27 in 2020-21. Any Sunday show will be followed by a Monday off for both performances and orchestra rehearsals. And Tuesday-morning rehearsals will have limits.\n\n\u201cOn a weekend people can relax and devote three or four hours that an opera takes,\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said. \u201cThis is not confined to the Met. Sunday matinees on Broadway have been hugely successful.\u201d\n\nLast season saw 75 percent of tickets sold and 69 percent of box office revenue capacity realized factoring in discounts, down from 90 percent in the 1990s. The Met said 78 percent of Sunday\u2019s tickets were sold to paying customers and next Sunday\u2019s performance of the Gershwins\u2019 \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d is sold out.\n\nThe Met has long presented seven performances a week from fall through spring: evenings from Monday through Saturday, plus a Saturday matinee. The Saturday afternoon shows have been featured since 1931 on radio, a series that runs from December through the end of the season. High-definition video simulcasts to theaters started in 2006-07 and now transmit about 10 matinees per season.\n\nThere were Grand Sunday Night Concerts from 1883-1944 plus the occasional Sunday-night staged gala, including the premieres of Herbert Graf\u2019s production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cOtello\u201d with Georg Solti conducting in 1963 and of Marc Chagall\u2019s designs of Mozart\u2019s \u201cDie Zauberfloete (The Magic Flute)\u201d in 1967.\n\nBut moving forward, there will be regular Sunday afternoons and fewer Monday evenings \u2014 traditionally the dressiest night of the week at the Met, with a marked increase of men in white tie and tailcoats.\n\n\u201cThis will be a massive shift in lifestyle for all of us,\u201d said Brad Gemeinhardt, a third horn and representative of the Met\u2019s orchestra committee. \u201cFor those of us with families and children in school, we now have committed another weekend day to the Met, which means we no longer have a full day to spend with our families.\u201d\n\nAs part of the labor contract, orchestra members receive an additional personal day that, with the permission of the orchestra manager, can be used to be let off from a weekend performance. Because there are more Mondays off, the Met has had to alter its schedule of final dress rehearsals, which usually take place three or four days before the first performance of a run.\n\n\u201cThat complicates the puzzle a little bit,\u201d Met assistant general manager for performance John Sellars said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing grand opera repertory, you\u2019ve got multiple operas in performance and have multiple operas in rehearsal all simultaneously, and you have to consider how many days rest in between performances singers need.\u201d\n\nThe audience gave a huge, louder-than-usual ovation to music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin and the cast highlighted by Christine Goerke (Turandot), Yusif Eyvazov (Calaf), Eleonora Buratto (Liu) and James Morris (Timur). The performance was dedicated to Franco Zeffirelli, who created the production in 1987 and died in June, and longtime Met tenor Marcello Giordani, who died of a heart attack on Saturday at age 56.\n\nMolly Livingston, a 17-year-old aspiring singer from Knoxville, Tennessee, and her 54-year-old father Mark, who commutes regularly from Tennessee to New York for work, were attending their first Met performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d she said.\n\nHer dad is reluctant to attend shows at night when he has work the next morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of nice to come in the middle of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had lunch before. Maybe we\u2019ll have dinner afterwards.\u201d", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Some in the audience wore tuxedos and evening gowns, others wore jeans and sneakers.
