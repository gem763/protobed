REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri/File Photo\n\nEthiopia, the source of the Blue Nile which joins the White Nile in Khartoum and runs on to Egypt, says the dam will not disrupt the river\u2019s flow and hopes the project will transform it into a power hub for the electricity-hungry region.\n\nA diplomatic standoff has heightened tension between the countries, which have held on-again-off-again talks over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) for years.\n\nThey signed a \u201cdeclaration of principles\u201d with Sudan in 2015 as a basis for negotiations, but no breakthrough has been made since.\n\nEgypt relies on the Nile for up to 90% of its fresh water, and fears the dam, which is being built in Ethiopia close to the border with Sudan, will restrict already scarce supplies.\n\n\u201cEthiopia\u2019s moving forward with the operation and filling of the Renaissance Dam is unacceptable and a clear violation of the Declaration of Principles and will have negative consequences for stability in the region,\u201d Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said in parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe call on the international community to shoulder its responsibility in finding a solution that satisfies all parties.\u201d\n\nAfter talks stalled, Egypt submitted a proposal on Aug. 1, including conditions over filling the reservoir.\n\nEarlier this month, Ethiopia rejected that proposal, calling it \u201can effort to maintain a self-claimed colonial era-based water allocation and veto power on any project in the Nile system\u201d.\n\nLast week, Egypt said the talks were deadlocked, accusing Ethiopia of \u201cinflexibility\u201d and calling for international mediation. Ethiopia rejected that call.\n\nEgypt has sought assurances that the dam will not significantly cut the river\u2019s flow to its rapidly growing population.\n\nSudan also hopes to benefit from electricity produced by the GERD.", "description": "Egypt denounced Ethiopia on Wednesday for moving forward with building and operating a hyropower dam on the Nile, which Cairo worries will threaten already scarce water supplies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438879410&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981G2-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
