UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is convening a climate summit aimed at galvanising action to keep temperatures below 2C \u2013 and preferably to 1.5C. Guterres wants world political and business leaders to come up with workable plans to almost halve carbon emissions by 2020, on the road to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\nBut as older generations debate what is achievable, younger millennials and members of Generation Z are leveraging their grief and anger at the world they are likely to inherit and are urging fast and effective action - right now. Some young climate activists believe there is a role for the UN, with many attending a separate Youth Climate Summit at the world body's headquarters on Saturday. But they are also leading direct action - including climate strikes - to shake people out of their complacency and highlight that a catastrophe lies ahead unless carbon emissions are not drastically cut.\n\n\n\nIn the final part of our series tied to the Covering Climate Now initiative, we\u2019ll meet young climate activists and thinkers who are battling to avert a global calamity.
