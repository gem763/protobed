There are also fears that jihadists held in jails in Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Syria could escape.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that the FTFs could reach the European continent unnoticed and uncontrolled,\u201d Van Tigchelt said referring, using an acronym for \u201cforeign terrorist fighters\u201d, of which there were about 55 in Syria with links to Belgium.\n\n\u201cThis is unlikely, but you should be clear that this is not impossible. And it is unlikely as long as - among other things - that the deal that Turkey struck with the EU holds.\u201d\n\nThe European Union and Turkey reached a deal in 2016 under which Turkey agreed to take back migrants, crack down on human traffickers and improve conditions for refugees in return for 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of aid and visa liberalisation.\n\nSome EU countries are wary of doing anything to anger Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who last week warned that he would \u201copen the gates\u201d and send 3.6 million refugees to Europe if it did not back him in his Syria offensive.\n\nDiplomats and officials have told Reuters that European states are trying to fast-track a plan to move thousands of foreign IS militants out of Syrian prison camps and into Iraq given that the outbreak of fresh conflict in Syria raised the risk of jihadists escaping or returning home.\n\n\u201cAn uncontrolled return is the biggest nightmare of the security services,\u201d Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw told the committee.\n\nThe stated objective of Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria is to carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it is hosting. Ankara also seeks to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish separatist insurgents in Turkey.", "description": "Two Islamic State militants from Belgium have escaped custody in northern Syria in the course of Turkey's offensive against Kurdish forces there, the head of Belgium's security assessment agency said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
