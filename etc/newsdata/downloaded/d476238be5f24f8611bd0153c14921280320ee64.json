She presented breaking up tech companies as one of the most powerful tools the government has for taking them on.\n\n\"I\u2019m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy,\" Warren said. \"It\u2019s time to fight back.\"\n\nFew other candidates have officially gotten behind her efforts.\n\nEven Sen.

He called for appointing antitrust enforcers \"who will take on these huge monopolies.\"\n\n\"We need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business and protect consumers by ending the price fixing,\" Sanders said, noting that he also believes there is a monopoly issue in Wall Street and health care.\n\nThe argument comes as regulators and policymakers have significantly ratcheted up their investigations into the top tech companies, probing whether they use their dominant market positions to quash competitors and take advantage of consumers.\n\nYang, who has sought to present himself as the most tech-savvy candidate, has argued that he believes a legislative framework that treats \"data as property\" would protect users from being exploited by companies like Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Absolutely excesses in technology, and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move, but we also have to be realistic that competition does not solve all of the problems,\" Yang said. \"It's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country.\"\n\nHe said we \"need new solutions and a new toolkit.\u201d\n\nO'Rourke, meanwhile, called for \"very tough, very clear, very transparent rules of the road\" around how companies can amass and treat user data.\n\nAnd Sen.

Twitter says it treats speech from politicians differently, keeping it online under the assumption that it is \"newsworthy\" even when the posts violate Twitter's policies.\n\nIt marked the first time the Democratic presidential candidates have criticized the companies at length on a national stage since the start of the campaign, exposing the enormous shift in public opinion since Democrats and Republicans alike sought to court companies like Facebook and Google during elections before 2016.\n\nSen.
