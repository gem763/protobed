Whittaker hasn\u2019t fought since June 2018 when he went five rounds in a rematch with Yoel Romero and came away with a split-decision win. Meanwhile, Adesanya has defeated the likes of Anderson Silva, Kelvin Gastelum, Derek Brunson and Brad Tavares in the past 15 months.\n\nIn the co-main, Dan Hooker (18-8) is getting his wish after calling out Al Iaquinta (14-4-1) after an impressive first-round knockout of James Vick at UFC San Antonio in July. Iaquinta was quick to respond and accept the challenge though he was coming off a tough loss to Donald Cerrone in May.\n\nUFC 243 main card (Live now on PPV)\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRobert Whittaker vs. Israel Adesanya\n\nDan Hooker vs. Al Iaquinta\n\nTai Tuivasa vs. Serghei Spivac\n\nDhiego Lima def.
