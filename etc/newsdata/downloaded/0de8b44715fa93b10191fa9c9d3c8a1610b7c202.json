The trust has complicated legal efforts by accusers hoping to get a hold of Epstein\u2019s money.\n\nEpstein \u201ctook steps to have those corporations fraudulently transfer assets into an estate that would shield them from the claims of victims following his death,\u201d Araoz\u2019s attorney Dan Keiser said on a phone call with reporters. \u201cEvery penny of his estate should be available.\u201d\n\nAraoz claimed Epstein sexually assaulted and raped her when she was 14 and 15 years old in 2001 and 2002, at Epstein\u2019s New York City mansion.\n\nLesley Groff was identified as Epstein\u2019s secretary; Rosalyn Fontanilla was identified as Epstein\u2019s maid; and Cimberly Espinosa was identified as Epstein\u2019s executive assistant at one of his companies.\n\nEPSTEIN USED NAME OF WEALTHY DUBAI BUSINESSMAN TO ACQUIRE 2ND CARIBBEAN ISLAND, REPORT SAYS\n\nAccording to Araoz, Groff would contact her directly to schedule and facilitate one-on-one visits between her and Epstein, and he sexually assaulted her during the first such meeting.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that on multiple occasions, Fontanilla would serve wine, cheese and crackers to Araoz as she waited to see Epstein at his home. The documents noted Fontanilla died in 2016.\n\nEspinosa also was accused of scheduling sexual encounters between Epstein and Araoz.\n\nGroff\u2019s lawyer, Michael Bachner, denied the allegations. \u201cAs an executive assistant to Epstein, Lesley Groff worked as part of a professional staff that included in-house attorneys, accountants, an office manager and other office staff. Lesley\u2019s job included making appointments for Mr. Epstein as directed by him, taking his messages, and setting up high-level meetings with CEOs, business executives, scientists, politicians and celebrities. At no time during Ms. Groff\u2019s employment with Mr. Epstein did she ever engage in any misconduct.\u201d\n\nEspinosa could not be reached for comment; it was unclear if she had an attorney.\n\nMeanwhile, Araoz\u2019s lawyers said while they have been unsuccessful in finding the whereabouts of Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend and accused primary co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, they believed her whereabouts will emerge before long.\n\n\u201cWe have reason to believe that the FBI knows her location,\u201d Araoz\u2019s attorney Kimberly Lerner told reporters Tuesday. \u201cThey certainly didn\u2019t deny knowing her whereabouts. I would be shocked if she wasn\u2019t one of their targets and I believe that they know her whereabouts. I don\u2019t believe that they are going to let her leave the country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible Maxwell, identified as Epstein\u2019s alleged madam in his sex-trafficking operation, could have left the country already.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe FBI is scheduled to update Epstein\u2019s accusers on their investigation into his possible co-conspirators at the end of October.\n\n\u201cOur pursuit of justice did not die when Epstein took his own life,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cIt has just taken on a different face, the face of all the enablers and co-conspirators that allowed him to violate a 14-year-old child.\u201d\n\nFox News' Maria Paronich and Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.", "description": "One of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accusers is suing the millionaire\u2019s companies and estate alleging the convicted sex offender fraudulently funneled money from his companies and non-profits into a trust just two days before his suicide in a last-minute effort to shield his money from his alleged victims.", "authors": ["Bryan Llenas"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/07/694940094001_6084342099001_6084350341001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
