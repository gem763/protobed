( MU ) has pretty much traded sideways the past 12 months after its 2018 decline. Are prices strong enough now for more upside or are we likely to grind sideways into year-end?\n\nLet's check out the latest charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of MU, below, we can see some positive clues that we haven't seen on MU in a while. Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and the positively sloped 200-day moving average line.\n\nAt the beginning of August we can see the 50-day line cross above the 200-day average line for what is commonly called a golden cross. This moving average crossover signal is generally considered bullish and it can be successful in long-trending markets.\n\nThe trading volume looks like it has diminished in July and August, which is not bullish, but the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has risen the past two months which is constructive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line and just crossed to the upside for a new buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MU, below, we can see some technical improvement. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is up over the last three months and the MACD oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MU, below, we can see a possible upside price projection of $57. A trade at $49.03 is needed to give us a breakout, however.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The charts and indicators of MU are looking better than they have in a while, but with volume shrinking in the past two months I am not sure they will achieve liftoff. Let's keep MU on the shopping list and see if volume improves.", "description": "Micron Technology: Looking Better but There Is a Missing Ingredient...MU", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Micron Technology", "Looking Better But There Is A Missing Ingredient", "The Charts", "Indicators Of Mu Are Looking Better Than They Have In A While.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Tom Graff"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/ade1cc02-4c0e-11e9-b5b3-11e45a72525f.jpg"}
