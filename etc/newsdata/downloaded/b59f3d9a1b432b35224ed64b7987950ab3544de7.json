The fly-overs are specifically intended to collect data on military forces and activities, according to the Arms Control Association.\n\nAlthough the administration has not announced any formal action that would change the U.S. role in the agreement, Mr. Engel said the White House has cited \u201cimplementation concerns\u201d on behalf of Russia and has placed restrictions on Russian flights over the U.S.\n\nHe said, however, that the concerns \u201cdo not rise to the level of material breach of the treaty.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to White House National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, Mr. Engel requested his \u201cpersonal engagement\u201d to preserve the U.S. position within the treaty, which Mr. Engel said \u201ccontinues to serve American national security interests and is particularly important as a check against further Russian aggression against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr. Engel called on the administration to engage in a \u201ctransparent process,\u201d including an interagency review, and to inform Congress of any potential policy changes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
