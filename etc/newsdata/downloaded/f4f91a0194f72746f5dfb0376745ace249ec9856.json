A failure of firms to spend on factories and machines will have long-reaching implications. This is one reason why economists are pulling down their forecasts for next year too.\n\nBut it is also unhelpful that growth in some of our biggest trading partners, such as Germany, has run into problems. The bright spot remains job creation - but that too could falter.\n\nThis sluggishness ignited a mood shift among policymakers. Even those members of the Bank's interest rate panel who previously favoured a rise in the cost of borrowing now think their next move could be a cut - deal or no deal.\n\nThe question for them, grappling with as much uncertainty as the rest of us, is when.\n\nWhat does it mean for the future?\n\nThe data sparked some economists to revise up their expectations for the third quarter.\n\nMr Wishart said the the economy could grow by 0.4% in the third quarter, more than he had originally expected.\n\nHowever, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said that while the data \"has put to bed fears of the UK economy falling into recession in the third quarter of 2019\", he was cautious about the future.\n\nHe said there could be \"problems ahead in the fourth quarter as heightened Brexit-related uncertainty takes a toll on both business investment and consumer confidence.\"\n\nUncertainty about Brexit was also mentioned by Mr Williamson. who expects the UK to expand by 1% in 2019 but by just 0.5% in 2020.\n\n\"These growth projections assume a Brexit delay beyond 31st October and that the UK and EU will eventually achieve a comprehensive agreement on future relations. However, a no-deal Brexit would likely throw the UK into a prolonged recession,\" he said.", "description": "The economy contracted in August, but is still expected to have grown in the third quarter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15E57/production/_109178698_filmproduction_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
