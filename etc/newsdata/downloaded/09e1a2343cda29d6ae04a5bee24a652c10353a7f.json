But her own star has also brightly shined since founding a luxury line of beauty products in 2013. Tilbury\u2019s namesake brand is a hit at department stores and Sephoras around the world; one Matte Revolution lipstick in Pillow Talk is sold every two minutes, according to the brand\u2019s website (though Duchess Meghan reportedly prefers the lipstick in Very Victoria ).\n\nThe company opened its first U.S. standalone store in Los Angeles in July. The 46-year-old British-born, Ibiza-raised entrepreneur shared with Penta her favorite places and things.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is\u2026 Ibiza! It\u2019s where I grew up and my parents still live there; it feels like home to me. It is such a magical and nourishing place. I visit every year and some of my favorite places to visit on the island for dinner are La Formentere\u00f1a, La Escollera, and Bambuddha.\n\nMy favorite piece of art is\u2026 my talented father, Lance, is the most amazing painter\u2014he taught me all about colors, tonality, and contrasts when I was growing up. I love visiting art galleries in London when I get the chance, like The Serpentine, V&A, White Cube, Tate, and The National Gallery.\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 Madame by Helena Rubinstein. This is the inspirational story of someone who revolutionized women\u2019s lives through cosmetics. I re-read this autobiography all the time.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is... supporting the incredible charity Women for Women International. It\u2019s a charity that is so close to my heart, and I am a Global Ambassador for them. [She\u2019s also pledged a donation of \u00a31 million (US$1.2 million)]. Women for Women International supports women who live in some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places. Women enroll in the charity\u2019s year-long training program, where they learn how to earn and save money, improve their family\u2019s health, and make their voices heard at home and in their community.\n\nEver since I first met Brita [ Fernandez Schmidt, Senior Vice President for Global Partnerships] and heard the stories of women in the Women for Women International program, I was shocked, devastated, and determined to do something to make a real difference.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again... I have been lucky enough to take so many amazing trips to so many incredible places, it\u2019s hard to pick just one! For my wonderful husband George\u2019s 50th birthday, we went to Italy for a week of celebrations. Italy is such a beautiful country full of history and full of magic. It was like stepping into a portal to another world\u2014lots of dancing, fun, and delicious food. Another one of my favorite ever trips was when my husband and I went to the Maldives with lots of our gorgeous friends and family\u2014it was such a huge party. The island we stayed on was magical and I was surrounded by such wonderful, wild characters. I also love Cuixmala in Mexico\u2014we stayed there for New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThe next destination on my travel itinerary is... Ibiza. I go every year with my family to relax and unwind, it recharges my batteries.\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning are... my beautiful boys Flynn and Valentine are my alarm to get me up in the morning. They\u2019re up at 7 a.m. and come bouncing in waking me up.\n\nThe restaurant/bar in my hometown that I love to take a visitor is\u2026 there are so many restaurants in my hometown of London which I love to visit, but some of my favorites would be Casa Cruz, Laylow, and Annabels.\n\nA person who inspired me to do what I do is... my glamorous mother, Patsy Tilbury. She is one of my biggest inspirations and has always been full of great beauty advice. She introduced me to the positive, powerful world of makeup and beauty. I remember watching her from a very young age, with her perfectly painted red nails, applying her red lipstick. She would never leave her house without makeup on. She taught me about the confidence-boosting powers that wearing makeup brings and how she felt instantly empowered the moment she put on her favorite red lipstick. She always says, a red lip can take you anywhere!", "description": "The entrepreneur loves Ibiza, London\u2019s art galleries, and the charity Women for Women International", "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103919/social"}
