A $260 ghost-detecting teddy bear and debunked nonsense about EVPs (ghost noises), mostly. But, in the spirit of Halloween, we\u2019ll indulge the pseudoscience. Because you never know when the impossible might become reality.\n\nThe ghost hunters responsible for ensuring that five-bedroom four-bath colonial isn\u2019t raging with demonic forces from the other side are from the Carolina Paranormal Unit. The group\u2019s website is a piece of art.\n\nSure we know ghosts don\u2019t exist, but do we really know that ghosts don\u2019t exist? What if scientists at MIT\u2019s secret underground ghost-hunting facility (you know it\u2019s there Dean Chandrakasan, stop avoiding my emails) finally proved that poltergeists were real? If you were about to sink your life\u2019s savings into a new home for your family, wouldn\u2019t you want to know if it was haunted?\n\nSo far, all the listings we\u2019ve looked at were declared free of evil spirits.\n\nH/t: Charlotte Observer\n\nRead next: Alexa can now speak Espa\u00f1ol in the US", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fghosthunters.jpg&signature=e99e68b270e59ae749d3d7bd2baac949", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
