Hodge didn\u2019t appear to use his arms in making the tackle.\n\nWorld Rugby said Hodge will attend a disciplinary hearing in Tokyo on a date to be confirmed. If he\u2019s found guilty, Hodge will be banned for at least two weeks unless there are mitigating factors. His ban could be as much as 6-10 weeks if the disciplinary panel views the offense as serious.\n\nThe imposing utility back has played 38 tests for Australia and scored one of the Wallabies\u2019 six tries in the win over Fiji. Two-time champion Australia is set to face Six Nations winner Wales in a crucial Pool D match next Sunday.\n\nYato left the field with concussion after the tackle and missed the rest of the match. He could be ruled out of Fiji\u2019s next game against Uruguay on Wednesday.\n\nFiji players complained about the tackle at the time of the incident and asked referee Ben O\u2019Keefe to refer it to the Television Match Official. But neither O\u2019Keefe nor the TMO took any action.\n\nUntil the tackle, Yato was among the best players on the field and had the Australians under constant pressure.\n\nHe had already scored one try and Fiji was leading Australia when the big, powerful backrower had to leave the field. Fiji coach John McKee said losing Yato had a \u201cbig impact\u201d on the game as Australia came from behind to win.\n\nWorld Rugby says it\u2019s taking a tough stance on illegal tackles where contact is made to the head. The infringement can lead to a straight red card in games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Australia winger Reece Hodge was cited Sunday for a dangerous tackle on Fiji flanker Peceli Yato in their Rugby World Cup group game and could be facing a ban of between two and 10 weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_76499_c0-101-2428-1516_s1770x1032.jpg?a81960d2604dbe2cd9119cf49f978e42b041fe0f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
