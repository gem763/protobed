The banner was a direct shot at general manager Bruce Allen, who has been in charge of the Redskins for the last 10 years. The team has only made the playoffs twice in that span.\n\nNEW YORK JETS' JAMAL ADAMS WINS APPEAL OF FINE, PLANS TO USE MONEY IN A SPECIAL WAY\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, retired banking executive Chuck Coltman paid $1,600 to have the banner fly over the stadium.\n\n\u201cUnder Bruce Allen, it\u2019s just been horrible,\u201d Coltman, a longtime Redskins supporter, told The Washington Post. \u201cIt seems to me it\u2019s a total lack of understanding of how to manage something. You can\u2019t allow internal competition and internal politics to interfere with the objective. \u2026 That\u2019s what Bruce Allen has done historically, and he\u2019s going to keep doing it unless we change it.\u201d\n\nExpressing his frustrations with the club, Coltman said he understands if team owner Daniel Snyder wants to keep Allen around to try and get a stadium deal but he needs to realize that the fan base\u2019s resentment continues to grow with each passing season.\n\nCOLIN KAEPERNICK READY TO PLAY IN NFL AGAIN, QUARTERBACK'S AGENTS SAY IN MEMO TO DEBUNK 'FALSE NARRATIVES'\n\n\u201cI want to want to go to every game, but you\u2019ve gotta have a winner every once in a while,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThe NFL needs a good team in Washington. If Dan Snyder is a good businessman, he needs to realize he\u2019s losing his customer base. He\u2019s not going to sell the team. If he wants to keep Allen for the stadium deal, fine, but darn it, keep him out of the politics of the football team. Let\u2019s get a pro.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins defeated the Dolphins, 17-16. The Redskins got two touchdown passes from Case Keenum but the defense nearly blew it at the end. Ryan Fitzpatrick led Miami down the field to put the game within a point after he found Devante Parker in the end zone.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMiami elected to go for two points instead of trying the game with a field goal. However, a short pass to Kenyan Drake was dropped and Washington picked up the win.", "description": "Even as the Washington Redskins were on the road to take on the Miami Dolphins, the team\u2019s front office personnel is still taking a beating over the franchise\u2019s disappointing season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
