Even if you have a car half a second faster it's still almost impossible to beat them in qualifying.\n\n\"As you can see with Mercedes, they have the best car compared to them and still in qualifying they are lacking compared to them. It's insane the speed difference they have.\"\n\nAsked if he knew where that power leap had come from, Verstappen said: \"No otherwise of course we would have implemented that in our engine.\n\n\"We keep pushing from our side to try and gain more power but the deficit is really big.\n\n\"When we look to Mercedes and Renault I think we are looking strong, we are not really lacking that much.\n\n\"Of course Mercedes normally run more downforce than us but we are close to them, so I guess that's already a good achievement.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Charles Leclerc thinks questions about the legality of Ferrari's Formula 1 engines are an attempt to \"destabilise\" his team - which he insists is not worried about the situation", "authors": ["Scott Mitchell", "Jack Benyon", "Jonathan Noble"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R0wyuuVt.eieK.5hgpFRuA--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/6612edcd037ba19a1888a671feddd296", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
