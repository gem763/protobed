There will be azalea and acer leaves along with the evergreen conifers.\n\n'It has been very satisfying to use so many skills, and to have done every task ourselves. All but two of all the plants in our garden have been planted by us.\n\n'What is rather pleasing is an aerial photograph appears to show a face of an owl in the garden. This was never intended but a very lovely accident.'\n\nDespite the extraordinary heavy rainfall in recent weeks, the incredibly dramatic colours of the autumn leaves are joining the beautiful apricot shade begonias that amazingly are still flowering in Walsall, West Midlands\n\nGreen-fingered Marie, 31, is pictured tending to the lawn, while her husband Tony works on the border bushes in Walsall\n\nThe couple, who have four grown-up children and four grandchildren, spend two hours a day lovingly maintaining the plants and bushes. Tony is pictured tending to his masterpiece garden\n\nOld pictures from the 1980s show just how much work the couple have done to transform their muddy lawn and broken rockery into the wonderous creation it is today.\n\nThe garden has become so popular the couple's home has even made it onto several unofficial tourist trails in the Black Country.\n\nMrs Newton added: 'We've had over 14,000 people from 48 different countries come and visit our garden over the years which is just so touching.\n\n'Some Chinese students came to visit our garden and told us that it was used as an example in one of their lectures.\n\n'We spend around two hours a day in the garden but it can be more or less depending on the weather.\n\nThe plot totals just a third of an acre but is packed with as many as 3,000 different types of plants, trees and flowers\n\nMarie and Tony's garden in the industrial heartlands of Walsall, West Midlands, is nicknamed 'four seasons' on account of its year-round appeal. In autumn the colours include yellows, reds, oranges and purples\n\nThe garden has become so popular the couple's home has even made it onto several unofficial tourist trails in the Black Country. Marie is pictured raking leaves up on her perfectly-kept lawn\n\nThe Newtons have also inadvertently created what appears to be a huge image of an owl using the patio and flowerbeds which is only visible from above\n\n'There is always something to do or a flower or shrub to tend. It has become quite an obsession.\n\n'We have grown some of the flowers ourselves from the seeds that have dropped from the other flowers.'\n\nRetired GP Mr Newton added: 'First we made it child friendly for our kids but as the years went by we moved on to planting and growing our own flowers and plants.\n\n'There has been a lot of trial and error to get the garden way it is now. A lot of our plants are now 30 years old or more.\n\n'We've got a vast amount of colour and plants all year around. We try and add to the garden every year but at this time of year it is simply glorious.'\n\nWalking in an autumn wonderland!
