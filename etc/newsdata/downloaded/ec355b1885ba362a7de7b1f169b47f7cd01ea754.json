What the proposal does is it rises to meet that concern, by way of all the various mechanism that come within it.\u201d\n\nThe control order suggestion does not address the Australian government\u2019s concerns about the risk of an extraction operation, which Condon said was a separate issue.\n\nFamilies urge government to reconsider rescuing Australians in Syria Read more\n\n\u201cBut our position in relation to extraction process is that we\u2019ve had multiple journalists flooding into the camp this week and by their reports it\u2019s relatively safe during the ceasefire period,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Kurdish authorities have said to us they\u2019ll do everything they can to assist the extraction \u2013 whether that\u2019s delivering people to the border or an embassy in Erbil or wherever.\n\n\u201cIn our dealings with the Kurdish they\u2019ve been incredibly careful and helpful \u2026 but the request has to come from the Australian government. My view is it\u2019s a lack of political will at the moment, and I can understand that, which is why this control order proposal is sensible.\u201d\n\nThe orders can be varied to prevent a person from being in certain places, associating with certain people, or accessing particular kinds of technology such as the internet, and can also require the person to be subject to curfews and monitoring.\n\nThe orders last for a maximum of 12 months or three months if the subject is between the ages of 14 and 18. They cannot be applied on children under the age of 14.\n\nKamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter and three grandchildren are trapped in the camp, said the proposal attempted to find a solution for the women and children within the legal framework the minister had created.\n\n\u201cWe were really motivated by concerns for the children, they need to be removed from that environment and we are trying to find a way where that might be possible,\u201d Dabboussy said.\n\nDabboussy represents a group of 63 Australians \u2013 19 women and 44 children \u2013 and said all 19 women had indicated they would accept a control order as a condition of repatriation to Australia.\n\nDabboussy said he understood the government\u2019s position that some of the women, such as his daughter Mariam, were tricked or coerced into travelling to Syria but that others went willingly to the conflict zone.\n\n\u201cWithout any admission of guilt, all of the women have agreed to accepting these orders if it means the children can removed from harm,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Guardian understands the government is not inclined to accept the group\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cWe are attempting to cooperate, attempting to be partners in this, and to communicate directly with government, by making this proposal,\u201d Dabboussy told the Guardian. \u201cIf these conditions are not acceptable to the government, we ask what are the conditions that are acceptable to government?\n\n\u201cWe are offering to work with law enforcement, we know that the means exist to move these people out of the camp without endangering any other Australians, it can be done: we are looking to bridge the divide, for the sake of avoiding any more harm to these children.\u201d\n\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, told reporters on Saturday the question of extraction was one for government, as he did not receive national security briefings. However, he said control orders were made to be used.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be voluntary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government should make assessments and, if people are a threat to Australia\u2019s security, then those measures that have been supported by both sides of politics, passed through the parliament, should be used. That\u2019s why they are in place.\u201d\n\nSimon Henderson, the head of policy at Save the Children Australia, described the families\u2019 offer as \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented\u201d.", "description": "Thirty-six women and children stuck in Syria say they would agree to be put under anti-terrorism orders", "authors": ["Helen Davidson", "Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfcd80474096c7dc592fdfa902e8076c4a7e6353/0_401_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5bb3d96e097f4aef711698a5114ae95c", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
