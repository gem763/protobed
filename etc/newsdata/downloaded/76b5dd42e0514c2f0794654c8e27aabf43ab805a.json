Hot water and medical care as well as communications with inmates' counsel and relatives were also denied during that time, said Horowitz.\n\n\"The BOP\u2019s initial silence about the fire and power outage was interpreted by defense counsel, the courts, the public, and ultimately members of Congress as apathy and indifference, as demonstrated by ensuing public confusion and protests, judicial actions, and congressional scrutiny,\" according to the report.\n\nThe BOP issued two conflicting press releases about the fire over six days and erroneously assured the public that the inmates had hot water.\n\nAs of June 9, 2019, according to the report, Herman E. Quay, who was the warden of MDC during the power outage, is now the warden of Federal Correctional Complex Allenwood.\n\nKathy Willens/AP, FILE\n\nQuay was \"away from the institution\" at the time of the outage, according to the report. Quay is named as a defendant in nine ongoing federal civil lawsuits filed in the Eastern District of New York, according to the report.\n\nThe investigation found the jail's lowest recorded temperature was 59 degrees a week before the fire. When the power was restored, the heat rose to over 80 degrees. Inmates made \"nearly three times as many complaints about hot temperatures than cold temperatures,\" said Horowitz.\n\nThe Inspector General's office recommended the federal building's HVAC system be upgraded in order to \"allow facilities staff to accurately monitor building temperatures and heating, ventilation and cooling equipment performance.\" The BOP's temperature target is 68 degrees.\n\nThe recommendations also include providing cold-weather clothing to the inmates, properly recording the building's temperatures, updating visitation policies and creating a list of inmates who require electronic medical equipment in their cells.\n\nKathy Willens/AP\n\nThe BOP has until Dec. 26, 2019, to provide documentation detailing the status of the recommended improvements.\n\nIn July, American Oversight, a nonprofit ethics watchdog, filed a federal civil lawsuit against the BOP for not adequately responding to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for records regarding the outage. On Monday, the U.S. Attorney's office of Washington, D.C., which is representing BOP, said American Oversight was not entitled to the FOIA information.\n\nThe BOP spokesperson told ABC News there would be no further comment because of ongoing legal proceedings or pending litigation.", "description": "Almost 1,700 inmates were trapped in below freezing temperatures for six days.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jail-heat-01-ap-jt-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
