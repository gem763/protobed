He was known as a \u201cproximity flier\u201d \u2014 one who stays close to the landscape \u2014 and hit a ridge at 108 mph, dying instantly, according to the fliers.\n\nDr. Grubisic called his world-record preparations \u201cthe Icarus Project,\u201d after the Greek mythological figure who carried himself aloft on homemade wings of feathers and wax but died after flying too close to the sun.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe University of Southampton, in southern England, where Dr. Grubisic was a lecturer in aeronautics and advanced propulsion and had enlisted 10 students to help design the ideal wingsuit, confirmed his death at age 38.\n\nThe current world record for wingsuit flight duration was set by Colombian skydiver Jhonathan Florez in 2012 with a time of nine minutes and six seconds. (Florez was killed during a wingsuit flight when he crashed into a mountainside in Switzerland in 2015.)\n\nThe highest-altitude wingsuit jump \u2014 from a plane at 37,426 feet \u2014 was achieved on Veterans Day 2015 by retired U.S. Air Force Pararescueman Jimmy Petrolia over Davis, Calif., to raise funds for Special Operations forces killed in the line of duty.\n\nAD\n\nThe highest speed so far was reached by Japanese wingsuit pilot Shinichi Ito in 2011, when he hit 226 mph. The \u201cgreatest absolute distance\u201d record of 19.94 miles was set by American Kyle Lobpries, also over Davis, in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nThe goal of Dr. Grubisic\u2019s Icarus Project was to jump from 45,000 feet and fly as far as possible for around 15 minutes, reaching 280 mph.\n\nWingsuit-flying and BASE jumping \u2014 the acronym refers to free-falling from bridges, antennae, spans or Earth features \u2014 were Dr. Grubisic\u2019s hobbies, but he was far more than a hobbyist. He was also described in Britain as \u201cRocket Man\u201d or \u201cJet Man\u201d for his stunts in which he took off and flew James Bond-style in a suit powered by jet engines on his arms and back.\n\nAD\n\nHe and the jet suit\u2019s inventor, Richard \u201cIron Man\u201d Browning, stunned tourists last year at the Bournemouth Air Festival in southern England when they took off from a pier and buzzed over sea bathers at low level before one of Dr. Grubisic\u2019s arm engines exploded. He cartwheeled and crashed in shallow surf.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike some extreme athletes, Dr. Grubisic was after more than an adrenaline rush. At the University of Southampton, he specialized in the development and testing of advanced propulsion systems for spacecraft in support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. He was a consulting engineer for the ESA during its BepiColombo mission to Mercury last year, a joint project with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency using two satellites that are due to reach Mercury\u2019s orbit in 2025.\n\nDr. Grubisic was also a consultant to NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, Calif., which is involved in exploration research on Mars, including probing the possibility of life on the Red Planet.\n\nAD\n\nAngelo Niko Grubisic was born in Walsall, north of Birmingham, on June 24, 1981, and grew up in nearby Willenhall. His father, a Serb immigrant, worked in a ball-bearing factory and married an English barmaid.\n\nAD\n\nAngelo was 3 when his parents divorced, and he and a sister were brought up by their mother.\n\n\u201cBeing a one-parent family was tough financially and although poor in monetary terms, both Angelo and I always considered ourselves rich in love,\u201d Karina Grubisic told The Washington Post. \u201cMy mom would put us before everything else. She didn\u2019t have a great education. She\u2019s dyslexic, but she\u2019s certainly intelligent and became a private accountant. She was driven to get us both to university, which she did, but most of all, she poured all the love she had into us.\u201d (Dr. Grubisic was also diagnosed as dyslexic only a few years ago.)\n\nAD\n\nHe was deeply influenced by his maternal grandfather, Tom Richardson, a daredevil who enjoyed skydiving and attending air shows. \u201cI\u2019m certain this is where Angelo inherited his fearless streak,\u201d Karina Grubisic said. \u201cOur granddad made his last skydive on his 80th birthday.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to his sister, Dr. Grubisic\u2019s survivors include his parents, a half brother and a half sister.\n\nAngelo Grubisic studied aerospace technology at Coventry University, obtaining a bachelor\u2019s of engineering degree in 2003. At the International Space University in France, dedicated to the development of space exploration for peaceful purposes, he received a master\u2019s degree in space studies in 2005. He completed a doctorate in advanced propulsion at Southampton in 2009.\n\nAD\n\nHe attended a joint post-doctorate fellowship program with Southampton and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Using his experience gained at NASA, Dr. Grubisic worked with the Paris-based ESA. He was instrumental in developing the Solar Electric Propulsion System for the BepiColombo mission.\n\nOn July 4, Dr. Grubisic, jumping from a helicopter, was crowned British national wingsuit champion in the advanced category at Dunkeswell Aerodrome in southwest England.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy brother grew up on classic war films like \u2018Platoon\u2019 and \u2018Full Metal Jacket,\u2019 \u201d Karina Grubisic said. \u201cAt first he wanted to be an Apache helicopter pilot in the Royal Marines but then realized he would make more of a contribution to mankind if he helped push it forward instead of destroying it.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nBarbara Probst Solomon, writer who chronicled Franco\u2019s rule in Spain, dies at 90\n\nLeslie H.
