In short, it will be up there among the quickest school-run motors parked on the other side of the playground.\n\nBut it's not all about power. So to make sure the Portofino can blitz the outgoing California T, Ferrari boffins have reduced the overall weight by 10 per cent, which improves CO2 emissions (245g/km) and fuel consumption (26.4mpg) as well as the pin-you-to-your-seat acceleration.\n\nIt means you should be able to drive - conservatively - for 458 miles before you need to brim the fuel tank again.\n\nEven the name change \u2013 a shift away from America\u2019s West Coast to Italy\u2019s elegant Riveria \u2013 signals a change of mood and style emanating from the Italian brand.\n\nFerrari has upgraded the twin-turbo V8 engine so that it produces 40 horse power more than the car it supersedes\n\nDrivers can enjoy the Portofino has a hard-top GT car with plenty of rakish curves\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a But at the push of a button the roof can be retracted into the boot to allow for wind-in-your-hair motoring. It takes 14 seconds for it to open and close fully when travelling at speeds of up to 30mph\n\nPortofino, which features in many advertising brochures and holiday guides, was the internal winner from a short-list of Italian coastal resort names being considered, some of which may yet find their way onto future Ferraris.\n\nAnd although both the driving and styling may increasingly appeal to women, Ferrari say paying customers remain predominantly male.\n\nWith the the tin-top roof in place, the Portofino looks every inch a bold Ferrari GT with beautifully sculpted lines, especially in the side profile.\n\nBosses said they took their coupe styling inspiration from the classic Ferrari Daytona of the late 1960s and early \u201870s. And despite the low aerodynamic styling, the driver and passenger have plenty of headroom.\n\nSeeing the roof gracefully stow itself away at the push of a button in just 14 seconds is like watching ballet \u2013 and if you get caught in a sudden shower it will do it on the move it at speeds of up to 30mph.\n\nLike any vitamin B-starved Brit seeing the sun in a blue sky, I drove mainly with the roof down to enjoy the wind in the hair thrill of the open road, though winter chill, even around coastal Bari in the heel of Italy, meant the heaters were on full blast.\n\nThe powerful V8 engine in the Portofino helps it to accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 3.2 seconds\n\nIt will hit 124mph in 10.8 seconds \u2013 or about the same time it will take many family cars to reach half that speed\n\nTop speed is around 200mph. That means it will be up there among the quickest school-run motors parked on the other side of the playground\n\nFrom well-mannered cruiser to badly-behaved bruiser in the flick of a switch\n\nAs well as the temperature controls in the cabin, there are three round buttons on the free-floating centre console marked as \u2018R\u2019 for reverse, \u2018Auto\u2019, and \u2018Launch\u2019, the latter of which can be used for much-needed quick getaways.\n\nThen there's the selection of driving modes.\n\nIn \u2018comfort\u2019 setting the Portofino displayed impeccable manners and proved a doddle to drive \u2013 even when crawling at a walking pace through the cobbled streets of an old town.\n\nElectric power steering makes changes of direction at low speed easier on the forearms than it would have been if attempting similar manoeuvres at the wheel of an '80s Ferrari.\n\nBut the real thrill came in \u2018sport\u2019 mode when flicking up and down the gear paddles behind the racing-style wheel.\n\nPulling power is instantaneous with no lag. And its thresholds far exceeded my skill or nerve - it always felt there was a lot more in reserve.\n\nEven on slippery and serpentine coastal and mountain roads with tight hairpin bends it felt planted to the road with great grip.\n\nThis in part is down to the new Ferrari\u2019s variable boost management software that adjusts and increases torque delivery to suit whatever gear the driver has selected.\n\nOnly real pros on a track should consider switching off the electronic stability control, which isn't for the faint-hearted or amateur drivers.\n\nThere's not much room in the back, though there are Isofix mounting points if you need to fit a child car seat\n\nUp front, the interior is awash with carbon fibre, gorgeous leather and a trio of high-definition screens\n\nThe name Portofino is taken from the exclusive upmarket seaside resort on the Italian Riviera - a more fitting replacement for the California name is ousts\n\nHave young kids? It even has Isofix mounting points for child car seats\n\nThe cockpit itself is smart, functional and sporty with lashings of carbon fibre and leather, very comfortable - though lightened - seats, a digital driver display and a centrally mounted 10.25-inch infotainment touch-screen for sat-nav, music and other functions.\n\nThere's space - at a squeeze - in the back for two more passengers or young family members playing gooseberry in the bucket seats for short distances. There are even Isofix mounting points if your nipper needs a child seat.\n\nWhen you've lowered the roof, a new wind-deflector cuts airflow over the driver and passenger\u2019s body by 30 per cent \u2013 17 per cent over the head and 40 per cent over the chest \u2013 but I didn\u2019t actually use it, sticking to a pair of sunglasses to deflect the onrush of air\n\nNo matter where the roof is, you're always accompanied by a wonderfully tuned choral soundtrack of the exhaust to serenade your journey.\n\nThat said, with the top up Ferrari claims you'll be able to hold a conversation with others on board as extra soundproofing has made it eight decibels quieter than the previous car.\n\nThere\u2019s not a huge amount of space in the boot \u2013 especially if you have the wind-deflector in there too \u2013 but Ferrari say it\u2019ll take three cabin bags with metal roof up, or two with roof folded down. I fitted my cabin back and a laptop bag and there was still some space.\n\nOptional extras will see the price of most Portofinos rise to -and beyond - \u00a3200,000, Ferrari says\n\nDaily Mail motoring correspondent Ray Massey said the performance easily surpassed both his skill and nerve, though thoroughly enjoyed his sea-side blast in the boxfresh Ferrari\n\nFerrari's Nicola Boari said the new Portofino is 'the most everyday Ferrari we have ever created'\n\nBe prepared for the expensive options list\n\nTempting extras will push up the price considerably including a two-tone paint job (\u00a34,320), run-flat tyres (\u00a32,208), Apple CarPlay (\u00a32,400), front and rear parking cameras (\u00a33,456) and a handy passenger display that lets the co-pilot see how fast the car is going, rpm, and gears, or what\u2019s playing on the hi-fi (\u00a33,360).\n\nProving just how easily the price can spiral, carbon fibre trim extras include a modest \u00a3480 for wheel caps, to \u00a31,440 for a cup-holder, \u00a32,496 for dashboard inserts, and \u00a34,320 for the interior \u2018driver zone\u2019 and steering wheel, \u00a34,992 for an under-door cover, and 20-inch forged diamond wheel trims for \u00a34,608.\n\nThe improved magnetically-controlled Magnaride Dual Mode suspension system will add another \u00a33,168 to the final bill.\n\nFerrari marketing chief Nicola Boari said of the new Portofino: \u2019This is the most everyday Ferrari we have ever created. But it also offers high speed stability when accelerating or cornering. You feel in control at all times.\u2019\n\nIn the UK, the Portofino comes with a four-year warranty \u2013 with the option to extend to a fifth year for \u00a32,880 - and a seven-year servicing deal.", "description": "In a moment it can turn from an easy-going grand tourer with impeccable manners into a full-blooded performance machine that's powerful enough to rearrange your internal organs.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
