This included a search and seizure operation by FSCA investigators at their shared premises in Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nOn 24 September, a case was opened with the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations \u2013 better known as the Hawks \u2013 for further investigation.\n\nThat investigation is still underway, with the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) having recently obtained preservation orders against some bank accounts linked to the two parties investigated, namely directors Michael Andrew Anthony de Beer of Coin-it and Ursula de Beer of Commex.\n\nThe AFU is now tracing their assets, the FSCA said.\n\n\"Neither Coin-it or Commex, nor its directors [\u2026] are licensed to conduct any financial services or receive deposits from the public.\n\n\"The recent correspondence by Coin-it management to transfer investors to alternate, unnamed companies would once again be in breach of financial sector law, should these companies also not be licensed financial service providers,\" the FSCA said.\n\nAccording to Coin-it's website \u2013 which is not secure \u2013 the entity wants investors' \"coffers to overflow\". Coin-it claims to specialise in property and asset management, and promises investors a guaranteed monthly income \"for at least 36 months\".\n\nIt further promises \"high returns\" for a \"small investment\".\n\n\"You start seeing money back from the first month,\" it says. \"Once your unit is paid for, you will see only profit until the end of your contract.\"\n\nBut a complaint on customer review site hellopeter.com, which cites the raid on Coin-it by authorities, warns: \"Investors be warned, your money is gone.\"\n\nAn attorney for Coin-it and Commex, Mazana Maphumulo, previously denied wrongdoing.", "description": "Financial regulator the Financial Sector Conduct Authority has warned the public not to enter into any agreements with unauthorised entities associated with Coin-it Trading.", "authors": ["Compiled Allison Jeftha"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4976/3fa71fb5e369442d9494020164ff68ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
