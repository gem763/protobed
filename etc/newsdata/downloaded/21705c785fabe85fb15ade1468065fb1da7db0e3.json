Mitt Romney (R-UT) has been severely critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. forces back from Kurdish-controlled areas of the Syria-Turkey border. But in 2007, Romney had a somewhat different view of the Kurds.\n\nOn Thursday, shortly after the Trump administration reached a five-day cease-fire (or \u201cpause\u201d) agreement with Turkey to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw, Romney delivered a speech from the floor of the Senate excoriating Trump\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s argued that the Kurds were fighting for themselves. Of course they were! That\u2019s the nature of an alliance,\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cWe fight together, each pursuing our own vital interests. \u2026 The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2007 \u2014 as he was running for president for the first time \u2014 Romney took a somewhat different view of the Kurds and their broader national cause.\n\nIn an essay for Foreign Policy regarded as a definitive statement of his foreign policy views at the time, Romney warned that \u201cKurdish nationalism could destabilize the border with Turkey.\u201d\n\nHe meant the Iraqi border with Turkey, but Kurdish nationalism is widely recognized as a force throughout the region. Romney\u2019s statement, in full context, was as follows (emphasis added):\n\nToday, the nation\u2019s attention is focused on Iraq. All Americans want U.S. troops to come home as soon as possible. But walking away now or dividing Iraq up into parts and walking away later would present grave risks to the United States and the world. Iran could seize the Shiite south, al Qaeda could dominate the Sunni west, and Kurdish nationalism could destabilize the border with Turkey. A regional conflict could ensue, perhaps even requiring the return of U.S. troops under far worse circumstances.\n\nRomney delivered that statement to a live audience as part of a speech on foreign policy to the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas, on April 10, 2007.\n\nThe circumstances then were not too different, even though the war in Syria was several years away: Kurds in Iraq had already proved important U.S. allies. Yet Romney warned, correctly, that they could complicate relations with Turkey.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Turkey claims that it has a legitimate national security interest in removing Kurdish forces from its border.\n\nRomney once seemed to agree.\n\nJoel B.
