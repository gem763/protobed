It\u2019s all within reach, even in the midst of an impeachment-obsessed D.C., but it\u2019s going to require President Trump to go on offense with Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s been a nearly a year since Trump and his counterparts in Canada and Mexico signed the USMCA, and yet Congress has stalled on ratifying the agreement. Democrats object that the deal doesn\u2019t go far enough to raise labor standards and environmental protections. But failing to get the USMCA passed has been much more about politics than economics.\n\nAMB. ROYA RAHMANI: ELECTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN ARE CRITICAL \u2014 THEY NEED US SUPPORT ON THE PATH TOWARD PEACE\n\nBetween the probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and now the Ukraine controversy, Democrats have found convenient excuses for inaction and distraction, pushing USMCA to the back burner.\n\nBut whatever political advantage Democrats think they\u2019ve gotten from delay has come at the cost of American businesses and workers, who have been left to deal with the uncertainty of not knowing on what terms they can invest in growing their businesses and selling their products.\n\nThe American people are aware of that cost and have made it clear in polls taken before revelations of Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine that they don\u2019t support impeachment efforts.\n\nThe USMCA isn\u2019t a perfect deal \u2014 no trade agreement is \u2014 but it makes important updates on issues like intellectual property and provides clarity on rules and regulations so that businesses can once again think about long-term investment.\n\nAs Americans grow weary with probes, investigations and overblown political posturing in Washington, they\u2019re looking for action on issues that affect their daily lives. Democrats have controlled the House for the better part of a year and don\u2019t have much policy to show for it. It\u2019s an ideal moment for Trump to refocus on the economy and relentlessly push Congress to do its job on the USMCA.\n\nTrade deals with Japan and China, and a ratified USMCA, would provide a powerful confidence boost to workers, businesses and investors heading into 2020.\n\nThe best way for the president to turn up the heat on Congress would be to get results with China. He\u2019s hinted that a trade agreement could happen \u201csooner than you think.\u201d That would be welcome news for U.S. businesses that have suffered from economy-stalling uncertainty caused by delays on the USMCA and escalating tariffs and tension with China.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nA trade deal with China, on the heels of the latest one with Japan, would allow the president to credibly claim that he\u2019s doing his job and that it\u2019s time for Democrats in the House to do the same.\n\nIn the glaring spotlight that would turn back on Congress, thin political excuses for inaction would quickly evaporate, setting up the president to enter an election year with the wind of three economy-boosting trade deals at his back.\n\nAs talk of investigation and impeachment dominates headlines, the margin for meaningful action on pocketbook issues seems to be shrinking. But the truth is, growing frustration with Washington and its inability to focus on issues that affect voters\u2019 lives is creating an opportunity for leadership.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe initiative and leverage lie with the president. A trade deal with Japan, followed closely by a new deal with China and a ratified USMCA before year-end, would provide a powerful confidence boost to workers, businesses and investors heading into 2020.\n\nDemocrats surely aren\u2019t eager to give Trump that kind of economic momentum before the 2020 election. But if the president plays his cards right, they may not have a choice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BRIAN BRENBERG", "description": "Growing frustration with Washington's inability to focus on issues that affect voters\u2019 lives is creating an opportunity for leadership.", "authors": ["Brian Brenberg"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/26/694940094001_6089682139001_6089682023001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
