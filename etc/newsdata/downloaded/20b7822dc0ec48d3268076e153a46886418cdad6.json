This history justifies the current state of India and thus supports a need for our ancient nation to discard her traditional wisdom and align with western ideas and ideologies.\n\nThe above two parts of Indian history are akin to the visible part of the iceberg, while a massive part of Indian history is either buried in research papers that met with academic disdain as they did not match up with the academic world view of India being a backward civilisation that needed to learn from west or history that is still lying undiscovered because it found no takers.\n\nAs history of any nation can rise up only through textbooks or through public recollection, it is clear that the history lying buried today will need academic support to make it reach the textbooks to reach the next-gen or it needs an alternative medium to reach the masses.\n\nAs Indian academia is still living under the peer pressure of the west, it is unlikely that we have much hope from the current academic establishment to break free from the western idea of an India that was refined and improved of her pagan unscientific traditions through occupation (as it would help the west justify the horrors of colonisation), and hence there is a dire need of finding an alternative that can bypass academia and make our rich history reach the masses.\n\nWhile there is little hope for this miracle to happen through academic initiative, thankfully we now have a great alternative and with huge power.\n\nAs our entertainment industry is growing rapidly and big money is now getting invested in this popular medium, a strange possibility has emerged, and that is to shift the history research out of academia and move it to movie production houses.\n\nWith a five-thousand-year-old history to dig into, it is a goldmine for movie makers to explore, and as larger budgets and new technologies becoming available for making period movies at a grand scale, Bollywood could be a much-needed short circuit past the academic historians toeing a western idea of India.\n\nWhile Jawaharlal Nehru did a great job with \u201cThe discovery of India\u201d from his perspective, there is a lot more of India left to be discovered and Bollywood could be a great agent of change that can do it for the nation.", "description": "As my piece seeking answer from academicians and historians about the myopic depiction of history of India that refuses to look beyond who ruled Delhi has caused a bit of burn; claims are being made...", "authors": ["Samir Shukla"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
