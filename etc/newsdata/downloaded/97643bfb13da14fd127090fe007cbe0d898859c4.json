Ted Cruz tweeted Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA 7-year-old child doesn\u2019t have the maturity to make profound decisions like this,\u201d Cruz said, referring to the controversy over James Younger, the Texas boy who is being encouraged by his mother to declare himself as \u201ctransgender.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of Texas should protect this child\u2019s right to choose\u2014as an informed, mature person\u2014and not be used as a pawn in a left-wing political agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nTexas law was written before the sudden emergence of the claim children can change their sex. So parents have the authority to encourage their children to live as members of the opposite sex, and also to begin medical treatments at an early age \u2014 even though many of the medical procedures can be crippling and cannot be reversed by the child when he or she becomes an adult.\n\nA 7-year-old child doesn't have the maturity to make profound decisions like this. The state of Texas should protect this child's right to choose\u2014as an informed, mature person\u2014and not be used as a pawn in a left-wing political agenda. #ProtectJamesYounger \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) October 24, 2019\n\nCruz\u2019s intervention puts him on the side of children \u2014 and leaves Democrats in the position of defending child abuse, according to a U.K. left-wing opponent of the transgender ideology:\n\nI really think it was a catastrophic error by American liberals and left wingers to leave the \u201clet\u2019s protect a 7-year-old child from being put on a path to sterility\u201d side to the Republicans https://t.co/cgyMTevnwQ \u2014 Helen Joyce (@HJJoyceEcon) October 24, 2019\n\nThe federal government sets few rules to protect children and teenagers from abusive parents, teenage fads, or revenue-seeking medical professionals.\n\nMany Democrat-run states have set rules barring mental-health professionals from discouraging children or teenagers from quickly trying to change their unchangeable sex.\n\nA growing number of teenagers and young adults have quietly revesed their claims to be members of the opposite sex. This \u201cdetransition\u201d movement is gaining influence, especially in the United Kingdom, which was pushed into the transgender debates several years ago.\n\nThe response to my talk today was overwhelming. Thank you. So so much. https://t.co/JsIxhIY8rH \u2014 Charlie Evans (@charlie_sci) October 19, 2019", "description": "Texas should protect children and youths from life-alternating \"transgender\" medical procedures, Sen.
