Some DIYs turn out to be more expensive or time consuming than just buying the item that you wanted to recreate. Some goals take too long to achieve. Some hacks are only helpful for a small group of people.\n\nOne hack on my list that probably isn\u2019t worth the time: paying an extra fee to purchase a product or service with a credit card. If the amount of cash-back rewards you get exceed the fee, you come out on top, right?\n\nReddit user EMF911 explained it in the r/frugal subreddit:\n\nI had a personal tax bill I had to pay. When I called the payment office, I inquired about credit cards. The receptionist told me they do take credit cards but there is a $5 fee. Well, my credit card was going to get me 2% back and the bill was for $310. 2% of $310 would be netting me $6.20 in rewards. After paying [a] $5 fee I would still be coming out ahead - making paying this way worth it.\ufeff\n\nEMF911 noted the other benefits of paying with a card too, like building credit. A few others chimed in and said that when the fee is less than the cash back you\u2019ll earn, it\u2019s worth it. Of course, you have to be one of those people who never carries a balance on your credit card from month to month to reap the benefits.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable using credit for just about everything, like this particular Redditor, you might not think twice about doing this.\n\nThe potential for error for everyone else is just too large. Paying a bill with a credit card \u2014 and eating the accompanying fee \u2013 can be a crucial last resort if your budget is a bit short. But all too quickly, the habit of paying for everything with a credit card can snowball into debt. If you aren\u2019t paying your complete credit card balance every single month, any gains you would have enjoyed from cash-back rewards are getting cancelled out by =interest charges.\n\nNot every tip or trick comes with this level of risk \u2014 if a DIY project goes awry, the stakes are usually pretty low \u2014 but when it comes to your finances, sometimes it\u2019s better to play it safe. Would you rather save money now, or pay up front to get a buck or two back later?", "description": "Not all life hacks are created equal.
