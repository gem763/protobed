Now, leaker Evan Blass has spilled details about Windows 10X, which is said to be Microsoft\u2019s fork of Windows 10 that\u2019s built for dual-screen devices.\n\nOf course, a dual-screen Surface product (codenamed \u201cCentaurus\u201d) is rumored to make its debut at the big Surface event. Based on Blass\u2019 tweet, it will run on Windows 10X, which has been previously referred to as Windows Lite.\n\nWhile the tweet shared no images of the software, it states that Windows 10X is made to run on dual- and folding-screen devices. Compared to standard Windows 10, 10X might run applications in \u201ccontainers.\u201d As for what that means, 10X may lean on virtualization to run a majority of the apps over the internet instead of running them locally off of the hardware.\n\nThe Verge will be covering Microsoft\u2019s big event tomorrow, October 2nd, starting at 10AM ET, so tune in to see if this and all of the other leaks pan out. Hopefully, Microsoft will still have a few surprises left in store, so stay tuned.", "description": "Leaker Evan Blass has shared details about Windows 10X, Microsoft\u2019s alleged new software that\u2019s built specifically for dual-screened devices.
