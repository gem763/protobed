Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), a Donald Trump loyalist who stepped down from his congressional seat last month, spent his first day as a CNN contributor regurgitating a debunked right-wing conspiracy theory on air.\n\nDuring his first appearance on the network as a paid employee Sunday, Duffy appeared to defend the unsubstantiated claim that Ukraine may have been behind the 2016 cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee and that it is in possession of the compromised server. The U.S. intelligence community has long made clear it believes Russia perpetrated the cyberattack. Furthermore, there was no physical server that could be transported to Ukraine in the first place, making the claim all the more mind-boggling.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Duffy from toying with evidence-free speculation on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats and the media were all about what happened in the 2016 election,\u201d he said, adding that President Trump simply wanted to \u201clook and get the server\u201d when he decided to solicit help on the matter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDuffy had been speaking in reference to a news conference last week in which acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that Trump was interested in \u201ccorruption that related to the DNC server\u201d when U.S. military aid was being withheld from Ukraine, meaning there was a quid pro quo at play.\n\nDuffy\u2019s mere mention of the conspiracy theory prompted his co-panelists, including conservative pundit Amanda Carpenter, to lash out against his remarks, visibly frustrated that he was discussing it in the first place.\n\nBut less than 24 hours later, the newly minted commentator brought it up again.\n\nIn an interview Monday morning with CNN \u201cNew Day\u201d anchor Alisyn Camerota, Duffy said that \u201cwe spent two years talking about a Russia collusion\u201d \u2015 meaning former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into election meddling \u2015 a pressure point within the GOP among those who railed against the investigation as a political witch hunt aimed at Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat Mick Mulvaney was talking about was actually trying to find the server that was the DNC server, which was at the heart of the Russia investigation,\u201d Duffy added.\n\nInstantly, Camerota jumped in, telling her colleague, \u201cThat\u2019s a conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cUkraine doesn\u2019t have the server, Sean,\u201d she later responded.\n\nCNN contributor Sean Duffy comes on to push the debunked Crowdstrike conspiracy theory for the second day in a row to justify Trump's actions\n\n\n\nAlisyn Camerota: That's a conspiracy theory. ... Ukraine doesn't have the server, Sean.\" pic.twitter.com/Et0k0Zvohe \u2014 courtney hagle (@CourtneyHagle) October 21, 2019\n\nDuffy\u2019s performance prompted the network\u2019s Chris Cillizza to speak out on Twitter, where he shared an article in which he refuted the conspiracy theory in September.\n\nJay Caruso, managing editor of the conservative Washington Examiner, tweeted an even more vociferous response.\n\n\u201cThe idea there was this lone box, which is now hidden somewhere in Ukraine containing all the DNC emails, is Alex Jones level stuff,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "The former congressman repeatedly mentioned a debunked claim that Ukraine may have been responsible for the 2016 DNC hack.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae2b812100008821ad3777.jpeg?cache=npjnifjfvb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
