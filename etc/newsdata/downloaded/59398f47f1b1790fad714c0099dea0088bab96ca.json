In all, seven of the 15 men who started for Japan that evening were born overseas.\n\nFor some in the sport, Japan\u2019s multiracial side is simply the most egregious example of how teams are exploiting the three-year residency requirement for drafting foreign-born players into national squads. Led by coach Jamie Joseph, a New Zealander who represented Japan at the 1999 World Cup, the 31-strong squad includes 16 players originally from seven countries, including their captain in their recent win over Ireland, the South African-born Pieter Labuschagne.\n\nCriticism of rugby\u2019s relaxed attitude towards eligibility followed Japan and other teams into this tournament, with the former Wales captain Paul Thorburn claiming that World Rugby\u2019s liberal criteria had made a \u201ctotal mockery\u201d of international rugby and turned the World Cup into a \u201ccircus\u201d.\n\nBut Leitch, who arrived in Japan as a 15-year-old to study at a high school in Sapporo and took Japanese citizenship in 2013, has spoken with pride of the diverse backgrounds of his teammates. \u201cI am very, very proud to be the captain of the Japanese rugby team,\u201d he said on the eve of the tournament. \u201cWe have got a very diverse side with a lot of foreign influence.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Naomi Osaka is among a growing number of mixed-race athletes who represent Japan.

Hendrik Tui, born in New Zealand of Samoan descent, graduated from a Japanese university, as did Samoan-born and New Zealand\u2013raised Timothy Lafaele. Both are now Japanese citizens. Lomano Lemeki, who was born in New Zealand to Tongan parents and grew up in Australia, took Japanese citizenship after marrying a Japanese woman. Then there is Koo Ji-won, who was born in South Korea but went to high school and university in Japan and became a Japanese citizen in 2015. He now finds South Korea is locked into a bitter row with Japan over wartime history.\n\nJapanese tennis star Naomi Osaka\u2019s victory in the US Open against Serena Williams a year ago had many wondering if traditional theories of Japanese identity were being eroded, whether on a tennis court, rugby pitch or running track. Osaka, the daughter of a Japanese mother and Haitian father, along with Leitch and his teammates are among a growing number of mixed-race athletes who represent Japan, including the US Major League baseball player Yu Darvish, whose father is Iranian, and the Olympic sprinter Asuka Cambridge, whose father is Jamaican.\n\nBasketball player Rui Hachimura is expected lead the Japanese men\u2019s basketball team at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. In June, Hachimura, whose father is from Benin, became the first Japanese player to make the NBA draft.\n\nThe 2020 Games will also feature sprinter Abdul Hakim Sani Brown, born to a Japanese mother and Ghanaian father, who was one quarter of the Japanese men\u2019s team that won a bronze medal in the 4x100m relay at the world athletics championships in Doha.\n\nHelen Macnaughtan, a senior lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University, agreed that Japan\u2019s racially diverse team was partly the product of World Rugby\u2019s eligibility rules, but saw potential for a more inclusive definition of Japanese identity as exemplified by the Brave Blossoms.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s sheer visibility as an ethnically diverse team is challenging notions of Japaneseness - and it\u2019s not just Japanese commenting on that,\u201d said Macnaughtan, who is researching the history of Japanese rugby. \u201cYou hear non-Japanese observers and rugby fans commenting on that as well.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Washington Wizards forward Rui Hachimura (right) is the first Japanese player to make the NBA draft.

Months after her US Open victory, one of her sponsors, the instant noodle maker Nissin, was forced to apologise after depicting her in an ad with pale skin, light brown hair and Caucasian facial features.\n\nThis month A Masso, a little-known comedy duo, apologised for saying during a live show that Osaka looked \u201ctoo sunburned\u201d and suggested she \u201cneeded some bleach\u201d.\n\n'Re-written history': how Japan reacted to shock win over Ireland Read more\n\nMcNeil, though, noted that the first people to complain about the racist remarks had been Japanese people in the A Masso audience. \u201cThat is a very good sign that attitudes towards non-traditional looking Japanese people, who happen to be representing the country in record numbers of late, may be evolving,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the rugby gods smile on the tournament this weekend and Super Typhoon Hagibis spares Japan\u2019s final pool match against Scotland, the host nation\u2019s multicultural, multinational team will line up again and give a flawless rendition of their national anthem, Kimigayo, in front of 70,000 fans and a TV audience in the tens of millions.\n\nThe anthem, based on an ancient waka poem, expresses hope for a long imperial reign, \u201cuntil the tiny pebbles grow into boulders\u201d \u2013 a sentiment that surely applies to Leitch and his eclectic band of Japanese sporting heroes.", "description": "Japan\u2019s Rugby World Cup side, along with Naomi Osaka, Rui Hachimura and others, show the potential for a more inclusive definition of Japanese identity", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf58c2b7c2c5525acc5593dc7a5266083086fd0b/0_245_2652_1592/master/2652.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02dec62ac0a61a306910dc51b22e5395", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
