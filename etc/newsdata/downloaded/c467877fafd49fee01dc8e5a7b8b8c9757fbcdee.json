I certainly resented it, or at least envied it. When I first met Bloom in person, I spotted Little, Big, a 1981 novel by John Crowley, on his dining room table. He said he had read it again that morning \u201cfor the 46th or 47th time.\u201d I was skeptical: the copy on that table looked like it had never been read at all. By chance I had read it recently, too, and I proposed that one of the characters was modeled on E. T. A. Hoffmann\u2019s Sandman. He immediately quoted both books, confirming my hypothesis. I guess that\u2019s the secret to keeping books in mint condition: if you memorize them on a first, gentle reading, you need never open them again.\n\nHe had read everything worth reading, or claimed to have. When he could still walk, he would allow bystanders on Yale quads to quote random lines of Milton to him, and he would pick up the line and keep reciting until he reached the other end of the quad.\n\nI tried to stump him\u2014and only once succeeded. Last year, during one of Bloom\u2019s periods of seriously failing health, I told him that as a teenager, I loved the novels of Anthony Burgess. Bloom could barely move, and he sat, as always, in a wheelchair in front of a table stacked with books and medicines. His voice shook with weakness, but he told me his Burgess stories and reminisced about drinking Fundador with him in New York. I said I had read all his novels but one: Earthly Powers, from 1980. (It begins with a perfectly Burgessian sentence: \u201cIt was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday, and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced that the archbishop had come to see me.\u201d)\n\nThen came Bloom\u2019s startling reply: he had not read Earthly Powers either. Extracting that admission felt like a small victory, a confirmation of the human limitations of a man whose powers of reading sometimes seemed irritatingly superhuman.\n\n\u201cI ordered it from London,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took nearly three weeks to arrive.\u201d He then gestured feebly to a short stack of books between us on the dining room table and instructed me to remove a single sheet of paper concealing the top book.\n\nThe book was a mint-condition copy of Earthly Powers. The one book he hadn\u2019t read was already on top of his pile, and would presumably be downloaded into his head by suppertime.", "description": "I tried to stump him\u2014and only once succeeded.", "authors": ["Graeme Wood", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_50435637/facebook.jpg?1571150138", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
