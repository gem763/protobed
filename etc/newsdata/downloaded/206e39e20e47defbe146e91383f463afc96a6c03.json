The stock was trading 1.8 per cent higher to $15.88 in Toronto on Tuesday.\n\nGreat Pacific currently controls 51 per cent of the shares, but in order to proceed the transaction would require two-thirds of the overall shareholders\u2019 support and a simple majority from minority shareholders. Last month, Montreal\u2019s Letko, Brosseau & Associates, which said it manages 4.8 per cent of the outstanding shares, announced it would vote against the offer, calling it based on a \u201cvery depressed share price.\u201d\n\nOne analyst said the same thing.\n\n\u201cWe think Great Pacific\u2019s offer to take Canfor private \u2026 looks like impeccable timing,\u201d Mark Wilde, a BMO analyst, wrote in August shortly after the deal was announced. \u201cHowever, the offer is far below our estimate of Canfor\u2019s \u2018intrinsic\u2019 value of $23 per share.\u201d\n\nWilde wrote that lumber and pulp prices, Canfor\u2019s two main businesses, are very volatile, which results in huge cash flow swings. Lumber hit a record in the summer of 2018, and pulp peaked at the end of 2018, but prices for both subsequently collapsed, and Canfor\u2019s stock price declined too.\n\nThus, less than two years ago, in mid-2018, every analyst covering the company had a price target on Canfor of between $32 and $40 per share, except Wilde who stood at the low-end with a target of $27 per share.\n\nWilde wrote that Pattison\u2019s bid is only a premium when Canfor is valued at a low-point in the cycle.\n\nThe offer is far below our estimate of Canfor's 'intrinsic' value of $23 per share. Mark Wilde, BMO analyst\n\n\u201cWe think this bid falls well short of a fair/optimal outcome for (Canfor\u2019s) minority shareholders,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCanfor declined to comment for this article.\n\nSeveral factors are hurting the sector. In British Columbia, the populations of wood-boring beetle species that destroy forests have exploded in size and reduced available timber, forcing mill closures and industry shrinkage.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts say that wet weather in the U.S. this year reduced the number of home starts, which, combined with lingering tariffs on Canadian lumber, have reduced demand.\n\nCompanies such as Canfor have been investing heavily in the U.S. South, where a rival logging industry has rapidly emerged.\n\nLast week, on an earnings call, Alan Nicholl, chief financial officer of Canfor Pulp Products, said the company is in the process of emerging from a $125-million organic growth program.\n\n\u201cWe currently anticipate much lower capital spending in 2020,\u201d said Nicholl.\n\nMeanwhile, Don Kayne, chief executive of Canfor and Canfor Pulp, said that he expects global pulp pricing to start improving next quarter, while global lumber prices \u201cshould stabilize\u201d in 2020 when inventory levels \u201ccome back into balance,\u201d including improvements over the next couple of quarters.\n\nPaul Quinn, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote that he now values the company between $14.24 and $19.38, and noted Canfor has limited alternatives given Great Pacific owns 51 per cent.\n\nStill, Canfor said in a press release that one member of the board, Barbara Hislop, who owns around two per cent of the shares, is not prepared to support the deal, and it suggested certain unnamed executives were not either.\n\n\u201cWhile we still view a rejection of the transaction by minority shareholders as unlikely, we expect that the combination of a prominent board member and major shareholder will increase momentum behind a vote against the take-private proposal,\u201d Quinn wrote.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "Board agrees to $16 per share buyout by Great Pacific Capital, but some shareholders think the offer is too low", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canfor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
