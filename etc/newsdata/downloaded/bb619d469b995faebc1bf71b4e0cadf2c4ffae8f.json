'It's about getting women to recognize to get tested.'\n\nThen, in 2014, his mother passed away.\n\n'Sandra Kay Hill is the biggest reason I've been able to enjoy eight NFL seasons, going on nine with the Panthers,' he wrote in an emotional piece for The MMQB after her death.\n\n'I remember the summer when my mom finally told me about her diagnosis. I was less than a year away from the NFL. She joked that she elected to have the surgery after the football season because 'your offseason is my offseason. That's how she was \u2014 fiercely protective of me and my interests.'\n\nScary stuff: He lost his mother and also four of his aunts to breast cancer\n\nIncredible: Though he started out with a single event for 53 women, the program has expanded, and he's now covered the cost for the test for over 500 women\n\nHe also pledged that, together, people would defeat the disease 'that steals our mothers, our aunts, our sisters, our daughters and our wives before their time.\n\n'Until that final day comes, we have to fight, just as my mom did.'\n\nAll pink! He also pushed the NFL in 2009 to allow players to wear pink cleats throughout October, Breast Cancer Awareness month (pictured in 2011)\n\nHis biggest contribution to the fight started when, in 2015, his foundation held its first 53 Strong for Sandra in Charlotte, North Carolina, providing cancer-detecting mammograms to 53 women.\n\nSince then, they've expanded to hospitals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; and Jonesboro, Arkansas.\n\nA 2D Digital Diagnostic Mammography costs an average of $200-250 in those cities.\n\nOver 500 women have benefited from the program.\n\nThe foundation, which accepts donations, also pays for follow up appointments and treatments when needed.\n\n'To be able to help all these women is amazing. This can be life-changing for these women,' Williams told Today.\n\n'We are enabling them to get this care that no one should ever be denied or not have access to.'\n\n'DeAngelo wants to ensure that no woman (or man) fights breast cancer alone,' his wife Risalyn Williams, who is also the executive director of The DeAngelo Williams Foundation, added.", "description": "The former Pittsburgh Steelers running back sponsors the '53 Strong for Sandra' program, a free mammogram event.
