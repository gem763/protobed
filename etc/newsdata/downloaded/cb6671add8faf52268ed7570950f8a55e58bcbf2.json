That would make things worse. While subpar, Australia\u2019s 1.4 per cent economic growth rate is far from crisis territory. After some jarring headlines on economic growth last week, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said in Washington on Friday that Australia\u2019s economy could return to trend growth of near 3 per cent next year. Adding up rebounds in commodities and housing, and the effects of lower interest rates and tax cuts, Dr Lowe said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t assume\u201d more rate cuts, moving the Reserve Bank bias towards neutral. The market odds of a Melbourne Cup day rate cut have fallen from one in two a week ago to less than one in five now. That\u2019s a reassuring retreat on recent talk that Australia has been just months away from effectively zero interest rates and quantitative easing money-printing to escape from economic stagnation.\n\nThe IMF has effectively endorsed the government's position.\n\nEven the International Monetary Fund\u2019s lowered growth outlook for Australia, which it last week sliced to 1.7 per cent for this year, still suggests the economy is on track to pick up rather than slow down further. As The Australian Financial Review\u2019s Washington correspondent Jacob Greber reports today, the IMF\u2019s top Asia-Pacific economist, Jonathan Ostry, effectively endorses the Morrison government\u2019s reluctance to rush to a midyear budget stimulus before Christmas. Dr Ostry says the first round of personal tax cuts paid from July 1 - which the government sold as its stimulus policy during the election campaign - are still feeding through. For the IMF, this means fiscal policy should be reviewed for next year\u2019s budget, to be delivered in May. That will likely include a business investment allowance as a second-best alternative to reducing Australia\u2019s uncompetitive 30 per cent company tax rate. Blowing the surplus before it actually arrives, just because the economy is subpar, would undermine confidence in the government\u2019s ability to manage the nation\u2019s finances without jacking up taxes.\n\nDr Lowe\u2019s confidence that the economy will return to its trend or potential growth rate of about 2.75 per cent seems optimistic, particularly given the US-China trade war and the latest soft GDP readings. Yet, as deputy governor Guy Debelle explained last week, part of the economy\u2019s weakness reflects the exaggerated influence of the housing construction cycle, which already has clipped half a percentage point off growth in the past year. This is the cyclical downside of the 2013 to 2017 housing investment catch-up to the population growth sparked by the previous resources boom. But the downturn in this exaggerated cycle means that, as construction bottoms out in 2020, housing supply will fall below the baked-in demands of population growth, predictably leading to another cyclical upswing.\n\nThe world is in a synchronised downturn after the synchronised recovery of 2017, even if the more hopeful news on the Sino-US trade war and Brexit means the worst outcomes are now much less likely. Yet some of the gloom is absurd. After the IMF global growth figures were released last week, headlines suggested that Australia\u2019s economy was worse than that of Greece on the basis of relative growth rates. Yet Greece is staggering out of the longest period of economic depression in modern times. Australia is continuing on the longest growth run of the modern era, now 28 years. Only one member of the G7 - Donald Trump\u2019s America - is growing faster than Australia.\n\nThat should reinforce that emergency stimulus measures should be preserved for when they are really needed. In the meantime, the IMF is backing the message from Dr Lowe that Australia should get on with structural reform in tax and workplace regulation -- repairing the motor, not just trying to fuel it. There is a long way to go. Telstra chairman John Mullen explains in the Financial Review today that businesses now spend too much time dealing with government regulation and oversight that they should be putting into their own performance - and that of the Australian economy. Too much of Australia\u2019s economic growth slowdown is self-inflicted.", "description": "Piling on the stimulus dollars is not justified when the IMF and the Reserve Bank can see through this downturn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1062%2C$y_1176/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c34572f1ff7a95a6f7d23b2ffce189efad208fb9", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
