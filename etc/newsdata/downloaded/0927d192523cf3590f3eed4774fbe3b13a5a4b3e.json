And it has actually been put to the test \u2014 in a 2015 April Fools\u2019 Day issue of JAMA Internal Medicine (while the topics were zany, the studies were real).\n\nResearchers investigated whether people who reported eating apples daily actually had fewer annual doctor visits or were in better overall health. Of the 8,399 study participants, 753 ate at least one small apple daily. The results showed that 39 percent of apple eaters avoided physician visits compared to 34 percent of non-apple-eaters, which was not a statistically significant difference. Researchers did find that apple eaters were a bit less likely to require prescription medications compared to non-apple-eaters, leading the researcher to joke that \u201can apple a day keeps the pharmacist away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, the doctor proverb shouldn\u2019t be taken literally, but the overall sentiment is true: Eating vegetables and fruits daily does have health benefits. That\u2019s because the combination of fiber, vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients may help reduce inflammation and combat cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer.\n\nCarrots are good for your eyes: This narrative traces back to World War II. In 1940, British Royal Air Force pilots began using radar to shoot down enemy planes in the dark. To keep this new technology a secret, the Ministry of Information\u2019s propaganda was that the pilots had great visual accuracy because they ate carrots, which improved their night vision.\n\nIt seemed plausible, too, because carrots are rich in the antioxidant beta carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. Once absorbed by the body, vitamin A helps make rhodopsin, a pigment that helps eyes work better in low light. Carrots can help if you have vitamin A deficiency that causes poor night vision, but of course they can\u2019t really help you (or Air Force pilots) see in complete darkness. So, yes, carrots are good for eyesight, but other foods rich in beta carotene, such as sweet potatoes, squash and leafy green vegetables, have the same benefits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkey makes you tired : We\u2019ve all heard this one after Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 \u201cthe turkey made you fall asleep!\u201d Turkey contains an amino acid (a building block of protein) known as tryptophan, which the body uses to generate serotonin, which helps promote sleep. So then there must be something to this whole turkey-sleep connection, right?\n\nNot so fast. Turkey contains no more tryptophan than beef, eggs, fish or chicken, and tryptophan has a hard time getting past the blood-brain barrier, so it\u2019s not an effective sleep inducer on its own. But the effect of tryptophan increases when insulin levels are high, as happens after you eat a carb-rich meal \u2014 such as a Thanksgiving dinner with stuffing, potatoes and apple pie. So it\u2019s actually carbs that increase serotonin levels and help with the production of the hormone melatonin, which makes you sleepy. Eating a large meal can have a similar effect because there\u2019s increased blood flow to the stomach for digestion, and decreased blood flow to the brain. So it\u2019s definitely not just turkey that makes you sleepy.\n\nGinger relieves nausea : This remedy has strong roots. More than 5,000 years ago, people from India and China used ginger as a tonic to treat many ailments. The most common and \u00adwell-established historical use is to alleviate nausea and vomiting. \u00adFast-forward to the present day and there are many clinical studies that support the use of ginger for exactly this purpose.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResearch shows that ginger helps relieve nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness; morning sickness in pregnancy; during chemotherapy treatments; and post-surgically after anesthetic. It\u2019s thought that the constituents in ginger \u2014 including gingerols and shogaols \u2014 help speed up gastric emptying, which relieves nausea. Some people sip ginger tea for relief, while others prefer to take a ginger capsule, and studies show that both options can work. My mom used to open a can of ginger ale when I was queasy. While she was on the right track, it turns out many soda brands use artificial flavoring rather than real ginger, so those are of little benefit.\n\nFish is good for your brain: In his 1930 short-story collection \u201cVery Good Jeeves,\u201d British author and humorist P.G. Wodehouse wrote: \u201cThey say fish are good for the brain. Have a go at the sardines and come back and report.\u201d Wodehouse was onto something!\n\nIn 2016, researchers found that weekly consumption of fish was associated with high volume of gray matter, the dark tissue of the brain that\u2019s in charge of processing information and controlling vision and memory. Many people have postulated that the value of fish comes largely from omega-3 fats, which play many important roles in brain health. Yet, interestingly, this study showed that any fish \u2014 not just those high in omega-3 fat \u2014 had this positive effect. Another review study found that fish intake may help delay cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but cast doubt as to whether the omega-3 fats are the reason. That means taking omega-3 fish oil supplements (or drinking cod liver oil) for brain health may not cut it \u2014 there\u2019s something about eating a whole fish fillet that\u2019s more beneficial.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMustard helps with leg cramps : Have you ever been jolted from sleep with a leg cramp, or felt your calf seize after a run? Maybe you were told to take a shot of pickle juice or a teaspoon of yellow mustard. For years, people assumed this worked because the pickles and mustard contain fluids and sodium, which may help ease leg cramps caused by dehydration or an electrolyte imbalance. But research doesn\u2019t confirm this reasoning.\n\nIn one study, researchers induced leg cramps in male subjects, then gave them pickle juice or water. The pickle juice made the cramps go away faster, but effect was not due to restoring body fluids, or the water would have worked just as well. Plus, the researchers found no changes in plasma electrolytes or volume in the five minutes after ingesting the pickle juice. They concluded that the benefit from pickle juice could not be explained by rapid restoration of body fluids or electrolytes.\n\nNow researchers believe the problem is not actually with the muscle itself, but with the motor neurons that send signals to it, which become hyperactive. The researchers hypothesize that strong flavors (as in mustard or pickle juice) stimulate neurons in the mouth and upper GI tract, which in turn restores the normal activity of the motor neurons involved in muscle cramping \u2014 sort of like a distraction. There are no rigorous studies to prove this interesting theory, so drinking pickle juice remains mostly unsubstantiated. But if it works for you, drink up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegistered dietitian Cara Rosenbloom is president of Words to Eat By, a nutrition communications company specializing in writing, nutrition education and recipe development.
