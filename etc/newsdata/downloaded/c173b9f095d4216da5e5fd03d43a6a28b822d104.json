They have also applied to life the building height from 15 to 24 metres to house more people.\n\nThis is more far more than the company's original successful tender to build 1,850 in the projects in Menangle Park and Edmondson Park.\n\nThe new Menangle Park Country Club, which is set to open in January, could benefit from the Dahua Group master plan\n\nThe new communuity will have four new playing fields, a new school and a one hectare park connecting the development with the Nepean River and the Mt Annan Botanical Gardens.\n\nThe master plan is part of the state government's strategy of building 725,000 new homes to house an additional 1.7 million residents in Sydney by 2056.\n\nClub Menangle Chief Executive Bruce Christison (pictured) has said it is important the master plan benefits the right areas\n\nBruce Christison, the chief executive of Club Menangle, which is opening a new Country Club near the development in January, said the development had to fit in with the already established community.\n\n'We are obviously happy to see more people coming to the area from a club point of view,' he said.\n\n'I don't really have a problem with it personally if it is done in the right place.\n\nA future report on the planning proposal will be tabled before the Council for its consideration which will include the advice provided by the Local Planning Panel.", "description": "Chinese developer Dahua Group has set its sights on the small town of Menangle Park in the outskirts of Sydney, proposing a $1.5 billion masterplan for the area.", "authors": ["Sean Slatter For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/03/20162902-0-image-a-2_1571971159102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
