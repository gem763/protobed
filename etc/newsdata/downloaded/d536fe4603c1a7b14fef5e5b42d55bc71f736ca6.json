Echoes of that time reverberate in my coaching practice for parents of young adults when clients discuss their grown kids\u2019 upcoming or recent nuptials, and their efforts to accept the Other and adapt to their new role in their child\u2019s life.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those significant life events, and everyone responds differently, viewing it as either a personal gain or loss, but in either case, determined to do the best they can to support the couple.\n\n\u201cDo I wish she\u2019d married someone else? Absolutely. But do I want her to be happy? Of course. I just can\u2019t stand him,\u201d said a client. Another, with more pressing concerns, was pondering what to do about offering his son\u2019s partner a job in his business and how it would impact both his family and his firm. And a third was arguing with her husband about attending a lesbian daughter\u2019s wedding.\n\nTheir choices aren\u2019t ours\n\nResearch into parental control over their offspring\u2019s mating decisions has mostly been focused on an evolutionary psychology theory. According to Menelaneos Apostolou, a leading researcher in the field, parents have vested interests in their children\u2019s marital behavior. Accordingly, they employ a battery of tactics to manipulate the mate choices of their sons and daughters, which vary in effectiveness.\n\nEvidence from independent studies indicates that parental manipulation has an effect which is nevertheless small, with some tactics more effective than others. Researchers also found that parents have a good idea how effective their attempts at manipulation will be on their children\u2019s final choices.\n\nThere are cultures in which arranged marriages are the norm, and no doubt, the wishes those parents have for their kids are much the same as they are for us, though they may be better at wielding their influence than we are. But all of us know we can\u2019t choose who our kids love. In marriage, as in everything, we want the best for them. And their choices aren\u2019t ours.\n\nBe considerate of their needs as a couple\n\nI remember how my mother responded to the news of my elopement to a man she thought was wrong for me. To me, she said, \u201cYou can always come home if you want to,\u201d and to everyone else, she said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful? Yes, we\u2019re having a party for them, please come.\u201d\n\nShe found things to praise about him, like his manners (which were excellent) and his charm (which was considerable). And to her credit, she only actually said \u201cI told you\u201d so a few times when both wore thin.\n\nI was more discreet about my own daughter-in-law, and approached her warmly \u2014 or so I thought. Only my own daughter sensed I was less than wholly enthusiastic. \u201cI can tell you don\u2019t like her,\u201d she said, \u201cbut nobody else will [notice], including my brother.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Why you might want to move far away from your grown kids\n\nAnd so I learned by doing; by focusing on how happy she made him, by stepping out of their way and being thoughtful of her needs, by maintaining the degree of closeness and distance they, as a couple, managed. In some ways, it was better. She managed our relationship as a family in ways that curbed my tendency to trespass on their boundaries and I was included in their activities and consulted before decisions about holidays were finalized.\n\nWe were never emotionally close, but when she and my son divorced, I was truly sorry for all of us. In the many years since, she and I have become remarkably intimate friends; we have my grandson in common, as well as a variety of interests and talents that continue to surprise me. We\u2019ve both grown up and gotten over ourselves, is what it is. I still haven\u2019t curbed my tendency to write about my family (sorry, Jen). I call her, like my former son-in-law, mon putatifs, which is French for my putative, or \u2018as if\u2019 family members.\n\nKeep an eye on boundaries\n\nThere are obvious ways to be a good in-law, most of which involve reconciling your boundary style with theirs; that is, let them, individually and together, regulate the distance and closeness between you. That goes for not demanding their presence at every holiday; proffering your advice unless, and only after, they ask for it; refraining from expressing your judgment on their choice, taste, lifestyle \u2026you get the drill.\n\nRead: When your adult children keep asking for money, here\u2019s what to do\n\nIt means not taking sides, even when it\u2019s obvious who\u2019s at fault. Don\u2019t let your feelings get in the way of theirs. Be a sounding board if that\u2019s what they need. But otherwise, just offer them comfort, shelter and a respite from the storm if they need it. And then get over it, which they will regardless of the advice you couldn\u2019t help giving, without carrying grudges.\n\nIf, as a single parent, you\u2019ve been particularly emotionally close to your grown child, it\u2019s especially difficult to respect their couple boundary without feeling shut out of the intimacy you once enjoyed with your daughter or son.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to see your grown child as a member of a whole other family; \u201cFor so long it was just the two of us, and I felt so diminished by her fianc\u00e9\u2019s big, close-knit family,\u201d said one client. \u201cBut they welcomed me into their clan, and I\u2019m thrilled.\u201d\n\nOne final thing to remember from your seat right behind them as they\u2019re exchanging their vows: Smile like you mean it. Or, as my daughter said when my son got married, \u201cJust wear beige and keep your mouth shut.\u201d", "description": "Could it involve keeping opinions to yourself?
