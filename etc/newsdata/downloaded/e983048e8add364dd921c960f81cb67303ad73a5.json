(Photo: Charly Triballeau, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe long-rumored arrival of Sony's next PlayStation has officially been confirmed.\n\nTuesday, Sony revealed its next video game console, PlayStation 5, will launch during the holiday 2020 season.\n\n\"These updates may not be a huge surprise, but we wanted to confirm them for our PlayStation fans, as we start to reveal additional details about our vision for the next generation,\" Sony Interactive Entertainment President and CEO Jim Ryan said in a statement.\n\nNext year is likely to be a pivotal one for the video game business: Two new consoles are slated to launch by the holiday season. This year, Microsoft confirmed it will launch the next Xbox, dubbed \"Project Scarlett,\" in 2020.\n\nHere's what we know about the PlayStation 5:\n\nThe controller gets a significant upgrade\n\nThe PlayStation's classic controller will experience a couple of major changes. First, the \"rumble\" tech found in current controllers will be replaced by haptic feedback. Ryan said the technology will offer more detailed feedback for players. \"Crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.\"\n\nThe controllers will have adaptive triggers, with inputs that vary based on the action a player performs. As Ryan explained, players might feel things such as the tension of a bow as they draw it back or the acceleration of a vehicle through rocky terrain.\n\nProject Scarlett: Microsoft unveils its next Xbox\n\nGreen gaming: Climate-friendly changes coming to Xbox, PlayStation\n\nGame downloads will work differently\n\nAccording to a feature on Wired, players will have more choices in how to download and manage games on the device's solid-state drive. The PS5 could allow players to download only parts of a game, such as the multiplayer portion, Wired reported, or players could download a full game, then delete the single-player campaign when they're done.\n\nWhat is 'ray tracing'?\n\nThe PS5 will include a technique called ray tracing, according to Wired, which will create more robust lighting and sound. Mark Cerny, who helped build the PS5, told Wired accelerated ray tracing is baked into the system itself, instead of being implemented through software.\n\n\"Ray tracing\u2019s immediate benefits are largely visual,\" Wired reported in April. \"Because it mimics the way light bounces from object to object in a scene, reflective surfaces and refractions through glass or liquid can be rendered much more accurately, even in real time, leading to heightened realism.\"\n\nWe still don't know what it looks like\n\nWhat Sony has yet to reveal in this information dump on PS5 is what the console looks like. PlayStation 4, which hit stores in 2013, sported a sleeker body than its bulkier predecessor. If PS5 follows the trajectory of the PS4, expect a first look at the device early next year followed by specific release dates and prices by summer.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2019/10/08/playstation-5-sony-2020-launch/3906680002/", "description": "Sony confirmed it will launch the PlayStation 5, its next video game console, during the holiday 2020 season.
