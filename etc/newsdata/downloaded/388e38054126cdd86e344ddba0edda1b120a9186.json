Recently, she recreated all of Taylor Swift's (right) seven album covers including her first one (pictured)\n\nPerfection: She shared seven images of herself last week recreating each of Taylor Swift's album covers for her Instagram followers. Pictured is Taylor's second album Fearless\n\nAll in the details: Each of the recreation images show Rachel in a nearly identical outfit to Taylor with her hair and makeup styled similarly\n\n'I've heard every album, listened to the radio waited for something to come along that was as good as TAYLOR SWIFT,' Rachel wrote in an Instagram post when sharing the first three album covers.\n\n'My biggest #RachRecreates to date \u2014 recreating all 7 of @taylorswift\u2019s album covers!'\n\nShe continued: 'I have been a huge fan of Taylor since her first album & I\u2019ve felt so connected to her over the years \u2014 from my years in Nashville to moving to New York City. This one is for you, Taylor. Happy #13yearsoftaylor.'\n\nThe recreation started with Taylor Swift's first album, Taylor Swift, from when the singer was doing only country music and modeling her blonde curly hair.\n\nRachel was able to match Taylor's curly locks while also posing with a background designed nearly identical to the album cover.\n\nThen the influencer moved on to Taylor's second album titled Fearless where the singer is modeling a similar hairstyle that is then tossed up around her face. Again, Rachel was able to match Taylor's look to be nearly identical to each other.\n\nAccurate: Rachel would also mirror Taylor's pose for the album cover, like what she did for the album Red\n\nTrue fan: 'I've heard every album, listened to the radio waited for something to come along that was as good as TAYLOR SWIFT,' Rachel wrote in an Instagram post when sharing the album covers\n\nMaking an effort: Rachel also aimed with each recreation to pose similar to Taylor in both body posture and facial expression to get the covers just right\n\nHer love song: Commenters enjoyed the recreation images, which Rachel said was her 'labor of Love(r)' to Taylor\n\nThese album recreations continued with Rachel making sure to mirror Taylor in what she wore on each cover as well as how her hair was styled.\n\nThe singer's Speak Now cover was matched with nearly identical purple gown worn by Taylor, and then the Red cover was mirrored with the addition of a hat and a white button-up shirt.\n\nRachel also aimed with each recreation to pose similar to Taylor in both body posture and facial expression to get the covers just right.\n\n'I\u2019m so proud of this labor of Love(r) for my girl Taylor,' Rachel wrote.\n\nThe album recreations ended with Taylor's final album Lover, which she released earlier this year. Rachel was able to recreate the cover by finding a similar tie-dye shirt. She also dyed the tips of her blonde hair blue to match that of Taylor.\n\nCommenters praised Rachel for her commitment to recreating the looks, calling the influencer's recreations 'genius' and 'well executed' to make them look just like the original covers.\n\n'Oh my god, I\u2019ve been hit by nostalgia tsunami!
