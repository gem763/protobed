I will only take real satisfaction from the innings if we win back the Ashes.\u201d\n\nStokes praised the contribution of England\u2019s last man and new cult hero Jack Leach, who faced 17 deliveries for his one run at Headingley.\n\nThe pair put on 74 in the space of an hour to frustrate Australia, who had bowled the hosts out for 67 in the first innings.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty iconic picture, Jack Leach cleaning his glasses after every ball and the video of him running down the pitch has gone viral as well,\u201d Stokes added.\n\n\u201cHe has to take a lot of credit from the game because the 17 balls he faced are probably the most crucial he will ever face in his career.\n\n\u201cWe knew how much time we had left in the innings and we were fully prepared to take it into day five because we didn\u2019t have any scoreboard pressure.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old says England go into the fourth Test with a huge amount of belief after snatching victory from the jaws of defeat on Sunday.\n\nTim Paine\u2019s Australia may still be reeling, though, after coming so close to retaining the urn they hold after winning the 2017-18 series 4-0.\n\nStokes believes the Australians probably felt they had the match wrapped up when Stuart Broad was out lbw to leave England on 286 for nine.\n\nBut with the Headingley crowd on their feet \u2013 and at certain stages with their shoes off in a tribute to chant to Stokes \u2013 the Durham man delivered with eight sixes and 11 hours in his knock of 135 off 219 balls.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe crowd were so, so loud and they were during the whole four days. We have an amazing support and I didn\u2019t get told until after about everyone taking their shoes off, but they are your 12th man.\n\n\u201cMomentum is huge in sport and I\u2019m 100 per cent sure when Stuart Broad got out Australia would have thought they will have the Ashes by the end of the day, so we go into the next match with a lot of confidence.\n\n\u201cI think we are very aware as a team and as players that we have a responsibility to inspire the next generation of cricketers.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in the first half of the summer (win the World Cup) helped us to do that and if we win the Ashes hopefully it will help produce more cricketers out of England over the next 20 years.\u201d", "description": "Ben Stokes accepts his match-winning innings for England against Australia in the third Test at Headingley will count for little unless they win back the Ashes.
