REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nTrump said Bolton had made mistakes, including offending North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un by demanding that he follow a \u201cLibyan model\u201d and hand over all his nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cWe were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model ... what a disaster,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using that to make a deal with North Korea? And I don\u2019t blame Kim Jong Un for what he said after that, and he wanted nothing to do with John Bolton. And that\u2019s not a question of being tough. That\u2019s a question of being not smart to say something like that.\u201d\n\nTrump also said he disagreed with Bolton on Venezuela but offered no specifics. \u201cI thought he was way out of line and I think I\u2019ve proven to be right,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump said Bolton, with his abrasive, hardline approach, \u201cwasn\u2019t getting along with people in the administration that I consider very important.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn wasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump said he got along with Bolton and hoped they parted on good terms, but added: \u201cMaybe we have and maybe we haven\u2019t. I have to run the country the way we\u2019re running the country.\u201d\n\nTrump had been growing more impatient with the failure to oust socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro through a U.S.-led campaign of sanctions and diplomacy in which Bolton was a driving force.\n\nBolton was also a chief architect of the Trump administration\u2019s hardline policy on Iran.\n\nAsked whether he would consider easing sanctions on Iran to secure a meeting with its leader President Hassan Rouhani at this month\u2019s U.N. General Assembly, Trump replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Bolton had opposed such a step.\n\nNorth Korea has denounced Bolton as a \u201cwar maniac\u201d and \u201chuman scum.\u201d Last year, it threatened to call off a first summit between Kim and Trump after Bolton suggested the Libya model of unilateral disarmament. In the past Bolton had proposed using military force to overthrow the country\u2019s ruling dynasty.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to engage with North Korea nearly fell apart altogether in February after he followed Bolton\u2019s advice at a second summit in Hanoi and handed Kim a piece of paper that called for the transfer of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States.\n\nTrump announced he had fired Bolton a day after North Korea signaled a new willingness to resume stalled denuclearization talks, but it then proceeded with the latest in a spate of missile test launches.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAnalysts say Bolton\u2019s removal could help U.S. efforts to revive the talks but will not make it easier for Washington to persuade Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons.\n\nWashington has given no indication so far that it will soften its demand for North Korea\u2019s ultimate denuclearization, even though with Bolton gone, the risky all-or-nothing gambit is unlikely to be repeated so bluntly.\n\n\u201cThis change in personnel could carve out some space for new approaches or thinking about what defines success and how to achieve it,\u201d said Jenny Town at 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea project. \u201cWhether it actually does or whether Bolton\u2019s view was more deeply entrenched in U.S. thinking on this matter is yet to be seen.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that John Bolton, dismissed a day earlier as national security adviser, had been a \"disaster\" on North Korea policy, \"out of line\" on Venezuela, and did not get along with important administration officials.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428818673&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1U9", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
