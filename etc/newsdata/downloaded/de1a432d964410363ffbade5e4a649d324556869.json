We can see homework that needs to be handed in and we can just do revision at break times or when we have free lessons.\n\n\"My parents think it's a good idea because they can see if I need more help at home and they can track what I'm doing.\"\n\nHe likes using educational videos \"to learn through listening and watching things rather than copying things down\" and Kahoot, an app which provides a quick way for teachers to quiz pupils to check their learning.\n\nMr Williams said he had not seen any negative impact on pupil wellbeing and nearly all children have a smartphone, with devices being shared to make sure no one misses out.\n\nWhy have other schools banned phones?\n\nImage caption At Llangatwg Community School, head teacher Alan Rowlands uses a walkie talkie to communicate with staff after banning mobiles\n\nLlangatwg Community School just outside Neath encourages children to use technology \"where appropriate\", but in September they banned phones - teachers now use walkie-talkies to communicate.\n\nHead teacher Alan Rowlands said: \"What we were finding as a school was the overreliance on mobile phones was affecting children's concentration levels, affecting their communication with each other and we really asked ourselves the serious question what is the purpose of a mobile phone in school?\"\n\nChildren are allowed to have phones turned off in their bags, but they are not allowed to be seen during the school day.\n\n\"Some of us felt it would be difficult to implement, however... the children seem very much on board,\" Mr Rowlands said.\n\nImage caption Head boy and head girl Benjamin and Annalise said pupils talk to each other more and listen better after the ban\n\nHead boy and Year 11 pupil Benjamin said children were listening more, while head girl Annalise, 15, said it was \"100 times better now\" and no longer thinks about checking her texts or social media.\n\n\"I used to walk in the canteen, everyone was on their phones, and no one's socialising, they were used excessively\u2026 People are now interacting,\" she added.\n\nMr Rowlands found the policy change \"liberating\" and said while it may seem counterintuitive to remove technology from the classroom, the school had seen benefits in communication between pupils and staff.\n\nMany schools have a policy that mobiles should be switched off during lessons, but some - such as Aberconwy School in Conwy, allow their use at break times.\n\nStanwell School in Penarth has a total ban on electronic devices of any sort and they cannot be brought to school unless officially authorised.\n\nAre there rules on phone use in schools?\n\nThe Welsh Government said it did not issue guidance on the use of mobile phones, as \"it is a matter for individual schools\" but the effect on learning and wellbeing should be considered.\n\n\"Teachers already have the power to restrict the use of phones and we recognise that, where managed properly, phones can be used effectively in classrooms as learning tool,\" a spokesman said.\n\nThe UK government policy is that it is the responsibility of head teachers to determine on how phones should be used.\n\nLast year, the then-UK culture secretary Matt Hancock said he admired schools that had enforced mobile phone bans.\n\nWhat do teaching unions say?\n\nNASUWT said schools should have clear and robust phone and social media policies.\n\nIts official in Wales, Neil Butler, said: \"Too often pupils are distracted from learning by constantly checking their phones and messaging. No pupil needs constant access to their phone during lessons.\"\n\nSarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser for the National Association for Head Teachers, said the union supported school autonomy on the issue: \"Outright banning mobile phones can cause more problems than it solves, making problems less visible and obvious for schools to tackle.\"\n\nWhat questions do you have about children and their use of technology - inside or outside the classroom?
