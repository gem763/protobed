Sign up here.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean premier Lee Nak-yon agreed they must work to ease the feud between the two neighbors after their highest-level meeting in more than a year.\n\nBoth sides issued statements expressing a desire to repair ties after a roughly 20-minute meeting between the two leaders. Lee delivered a letter to Abe from South Korean President Moon Jae-in that, according to the Yonhap News Agency, described Japan as a valuable partner in securing a lasting peace with North Korea and urged efforts to resolve the their disputes.\n\nAbe told Lee that relations must not be left in their current state, which he described as \u201cvery severe,\u201d according to the Japanese foreign ministry. Lee urged Abe to continue communications and exchanges, South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said separately.\n\nThe meeting is the most positive signal since South Korean courts issued a series of rulings last year backing the claims of people forced to work for Japanese companies during the country\u2019s 1910-45 occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Abe last met South Korea\u2019s president in September 2018 and passed up a chance to meet him for formal talks during Group of 20 events in Osaka in June.\n\nTensions have rapidly escalated, with Japan striking South Korea from a list of trusted export destinations and imposing restrictions on the sale of specialized materials essential to the country\u2019s semiconductor- and display-manufacturing industries. South Korea responded by announcing its withdrawal from an intelligence-sharing pact, as its citizens boycotted Japanese goods and travel.\n\nAfter largely sitting on the sidelines as tensions re-emerged, the Trump administration has recently pushed the two sides to try to work out their differences. The U.S. has been particularly critical of South Korea\u2019s exit from the intelligence pact, since it\u2019s relying on cooperation between its two closest Asian allies to help counter China and North Korea.\n\nAs the meeting started in Tokyo, South Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa offered support for the discussions and said in Seoul her government will work to improve ties with its neighbor through dialogue. She also cautioned that Japan needs to withdraw its export curbs for ties to improve.\n\nThe pretext for Lee\u2019s visit was his attendance at Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony Tuesday. \u201cI do not expect everything to be solved during my visit to Japan, but I do have ambitions of finding a clue in solving something,\u201d he told a group of ethnic Koreans in Japan, according to a report published Wednesday by the Seoul Economic Daily.\n\nJapan argues that all Korean compensation claims were settled by a 1965 treaty that established ties between the two countries. Moon has said the U.S.-brokered agreement didn\u2019t take into account the emotional suffering of the victims of Japan\u2019s occupation.\n\nEach country is the other\u2019s third-largest trading partner and neither can afford a damaging economic fight as global growth cools. South Korean exports are poised for an 11th monthly decline and semiconductor sales, which account for the largest share of exports, fell 29% in the first 20 days of October, according to the Korea Customs Service.\n\nThe number of South Koreans visiting Japan dropped by about 58% in September from the year earlier period, data showed. If unresolved, the trend could undercut Abe\u2019s tourism drive ahead of the Tokyo Olympics next year.\n\n\u201cThe current dismal situation does not benefit either country,\u201d said Kak Soo Shin, South Korea\u2019s ambassador to Japan from 2011 to 2013.\n\n(Updates headline and first sentence with meeting outcome.)", "description": "Japan, South Korea Agree to Mend Ties After Ice-Breaking Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picdbc035d19161d55cec38b61823a1cba4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
