Just hours after Frank Steffen-Walliser, Porsche head of sports cars, told Autocar that Porsche is considering a Cayman GT4 RS, our wily spy photographers checked in with this set of photos depicting what appears to be a 718 Cayman GT4 RS undergoing testing.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Chris Doane Automotive - Car and Driver More\n\nWe can't say these events come as a surprise, as the GT4 RS has been rumored since the 2020 718 Cayman GT4 was revealed earlier this year. Porsche indicated at the time, unofficially of course, that the GT4's 414-hp 4.0-liter flat-six held some untapped potential even without resorting to forced induction. While it's anyone's guess how much could reliably be milked from the engine, estimates of 450 horsepower are likely within reach.\n\nAs for transmission choices, the GT4 RS could go either way; the 718 Cayman GT4 is offered exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission, but the GT3 RS gets a PDK as the sole option. We\u2019re leaning toward the latter, as the fast and intuitive action of the PDK makes it a natural for track duty.\n\nIn addition to the louvers\u2014which could be temporarily mounted over the windows or outright replace them\u2014 along with the NACA ducts and a boisterous rear wing that appears to be suspended by universal struts to allow for various positioning options, we expect the Porsche to try and trim some weight wherever possible to make the GT4 RS as quick as possible. We also expect slight tweaks in the steering suspension and braking departments, although the extent of these items is not clear from the spy photos.\n\nIf everything goes according to expectations, look for the Cayman GT4 RS to appear in the fall of 2020 with a price significantly higher than the $100,450 ask of the 2020 718 Cayman GT4.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It has been long rumored\u2014and this new evidence suggests the Cayman GT4 RS will see production.", "authors": ["Andrew Wendler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.P4Tq.COeq8zYfBZ8fsg9A--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/2d05078b325100c245d340e48c39d035", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
