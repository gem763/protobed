I read the interview and it was perfect. It was incredibly respectful, like Gabriel is.\n\n\u201cOf course he wants to play. He\u2019s the number nine for the national team, Brazil. He\u2019s maybe the only striker in the world at his level that has to have this mentality.\n\n\u201cEvery time he went on the pitch \u2013 one second, two minutes, 90 minutes \u2013 he plays like an animal.\n\n\u201cI understand completely. I try but no player, not only Gabriel, will be happy if they don\u2019t play regularly. That is what it is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy answer. If he plays he will be happy, if he doesn\u2019t play he will not be happy.\u201d\n\nJesus scored his third goal of the season in Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup win at Preston but, as Guardiola prefers to play only one striker, he may have to make way again at Everton in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nGuardiola said: \u201cI try to let both players play as much as possible. Both are incredible players.\n\n\u201cSergio could have scored five goals against Watford and Gabriel could have scored three or four against Preston. Gabriel was incredible in the (FA Cup) final against Watford and against Shakhtar (Donetsk in the Champions League).\n\n\u201cNormally I don\u2019t play with two strikers. I did in the last minutes at Norwich and it wasn\u2019t good. So it\u2019s difficult for me to tell one you don\u2019t play.\n\n\u201cIn some games Gabriel gives me something Sergio can\u2019t, and other games Sergio gives us something Gabriel cannot. Both guys are incredible.\u201d\n\nOne player making his way back into the City side after more than two years of injury problems is left-back Benjamin Mendy.\n\nThe Frenchman had another half-an-hour at Preston after playing the first 45 minutes of last Saturday\u2019s 8-0 thrashing of Watford and is determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nMendy said: \u201cIt was not easy because I understand some people were saying, \u2018He never plays\u2019 or something like that. I know some said this.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m back and I want to give everything for this club and this team. I came here to do this. I knew what I could give to this team and I was sad because I lost the time but it\u2019s like this.\n\n\u201cI can do nothing about my injury, now I forget the past and I focus on the present and the future.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Pep Guardiola has hailed Gabriel Jesus as a special talent and can understand his frustration at his lack of starts for Manchester City.
