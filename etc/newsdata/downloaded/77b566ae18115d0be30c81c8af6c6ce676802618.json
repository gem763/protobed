The parade will culminate with the unveiling of some pretty impressive weapons, including the Dong Feng 41 intercontinental-range ballistic missile\u2014one of China\u2019s longest-range missiles, capable of throwing multiple nuclear warheads across the entirety of the United States. Beijing may also show off new weapons based on technology still under development in the United States, like its Dong Feng 17 hypersonic missile.\n\nThe reaction to the parade by many observers in the United States will be predictable panic. For the Trump administration and its supporters on the Hill, Xi\u2019s demonstration will serve as fodder for the argument that Beijing\u2019s growing arsenal must be constrained by bringing China into future U.S.-Russia arms control talks. \u201cBeijing can no longer credibly make the case that its forces are so small\u2014and intended only for a secure, retaliatory deterrent\u2014that they need not be included in arms-control negotiations,\u201d two former Bush administration officials wrote in the National Review last spring, seeking to make this case.\n\nDon\u2019t buy it. While China\u2019s ever-advancing capabilities are a cause for concern, proposals to \u201ctrilateralize\u201d nuclear arms control are nothing more than a poison pill for existing bilateral arrangements, like the 2011 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between Washington and Moscow. China won\u2019t join such an arrangement, and pursuing this objective\u2014as the Trump administration has indicated it might\u2014will be a wild goose chase.\n\nAs the demise of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty earlier this year underscored, global arms control is in trouble. The United States and Russia are trying to squeeze through a fast-closing window to extend New START, the only major accord standing between mutual nuclear restraint and a potential renewed Cold War\u2013style arms race. The treaty limits the countries\u2019 deployed strategic nuclear weapons to a total of 1,550 and restricts their delivery methods (i.e., missiles and bombers) as well. The treaty succeeded in verifiably reducing the two countries\u2019 arsenals; both sides announced they had met the reduction requirements in February 2018.\n\n", "description": "Hawks are telling the president to toughen up on Chinese nukes, but their plan might spur a new global atomic arms race.", "authors": ["Ankit Panda"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/6df043e2346dc1690d4c417e484b130125cf5256.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
