Taxing unrealized gains at death could let Congress raise the capital gains rate to 50% before revenue from it would start to drop, according to the Tax Policy Center, because investors would no longer delay sales in hopes of a zero tax bill when they die. And indeed, Mr. Biden has proposed doubling the income-tax rate to 40% on capital gains for taxpayers with incomes of $1 million or more. But for Democrats, repealing stepped-up basis has drawbacks. Much of the money wouldn\u2019t come in for years, until people died. The Treasury Department estimated a plan Mr. Obama put out in 2016 would generate $235 billion over a decade, less than 10% of what advisers to Sen. Warren\u2019s campaign say her tax plan would raise. That lag raises another risk. Wealthy taxpayers would have incentives to get Congress to reverse the tax before their heirs face it.\n\nWyden Plan\n\nInstead of attacking favorable treatment of inherited assets, Mr. Wyden goes after the other main principle of capital-gains taxation\u2014that gains must be realized before taxes are imposed. The Oregon senator is designing a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d system. Annual increases in the value of people\u2019s assets would be taxed as income, even if the assets aren\u2019t sold. Someone who owned stock that was worth $400 million on Jan. 1 but $500 million on Dec. 31 would add $100 million to income on his or her tax return. For the government, money would start flowing in immediately. The tax would hit every year, not just when an asset-holder died. Mr. Wyden would apply this regime to just the top 0.3% of taxpayers, said spokeswoman Ashley Schapitl. There are serious challenges. Revenue could be volatile as markets rise and fall. Also, the IRS would determine asset increases annually, requiring baseline values and ways to measure change. That\u2019s easy for stocks and bonds but far more complicated for private businesses or artwork. The rules would have to address how to treat assets that lose instead of gain value in a year, and how taxpayers would raise cash to pay taxes on assets they didn\u2019t sell. Under Mr. Castro\u2019s proposal, losses could be used to offset other taxes or carried forward to future years.\n\nWarren Plan\n\nThe most ambitious plan comes from Sen. Warren of Massachusetts, whose annual wealth tax would fund spending proposals such as universal child care and student-loan forgiveness. The ultra-rich would pay whether they make money or not, whether they sell assets or not and whether their assets are growing or shrinking. Ms. Warren, who draws cheers at campaign events when she mentions the tax, would impose a 2% tax each year on individuals\u2019 assets above $50 million and a further 1% on assets above $1 billion. Fellow candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke has also backed a wealth tax, and it is one of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 options for financing Medicare-for-All.\n\nWon't Stop There\n\nExpect more and more radical ideas to pay for nonsense like the \"Green New Deal\", an idea that will cost an estimated $51 to $93 trillion.\n\nElizabeth Warren backs the Green New Deal so she is the most desperate to raise the most money the fastest.\n\nThey claim this a tax only on the wealthiest citizens. It won't stop there. It never does.", "description": "Democrat candidates are lining up with a numerous radical schemes .09/02/2019 3:23:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/795d028d-3028-4c36-a735-32db25524eb5.png"}
