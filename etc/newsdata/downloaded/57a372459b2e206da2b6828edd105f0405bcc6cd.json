I pray that there will be none, because what is at stake is people\u2019s spiritual health,\u201d he told journalists on board the plane.\n\nThe Pope\u2019s impassioned defence of migrants and refugees, his opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s wall on the US-Mexico border, his sympathy towards homosexuals and his openness to remarried divorcees being allowed to take communion have earned him the ire of conservatives, particularly in the US.\n\nPope Francis answered questions from journalists while travelling back from a trip to Africa Credit: ALESSANDRA TARANTINO/ AFP More\n\nHe said he was open to discussing differences of opinion with his critics, some of whom have accused him of heresy and have called for his resignation.\n\n\u201cLet there be dialogue, let there be correction if there is an error, but the schismatic path is not Christian,\u201d he said.\n\nHis critics were putting ideology over Catholic doctrine and deserved sympathy, not hostility.\n\n\u201cWe need to be gentle with those who are tempted by these attacks, they are going through a tough time, we must accompany them gently,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Catholic Church last suffered a schism in 1988, when Marcel Lefebvre, an ultra-traditionalist French archbishop, ordained bishops without papal permission and started his own movement.\n\nFrancis insisted that many of his views were similar to those of Pope John Paul II, who is regarded as an icon by conservatives, in part for his role in standing up to the USSR and bringing about the fall of Communism.\n\n\u201cThe social things that I say are the same things that John Paul II said, the same things. I copy him. But they say: \u2018the Pope is a communist.\u2019\u201d\n\nPope Francis arrives for his weekly general audience, at the Vatican on Sept. 11 Credit: AP More\n\nHe said he was happy for critics to address him openly, but condemned those who launched attacks in an underhand way.", "description": "Pope Francis said he does not fear a schism within the Roman Catholic Church, as criticism grows among conservatives of his liberal views on migrants, the protection of the environment and giving communion to divorcees.
