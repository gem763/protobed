Thank you Hillary Clinton,\u201d Gabbard tweeted on Friday afternoon. \u201cYou, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine,\u201d Gabbard added.\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nClinton, who has blamed everyone from the FBI to Russia for her 2016 loss to Donald Trump, said in an interview on Thursday that \u201cRussians\u201d were \u201cgrooming\u201d someone in the Democrat primary field to run as a third-party candidate. While not calling out Gabbard by name, her spokesperson later told CNN, \u201cif the nesting doll fits,\u201d leaving no room for doubt.\n\nOf all the candidates in the crowded Democrat primary field, Gabbard has been under the heaviest fire from journalists who previously boosted Clinton, accused of being an \u201cAssad apologist\u201d over a fact-finding trip she took to Syria years ago.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Russians\u2019 are grooming Tulsi Gabbard, hints Hillary Clinton (& by the way, Jill Stein\u2019s \u2018totally\u2019 a Russian asset too)\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly,\u201d Gabbard called out Clinton, who has dropped hints that she might run again in 2020 as a rematch for her 2016 humiliation.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Gabbard resigned as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee after endorsing Bernie Sanders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Clinton beat Sanders out for the nomination largely due to support from the unaccountable \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d and it emerged later that her campaign had taken over the DNC entirely \u2013 which might help explain Gabbard\u2019s line about \u201cthe rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
