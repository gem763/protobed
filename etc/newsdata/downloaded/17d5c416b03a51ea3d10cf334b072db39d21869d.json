Simpson spoke to People about dating the singer, and, as expected, he only has positive things to say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. We are very, very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s creative. She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense. That\u2019s why we get along so well. We just have a ball, yeah, and that\u2019s the most important part of a relationship, you know?\u201d\n\nThe two have been friends for years, and Simpson had even been public about his childhood crush on Cyrus when he was a teenager.\n\n\u201cThe reason why it hasn\u2019t been a really crazy sudden thing is just because we\u2019ve been friends for so long,\u201d he said, adding that they \u201cfound each other again in a space where we\u2019re both not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy and it\u2019s good. Any girlfriends I\u2019ve had in the past has always been immediate romance and so it\u2019s a different experience having been friends with somebody before and it developing naturally into something more.\u201d\n\nSimpson also revealed that he\u2019ll be releasing a new song next week, which he wrote for Cyrus while she was in the hospital last week recovering from tonsillitis. Cyrus posted photos and videos to her Instagram of Simpson bringing her flowers and serenading her while she was there.\n\n\u201cI wrote her a song this week that she\u2019s pretty much forcing me to put out,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was like, \u2018If you don\u2019t put this shit out, I\u2019m putting it out on your behalf for you. I\u2019m getting your Spotify login and doing this shit myself.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "And he only had great things to say.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YCsPiDr.9DveAZ_AHY7NBQ--~B/aD0xMDcxO3c9MjEzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/802fa266478225ac50b19210dd519933", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
