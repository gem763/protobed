Nothing is new,\u201d Republican Representative Scott Perry said after several hours of testimony. \u201cThe accusations that are being leveled against the president aren\u2019t being corroborated in any of this witness testimony and today in my opinion is no different.\u201d\n\nReeker submitted to questioning in response to a congressional subpoena that was issued after the State Department attempted to block his testimony, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe testimony was the first since a federal judge on Friday rejected a claim by Trump and his Republican allies that the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry process was illegitimate because the full House had not voted to authorize it.\n\nPhilip Reeker, U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, arrives to testify in impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump, in Washington, U.S., October 26, 2019. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sept. 24 launched the formal Trump probe under her broad powers as speaker.\n\nThe White House, citing the lack of an authorizing vote, had claimed the inquiry was \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d and defied numerous congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony.\n\nFOCUS ON UKRAINE\n\nAt the heart of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens and a claim - debunked as a conspiracy theory - that a Democratic National Committee computer server was in Ukraine.\n\nWilliam Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified on Tuesday that Trump made the withheld aid contingent on Zelenskiy announcing the requested investigations.\n\nReeker was unaware in the June-August period of the possibility Trump may have withheld the aid or a meeting to pressure Zelenskiy, the source said.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and, backed by his fellow Republicans in Congress, insists he is being treated unfairly.\n\nReeker, 54, a career diplomat, is the latest in a growing list of current and former officials who have met with investigators.\n\nAmong the issues the committees were expected to explore with Reeker was Trump\u2019s abrupt dismissal in May of the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. According to emails given to congressional committees this month, Reeker sought to intervene when Trump supporters accused Yovanovitch of being disloyal to the president.\n\nReeker sought a stronger State Department defense of Yovanovitch under U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s name, according to the source familiar with the matter, but this appeared to have been stymied \u201cfrom the top,\u201d though it was not clear if Pompeo himself had objected.\n\nThe committees have scheduled several depositions for next week, all behind closed doors.\n\nCharles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump, who was called to appear on Monday, has asked a court whether he should to comply with a congressional subpoena or honor the administration\u2019s instruction not to testify.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers expect to hear from Alexander Vindman, the White House National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert.\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security, is scheduled to appear on Wednesday, and Tim Morrison, a top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, is scheduled for Thursday.", "description": "A senior U.S. diplomat on Saturday offered what Democrats characterized as corroborating testimony in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, although the witness was expected to tell lawmakers his knowledge of the events at hand was limited.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445276464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0ME", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
