It originally appeared on scmp.com on Oct. 20, 2019.\n\nHong Kong protesters went on a rampage on Sunday hurling petrol bombs and setting ablaze multiple stores along Kowloon\u2019s main thoroughfare, as police fired tear gas and water cannons which sprayed the entrance of the city\u2019s biggest mosque with blue dye, fueling tensions in the area.\n\nThe arson attacks began from around 3 p.m. and lasted for more than eight hours as they set off fires inside mainland-linked businesses and police and metro stations, before gutting a Xiaomi shop and Chinese medicine store Tong Ren Tang in Mong Kok.\n\nAs the city marked the 20th weekend of violent protests, demonstrators kicked off an illegal march in Tsim Sha Tsui peacefully but the initial calm dissipated in less than two hours as marauding protesters began blocking roads and throwing bricks and petrol bombs.\n\nKowloon Mosque and Chungking Mansions had been on high alert ahead of the march amid fears that there would be retribution against the city\u2019s ethnic minority groups after Civil Human Rights Front\u2019s convener Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit was attacked by people described to be of South Asian descent last Wednesday.\n\nWhile protesters steered clear of the place for worship, the mosque\u2019s gates ended up being soaked in blue solution by the police\u2019s water cannon that was spotted going up and down Nathan Road several times firing randomly at no one in particular or at groups of bystanders and journalists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why dye was sprayed on the religious building as there were not many people around,\u201d said Mohammed Sadeque, 34, who came from Kolkata to settle in the city 12 years ago. But he appreciated fellow Hong Kongers who helped to clean up the colored mess afterward.\n\nThe front, which applied for a march today but failed, condemned police\u2019s use of a water cannon on the mosque, calling the action \u201ctotally unnecessary\u201d as there were only \u201ca few people\u201d nearby.\n\nHong Kong Unison, which reported that some of its members were doused in the dye and injured while safeguarding the mosque, issued a statement saying it was \u201coutraged by police's unjustifiable and rash action.\u201d\n\nIt demanded police explain their actions for deploying the \u201cstinging dye\u201d and issue an apology to those injured, as well as to the mosque.\n\nLater in the evening, Ho Yun-sing, the district commander of Yau Tsim, visited the mosque to meet with the imam for 45 minutes. It was unclear whether there was an apology.\n\nProtesters set fire to a Xiaomi shop at Nathan road in Hong Kong, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019. Hong Kong protesters again flooded streets on Sunday, ignoring a police ban on the rally and setting up barricades amid tear gas and firebombs.

Protesters later returned to the medicine store to set it on fire.", "description": "This story is being published by POLITICO as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post.
