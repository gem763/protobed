But that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t still strive for a happily ever after.\n\nOn October 9, the Washington Examiner published an opinion piece on, \u201cWhy super-successful women struggle in love.\u201d Relationship expert and author Suzanne Venker claimed that \u201cfew, if any, women\u201d can have both \u201cpower in the world\u201d and \u201cpower in bed.\u201d While she backed up her arguments, her piece left something to be desired by women: encouragement.\n\nVenker began by referencing a Wall Street Journal piece, arguing that \u201cAs women have become more and more rich, love has indeed become more and more elusive.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to an email about one of the women dealing with this very problem \u2013 written by the woman\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about my daughter who\u2019s a high achiever,\u201d the mom began. \u201cShe\u2019s a thirty-eight-year-old, well-educated (two Ivy League schools), creative, intelligent, sophisticated, loving, successful, attractive, with a model-like body, and surprisingly can\u2019t find a desired partner.\u201d\n\nWhile previously \u201cshe wasted many years on several senseless relationships,\u201d her daughter is \u201cextremely unhappy that she doesn\u2019t have a partner,\u201d or children.\n\nIn response, Venker urged that not only do successful single women struggle, but also women who serve as the primary breadwinner. There are many reasons why \u201clove becomes a struggle the more successful women become,\u201d she said, including the \u201cpursuit of a post-secondary education and career.\u201d\n\n\u201cJumping in full throttle and making work the center of one\u2019s life, as young women are encouraged to do, invariably means this group will be unable to take advantage of their greatest marital bargaining power,\u201d she said.\n\nThat main \u201cbargaining power\u201d appeared to be beauty.\n\n\u201cWhen a woman is in her 20s, she has beauty and fertility on her side. By the time she hits her 30s, she has to compete with younger, more beautiful women,\u201d Venker warned. \u201cNot only are the pickings slim, a woman\u2019s attractiveness peaks in her 20s.\u201d\n\nWhile men also become physically less attractive over time, their \u201cpower and status rises,\u201d which continues to attract women. Men, on the other hand, could care less about a woman's socioeconomic status, she added.\n\nIf there are \u201cno longer enough men in their same sociological status,\u201d then successful women who want to marry must either \u201chold out for an older and richer man\u201d with baggage or \u201cmarry \u2018down\u2019 and learn how to be content with a good man who\u2019s less educated or less rich.\u201d\n\nThese women, she concluded, should ask themselves, \u201cWhich do I want more? Power in the world, or power in bed?\u201d because \u201cFew, if any, women have both.\u201d\n\nOr can they?\n\nThe woman in the email wasn\u2019t single because she was consumed totally by her career \u2013 she had time for \u201cseveral senseless relationships.\u201d And, if senseless, it\u2019s probably for the best that she didn\u2019t continue them in marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s better to be single with the opportunity of meeting Mr. Right, than suffocating in a marriage with Mr. Wrong.\n\nVenker makes a point, and she\u2019s right to want to inform women. But arguments like hers prompt the myths that so many of us are already tempted to tell ourselves: That if we\u2019re not young and beautiful, we\u2019re not lovable \u2013 valuable. That if we\u2019re not married right now, we must do something drastic because time is ticking. That if we\u2019re serious about dating and marriage, we must hold off on pursuing an education and career. Or, even, that if we pause our education and career, we\u2019ll absolutely find someone. If we settle, we\u2019ll be just as happy.\n\nThey suggest that pursuing marriage is the woman\u2019s burden, even if things are outside of her control \u2013 like finding a good guy who\u2019s as interested in her as much as she\u2019s interested in him.\n\nThe truth is, there is no one size fits all. That\u2019s because women are so much more than a beauty product with an expiration date. We\u2019re human persons with inherent dignity and worth \u2013 with callings and choices that only we can choose.\n\nAnd so, I dare add to Venker\u2019s words: Ladies, you are enough. You are enough, just as you are. You are loved, whether you\u2019re single, married, or a nun. Whether you find someone to marry or you don\u2019t.\n\nYou are, intrinsically, precious.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we stand still: striving to become our best is a lifelong endeavor. And, I have a hunch, good guys want women who have dreams \u2013 and chase them. Or, at the very least, we want the guy who wants us to touch the stars.\n\nAnd yet, we must also use Venker\u2019s words to our advantage. Be open. Don't reject dating to solely focus on a job or education. But also, don't reject a job or education for the sake of dating. Take chances with dating. But also, refuse to settle if your gut says \u201cno.\u201d Not only for your sake, but also for his: both man and woman should be radically loved, respected, and accepted by the other, as he and she are.\n\nAs women, we face life challenges that are foreign to many men \u2013 from fertility and maternity-leave decisions to being a working mom or a stay-at-home mom. But we shouldn\u2019t let that steal away our ability to pursue success both personally and professionally. We may not get both, but we can, at the very least, try.", "description": "Successful women face special barriers in love and marriage, according .10/10/2019 10:59:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/36/875327d5-f50f-459c-8a24-e90cc56e42fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
