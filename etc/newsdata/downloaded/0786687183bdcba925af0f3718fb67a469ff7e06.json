And it dredges up bad memories of their struggles to hold Trump administration officials to account for ignoring subpoenas over Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. In response, they want Giuliani to feel some pain, either personally or financially.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say no to a congressional subpoena,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, which is spearheading the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThat\u2019s not a thing. That is a crime. He\u2019s gonna show up, or he\u2019s going to get fined, or he\u2019s going to go to jail.\u201d\n\nBut the party\u2019s leadership is increasingly convinced that its Ukraine-focused impeachment inquiry is getting results\u2014and that going after Giuliani with threats of contempt of Congress would turn a success into a show that unnecessarily muddies the waters.\n\nAnd many in the caucus believe they already have a strong enough case to impeach Trump, and that Trumpworld\u2019s stonewalling of subpoenas will only make it stronger.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) told The Daily Beast on Tuesday night that he supports holding individuals accountable for not complying with the House\u2019s subpoenas. But he stressed that a court fight over that should not delay what he believes to be clearly justified articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe have this very clear and compelling evidence right out in front, and in the president's own words, and it's already been corroborated and confirmed by a bunch of first-person witnesses,\u201d said Huffman. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got this, and in some ways we are now gilding the lily.\u201d\n\nAs House Democrats return from a two-week recess poised to display their unity over the impeachment process\u2014only seven of them do not openly support an inquiry\u2014the divide over what to do about Giuliani is a point of divergence that reflects the differing views within the caucus over just how drawn out their impeachment inquiry can or should be.\n\nTuesday was the deadline for Giuliani to comply with a subpoena asking for a broad range of documents and correspondence focusing on his Ukraine activity. The four-page request touches nearly every corner of the Democrats\u2019 probe, from the role of the $400 million in delayed security aid to his business interests in Ukraine, and covers the entirety of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn a letter, Giuliani\u2019s attorney\u2014who was dropped by his client shortly after said letter went out\u2014said the subpoena was \u201coverbroad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Giuliani, the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget faced a Tuesday deadline to produce documents that were requested in Democrats\u2019 subpoenas. OMB said it would not be complying, but Pentagon chief Mark Esper has said he would turn over at least some documents that would help lawmakers better understand the role that the hold-up in security security aid played in Trumpworld\u2019s campaign to pressure the Ukranians. \u201cWe will do everything we can to comply,\u201d Esper told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, faced a Tuesday request\u2014not a subpoena\u2014for documents illuminating his role in the Ukraine saga. But his office announced on Tuesday that it would not comply with any of the Democrats\u2019 requests, casting their impeachment inquiry as illegitimate.\n\nThe moves echo past attempts from Trumpworld to stiff-arm subpoenas during the Mueller investigation, which prompted intense hand-wringing among House Democrats over how to respond. Ultimately, they did vote in June to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas. These were largely symbolic votes, however, and their ramifications were murky at best, leaving Democrats struggling to explain their import to the public.\n\nThat frustration is clearly animating some lawmakers\u2019 desire to reconsider ways to assert their punitive authority\u2014including the avenue of inherent contempt, which empowers the legislative branch to take would-be witnesses into custody until they comply with duly issued congressional orders.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of why the House needs to revisit inherent contempt,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) of Giuliani. \u201cWe need to enforce our own subpoenas. We can and we should.\u201d\n\nBut others on Capitol Hill look back on those struggles and see a reason to simply move past it to focus on what they believe really matters. \u201cIf the administration, and the president\u2019s private sector accomplices, are going to follow through on their promise not to comply with the investigation, including ignoring lawful subpoenas, and if the only recourse (court action) allows them to run out the clock on an active criminal scheme involving U.S. national security and elections, then the House has no choice but impeachment,\u201d said a House Democratic aide.\n\nAnother House Democratic aide put it more bluntly: \u201cThey already have the Watergate tapes,\u201d the aide said of the impeachment investigators, underscoring why the party was unlikely to pursue a punishment outside the normal legal system for those defying subpoenas.", "description": "Should Trump\u2019s personal attorney be jailed for his stonewalling of a congressional subpoena\u2014or would a court fight only delay the impeachment inquiry unnecessarily?", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571204799/191015-dems-rudy-tease_fayidu", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
