But when we make a new Filipino movie, or a special with a Malaysian comedian, they explode.\u201d\n\nA $1 billion valuation has been touted for iflix during investor meetings for a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, where Grove and Elliott made their fortunes in 2016 when their Catcha Group sold its listed iProperty Group to Rupert Murdoch's REA Group, in a deal valuing the business at a (since written down) $751 million.\n\nGrove was valued at $885 million by the 2019 Financial Review Rich List, with his share of Catcha's majority stake in iflix now comprising more than half of his wealth.\n\nIflix's initial public offering is pencilled in for late 2019, with Macquarie Capital and UBS appointed joint lead managers.\n\nMost of iflix's 2018 revenue came from business-to-business channels ($US23.8 million of the $US28.7 million total), such as mobile phone companies in south-east Asia buying bulk iflix subscriptions to bundle into plans.\n\nNot expecting every audience member to pay directly straight away, and making big investments in country-specific content, were necessary to monetise streaming in emerging markets still ruled by piracy, Grove has previously told the Financial Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritt did tell Asian media this week that iflix had about 700,000 individual monthly subscribers, and $2.4 million was made in 2018 from direct-to-consumer channels.\n\nIflix's 2018 revenue also included some advertising sales for the first time, a modest $US783,000, however, in a note to the accounts, director Elliott said advertising would eventually be a \"main driver\" of the platform.\n\nIflix has raised $420 million to date from investors including Fidelity International, as well as media companies like Indonesia's MNC, Japan's Yoshimoto Kogyo, South Korea's JTBC, Britain's Sky TV and American publisher and television station owner Hearst.\n\nThe platform has been prepared to test limits to win attention. Britt told Asian media this week that iflix's most successful original production to date was a Malaysian movie, Nur, about a religious leader falling in love with a prostitute.\n\n\"In a Muslim country, talking about prostitution and religion in the same context is really touching the edges in a market where you can\u2019t have any nudity,\" he said.\n\n\"But if you do it in a very local context, you can explore the challenging aspects in an extremely sensitive manner at par with the local community standards and expectations.\u201d\n\nBritt also reported that iflix had streamed about 1500 hours of live local sports in the previous 12 months, including the Malaysian Football League.", "description": "Patrick Grove's Asian answer to Netflix is spending up big to win eyeballs as it plans a potential listing on the ASX.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5389%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_997%2C$y_379/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5c5532382e66ca5ca52d1304aa7f0c7b4afc7849", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
