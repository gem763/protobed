Women can submit claims from 15 weeks before their due date and receive payments for up to 39 weeks from 11 weeks before their baby is due \u2014 or later if they choose to work for longer.\n\nBut a massive backlog at DWP means that applications are being delayed by around 14 weeks, and many mothers are going into labour without knowing when their payments will start.\n\nAs a freelance journalist, I will rely on Maternity Allowance to cover my basic living costs when I take a career break to have my baby.\n\nBut, like thousands of other pregnant women, I am now unlikely to receive any payments until after my child is born in January.\n\nSelf-employed fashion designer Amelia Friend, 28, has been forced to live off money borrowed from family and her partner's credit card since she stopped work at 39 weeks pregnant.\n\nThe first-time mother from London applied for Maternity Allowance when she was eight months pregnant, expecting it to be sorted within the five weeks stated on the DWP website.\n\nBut, as she went into labour last week, at two weeks overdue, she was shocked to discover she is unlikely to receive the allowance until the end of November.\n\n'I'm getting into debt waiting for the payments,' she says. 'It's a very upsetting experience at such a vulnerable time.\n\n'Women already make financial sacrifices to have a child, but I never expected to be in a position where I'd be unable to look after myself financially.\n\n'I'm lucky I have supportive people around me, but many others don't have that.'\n\nTo qualify for full Maternity Allowance, self-employed women must prove they have made at least 13 weeks' worth of National Insurance payments within 15 months of their due date\n\nThe charity Maternity Action has seen a spike in calls to its helpline from women who applied for their allowance in July and August, but have yet to receive anything.\n\nIt has written to Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey demanding action to resolve the problem.\n\nDirector Rosalind Bragg says: 'Delays in Maternity Allowance payments are leaving families in very difficult situations.\n\n'Mums and dads should be able to enjoy their new baby without worrying about being able to pay their bills or afford a supermarket shop.\n\n'We know that many families are using credit cards to buy essentials such as nappies, but families shouldn't be forced into debt by bureaucratic delays.' She adds that she 'can't understand' why the DWP did not address the staffing situation before the problems escalated.\n\nThe DWP is now working urgently to recruit people, but was unable to give any estimate as to when the problem might be resolved.\n\nAnd, with a record 1.6 million women either full or part-time self-employed, and another 760,000 in temporary roles, the numbers applying for Maternity Allowance are unlikely to decrease any time soon.\n\nFor self-employed mothers, the problems are compounded by a separate issue that is adding to the already lengthy delays.\n\nWith a record 1.6 million women either full or part-time self-employed, and another 760,000 in temporary roles, the numbers applying for Maternity Allowance are unlikely to decrease soon\n\nTo qualify for full Maternity Allowance, self-employed women must prove they have made at least 13 weeks' worth of National Insurance (NI) payments within 15 months of their due date.\n\nHowever, in 2015, changes to the system for the self-employed meant that NI is no longer paid weekly, but with tax returns in the January after the end of the financial year.\n\nThis means that self-employed women applying for Maternity Allowance always appear to be behind in their NI records, so initially the DWP assesses them as being eligible only for the \u00a327-per-week minimum.\n\nTo get the full allowance, they must ask the DWP to ask HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to issue a bill for outstanding NI \u2014 usually around \u00a340 \u2014 which they can pay, and then get their application reassessed.\n\nAny payments are then backdated to the point when the Maternity Allowance was supposed to start.\n\nThis process can take another five weeks and, in my case, means that, even after I eventually hear back on my application, I am likely to be living off just \u00a327 per week until the appeal goes through.\n\nWhile I have put aside money that I can draw on, many other expectant mothers do not have that luxury.\n\nAs Rosalind Bragg says: 'Women are reliant on receiving the financial support to which they are entitled prior to the birth, in order to be able to have a healthy pregnancy and start their maternity leave.\n\n'In our view, it is simply unacceptable that pregnant women who qualify for Maternity Allowance are experiencing such prolonged delays.'\n\nA DWP spokesperson says: 'We understand how important this financial support is for new parents and are sorry for the delays some are currently experiencing.\n\n'We are putting more staff in place to speed up the process and are fast-tracking emergency cases.'\n\nThe DWP is urging parents to apply for the allowance as soon as they are eligible, to keep delays to a minimum.\n\nFor information on the Maternity Allowance, call 0800 169 0283.\n\nmoneymail@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "I am one of thousands of working pregnant women  facing motherhood without any money coming in.
