Of those, about 70,000 work in its retail stores, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe company's proxy statement from its 2018 fiscal year reveals, \"The 2018 annual total compensation of our CEO was $15,682,219, the 2018 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $55,426, and the ratio of these amounts is 283 to 1.\" All public companies are required to reveal this ratio in SEC filings.\n\nUnder Sen. Sanders' proposal, companies whose CEO makes more than 200 times the average employee's salary would have an additional 2% tax levied on them. Apple's effective tax rate was 18.3% on taxable income of $72.9 billion. Bumping that up another 2% would have meant an additional $1.4 billion payout.", "description": "Many tech companies wouldn't be affected by Sanders' proposal because they tend to pay employees high salaries.
