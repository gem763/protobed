They say the new experiment supports the idea.\n\n\u201cWe know there is a reflex [in rabbits], but the question [is] could this be the same one that has lost the function in humans?\u201d said Dr Mihaela Pavli\u010dev a researcher at the University of Cincinnati who co-authored the study.\n\nTo explore the question the team gave 12 female rabbits a two-week course of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) \u2013 an antidepressant known to reduce the capacity for women to orgasm \u2013 and looked at the number of eggs released after the animals had sex with a male rabbit called Frank.\n\n'Golden trio' of moves boosts chances of female orgasm, say researchers Read more\n\nThe results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that rabbits given the antidepressants released 30% fewer eggs than nine rabbits that were not given Prozac but still mated with Frank.\n\nFurther experiments backed the theory that the drug was affecting ovulation through a mechanism involved in copulation and entailing the nervous system, rather than acting directly on the ovaries or other routes.\n\nThe team said the results fit their theory that rabbits needed to experience something akin to an orgasm to have a hormonal surge and ovulate, although it is not known if it gives the animals sexual pleasure.\n\nThey also said their theory was supported by a previous finding that animals that rely on sex-induced hormonal surges for ovulation tended to have a clitoris \u2013 the organ behind the female orgasm \u2013 in a position that meant it was more likely to be stimulated during sex.\n\nPavli\u010dev said it remained unclear exactly how Prozac affected the reflex in rabbits, and that further experiments with other animals was necessary.\n\nShe added that even if the theory was right, an important question was why is the organism still there \u2013 could it be that it had acquired a different function, that there was a function on female health?\n\nElisabeth Lloyd, a professor of biology at Indiana University and author of The Case of the Female Orgasm, praised the study and said it offered support for the team\u2019s theory.\n\nShe said questions remained, including whether the same muscles and nerve fibres involved in the reflex in rabbits were present in the female orgasm.\n\nShe also noted that ovulation and orgasm were linked to different hormones in humans, though it was unclear why \u2013 if female orgasm had its roots in ovulation \u2013 orgasms in men and women showed so many overlapping features.\n\nSuch features, she said, had generally been thought to support the theory that orgasm evolved to reward males for fertilisation, with the female orgasm simply a bonus arising from the way embryos of different sexes develop from a common form.\n\nLloyd and Pavli\u010dev said it might be that the theories could be reconciled, with one potentially explaining the origin of female orgasm and the other indicating why it still existed.\n\nPavli\u010dev added that understanding the role of female orgasm remained important.\u201cMaybe it can direct a little bit more friendly focus on female sexuality rather than just being in [the] service of childbearing,\u201d she said.", "description": "Study suggests climax may be an evolutionary hangover \u2013 but crucial questions remain", "authors": ["Nicola Davis", "Mi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107", "George Monbiot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce0c2df77db0c506afcfda1695359f193894b2b/0_94_5421_3252/master/5421.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b483a1d8d6ab9cc61ae043d9940a236", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
