Google DeepMind is an artificial intelligence lab within Google. It was created after Google bought University College London spinout, DeepMind, for \u00a3400 million in 2014. Its goal is to solve general intelligence and make machines capable of learning for themselves. It wants to do this by creating a set of powerful general-purpose learning algorithms that can be combined to make an AI system. Google wants its DeepMind algorithms to make many of its products and services smarter and more responsive. DeepMind has been criticised by health watchdogs in the past. Last year a British hospital trust was told it misused patient data when sharing information with DeepMind for work on the smartphone app. The Royal Free NHS Trust did not comply with the Data Protection Act when it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients, a British data protection watchdog found. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it found 'a number of shortcomings' in the way the data was handled, including that patients were not adequately informed their data would be used as part of the test. 'There's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights,' Elizabeth Denham, head of the ICO, said in a statement. The investigation found that many patients did not know their data was being used as part of a test.\n\nHe told Mailonline: 'These new deals show just how little has changed for one of the most controversial NHS data projects of the last half decade.\n\n'Despite the deal with the Royal Free being ruled unlawful, Trusts have signed new contracts to hand Google five years of patients' data from over a dozen hospitals \u2013 and won't even say how much they're being paid.\n\n'If this is the sort of deal Boris Johnson is going to encourage, it's going to be catastrophic for public trust.\n\n'Patients must know what is happening to their data, and be able to see exactly what sort of deals are being done to get it.'\n\nIt's unclear if the other trusts have signed similar contracts, but experts told this website it seems likely.\n\nIf true, the number of patient records could be well within the hundreds of thousands.\n\n\n\nDeepMind health works with NHS hospitals to train algorithms to diagnose disease.\n\nThe DeepMind Health brand and its medical app Streams is now being absorbed by Google Health, based at the firm's headquarters in Mountain View.\n\nDeepMind has also been criticised by health watchdogs in the past.\n\nLast year a British hospital trust was told it misused patient data when sharing information with DeepMind for work on the smartphone app.\n\nThe Royal Free NHS Trust did not comply with the Data Protection Act when it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients, a British data protection watchdog found.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it found 'a number of shortcomings' in the way the data was handled, including that patients were not adequately informed their data would be used as part of the test.\n\n'There's no doubt the huge potential that creative use of data could have on patient care and clinical improvements, but the price of innovation does not need to be the erosion of fundamental privacy rights,' Elizabeth Denham, head of the ICO, said in a statement.\n\nThe investigation found that many patients did not know their data was being used as part of a test.", "description": "The internet giant was handed hospital records of tens of thousands of patients\u00a0up and down England in a deal signed last month.
