There is also a state-of-the-art, fully equipped winery, according to listing agency Savills.\n\n\n\nMore: There are Two Homes Inside a Single Building in This Historic Victorian Estate Near London\n\n\u201cAncre Hill is an established premium brand in the industry, and a genuine leader in organic and biodynamic wine making,\u201d said listing agent Chris Spofforth of Savills. \u201cThe new owner can be as hands-on or hands-off as they choose.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current owner is hands-on, but there is an excellent team at Ancre Hill and a new management structure would be relatively simple to implement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a sensible hand-over program is on offer too.\u201d\n\n\n\nWine production at the estate currently can reach 100,000 bottles per year, but if a new owner expanded the land dedicated to vines from the current 29.5 acres, and utilized an additional 57 acres that have been identified as prime planting land, production has the potential to go up to 300,000 bottles per year, Savills said. The business also makes around 5,000 liters of cider per year from their apple orchard.\n\n\n\nThe main house on the property is a six-bedroom period home dating to around 1700 with more modern extensions added in the 19th century, Mr. Spofforth said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Southern California\u2019s Case Study Homes Reimagined Modern Living, and Remain Relevant Today\n\nThe current owners, Richard and Joy Morris, bought the estate in 1998 and spent six years renovating the house, according to Savills. Despite spanning more than 7,000 square feet it still feels cozy, according to Mr. Spofforth.\n\n\n\nThe property also has a swimming pool and a tennis court.\n\n\n\nThere is plenty of ancillary accommodation on the estate, too, including two cottages plus planning permission to build another, and over at Newton Court Farm, the estate\u2019s other site, is a large secondary property\u2014a four bedroom farmhouse.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Ancre Hill\u2019s 2008 sparkling wine was voted the best white sparkling wine in the world at the the Bollicine del Mondo competition in 2012, according to the brokerage.\n\n\n\nThe current owners could not be reached for comment.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-114591?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
