And we also have to ask what matters more to Dominic Raab: the grief of a bereaved British family or the approval or a corrupt American president?\"\n\nShe added: \u201cWe need an urgent parliamentary inquiry to uncover who did what in this case, who took the decisions, when they were taken, and why. The rights, justice and answers that are due to Harry Dunn\u2019s grieving family can no longer be denied.\u201d\n\nMr Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, and father, Tim Dunn, travelled to the US this week in an attempt to put pressure on authorities to return Ms Sacoolas to the UK.\n\nThe visit included talks at the White House with President Donald Trump, during which the family were told that Ms Sacoolas was in a nearby room and prepared to meet them.\n\nThey declined, saying they would rather secure justice.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We will not let up in our search for justice for Harry.\n\n\u201cWe now expect Northamptonshire Police to take over from the work we have done and the progress we have made, charge her and begin extradition proceedings to bring her back.\u201d\n\nThe family said they are due to meet police bosses next week.\n\nMr Seiger said: \u201cThe family is now concerned that there has been misconduct and a cover-up on both sides of the Atlantic, and they are intent on exposing it with the help of their lawyers. Harry\u2019s family are being incredibly brave in their darkest hour and are taking it upon themselves to do whatever it takes to ensure that this never happens to anyone ever again.\n\n\u201cIn all my years of practice, I have never seen a family so badly let down after a tragedy and abandoned completely by the system. Let\u2019s see if we can find out why, hold those responsible to account, learn the lessons, and help to ensure that this never happens again.\u201d\n\nThe family have repeatedly stressed their hope to secure Ms Sacoolas a suspended sentence, rather than immediate custody, so as not to take her away from her family.\n\nBut they said their hopes of a meeting between the two parties should happen \u201cin a room, on our terms\u201d, back in the UK.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "The government asked Northamptonshire Police to delay informing\u00a0Harry Dunn\u2019s family that the woman involved in the road accident that killed their teenage son had left the UK, the foreign secretary has admitted.\u00a0 Dominic Raab\u00a0confessed that it had asked the force to withhold the information \"for a day or two\u201d.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/05/11/Harry-Dunn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
