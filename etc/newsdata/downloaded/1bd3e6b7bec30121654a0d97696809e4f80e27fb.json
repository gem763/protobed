the secretariat of state and the Vatican's financial intelligence unit - as part of an investigation by Vatican criminal prosecutors into alleged financial irregularities surrounding a 150 million euro investment into London real estate.\n\nIt involved the development of 49 luxury apartments in Chelsea's Sloane Avenue using funds from the Vatican's Swiss accounts, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe deal, which allegedly resulted in middlemen ripping off millions of euros from the Holy See over the past decade, has itself raised questions about the Vatican's murky finances and poor investment strategies in the past decade.\n\nVatican head of security Domenico Giani (right) flanks Pope Francis' pope mobile at the end of a canonization Mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday\n\nThe investigation surrounds \u00a3130million in Vatican funds invested in the development of 49 luxury apartments at 60 Sloane Avenue in Chelsea, according to reports\n\nGiani (centre, wearing a suit) speaks to a group of cardinals during a canonization Mass over the weekend\n\nThe raids and related suspensions, launched following more recent efforts to recover some of the lost money, were highly unusual for the Vatican and sparked fresh speculation about its Machiavellian turf battles, power struggles and score-settling.\n\nThat the alleged leaker remains unknown has added to the mystery surrounding the case, which has implicated high-ranking Vatican cardinals and monsignors.", "description": "Pope Francis (pictured in St Peter's Square in the Vatican today) said the 'distorted relationship between food and nutrition' has left almost 700million people overweight, 'victims of improper dietary habits'.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/18/19782260-0-image-a-4_1571247629649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
