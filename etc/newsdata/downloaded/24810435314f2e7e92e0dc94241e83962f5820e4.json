It is 5.66, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen earned run average in the regular season. No playoff team in major league history has ever had an E.R.A. so high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gutty group of guys down there, man,\u201d Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said late Tuesday night, after four of those guys preserved a 5-4 victory in Game 1 at Minute Maid Park. \u201cThey\u2019re sick and tired of hearing about it, I know that much.\u201d\n\nOf course, regular-season numbers mean nothing in late October, when teams often change the composition and usage of their bullpens. For the Nationals, the ghastly E.R.A. is mainly a scar now, a symbol of trauma for the fans, perhaps, but of opportunity for the pitchers. Before the playoffs, they rallied around the chance to start over.\n\n\u201cWe talked as a group heading into the final homestand of the season that we wanted to change the narrative,\u201d said Sean Doolittle, who saved Game 1 by retiring all four hitters he faced. \u201cWe were well aware of how we\u2019d kind of stumbled as a group over the course of the season and what the numbers said.", "description": "\u201cIn this locker room, we believe that we can do it.\u201d", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/sports/23kepnerWEB1/23kepnerWEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
