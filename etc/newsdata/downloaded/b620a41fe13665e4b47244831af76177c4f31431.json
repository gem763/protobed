REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05% while China\u2019s Shanghai stock index slipped 0.2%, barely responding to any of the concerns around the latest Sino-U.S. tensions that caused the Nasdaq index to fall more than 1% on Friday.\n\nRisk assets took a hit in U.S. trade on Friday following news the Trump administration is considering radical new financial pressure tactics on Beijing, including the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThe report knocked Chinese shares listed on U.S. exchanges, with Alibaba Group Holding falling 5.15% and JD.com 5.95% on Friday.\n\nWorries such an escalation would hurt Japan the most however weighed on the Nikkei, which shed 0.45%. U.S. stock futures gained 0.44%, paring most of Friday\u2019s 0.53% fall in the index.\n\nTrading in Chinese markets was quiet ahead of a long break. Chinese share markets will trade only on Monday this week ahead of the country\u2019s National Day holiday, which runs until Oct. 7.\n\nThere were mixed signals from China\u2019s manufacturing surveys on Monday, which showed sustained weakness in exports and surprising improvement in domestic consumption indicators, and a Chinese central bank statement briefly hinting at plans for more stimulative policies.\n\nChina\u2019s yuan was little moved at 7.1192 yuan per dollar, while the offshore yuan rallied a bit from Friday\u2019s three-week low of 7.1520.\n\nThe delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges was part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nA U.S. Treasury official said the United States does not currently plan to stop Chinese companies from listing on U.S. exchanges, Bloomberg reported on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhile China runs a current account surplus and is a net creditor nation, Chinese companies are net debtors and rely on foreign capital,\u201d Koji Fukaya, president of Office Fukaya Consulting.\n\n\u201cWashington seems to be trying to limit Chinese companies\u2019 activities by putting pressure on their funding,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, with trade talks between the United States and China expected to be held Oct. 10-11, many market players are hoping such drastic measures on capital markets will be avoided.\n\n\u201cAt this point, markets will have to wait and see. Of course we need to be guarded against more crazy headlines, but this week could be a bit calmer given holidays in China. Economic data will likely be the main driver for markets,\u201d said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.\n\nU.S. data on Friday showed consumer spending barely rose in August and business investment remained weak, suggesting the American economy was losing momentum as the trade dispute drags on.\n\nIndustrial output in Japan and South Korea, released Monday morning, dropped more than expected, underscoring the headwinds from the trade war.\n\nInvestors are also keeping a wary eye on U.S. politics.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said public opinion is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry against Trump following the release of new information about his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nMajor currencies were little changed in early trade.\n\nThe yen traded flat at 107.94 yen.\n\nThe euro hovered around $1.0932, having sunk to a 28-month low of $1.0904 on Friday as concerns about tepid growth in Europe weighed on the common currency.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2285, not far from Friday\u2019s low of $1.2270, its lowest since Sept. 9.\n\nBoris Johnson said on Sunday he would not quit as Britain\u2019s prime minister even if he fails to secure a deal to leave the European Union, insisting only his Conservative government can deliver Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nOil prices slightly rebounded after last week\u2019s slide.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince warned in an interview with CBS program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired on Sunday that crude prices could spike to \u201cunimaginably high numbers\u201d if the world does not come together to deter Iran.\n\nBut Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he would prefer a political solution to a military one, adding the Sept. 14 attacks on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities were an act of war by Iran.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 0.05% to $6.94 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.25% to $56.05 per barrel.", "description": "Asian stock markets, including China's, were little changed on Monday, shrugging off news that the U.S. administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435376645&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T054", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
