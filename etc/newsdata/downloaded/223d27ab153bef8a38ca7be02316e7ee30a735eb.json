If there is any wiggle room to reconsider our stance on this, I\u2019d love to make a pitch to someone to do so,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe policy in question bars \u201cthe use of the university name for any purpose in any non-university endeavor not previously sanctioned by the Office of Strategic Communication.\u201d\n\nScherer argued Thunberg\u2019s visit was not political and ties into environmental research being conducted on campus.\n\n\u201cStudents are interested in this,\u201d she told The Gazette. \u201cThis is an educational opportunity, and as an educator I feel the university could have engaged more.\u201d\n\nKosovski did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.", "description": "Faculty at the University of Iowa were told not to promote a Tuesday visit by teen climate activist Greta Thunberg through university social media, according to emails obtained by a local newspaper.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thunberggreta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
