Russian agent Maria Butina sentenced to 18 months in federal prison\n\nButina had been implicated in a years-long campaign to court politically connected Americans and infiltrate groups on behalf of the Kremlin.\n\nReading from a written statement prior to her sentencing earlier this year, Butina said \"it has never been my intention to harm the American people,\" but conceded she \"did just that\" by not notifying American officials of her activities.\n\nIf she had known the law required her to register, Butina said she \"would've done so without delay.\"\n\nThe arrest of the gun-toting, red-haired Russian graduate student and activist sparked a speculative frenzy about the nature of her activities in the U.S., as special counsel Robert Mueller was pursuing a far-flung inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors said her efforts had the hallmarks of a Russian espionage operation, suggesting that she was acting as a \"spotter\" to help Russian spies identify Americans they could cultivate.\n\nButina's defense attorneys described her as a civil activist who is passionate for gun rights and politics, but whose \"amateur diplomacy efforts\" became her undoing. They said Butina deeply regrets not disclosing her foreign-agent status to U.S. officials, and had she done so, there would not have been a crime.\n\n\"Maria is not a spy ... She has never engaged in covert activity. Maria is not a proxy for the Russian government ... In truth, nothing about Maria has been secret,\" one of her attorneys, Alfred Carry, argued earlier this year.", "description": "Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina released from prison; to be deported", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/19/USAT/60824ddf-ae68-400d-b9c0-c516754099db-AP_Russia_Accused_Become_Celebrities.JPG?crop=4091,2291,x0,y108&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
