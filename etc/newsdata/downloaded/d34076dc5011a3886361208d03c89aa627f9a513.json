And I learned how to work under a huge amount of pressure.\"\n\nButtigieg added: \"The only reason I couldn't stick with it was I had trouble caring about something ... because it was my job, because I was being paid to care about something. And so even though I loved \u2014 I thought the work was fascinating. I loved my colleagues, certainly paid very well. But I remember a moment in particular when I was working on this client studying, I got up to get a cup of coffee and I thought, I don't care.\"\n\nMore pointed objections to McKinsey and its work came along later. In April, during an interview with The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick, the magazine editor pressed the candidate on the news that McKinsey advised Purdue Pharma, a pharmaceutical company accused of exacerbating the national opioid crisis, on selling OxyContin.\n\nButtigieg responded, \u201cThe firm needs to be a lot more selective and a lot more thoughtful in the work that it does.\u201d And when interviewed again by Remnick in October, Buttigieg said \u201cit\u2019s infuriating to see the choices that they\u2019ve made\u201d since he left the firm.\n\nCurrent and former employees of prestigious consulting firms rarely go into detail publicly about their clientele, oftentimes because of non-disclosure agreements. But that hasn\u2019t stopped critics from using the consulting business as a campaign cudgel.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney\u2019s time at Bain Capital was a favorite subject of attack among Democrats. And Buttigieg has been criticized in some liberal quarters for his time in the consulting world: The progressive monthly magazine In These Times ran a piece called, \u201cMcKinsey and Company Is an Elitist Cult. Why is Buttigieg Defending it?\u201d\n\n\"I think that some people maybe see any experience in consulting firm or an investment banking firm as raising a flag about whether you are going to be able to reform the excesses of capitalism and the consolidation of wealth, but I personally don't have any issues with his experience there,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, the co-chairman of Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Jack Markell, who worked at McKinsey but not with Buttigieg, said of Buttigieg's recent comments. \"It's a very good firm with a lot of smart people but it's grown really really quickly and I'm sure he learned a lot there, as did I. But, as I have, I tried to take what I learned there and use it to make me a better public servant, my guess is that's what he's done as well.\u201d\n\n\"Pete isn't the only alumnus who is unhappy with some of the recent incidents,\" a former McKinsey partner said.\n\nTom Peters, a former management consultant at McKinsey and co-author of the book \u201cIn Search of Excellence,\u201d said he was \"royally pissed off at McKinsey.\" A spokesperson for the firm said it did not have a comment when reached by POLITICO.\n\n\"I think [Buttigieg] is totally justified to feel that way \u2014 even though obviously every word he utters is political,\" Peters said of Buttigieg's most recent comments about McKinsey.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/16/19/3171dbef463dad8510735db76656/191029-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
