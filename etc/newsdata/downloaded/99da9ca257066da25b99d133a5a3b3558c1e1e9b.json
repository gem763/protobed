The destruction took place on the west side of the park in preparation for construction to begin there on a 125km chunk of Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nOrgan Pipe, which runs directly up against Mexico and sits about two hours west of Tucson, already has a variety of barriers in place. They include five miles of fence to keep pedestrians out and another 40km of posts that act as vehicle barriers. The latter are visible in the background of the videos and photos Dahl shared with Gizmodo.\n\nThe cactus you drew all the time when you were a little kid? You know, the one with three arms reaching to the sky? Yeah, that\u2019s what they\u2019re bulldozing in the desert right now so the land can instead be covered with a 9 metre tall steel beam wall.\n\nThe saguaro defines the Southern Arizona landscape. The stately cacti can grow more than three arms \u2014 the biggest of which can weigh upwards of six tons \u2014 live 150-175 years on average, according to the National Park Service.\n\nDespite their prickly appearance, they even sprout flowers that provide a bounty of nectar for desert creatures, including the endangered lesser long-nosed bat that calls Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument home. And of course, they\u2019re a cornerstone for the people who live in the desert or dream of it, too.\n\n\u201cWe love these saguaros,\u201d Dahl told Gizmodo. \u201cThe Tohomo O\u2019odham [tribe], in their taxonomy of life saguaros are very close to humans. And you know, they have a majestic presence, they are the iconic symbol of this part of the world. You know you\u2019re someplace different when you\u2019re in a saguaro forest.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the piles of dead brush is anyone\u2019s guess. The Army Corps of Engineers released a video last month saying that the agency would relocate saguaros along with organ pipe, ocotillo, and other types of cacti out of the wall construction site. The video says the agency is \u201ctaking great care to take care of the protected species.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Kevin Dahl, NPCA Photo: Kevin Dahl, NPCA Photo: Kevin Dahl, NPCA\n\nThe irony is that in a park, all species are generally protected. The U.S. Organic Act of 1916, which resulted in the creation of the American National Park Service, states that the agency exists to \u201cconserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\u201d I don\u2019t think mowing down saguaros inside a park\u2019s boundary was quite what the act\u2019s authors had in mind.\n\nThat said, there is, of course, some legal wiggle room here. The government has access to what\u2019s called a Roosevelt Reservation, an 18 metre strip of land along the border it can manage for border protection. The saguaros being knocked down are technically within that strip. But even still, under normal circumstances, the actions there would be governed by U.S. laws that include environmental protections and reviews.\n\nIn the case of the wall being built by the Trump administration, many of those reviews have been waived because Trump declared a bullshit national American emergency to fast-track construction.\n\nFor Dahl, who has been visiting Organ Pipe and the other parks of Southern Arizona for decades (to say nothing of the millions of others who enjoy the region\u2019s protected landscapes), the whole process is a slap in the face. But happening upon the real-time destruction taking place at the border was a whole new experience for him.\n\n\u201cOutrage,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s the appropriate emotion.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration has run roughshod over American environmental laws in a rush to build an unnecessary border wall.
