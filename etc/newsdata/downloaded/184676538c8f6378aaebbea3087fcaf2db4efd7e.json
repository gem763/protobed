I said okay, I\u2019ll come along.\n\n\"At times, I wasn't agreeing with the action, I thought it was not ideal.\n\n\"And I thought it wasn't the best thing to be doing but I certainly thought if it was going ahead, I should be there to film and try to portray it in the best light I can.\"\n\nHe added: \"I personally will never do another train action, I'm going to be targeting polluting industries.\n\n\"I did respect the right to protest and I thought it would be ok to film. You don't always have to agree with an action to film it.\"\n\nBut during the chaotic scenes, the campaigner said he had been reminded of environmental threats.\n\nHe said: \"I wasn't frightened of the mob in that moment, I was frightened of what if our food systems collapse.\n\n\"If our f******* food systems collapse, it\u2019s not going to be me thats being beaten, it\u2019s going to be our grandparents.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be our mum\u2019s and our dad\u2019s and our vulnerable people who are being beaten by the mob mentality.\n\n\"Ten percent of people on that platform supported us and said they supported us.\n\n\"About 70 percent were angry but they wouldn\u2019t resort to violence.\n\n\"But 20 percent went into mob mentality and beat me on the platform, they pulled another activist down and beat him.\"\n\nThe action is the latest in a series from the anti-climate change group, who have been banned from protesting in London.\n\nA legal bid to overturn the order is expected to reach the High Court on Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince last week, protesters have targeted London City Airport, shut down areas around Parliament and the Bank of England, and blockaded Google's HQ, with more than 1,600 people arrested.\n\nNow Extinction Rebellion (XR) organisers have said they will \"take stock\" over whether to continue with future disruption to the transport network.\n\nDuring the incident at Canning Town this morning, one commuter could be could heard shouting \"I need to get to work, I have to feed my kids.\"\n\nAnd Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, criticised the action.\n\nHe blasted: \"So what point is Extinction Rebellion making shutting down east London's public transport system, preventing ordinary people from getting to work, school, hospital?\"\n\nBut XR co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action and said: \"The public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is.\"\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned Thursday morning's protest, calling it \"an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers\".", "description": "Campaigner Elliot Laughlin claims he suffered cuts and bruises in the attack which happened as he filmed the protest at Canning Town Tube station today", "authors": ["Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Mahatir_Pasha Twitter", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639753.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_BLPP_CHP_PMI_16179JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
