In an April 7, 2018 tweet, Trump wrote that China was a \"great economic power\" but received \"tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S.\"\n\nMorrison has previously urged China to reform its economy and end a trade war with the United States but has until now stopped short of taking a public position on its WTO status. [nL4N23X1C3]\n\nWhile two-way trade between Australia and China has grown since the countries signed a trade pact in 2015, increasing to a record A$183 billion ($127 billion) last year, the bilateral relationship has at times been strained.\n\nIn December 2017, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs. The relationship was further soured by Canberra\u2019s decision last year to effectively ban Chinese telecoms firm Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] from its 5G broadband network rollout.\n\nMorrison said Australia and the United States had different relationships with China, given Australia had a trade surplus with China while the United States had a trade deficit.\n\n\"The engagement with China has been enormously beneficial to our country,\" he said. \"We want to see that continue.\"", "description": "Australia PM joins Trump calling for China to drop 'developing economy' status", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N016_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
