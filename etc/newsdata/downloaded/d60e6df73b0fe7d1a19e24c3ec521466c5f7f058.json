The MPs called for \u201can end to voluntary self-regulation\u201d of aid agencies, which they said \u201callows failures on sexual exploitation and abuse to slip through the cracks\u201d.\n\nPauline Latham, a Conservative member of the IDC, said: \u201cSome of the most vulnerable people in the world are being abused and they are being abused by people they should be able to trust. We need to support these people. This is a huge issue within the industry. We need to move faster and they are just dragging their feet.\u201d\n\nThe criticisms came as Alok Sharma, the fourth international development secretary in two years, issued a statement outlining steps made by DfID since February 2018 to put survivors first and drive culture change across the aid sector.\n\n\u201cThe international work led by DfID over the last year has generated good momentum and is starting to deliver results,\u201d Sharma said in a statement. However, the accompanying progress report acknowledged that providing support to victims and survivors remains a \u201ccrucial challenge\u201d, and recognised that more needs to be done.\n\nSharma highlighted the introduction of a sexual misconduct disclosure scheme for employers, which had prevented the hiring of at least 10 individuals. He also called attention to the creation of a \u00a310m register, using Interpol and national policing databases, designed to strengthen criminal record checks and stop perpetrators moving around the sector, announced at a DfID safeguarding summit in October 2018.\n\nThe MPs urged DfID to champion an independent aid ombudsman, proposed by the Dutch government, to allow an alternative form of access to justice for survivors, and to monitor the safeguarding of the sector as a whole.\n\n\u201cI want Britain to lead the world on this,\u201d said Latham.\n\nStephen Twigg, the committee\u2019s chairman, said MPs had previously urged the aid community to work quickly to develop robust protections focused on \u201cvictims and survivors\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the year since, this work has sadly not progressed to the point it needs to be,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe success of reforms can only be judged by how they support victims and survivors in humanitarian situations across the globe. It is clear that in this respect much more work needs to be done. There should be sufficient resourcing in place to provide access to safeguarding staff on the ground, and improvement in how whistle-blowers are supported and protected.\u201d\n\nOxfam failed to report child abuse claims in Haiti, inquiry finds Read more\n\nIn June, it emerged that Oxfam is investigating the suspected involvement of its humanitarian workers in a new sex-for aid scandal. The charity was issued with an official warning from the Charity Commission after it found Oxfam had failed to disclose allegations of child abuse in Haiti.\n\nCommenting on the IDC report, Asmita Naik, co-author of research published in 2002 that exposed sexual abuse by aid workers in west Africa, said: \u201cUntil these organisations are prepared to speak up and be honest, how on earth do they expect victims on the ground to do so? At the moment, they are still too defensive, too secretive.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhere\u2019s the sense of urgency? Where are the changes on the ground? It still seems stuck at that top level policy. That is where it has been for years.\u201d\n\nA DfID spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to take robust action and are making sure UK aid doesn\u2019t go to organisations who fall short of our expected standards.\u201d\n\nStephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, said: \u201cWe value the IDC\u2019s commitment to working with all sectors and DfID to improve safeguarding practices. However, it is a shame that months of hard work from the NGO sector to up its game across a wide range of aspects of safeguarding seems to have been overlooked in the committee\u2019s report.\u201d", "description": "MPs point to lack of progress on promised safeguarding improvements for whistleblowers and survivors", "authors": ["Karen Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc954b63b613e56709b5e7c6a2f947d5f4f628b0/0_0_1593_956/master/1593.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a502e86e8a5dfc8933bb428cb0428b67", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
