They didn\u2019t even have to play at the weekend. They have not been above criticism in their three bonus-point wins out of three, but the calibre of opposition has improved with each match and would have done so again, but for Typhoon Hagibis. England have got better, too. But none of it feels quite real. Neither can the weirdness of a cancelled World Cup fixture and evacuation back to sunny Kyushu to try to simulate the match they never got to play. Mature heads will be needed to negotiate the leap thence to a quarter-final against Australia. The Wallabies haven\u2019t exactly impressed, but England know only too well they can play a bit when the situation demands. Michael Cheika has been firing shots on their behalf at all targets throughout the tournament. He\u2019ll create a siege mentality, even if there isn\u2019t one to be had.\n\nKey players \u2026 England: Owen Farrell. At the heart of England\u2019s weird wobbles of late and of Saracens\u2019 complete lack of them. He sets the tone.\n\nAustralia: David Pocock. Player of the last World Cup, even if they didn\u2019t win it. Signs are he could be peaking for his last tilt at glory.\n\nPrediction: Australia. Match-hardened and underrated. It would be typical.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nNew Zealand v Ireland (Saturday 11.15am, Tokyo)\n\nForm: The All Blacks looked pretty good in their last meaningful Test ... more than three weeks ago. Meanwhile, the Irish have plodded through their assignments, looking one-paced but building momentum, working those phases as only they can. After flirting with the spotlight of No 1 in the world, they are back under the radar. New Zealand wear that mantle again \u2013 and it looks a better fit on them \u2013 but this is not the vintage that won the past two World Cups. They are as brilliant, certainly, but if the brilliance isn\u2019t happening they look vulnerable. Big question is whether they can switch the brilliance on at will. For all their travails, Ireland are not unacquainted with the taste of victory against the All Blacks. We know what they will bring. We know that New Zealand do not particularly like it.\n\nKey players, New Zealand: Beauden Barrett. Often feted as the best player in the world, because when on form he is untouchable. It\u2019s when he\u2019s not that the problems start.\n\nIreland: Conor Murray. The difference between Ireland with Murray and Sexton and Ireland without is huge. Murray\u2019s authority is central to that.\n\nPrediction: Ireland. See above for Australia.\n\nWales v France (Sunday 8.15am, Oita)\n\nForm: Wales keep on winning, which is all anyone should care about. They were flattered against Fiji and battered against Australia, but they have come through with the gravitas of pool winners (for the first time since they were hosts in 1999). The early scandal surrounding Rob Howley seems a long time ago. And who should be up next? France. Wales know they can beat them, all right. Almost the exact opposite of the earthy Welsh, France are either the same rabble as ever or a melting pot from which will emerge a new team fit to host the next World Cup. Anyone\u2019s guess. They can be unplayable (as Wales know only too well from the first half of this year\u2019s Six Nations opener) and they can hand you the game on a plate (as Wales know from the second).\n\nKey players, Wales: Alun Wyn Jones. He tackles and he tackles and he tackles. He is Wales, in a nutshell.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alun Wyn Jones will be key for Wales against France. Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nFrance: Antoine Dupont. If the brilliant France do make a showing, this guy will be at the heart of it. Or Machenaud will. Or Serin. They have options.\n\nPrediction: Wales. France will play all the rugby, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter to Wales.\n\nJapan v South Africa (Sunday 11.15am, Tokyo)\n\nJapan show world their defiance and skill in face of typhoon destruction | Andy Bull Read more\n\nForm: The best is saved till last. Japan, undisputed stars of this World Cup already, on and off the field, face the foes against whom they have defined themselves. This is a rematch of the most famous upset in history. Japan will not be 42-point underdogs this time. But they will be underdogs (early markets have them as 15). Something about the sheer heft of South Africa makes any thoughts of further Japanese glory feel unlikely. The template for Japanese victory is the same as ever and will incline every neutral on earth to back them, favouring as it does the fast and the skilful. The Springboks can play a bit too, but their trump card is power and strength of mind. For them, the World Cup will feel as if it starts here; for Japan, the drama has already been transformational.\n\nKey players, Japan: Kazuki Himeno. If South Africa deal in power, this is Japan\u2019s answer. The No 8 has been destructive with ball in hand.\n\nSouth Africa: Cheslin Kolbe. If Japan deal in pace, this is South Africa\u2019s answer. Scarcely believable speed.\n\nPrediction: South Africa. The rugby world will hope this is wrong but there are no killjoys like the Springboks.", "description": "Ireland and Australia can upset the odds but Japan have probably gone as far as they can, with a daunting match against South Africa", "authors": ["Michael Aylwin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1863eefaa8157b27e91533159b909b71138a69e/36_37_2490_1494/master/2490.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bab96164f0254c0c8bb397eb683a7fb6", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
