We lost our child care.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of the planned blackout \u2014 the first time the gamemakers dramatically ended one season before starting another in what is likely a huge and risky publicity stunt \u2014 parents began creating a whole new genre of YouTube videos, showing their kids crying, tantruming and ululating before the blank TV screen.\n\nAD\n\nThe pain is real. And hilarious. And frightening. (I\u2019ll let you find most of them on your own. Most are too profane to link to.)\n\nThe adult gamers who abandoned kid-heavy Fortnite were also raging because their own refuges, games less appealing to kids like Apex and Blackout, started becoming virtual kindertowns as the forlorn Fortnite orphans migrated.\n\n\u201cFinian switched to Minecraft. And Madden,\u201d my son reported, about the friend with whom he had planned a Fortnite team. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be disloyal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMy kid had a busy weekend \u2014 hockey, band practice, outdoor projects, washing the dogs and a high-tide, autumn river swim. He saved up all his video gaming time for what was supposed to be an epic bonus day of playing with his squad on Columbus Day.\n\nAD\n\nBut Sunday night, the squad started texting him the devastating news about the black hole.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to start back up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re lost. Some of my friends are just sitting there, watching the hole.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, Erasmo Hernandez Jr. posted a video of a kid trying to play with a foam airplane, explaining: This is \u201c8 year olds having to actually do something outside cause fortnite is dead #ripfornite.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular game is a difficult question for today\u2019s parents. It\u2019s not the old school gaming of solitude and total awkwardness.\n\nAD\n\nThis game is played in groups and it\u2019s supersocial. My son never plays alone. He mics up and squads up with his friends from school or hockey, and they work to conquer the island together. This is how they socialize and relate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you guys used to just talk on the phone for hours, without doing anything. That was so sad,\u201d my older son observed when I told him about the long phone cord that stretched down the hall and into my room, where I shut myself in and gossiped after school, trying to understand how my kids socialize today.\n\nThe struggle to find a healthy balance is a pain. Ban gaming, and they miss out on a contemporary experience and socializing with their friends. Indulge too much and they become zombies.\n\nIt\u2019s why some folks theorized that the whole black hole was funded by a bunch of desperate parents who simply wanted their kids back for a few days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI checked up on my son, who was still sitting in the sunshine. He was bored. It felt new. And weird. And good.\n\n\u201cI texted Justin and Jason to see if they could come over and we can play football outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI miss that.\u201d\n\nMe too.\n\nCan we make a deal, Fortnite? Y\u2019all do this black hole thing every few weeks, and we\u2019ll let them keep playing \u2014 a little bit \u2014 when you come back.\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nAD", "description": "Parents were almost as flummoxed as their kids", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/js4AiQQadY1faecizPTOaTBaugY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KEWOGVHOXMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
