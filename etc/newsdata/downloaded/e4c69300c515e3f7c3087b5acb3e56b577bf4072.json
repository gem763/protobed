This is, I believe, the eighth year running. Getting on for a decade since a high neckline became an October-to-March wardrobe staple. But I\u2019m not complaining. Far from it, in fact. The polo neck is a win-win, being both practical and a bit chic.\n\nThe one I\u2019m wearing here isn\u2019t the basic kind, as you might have noticed. This fancy high neck is what I call a mad-on. Like an add-on, but \u2013 you guessed it. To make an impact, you don\u2019t have to get dressed up from head to toe like a Christmas tree. You can just add one or two elements that are a bit extra. You could wear simple trousers and sweater, but add a velvet headband and big sparkly earrings. Or, as I\u2019m wearing here, you could switch up your go-to navy crew neck over cream polo neck combination, so that you\u2019ve got sequins at the neck and cuff.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, this sequin polo neck is not as comfortable as the simple fine-wool kind I wear most days. (Count yourself lucky this trend began in 2011 and not a year later, as I would not have been able to resist a Seven Year Itch joke.) But hey, I love it.\n\nI bought it five years ago, because I fell for the silver sequin polo necks on the catwalk at a Christian Dior show, back in the Raf Simons years. (This one is very much not Dior. I\u2019m not sure where I got it, because the label pushed the scratchiness levels beyond bearability, so I snipped it out.) If I wear it as a top in its own right, I look like a mermaid moonlighting as a ski instructor, which is every bit as bonkers as it sounds. So, funnily enough, I don\u2019t. I wear it under a fine jumper, like this old-season J Crew one \u2013 which, with its feathery cuffs, is a mad-on in its own right. Or I wear it under a pinafore dress, or under a loose black maxi dress with thin straps.\n\nHow to wear: bourgeois chic | Jess Cartner-Morley Read more\n\nA fancy high neck is a useful way to dress up an outfit without stripping off. Dressing up usually means taking clothes off \u2013 strappy or strapless dresses, sheer fabrics, short hemlines \u2013 which isn\u2019t always helpful, since what we call party season is also known as winter. So, if after all these years of wearing polo necks you\u2019re worried that they\u2019re boring \u2013 remember, they don\u2019t have to be.\n\n\u2022 Jess wears her own sequin polo neck and jumper; skirt, \u00a3110, boden.co.uk; heels, \u00a3300, jcrew.com.
