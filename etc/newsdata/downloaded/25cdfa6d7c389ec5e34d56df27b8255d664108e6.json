I will contact the family when I arrive in England, Dad,\" he wrote to his father on Facebook messenger.\n\nThat was six days ago, and his father has heard nothing since.\n\n\"For sure he was in that lorry. I just want my son's (body) back home,\" Le Minh Tuan told AFP from the family home in Yen Hoi village.\n\nCrippled by grief, Tuan clutches Ha's son and weeps, the confused child's eyes wet with tears too.\n\nHa's wife, who stayed behind in Yen Hoi, now fears she is a widow and her children are fatherless.\n\nHa took off in June, flying to Ho Chi Minh City then Malaysia en route to Turkey. From there he went to Greece then France, where he may have snuck onto the truck to Britain.\n\nBuried by debt back home -- he paid smugglers $30,000 to get him to Europe, and another $8,500 loan to build the family house -- Ha hoped to land a decent salary in the UK.\n\n\"He wanted to go to pay the debts... and send money back to his kids so they would have a better life,\" said his father, clinging to his grandson and weeping.\n\n- 'Bright smile' -\n\nIllegal migration abroad was not Ha's first choice. He trained as a police officer for three years before flunking the final exam, then worked as a rice farmer and an interior designer.\n\nBut nothing seemed to stick, propelling his dangerous journey to Britain.\n\nNghe An is one of a handful of rural provinces in central Vietnam that most of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nThey are mostly young, eager to escape mundane village life for promises of wealth working overseas.\n\nThat might have been what drove Bui Thi Nhung to Europe, where she frequently published photos from on her active Facebook feed.\n\nBut two days before the truck tragedy, her feed went silent, and now her family fears the worst.\n\n\"Step outside with a bright smile,\" she wrote in one of her final posts with a selfie of the fair-skinned 19-year-old.\n\nAn avid Facebooker, in recent weeks she posted photos of herself posing in France, along with praise for her mother's home cooking and pictures of bubble tea and a bowl of Vietnamese noodle soup, pho, in Germany.\n\nNow her portrait sits atop a makeshift altar adorned with fruit offering and flowers that her family set up, praying they might one day see her again.\n\nElsewhere in the area, families recount shreds of other lives they fear might have been cut short.\n\nNguyen Dinh Tu's relatives talk about his time as an army recruit before he moved abroad a year ago. He was with a cousin who at the last minute did not get on the truck, which may have saved his life, Tu's family said.\n\nIn neighbouring Ha Tinh province, Nguyen Dinh Luong's sibling has been looking for the 20-year-old in an agonising appeal for information.\n\n\"His characteristics: 1.62 meters, weight about 58 kg. He has a tattoo on his left bicep,\" the relative wrote in a Facebook post above a photo of Luong in a down vest and baseball cap.\n\nThe post was published on a Facebook page advertising nail salon jobs in Britain, a common line of work for illegal migrants.", "description": "Le Van Ha tried his hand as a police officer, a rice farmer and then an interior designer before paying smugglers for passage from Vietnam to Europe, a move that may have cost him his life -- and his young sons their father.
