Relax and enjoy the company of those around you. What do you value in your life? In the end, that's what matters' she says in the powerful obituary to those who knew and loved her.\n\nKuzma passed on September 22 at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nLaryngeal cancer, which forms malignant cells in the larynx, kills 3,700 people per year, according to the clinic.\n\n'When you have recurrent laryngeal cancer that just won't take no for an answer, you have a lot of time to think about death,' wrote the teacher who saw the cancer return four times during her fight for life.\n\nDespite knowing she most likely would die from the cancer, she embraced the end with dignity and even humor.\n\n'The good thing is I no longer have to worry about saving for retirement, paying off student loans, or trying not to get skin cancer???' she wrote.\n\n'One positive outcome from having recurrent cancer was that it taught me to let go of the insignificant things and to just enjoy the people and places,' she explained.\n\nKuzma had to have a total laryngectomy at the Cleveland Clinic, along with 30 radiation and five chemotherapy treatments, and sacrificed her vocal cords. She continued teaching, speaking by pressing a prosthesis that covered the permanent opening in her neck\n\nBorn on May 21, 1987 in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Kuzma grew up in Conway and attended Freedom Area High School. She graduated in the class of 2005 and earned a Bachelor's in History and Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh four years later.\n\nShe also completed her teaching certificate and Master of Education degree at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter graduating high school, and teaching a few years in Lancaster, she relocated to Erie, where her family had also moved, 'to plant my roots and became a gifted support teacher at McDowell Intermediate High School'.\n\nIt was during her time at the school that her battle with laryngeal cancer gained local and worldwide attention, according to GoErie.com in a story about her passing. Kuzma had won a cruise for teachers who demonstrate a passion for learning.\n\nHer symptoms first appeared just before arriving at the high school in February 2017, GoErie.com reports.\n\nShe had started complaining of a chronic sore throat, and her voice became progressively hoarse. An ear, nose and throat specialist in Erie discovered growths on Kuzma's vocal cords, which would prove to be malignant after a biopsy.\n\nThe tumors went away after 29 radiation treatments at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside, but returned a year later.\n\nShe then had a partial laryngectomy in March 2018, and was able to return to work for the final day of school in June while while still using a feeding tube.\n\nThen the cancer returned once more in August of that year, and showed that it was mucoepidermoid carcinoma, a cancer of the salivary glands.\n\nThat's when she decided to have a total laryngectomy at the Cleveland Clinic, along with 30 radiation and five chemotherapy treatments, and sacrificed her vocal cords.\n\n'After I found out my cancer was back for the fourth time, I went to Mexico and saw Chichen Itza,' she wrote in her obituary, referring to the ancient pyramid site in the state of Yucatan (pictured above)\n\nShe continued teaching, speaking by pressing a prosthesis that covered the permanent opening in her neck from her surgery. But by March the cancer came back once again, for the final time.\n\n'After I found out my cancer was back for the fourth time, I went to Mexico and saw Chichen Itza,' she wrote in her obituary, referring to the ancient pyramid site in the state of Yucatan.\n\nShe spent her time in life, according to her obit, 'reading, cuddling with my cats, wine tasting, relaxing on my dad's boat, watching movies, golfing, decorating my house, watching football (go Steelers!), appreciating a good sunset, and watching TV shows like 'Grey's Anatomy,' the original 'Will and Grace,' and 'Friends.'\n\nHer obit recalls that she spent a semester abroad in London and was 'able to travel to Paris, France, Krakow, Poland (it had been a goal of mine to visit Auschwitz for many years), Milan, Venice, Florence, and Rome, Italy.\n\n'Some of my favorite family vacations include experiencing the awe of the Grand Canyon and enjoying the sun, sand, and family time in the Outer Banks,' Kuzma wrote.\n\n'I am extremely grateful for the life that I lived. I was fortunate to have a loving family, supportive friends, a stable and meaningful job, and a house to call my own.\n\nShe was survived by her 'wonderful parents, John William Kuzma and Vicky Lynn (Barron) Kuzma of Fairview, Pennsylvania,' she wrote in the obituary.\n\nShe is also survived by her sister, Kristen Marie Kuzma of Clinton, Pennsylvania.", "description": "Ashley Ann Kuzma, 32, of Erie Pennsylvania, who died from laryngeal cancer last month, penned her own obituary to help ease the pain of her loss for her loved ones and to express her gratitude for her life.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
