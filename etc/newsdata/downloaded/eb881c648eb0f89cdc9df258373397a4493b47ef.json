(Aubert has since moved on to French real estate developer Nexity.)\n\nThe pair proposed embedding experts inside Facebook's machinery to figure out its workings and carry out continuous oversight, an idea inspired by similar moves in the financial sector.\n\nToward the end of 2018, more than seven Macron ministers had officially committed to fighting hate online.\n\nMacron himself, meanwhile, worked on winning Zuckerberg's support.\n\nHis outreach culminated in a May, 2018, meeting on the veranda of Macron's presidential residence in Paris which was noted not just because Zuckerberg, who usually wears T-shirts, wore a suit, but also because he had chosen to visit France over the U.K. or Germany while in Europe.\n\nThe embedding mission got started a few months later, in January.\n\nKnown in France as the \"Loutrel Mission\" after its author, Beno\u00eet Loutrel, a former Google executive and co-director of the ARCEP telecom regulator, the team was made up of seven rapporteurs who spent weeks visiting Facebook's content moderation centers in Paris, Dublin, Berlin and Barcelona.\n\nThey were meant to work for six months. But instead, after just two months of observation, Loutrel's team was asked to hand in its work.\n\nAccording to people directly involved in the mission and the debates that followed it, a packed legislative schedule in parliament was part of the reason for the delay.\n\nBut they also underscored jockeying between various Macron ministers and MPs who were all determined to claim ownership for the content regulation bill.\n\nOn one side, there was Loutrel and his supporters, namely O and Aubert, who backed the Loutrel Mission and favored a soft-touch approach.\n\nOn the other was Laetitia Avia, an MP in Macron\u2019s centrist La R\u00e9publique en Marche party, Digital Minister Mounir Mahjoubi and Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, the secretary of state for women\u2019s equality \u2014 all of whom had personally been subject to online harassment and favor a harder approach.\n\nToward the end of 2018, more than seven Macron ministers had officially committed to fighting hate online.\n\nWhile the two camps argued over the approach, one event was seen as instrumental in favoring a harder line \u2014 an annual dinner hosted by France's Jewish umbrella organization, the CRIF, at which Macron was asked what he would do about the rise of anti-Semitic speech online.\n\nTech industry players and digital rights activists are already up in arms, warning about unpredictable side effects.\n\nAvia took to the stage, and used the occasion to state that tech companies would have to respect French laws and could be tried in court if necessary.\n\nThere was no more room for Loutrel\u2019s softer approach to regulation.\n\nAsked about the pile-on, Avia denied ignoring the conclusions of the Loutrel report. \u201cI really enjoyed working with him and his team,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTheir work isn\u2019t useless at all: it helped us understand a broader framework for digital regulation, but our law is more about very specific national sovereignty issues,\u201d she added.\n\nOthers disagreed, arguing that Avia sidelined the Loutrel report to press ahead with plans for a law that threatens platforms with \u20ac1.25 million fines if they fail to delete \u201cobviously illegal content\u201d within 24 hours.\n\nWhile Avia\u2019s law still needs to be approved by the Senate, tech industry players and digital rights activists are already up in arms, warning about unpredictable side effects.\n\n\u201cIt is an absurd law that doesn\u2019t take into account the complexity of digital content moderation and now represents a threat to freedom of speech,\" added de la Raudi\u00e8re.\n\n'Part of the solution'\n\nFor Macron, the episode underscored a paradox \u2014 wanting to foster tech investment at home while also positioning himself as Big Tech's biggest antagonist on the international stage.\n\nAt the end of the last G7 summit in Biarritz, Macron summed up his ideal approach as follows: \u201cThe role of France is to be a mediating power ... and try to build useful solutions on a universal level\u201d \u2014 a strategy that also applies to his work on Big Tech, according to French ambassador for digital affairs, Henri Verdier.\n\n\u201cWe must negotiate,\" he said. \"There are lots of discussions on cybersecurity, terrorist content, taxation and disinformation ... It may seem uncoordinated, but the orientation is clear and the president's ambition remains the same since the Paris Call [on norms in cyberspace]: we have to make them be a part of the solution.\u201d\n\nSeen from outside, however, the result can look like a mixed message \u2014 a president who swings between being Big Tech\u2019s best friend in Europe and its number one antagonist.\n\nLooking back at the failed effort on \u201csmart regulation,\u201d French policy experts from the tech industry are grumbling.\n\n\u201cHis [Macron's] advisers practically force us to give the money to some national initiatives or sign an international charter before any meeting with the president, or they simply ignore us,\u201d said a member of the industry directly involved in negotiations.\n\nBut aides to the president insist that Macron remains fully committed to cooperating with the Big Tech.\n\n\u201cSmart regulation is still a priority to us and we are very inspired by the way things work with the GDPR,\u201d said a digital affairs adviser to Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe who asked not to be named.\n\nThe secretary of state for digital affairs added that regulating content was a key area where France would work with Ursula von der Leyen's incoming European Commission.\n\n\u201cWe must be pragmatic in moving forward efficiently on this matter,\u201d added O, who started a European tour to meet with his peers and to convince them to be a part of discussions.\n\nIn the meantime, the president is set to advance more cautiously.", "description": "An ill-fated scheme to embed regulators inside of Facebook underscores the French president\u2019s challenge in trying to be Europe\u2019s most tech-savvy leader.", "authors": ["Elisa Br\u00e4un", "Rym Momtaz", "David M.
