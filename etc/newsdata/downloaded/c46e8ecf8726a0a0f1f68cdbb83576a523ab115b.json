There needs to be more tolerance, there needs to be more understanding.\"\n\nHe said to address this, the government should promote the values of the Constitution.\n\n\"As South Africans, we should be embracing each other, and indeed, we should also embrace foreign nationals.\"\n\nRamaphosa said everyone, South African or not, should obey the country's laws.\n\n\"South Africans must be able to live in peace with themselves, but also side by side with those from other countries.\"\n\nRamaphosa stood by his earlier assertion that South Africans were not xenophobic and that the spate of violence was fuelled by \"criminality\" rather than xenophobia.", "description": "South Africans should embrace one another as well as foreign nationals, President Cyril Ramaphosa has told the National Council of Provinces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7895/7d020c79b095463f8c10eae44258400f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
