At the time of writing, 57% have voted for Piers to be removed.\n\nYouTube star Elijah, who previously bought a Michigan town and renamed it \u2018Gay Hell\u2019 to protest against the Trump administration, has been urging his followers to take action against him.\n\nThe YouTube star is urging his viewers to take action (Picture: Twitter)\n\nQuoting the poll on Twitter, he wrote: \u2018LMAOOOOO THEY RLY PUT HIS JOB UP TO A TWITTER POLL HELPPPPP YALL KNOW WHAT TO DO HIT THAT FIRE HIS A** BUTTON.\u2019\n\nHe went on to add: \u2018Good luck on the poll deciding ur job @piersmorgan,\u2019 before saying: \u2018piers morgan on live tv finding out that we took over the poll to fire him is\u2026..truly beautiful.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The sadness in ur eyes fuels me @piersmorgan,\u2019 he then declared.\n\nPiers has addressed the poll on the ITV show, saying: \u2018When I left the building yesterday, the poll was 80% solidly I should stay. We had about 60-70,000 votes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s now been hijacked by these snowflake websites and Twitter handles, so all last night they were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of him, get rid of him!\u201d, they actually think they can get rid of me.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe continued: \u2018We\u2019ve now had over 300,000 votes, one of the biggest in the history of the show, and it\u2019s now moved 59% against me, now viewers, you\u2019re not the snowflake brigade, you are my people.\n\n\u2018You are my army, I need you to get busy this morning. We cannot let the snowflakes win.\u2019\n\nThe poll appears to have backfired (Picture: Twitter)\n\nFollowing the original petition, Piers also hit back at claims, insisting he\u2019s not transphobic.\n\n\u2018It is an extremely difficult, emotional, psychological process. I\u2019ve taken the position that if we suddenly start saying there is a hundred genders it does the people who have transitioned a grave disservice,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It makes them look pointless, like why are they bothering, and I have been consistent on that position,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018I think most people including most trans people think a hundred genders, or the concept of a hundred genders, is ridiculous.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
