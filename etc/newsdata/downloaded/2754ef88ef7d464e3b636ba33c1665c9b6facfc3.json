Here at the Illinois Institute of Technology, the third annual summit kicked off with a modern-dance performance highlighting black and immigrant experiences. It included the trailer for Ava DuVernay\u2019s 2019 Netflix series, When They See Us, about the Central Park Five, a group of young men of color who were wrongly convicted and imprisoned on charges that they had raped a white female jogger in the park in 1989. At the time, Trump ramped up racial tensions around that case, taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the men to be executed.\n\nRead: Where is Barack Obama?\n\nThe two men had never spoken before Obama called to congratulate Trump on Election Night 2016. They met a few times during the transition, and except for a brief handshake at George H. W. Bush\u2019s funeral last year, they haven\u2019t spoken since Inauguration Day 2017. For almost three years, virtually everything Obama has said and done has been seen through the prism of attacking Trump.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s unmistakable, as on Friday, when Obama spoke at the funeral for Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about being honorable,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou\u2019re not a sucker to have integrity and treat others with respect.\u201d\n\nThat statement was clearly about Trump\u2014but Obama\u2019s remarks are not always about Trump, at least not definitively. \u201cMake sure you have a team with a diversity of opinion sitting around you,\u201d Obama said at a paid appearance in San Francisco last month. Also: \u201cThe other thing that\u2019s helpful is not watching TV or reading social media. Those are two things I would advise, if you\u2019re our president, not to do. It creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment.\u201d Are statements like that Trump-focused, or merely the same generic advice Obama would offer to whoever took his place?\n\n\u201cWe are not naive to today\u2019s political environment,\u201d Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama who was traveling with him yesterday, told me. \u201cThat said, the themes President Obama raises are points he\u2019s been making his entire public life\u2014and will continue to raise for many years to come.\u201d\n\nObama warned yesterday against running for office just to run: \u201cThen, when you get there, you have no idea what to do, you have no moral compass, you have no issue or cause that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice everything for or lose your seat for. All that\u2019s important to you is to stay that thing you wanted to be.\u201d\n\nIn that instance, was he talking about what he himself stood for, or hinting about what Trump doesn\u2019t? Perhaps both.\n\nRead: Barack Obama still doesn\u2019t understand Donald Trump\n\nObama also appeared to possibly issue a warning to his own party when he said, \u201cThis idea of purity, and you\u2019re never compromised, and you\u2019re politically woke, and all that stuff\u2014you should get over that pretty quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws,\u201d and he made fun of people thinking they\u2019d done something by retweeting a tweet. \u201cThat\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d", "description": "Nearly everything the 44th president has said since leaving office has been interpreted as a condemnation of his successor.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Obama/facebook.jpg?1572445328", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
