He does not run it at all.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nBut LNG Western still lists on its company website that Goldman is part of its \u201cleadership\u201d team and his LinkedIn profile lists that he still works for the company.\n\nBiden then reiterated his pledge not to take contributions from fossil fuel companies, a vow that nearly every candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic White House contenders has also taken.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, folks. I have never taken money from the industry,\u201d Biden told the crowd.\n\nBiden highlighted his decades of work in trying to combat climate change, emphasizing \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of my record.\u201d And he touted his climate change plan that he unveiled this summer, saying \u201cit\u2019s gotten rave reviews from the vast majority of all of the major environment groups.\u201d\n\nThen, moving in close and holding Beaulieu\u2019s hand, he said \u201cKiddo. I want you to just take a look. You don\u2019t have to agree. But I want you to look in my eyes. I guarantee you. I guarantee you we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel \u2026 before 2050, God willing.\u201d\n\nBeaulieu later told reporters she appreciated that Biden seriously answered her question - but that she thinks his plan to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050 wasn\u2019t adequate.\n\nShe also said she found Biden's use of \"kiddo\" patronizing.\n\nBlunt advice\n\nHours earlier, Biden received some blunt advise from one of his top supporters in New Hampshire. Longtime state Sen. Lou D\u2019Allesandro, known as the \u2018Lion of the state Senate,\u2019 met one-on-one with the former vice president ahead of Biden\u2019s town hall Friday afternoon in Laconia, N.H.\n\nD\u2019Allesandro - who has known Biden for years and last month endorsed the former vice president\u2019s White House bid -- said that he urged Biden to be more concise on the campaign trail.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI said that he\u2019s got to leave them wanting more and be specific and right on point. He\u2019s got a great message but he\u2019s got to condense it and get it out there,\u201d D\u2019Allesandro told Fox News and the Concord Monitor.\n\nAsked if Biden agreed with his critique, D\u2019Allesandro noted, \u201cI think he concurred. He understood what I was saying, clearly.\u201d\n\nThe state senator stuck around for the town hall \u2013 where Biden spoke and answered questions from the audience for just over an hour.\n\nAsked if Biden was concise during the event, D\u2019Allesandro said, \u201cI think there were moments he was concise and the people appreciated that. But there were other times when he was way too long.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden on Friday forcefully defended his appearance the previous evening at a top-dollar campaign fundraising event in New York City that was held at the home of a supporter who helped found a natural gas company.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19249653028537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
