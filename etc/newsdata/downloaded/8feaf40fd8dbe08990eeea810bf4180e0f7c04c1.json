But in an interview with The Washington Post last week, he complained about the \"tone, the message, the public face and approach\" of the nation's immigration policy.\n\nThe departure continues a purge of leadership at the Department of Homeland Security at Trump's behest and raises more uncertainty over management at the massive agency created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nSince April, former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph \"Tex\" Alles and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ronald Vitiello have resigned.\n\nIn June, Trump also accepted the resignation of acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders.\n\nTrump elevated McAleenan to serve as acting replacement for Nielsen just days after he said he wanted the administration to go in a \"tougher direction\" as illegal border crossings had increased.\n\nMcAleenan previously served as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection after having served as acting commissioner since the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nHe was well-liked among Republican and Democratic administrations. In a letter to Congress obtained by ABC News expressing \"enthusiastic support\" for McAleenan's nomination to lead U.S. Customs and Border Protection, officials from both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations called McAleenan \"supremely qualified.\"\n\nBut he quickly drew scrutiny from hard-liners close to Trump for his ties to the Obama administration, where he was deputy commissioner of the agency.", "description": "McAleenan \"wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector,\" President Trump tweeted.
