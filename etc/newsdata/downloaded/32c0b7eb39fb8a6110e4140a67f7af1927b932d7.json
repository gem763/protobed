Biden on Thursday said he\u2019s committed to not raising money from fossil fuel executives, at a fundraiser that had been co-hosted by the founder of a natural gas company.\n\n\u201cI just want to be very clear to everyone here: I am committed to not raising money from fossil fuel executives, and I am not doing that tonight,\u201d Mr. Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, said at a Manhattan fundraiser, according to a pool report of the event. \u201cClimate change presents an existential threat, and it is real. \u2026 I\u2019m so tired of having a president who picks fiction over science.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden told the crowd that there have been \u201ctensions\u201d surrounding the event. As of Thursday afternoon, Andrew Goldman, the co-founder of Western LNG, was still considered a co-host of the fundraiser.\n\n\u201cFolks, I know there\u2019s been a lot of tensions paid to yours showing up tonight. More than I think you anticipated,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nHe had been asked about attending the fundraiser at a CNN town hall event on Wednesday, given Mr. Goldman\u2019s ties to the natural gas industry.\n\nMr. Biden had said he would look into it, and that Mr. Goldman isn\u2019t listed as an executive with the company in federal filings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fossil fuel executive,\u201d Mr. Biden had said on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, a small group of environmentalists showed up outside the apartment of investor Andrew Solomon chanting, \u201cBiden, Biden, you can\u2019t hide, we can see your greedy side,\u201d but dispersed by the time the event wrapped up, according to the pool report.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is last night there was a discussion and I think a mild misrepresentation of what was going on relative to climate,\u201d Mr. Biden said, though it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what he meant and he didn\u2019t mention Mr. Goldman\u2019s name in his speech.\n\nMr. Biden wants to get the U.S. to net-zero emissions by 2050, and without naming names suggested other candidates\u2019 plans were unrealistic.\n\n\u201cYou have to have plans, but you have to be able to execute those plans,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
