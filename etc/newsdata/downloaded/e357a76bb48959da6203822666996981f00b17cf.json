Concerning the Ukraine scandal, the president is not seeking forgiveness for a failure in judgment or even trying to change the subject. He boldly asks Americans to accept that his actions \u2014 pressuring a foreign power to investigate a domestic political rival \u2014 were good and proper. \u201cI don\u2019t care about [Joe] Biden\u2019s campaign,\u201d Trump insists, \u201cbut I do care about corruption.\u201d And there was \u201ctremendous corruption with Biden.\u201d\n\nTrump is effectively setting a new standard of political morality and requiring his supporters to defend it. He is asking elected Republicans, in particular, to agree with his claim that a practice uniformly viewed as corruption in the past is actually an example of fighting corruption now. That is the little thing, the small thing, which Trump demands of his followers: To call hot cold. To call black white. To call wrong right.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhilosopher Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s idea of \u201cincommensurability\u201d strikes me as relevant here. If all moral claims are merely \u201cemotive\u201d \u2014 statements about ourselves rather than the nature of reality \u2014 then there is no way to argue between them. The statement that \u201cstealing is wrong\u201d can be debated. The statement \u201cI feel that stealing is wrong\u201d is not subject to rational dispute. Someone else could simply assert, \u201cI feel that stealing is right,\u201d and the argument would be at a stalemate.\n\nTrump is the emotivist par excellence. He holds no objective, abstract beliefs about the meaning of justice or duty. He approves of things that help him and disapproves of things that hurt him. There is no other moral grounding. Yet he makes his assertions with utter confidence.\n\nThe president currently claims that asking a dependent government to dig up dirt on a political rival is a good thing, even when it involves the implication of extortion. He makes no argument about why the traditional definition of corruption has changed. He feels no need. The shift is in his interest. And that is enough to require the assent of his followers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElected Republicans, as a result, are looking mighty uncomfortable. Mouthing the words that Trump wants from them \u2014 saying that corruption is really anti-corruption \u2014 would mean sounding like a fool and surrendering what remains of their political honor. Some, like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have lamely claimed that Trump was really making a joke. Because, you know, presidential corruption is normally such a laugh riot. But Trump has insisted on his own seriousness. Rubio and the rest must swallow the gelatinous pile of offal Trump gives them \u2014 all of it \u2014 or they are no longer in the club.\n\nRepublicans are being called to follow their leader down a relativist rabbit hole. Trump is not only asking them to accept his arguments on policy matters such as building a wall or provoking a trade war. To be loyal foot soldiers, they must affirm that morality means what Trump says it means \u2014 even when it violates their clearest instincts. They know, deep down, that if a Democratic president had asked France or China for help in destroying a prominent Republican rival, they would be in a fever pitch of outrage. But, in the Trump era, this isn\u2019t supposed to matter anymore. Consistency means nothing. Principle means nothing. Character means nothing. It only matters who wins.\n\nMany Republicans would dearly like to say: What Trump did is wrong, but it doesn\u2019t rise to an impeachable offense. There are two problems with this approach: First, Trump will not regard this as evidence of sufficient loyalty; he demands full approval. And, second, I imagine that most of the founders would regard Trump\u2019s act \u2014 inviting a foreign country to influence an American election \u2014 as the definition of an impeachable offense. If their intent means anything, it means Trump is seriously corrupt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo we are left with positions that can\u2019t be reconciled. Trump honestly seems to have no moral objection to what he did. His opponents are left sputtering, \u201cBut this has always been seen as serious corruption!\u201d The president simply doesn\u2019t care. And, if his GOP supporters remain loyal, they will be further implicated in the moral decay of American politics.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s latest lies about the Ukraine scandal are imploding fast\n\nJennifer Rubin: How you know Trump is in a full panic\n\nMichael Gerson: Trump\u2019s anti-impeachment rhetoric has already gone too far\n\nPaul Waldman: We\u2019re one step closer to seeing Trump\u2019s tax returns\n\nJames Downie: The new GOP strategy: Don\u2019t believe the president\n\nAD", "description": "To remain loyal, the GOP members are losing their own morality in favor of the president\u2019s relativism.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9HHXlMok25FaEREWNk8zx-D6I_c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SXOCQOXJFEI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
