Lack and Oppenheim still have the confidence of parent Comcast Corp. \u2019s NBCUniversal, which in recent months renewed Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s contract, people familiar with the matter said. The contract renewal is a strong endorsement for an executive who has been at the center of such a controversy. These contracts are typically renewed for several years at a time, and Mr. Oppenheim is expected to succeed Mr. Lack after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a book published last week, Mr. Farrow claimed NBC got cold feet over the Weinstein story he was working on in the summer of 2017 for myriad reasons\u2014including an alleged threat by Mr. Weinstein that he would reveal damaging information about \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\n\nNBC News has said Mr. Farrow\u2019s story wasn\u2019t ready for air when he was given permission to take it elsewhere. He took it to the New Yorker, where it ran in October 2017 and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, the highest honor in journalism. Mr. Lauer was fired from his job a month later, after a colleague accused him of sexual misconduct in an internal complaint.\n\nIn Mr. Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,\u201d a former NBC News employee, Brooke Nevils, alleged that Mr. Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nBoth Messrs. Weinstein and Lauer have denied the accusations against them. Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to go on trial in January for criminal charges including rape.\n\nThe allegations in Mr. Farrow\u2019s book have many NBC employees feeling angry that the network continues to make more headlines for its internal drama than for its reporting.\n\n\u201cNo one at NBC is happy about the fact that such a huge story wasn\u2019t reported by NBC,\u201d said one on-air correspondent, referring to the Weinstein story.\n\nNBC News Chairman Andy Lack is scheduled to retire after the 2020 election.

Mr. Oppenheim, 40 years old, became president of NBC News in 2017 after two successful years at the helm of \u201cToday.\u201d He initially joined NBC News nearly 15 years ago as a \u201cToday\u201d producer before leaving to pursue a Hollywood career. His screenwriting credits include the movie \u201cJackie.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think NBC News has handled the allegations made by Ronan Farrow? Join the conversation below.\n\nSome staffers at NBC News say they feel a wholesale change in management is needed given the string of public missteps that the division has weathered in recent years.\n\nAmong the questionable calls: Signing former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly to a huge contract only to cancel both her shows and push her out with a $30 million check; giving \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor Brian Williams a second chance on MSNBC after he lied about his war-reporting experiences; and not being first to report on an NBC video of then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women to entertainment reporter Billy Bush.\n\n\u201cFrankly, in light of all the miscues I\u2019ve wondered how the leadership of that place survives,\u201d said Michael Socolow, a professor of journalism at the University of Maine.\n\nNBC came under fire from one of its own on air last week when MSNBC host Chris Hayes questioned the network\u2019s defense that Mr. Farrow\u2019s reporting on Mr. Weinstein wasn\u2019t strong enough.\n\n\u201cThe path of least resistance is always there, beckoning seductively with an entirely plausible cover story,\u201d Mr. Hayes said on his Oct. 14 show. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s the very ease of that path that makes it the enemy of the very work that we as journalists are trying to do.\u201d\n\nRonan Farrow\u2019s book, \u2018Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators\u2019 was published last week.

Lack and Oppenheim\u2019s leadership. While ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d are first in viewers, \u201cToday\u201d and \u201cNightly News with Lester Holt\u201d remain on top in the key 25-54 demographic favored by advertisers. \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with Chuck Todd is the top Sunday morning news show. And although some inside NBC News grumble about Mr. Williams being allowed to rehabilitate himself, his MSNBC show \u201cThe 11th Hour\u201d has performed well.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio of news shows have weathered the challenges that all broadcast TV faces better than almost any of our competitors,\u201d Mr. Oppenheim said. The NBC News unit, he added, is \u201chealthier now than it\u2019s ever been financially, ratings wise and in terms of the journalism they showcase every day.\u201d\n\nMr. Oppenheim does have key backers at the network including \u201cToday\u201d hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb who, along with other top talent and producers, expressed their support of current leadership to Mr. Burke, people familiar with the matter said. Ms. Guthrie in particular has close ties to Mr. Oppenheim and his family. She and Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s wife, Allison, have recently co-written two children\u2019s books.\n\nMr. Oppenheim has been credited with putting women in charge of both \u201cToday\u201d and \u201cNightly News\u201d although detractors note that the top echelon of management inside the news division is still white men. NBC said it has appointed women to key leadership positions and that 63% of Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s direct reports are women, compared with 43% under his predecessor.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com", "description": "NBC News Chairman Andy Lack and NBC News President Noah Oppenheim still have the confidence of parent Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, which in recent months renewed Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s contract.", "authors": ["Joe Flint", "Benjamin Mullin", "Joe.Flint Wsj.Com", "Benjamin.Mullin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118679/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
