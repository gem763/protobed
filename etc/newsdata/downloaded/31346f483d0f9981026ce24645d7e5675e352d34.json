Failure could lead to a new election, the third within a year.\n\n\u201cEveryone expects us to bring the political chaos to an absolute end,\u201d Gantz said, accepting the nomination.\n\nRivlin gave Netanyahu the chance to form a government first. But the prime minister, who leads the right-wing Likud party, said on Monday he was abandoning the effort, opening the way for Gantz, his strongest rival.\n\nReplacing even a weakened Netanyahu after a decade in office could prove difficult without a significant shifting of political alliances.\n\nGantz, 60, has so far spurned Netanyahu\u2019s offer to Blue and White to join Likud in a \u201cnational unity\u201d government, citing looming indictments against the prime minister in three graft cases. Netanyahu denies the allegations.\n\nGantz, who headed Israel\u2019s military from 2011 to 2015,, has the endorsement of only 54 lawmakers - seven short of a parliamentary majority that neither he nor Netanyahu could manage in either last month\u2019s vote or the ballot in April.\n\nGantz has also balked at including ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties - some of Netanyahu\u2019s traditional allies - in his administration.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Gantz spoke of \u201cnational reconciliation\u201d but also described a future government in terms that could exclude the ultra-Orthodox.\n\n\u201cI promised to establish a liberal unity government, and that, I intend to do,\u201d he said, using political shorthand for an administration that pursues a secular agenda, such as a wider opening of businesses on the Jewish Sabbath.\n\nDifferences also emerged in coalition talks over Rivlin\u2019s proposal for a rotating premiership, including a possible leave of absence for Netanyahu should he be indicted. Israel\u2019s attorney general is expected to announce his decision on charges by the end of the year.\n\nNegotiators from Blue and White and Likud planned to meet again on Thursday. In a statement, Likud repeated its call for a broad coalition government, a nod to inclusion of the ultra-Orthodox.\n\nNetanyahu remains caretaker premier until a new government is established. He has been prime minister consecutively since 2009, after a first term from 1996 to 1999, making him Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader.", "description": "Former military chief Benny Gantz received an official mandate on Wednesday to try to form Israel's next government, but with no easy path to ending Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's long hold on power.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444203725&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1QY", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
