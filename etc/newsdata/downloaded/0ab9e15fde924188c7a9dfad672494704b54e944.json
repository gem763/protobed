Is it just hype? And is it all Elon Musk's fault?", "language": "en", "text": "Josh, my Twitter is flooded with people mourning the loss of Fortnite and blaming Elon Musk and I really have no idea what is happening. What is happening?\n\nI\u2019m glad you asked, Steph. So: Fortnite is a massive online multiplayer game played by 250 million people around the world. It\u2019s huge.\n\nA few hours ago a big asteroid in the game began to flare up and within a short time basically blew up the entire map.\n\nYou can\u2019t play the game right now. It\u2019s just a black hole. People, naturally, began freaking out.\n\nJack \u201cCouRage\u201d Dunlop (@CouRageJD) RIP Fortnite: Battle Royale\n\n\n\nFULL LIVE REACTION TO THE END! pic.twitter.com/ifX4CJcnEK\n\nFortnite also deleted all of its tweets and is running a livestream of said black hole both on Twitter and game-streaming platform Twitch, which around 40,000-60,000 people are currently watching. According to some reports, the total number of viewers across all platforms is more than six million.\n\n1800 Clapz (@1Clapz) \"No one is stupid enough to watch a blackhole for 4 hours\" #Fortnite Me: pic.twitter.com/NwtgWTCs33\n\nSome numbers have been appearing around the black hole, and people are wondering whether they\u2019re clues.\n\nJon (@MrDalekJD) This is no joke - @FortniteGame are FULLY trolling us all.\n\n\n\nIf you type the numbers \"11 146 15 62 google maps\" in Google and click the first link, you get a street view of a crab rave.\n\n\n\nLMAO\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80 pic.twitter.com/a1ADbXdxoH\n\ntimthetatman (@timthetatman) Everyone trying to figure out what the Fortnite numbers mean pic.twitter.com/8phQgUeuPQ\n\nMillions of people are watching a black hole? Who are these people? How does this game work?\n\nFortnite is an online shooter game where around 100 people are pitted against each other on a small island in a fight to the death until one person is left standing. A lot of time and in some cases money has been invested, particularly by the most hardcore players \u2013 so people are wondering if this is the end of Fortnite, or just the start of a new season of the game (a season lasts around 10 weeks).\n\nIt\u2019s so popular, particularly with kids, because it\u2019s free, easy to use and doesn\u2019t really take itself seriously with blood and gore and lots of things that you often get in other huge online games. Also, it\u2019s kind of addictive.\n\nJosh (@krockjosh) On behalf of parents everywhere, Thank You Fortnite, for making yourself completely unplayable for an entire day.\n\nEpic Games reportedly makes up to about US$300m per month from it. That\u2019s largely from players spending money in the game, on outfits and various items for their characters; as well as from the battle pass system, where people pay at least US$10 (or 950 v-bucks, in the in-game currency) for challenges that allow them to unlock extra content.\n\nIn terms of how much people invest in the game, it\u2019s less of an issue than loot boxes (where people pay real money for mystery in-game prizes) \u2013 but a law firm in Canada recently launched a lawsuit against Epic Games, claiming Fortnite operated in a similar way to slot machines, and was addictive as cocaine.\n\nIn July, people competed for US $30m in prize money at the Fortnite world cup \u2013 and you\u2019ve probably seen some of the memes for Fortnite without even realising. Do you remember Ted Danson flossing? Yeah that\u2019s Fortnite.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) Did your @fortnitegame suck you & everything else into a black hole?\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t help you there.\n\n\n\nBut death-by-black-hole is a thing, and there might even be an entire universe on the other side.https://t.co/Toio6gpgdv\n\nOK. So it\u2019s big. How exactly is Elon Musk involved?\n\nWhere Elon Musk fits in is that almost one year ago exactly, he tweeted out a fake news article suggesting he had bought Fortnite just to delete it to \u201csave these kids from eternal virginity\u201d.\n\nElon Musk (@elonmusk) Had to been done ur welcome pic.twitter.com/7jT0f9lqIS\n\nThat tweet has now got about 300,000 RTs, because some people were assuming the fake news became real. Musk, jokingly, even RTed it himself.\n\nBut while some fans are freaking out that it could be the end (not helped by Epic Games, who earlier Tweeted \u2013 and since deleted \u2013 about the end coming), it looks like it\u2019s just the end of this current phase of the game. PlayStation has reassured players that they don\u2019t have to worry about their items being lost.\n\nWait, so this is just hype for the next release?\n\nI\u2019d say so, yes. It\u2019s likely the new, 11th season will commence soon with changes to the map, and shiny new things.\n\nWe have seen Fortnite do this sort of thing before, At the end of season seven, big cracks began forming in the ground of the island as a result of earthquakes. Eventually this formed a big volcano \u2013 when season eight started.\n\nThose keen to know what happens next will have to stay tuned. If you get bored waiting, you can enter the Konami code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start) and play a Galaga-esque mini game in the meantime. Otherwise, just keep watching the hole.", "description": "Millions of players just watched as their favourite online multiplayer game was hit by an asteroid and turned into a black hole.
