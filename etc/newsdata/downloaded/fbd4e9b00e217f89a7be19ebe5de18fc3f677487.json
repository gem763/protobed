CoQ10 is an essential ingredient for fueling nearly every cellular process in your body. It\u2019s basically the gasoline that fuels your mitochondria\u2014often called the factories, or the power plants, of the cells. Every cell in your body has mitochondria. And\n\nLow CoQ10 Means Big Problems\n\nmitochondria need CoQ10 to create energy . That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so important. Without CoQ10, your body would literally stop functioning. But many of us are walking around severely CoQ10-deficient. And that might have even farther-reaching repercussions than we previously thought.Every patient that walks through my door, I test for CoQ10 deficiency. Why? Aside from being a simple, cheap test, our CoQ10 levels can signal many things. Low CoQ10 levels are often associated with cardiac problems\u2014and CoQ10 supplements are a safe, natural, and inexpensive treatment for many heart issues. However, statins \u2014often used to control cholesterol\u2014lower your body\u2019s CoQ10 levels. If a patient comes to me complaining of fatigue, one of my first thoughts turns to my favorite co-enzyme. Many times, energy levels are directly related to CoQ10. And the times when they aren\u2019t directly related, they are usually indirectly related. The fact is, CoQ10 deficiency is caused by an astounding array of diseases and their typically prescribed medications. Another stunning example: CoQ10 deficiency is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Low levels of CoQ10 have also been found in Parkinson\u2019s sufferers. Now, a new study suggests CoQ10 deficiency might not just be a symptom of Parkinson\u2019s Disease\u2014but perhaps a contributing factor.\n\nThe Most Promising, Natural Parkinson\u2019s Treatment I Know\n\nParkinson\u2019s Disease is, in essence, a problem with dopamine production in the body. Usually, it\u2019s caused by exposure to harmful, toxic chemicals, like pesticides and insecticides. Some of these products contain a chemical called MPTP, which directly interferes with mitochondrial function. Whenever a patient comes to me with Parkinson\u2019s, I immediately order a complete detox diet, and look for any possible sources of toxic exposure. That\u2019s the best way to limit further damage. But a new study has also found that doses of CoQ10 could help restore some lost function. That toxic, Parkinson-causing chemical\u2014MPTP\u2014directly leads to a reduction of CoQ10. So this study decided to find out if supplementing with CoQ10 could undo some of the damage. The early results are promising. In the study, participants were given a special type of non-oxidized CoQ10\u2014known as ubuiquitol-10. They took 300 mg a day. They showed absolutely no adverse side effects from the supplement. But the levels of CoQ10 in their blood were ten times greater compared to the control group that took a placebo. These are still early days. The researchers have only been working in a laboratory setting, and observing the effects at a cellular level. But I believe that huge jump in CoQ10 at the cellular level will mean good things at the macro level as well. And I fully expect future studies to strengthen that belief. Here\u2019s the bottom line: CoQ10 is an essential ingredient for your body to function properly. I recommend that every adult supplement with CoQ10 daily, 120 mg for heart protection. We\u2019re waiting on the science to tell us what\u2019s the appropriate amount to protect against Parkinson\u2019s, but 300 mg shows no ill effects. We know that it helps with heart function. We suspect that it helps alleviate the pain and suffering caused by a plethora of diseases (some of which might simply be a misinterpreted CoQ10 deficiency). And we now know that CoQ10 supplements taken for Parkinson\u2019s Disease show a huge effect at the cellular level. The next time I have a patient with Parkinson\u2019s, I\u2019m going to discuss CoQ10 supplements. And if you know anyone who suffers from this disease\u2014or you do yourself\u2014I\u2019d highly recommend you look into CoQ10.", "description": "Co-enzyme Q10\u2014or CoQ10\u2014is one of my favorite supplements and one .09/02/2019 3:23:19AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
