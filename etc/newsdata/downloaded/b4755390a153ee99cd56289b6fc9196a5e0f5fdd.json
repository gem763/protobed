Minutes away from the scheduled landing, the screen at the Indian Space Research Organization\u2019s monitoring center in the southern city of Bangalore showed the lander diverging from its expected path.\n\nAfter more than 20 tense minutes during which the leaders of India\u2019s space program looked confused, and huddled in groups apparently discussing what was happening, ISRO chairman K. Sivan made a simple announcement: The lander got to around 2.1 kilometers (about 1.3 miles) from its destination, then stopped sending signals.\n\n\u201cThe communication from lander to ground station was lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data is being analyzed.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was also at the space center, monitoring the mission\u2019s progress. \u201cWhat you have done is not a small achievement,\u201d he told the scientists after the loss of communications was announced. \u201cOur journey will continue.\u201d\n\nAfter Russia, the U.S. and China, India is trying to become the fourth country to land an unmanned craft on the moon. The lander had a small lunar rover in its belly. It was scheduled to move around and analyze the nearby terrain and minerals for two weeks.\n\nAuthorities offered no further details and asked the journalists gathered in the monitoring center in Bangalore to go home. A scheduled news conference was canceled.\n\nThe experts and other space enthusiasts on Indian television news shows tried to put a positive spin on the development. Some said they hoped communication could be restored and the mission completed, but even if that didn\u2019t happen India should be proud at how close it got.\n\nLanding on the moon has proven to be tricky, said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, the head of the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank.\n\n\u201cSince there was a deviation from the planned trajectory, the central engine could have malfunctioned. The other thing could be that the data transmission link got lost,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could just be the communication link getting snapped but things being normal. It\u2019s still difficult to say with certainty what could have gone wrong.\u201d\n\nLanding on the moon is particularly difficult because it has almost no atmosphere. That means parachutes can\u2019t be used, so landers depend on thrusters to set them down at the proper speed and in the right place. Transmissions to and from Earth take more than a second, so the lander cannot be controlled in real time. The Indian lander was programmed to scan for a suitable spot to land and reach it automatically.\n\nA similar Israeli mission failed earlier this year at around the same stage. As it descended to the lunar surface, it lost communications and hit the moon at too high a speed.\n\n\u201cThese are challenging matters and it could happen even to more experienced countries,\u201d said Ram S. Jakhu, former director of the Institute of Air and Space Law at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cKnowing something in theory and doing it in practice is different.\u201d\n\nIndia was hoping its arrival on its surface would highlight its high-tech chops as interest in space is growing.\n\nTechnology has made it cheaper and easier to attempt to explore and potentially make money away from Earth. China has announced grand plans to do more in space, and the U.S. is trying to keep its lead. The private sector also has a number of initiatives.\n\nChina landed a rover on the far side of the moon in January and next year, it plans to send one to Mars. It is even planning a lunar base and a space station above Earth. Japan hopes to land its first probe on the moon in 2021. Meanwhile, the U.S. wants to build a space station orbiting the moon by 2023, make a manned moon landing the same year and even land a person on Mars by 2033.\n\nIndia targeted the moon\u2019s south pole because it would have been a first for any country and there is evidence that it has water. If the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and rover could confirm the location of pockets of water\u2014scientists say it is likely within craters\u2014it would be useful for future missions. The ice could be turned into hydrogen for fuel and oxygen to breathe.\n\nEven if the lander is lost, India should be able to continue to survey the moon\u2019s surface with the orbiter. That would provide more clues not only about what happened to the lander but also for the future of space travel.\n\n\u201cWe remain hopeful and will continue working hard on our space programme,\u201d Prime Minister Modi said in a tweet.\n\n\u2014Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Eric Bellman at eric.bellman@wsj.com", "description": "India may have failed at its attempt to land a probe on the moon: It has lost communication with the lunar lander minutes before it was supposed to reach the lunar surface.", "authors": ["Eric Bellman", "Eric.Bellman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104955/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
