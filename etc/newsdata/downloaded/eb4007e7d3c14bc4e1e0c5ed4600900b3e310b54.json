REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nTwo years ago, Jean-Louis Biron started to complain about Maurice\u2019s early-morning crowing to its owners, Jacky Fesseau and his wife Corrine, who refused to get rid of their beloved fowl.\n\n\u201cThe cock\u2019s screeching starts at 4.30 a.m. and keeps up all morning and well into the afternoon,\u201d Biron said in an official letter he sent to his neighbors on the island of Oleron in 2017.\n\nThe row then escalated and the parties, against the advice of their lawyers and a mediator, went to court.\n\n\u201cI am telling myself, I am not going to let myself be bullied,\u201d Corrine Fesseau said about the lawsuit. \u201cThe countryside should stay as it is and they should not say: \u2018We should silence the countryside noises.\u2019\u201d\n\nA hearing on the case took place in July a local court in Rochefort and a decision is expected on September 5.\n\nIt is not clear what the plaintiffs want to achieve with the lawsuit. Biron\u2019s lawyer was quoted by Le Monde newspaper as saying he wants to open mediation \u201cto clear up the lawsuit\u201d. His lawyers could not be immediately reached.\n\nMaurice\u2019s case underscores a decades-long conflict in France between city dwellers buying summer homes in the countryside without being ready to cope with rural characteristics such as animal noise, odors or insects.\n\nMaurice has raised a broad move of sympathy and support from all over France and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to support Corrine\u2019s association, but also to push out a cry of anger against the fact that a rooster could be involved in a lawsuit,\u201d said Benoit Guitton, a local businessman who sells T-shirts supporting Maurice.\n\nSimilar court cases against cows and church bells have been filed in France but none with the same emotive impact as Maurice the rooster, who has elicited letters of support from as far away as in the United States.", "description": "PIERRE-D'OLERON, France (Reuters) - A loud 4-year-old rooster called Maurice on an island off the French Atlantic shore has pitted a couple of city slickers who bought a second home next door against his owners, and stirred a nationwide debate.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190831&t=2&i=1424808815&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7U0QM"}
