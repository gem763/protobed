Liverpool The most popular set of kits in the country. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nCocu, who has yet to decide whether Lawrence and Bennett could feature against Birmingham, said: \u201cThe first idea was footgolf but the weather was really bad so we changed plans and went bowling.\n\n\u201cAfter that there was a team dinner where the team sat together for some bonding. Most of the players left around 8pm and a small group stayed and continued at the bar.\n\n\u201cDue to an alcohol-related incident we\u2019ve lost our captain for the rest of the season, so in the end it was bad news for the whole team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad news and a bad situation for everybody at the club.\u201d\n\nCocu, who was not present at the meal, suggested there will be a range of disciplinary action taken against those involved but is eager to establish exactly what went on first.\n\nAsked whether 33-year-old Keogh\u2019s injury could even be career-threatening, the Dutchman simply reiterated it is \u201ca very serious injury\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was here (at the training ground) for a short moment and I spoke briefly to him because there\u2019s a lot going on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely down, of course, because he realises what\u2019s going on for him personally and of course as a responsible player, as captain, to not be part of the team anymore does something to you.\n\n\u201cI think he feels responsible, yeah. The more senior players always have to step up and take responsibility and it\u2019s now had a huge effect on him personally. It\u2019s a lot to deal with for him.\u201d\n\nDerby go into the clash with one win from Cocu\u2019s eight league games in charge since replacing Frank Lampard, and will have been looking to build on last Saturday\u2019s confidence-boosting draw at Leeds.\n\nHowever, the tone quickly changed and a County statement said: \u201cAs a club, we cannot, and do not, condone the actions of a small group of players on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cThe players were out as part of a scheduled team-building dinner with staff and while the majority of them acted responsibly and left at around 8pm and were not involved, a small group, including the team captain Richard Keogh, continued drinking into the night.\n\n\u201cThey should have known when to stop and also ignored the opportunity to be driven home using cars laid on by the club, and chose to stay out.\n\n\u201cAs a result of an alcohol-related incident, Richard Keogh has sustained a serious knee injury that will prevent him from playing until the end of the season.\u201d\n\nLawrence and Bennett were charged with drink-driving after a crash involving a Range Rover Sport and a Mercedes shortly before midnight on Tuesday.\n\nDerby\u2019s statement continued: \u201cThe players involved in the incident on Tuesday evening will be subject to a rigorous internal investigation under the club\u2019s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Derby\u00a0will bid to focus on football on Friday after a horror Thursday which saw manager Phillip Cocu explain how two of his players were charged with drink driving and his captain had been ruled out for the season.", "authors": ["Sports Staff"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/08/phillip-cocu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
