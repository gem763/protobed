I knew she desperately wanted to be with her babies in heaven and I told her to go to them.\n\n\u201cI knew they were waiting for her. I imagined them running towards their mam, throwing their arms around her and showering her with kisses. It brought me some comfort. Michelle had wanted to be a mum her\n\nentire life and her six children were her world.\n\n(Image: James Speakman/Mercury Press)\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt she wanted to die and be with her children the minute she knew they\u2019d gone \u2013 but I was always willing her to fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d beg her to carry on. I couldn\u2019t face more grief and I think deep down she knew that.\n\n\u201cMichelle was selfless and despite her horrific heartbreak, she carried on for so long for me, her four siblings and her surviving sons, Kyle and Louis.\u201d\n\n(Image: James Speakman/Mercury Press)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nKillers Zak Bolland, 24, and David Worrall, 27, threw petrol bombs into Michelle\u2019s kitchen in the early hours while the family slept upstairs. Bolland had been in a feud with Michelle\u2019s son Kyle over alleged damage to a \u00a3200 car.\n\nTensions grew weeks before the fire and Michelle called police several times.\n\nSandra said: \u201cShe would still be here with her kids today if the authorities had acted sooner and moved them. She would have seen her kids grow up. Lia was three and would have been starting school this year. Brandon would have been going to \u00adsecondary school.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"That has all been taken from us. I will never see my grandkids grow up or my daughter grow old.\n\n\u201cAll Michelle remembered from the fire is getting Lia into the bath, putting the shower on and \u00adthrowing a sheet over her to stop the flames.\n\n\u201cThen she said it all went black. She didn\u2019t remember anything else, just waking up in a hospital bed.\u201d\n\nWhen Michelle came round from her coma, mum-of-five Sandra waited weeks to break the tragic news.\n\n\u201cOne day she asked where her babies were,\u201d recalled Sandra.\n\n(Image: Greater Manchester Police)\n\n\u201cShe was hooked up to machines, still confused and in a lot of pain. I took her hand and said, \u2018Oh darling, they\u2019ve gone. I\u2019m so sorry. They died in the fire\u2019. She started sobbing and screaming, \u2018No, no, no\u2019. She was inconsolable.\u201d\n\nBut the trauma shattered Michelle\u2019s memory, so Sandra had to keep \u00adrepeating the horrendous news.\n\nShe said: \u201cHer memory was gone and she was so confused, she would ask where the children were and I\u2019d have to tell her all over again.\n\n\u201cShe broke down in tears every time.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cSaying goodbye to Michelle was the \u00adhardest thing I ever had to do but I knew she needed to go.\n\n\u201cShe died clutching a photo of her precious children. They are reunited now and I will see them all soon.\n\n\u201cI know they are all together in heaven. She is back in the arms of her children and I know she\u2019ll be looking over us until we\u2019re reunited again.\n\n\u201cNow I have to be strong for Michelle\u2019s two surviving boys. I knew she died \u00adtrusting that I would be there for them.\u201d\n\nSandra says the \u00adfamily feel relieved her four grandchildren are laid to rest with their mum at St Mary\u2019s Roman Catholic cemetery in Worsley.\n\n(Image: Greater Manchester Police)\n\nShe said: \u201cMichelle\u2019s coffin was white and we had four horses pulling four white carriages to symbolise the children she\u2019d lost. It was impossible to hold back the tears as everyone was reminded how tragic it all was.\u201d\n\nNow Sandra, a retired \u00adcleaner, faces another battle \u2013 \u00adensuring that Michelle\u2019s killers are charged with her murder. Bolland and Worrall were jailed for four murders and told to serve a minimum of 40 and 37 years respectively.\n\nBolland\u2019s girlfriend Courtney Brierley, 21, got 21 years for manslaughter.\n\nYet Bolland and Worrall were convicted only of Michelle\u2019s \u00adattempted murder, a charge Sandra wants to see upgraded to murder.\n\n\u201cI want them to rot behind bars for their entire lives,\u201d said Sandra.\n\n(Image: Greater Manchester Police)\n\n\u201cThey are disgusting, cowardly bullies and their act has ruined our family and stolen the young lives of my grandkids and daughter.\n\n\"Every waking minute of Michelle\u2019s 20-month fight was constant agony. We all thought she was lucky to have survived but I wouldn\u2019t wish what she went through on my worst enemy.\n\n\u201cHer skin was red raw, her toes amputated, she fought constant infections and her life hung in the balance.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"Even the most \u00adviolent gangsters don\u2019t target children and \u00adwomen. The murderers don\u2019t deserve to see \u00addaylight again.\u201d\n\n\u201cFighting for this extra \u00adsentence on Michelle\u2019s behalf is the least we can do. She was so brave.\u201d\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said: \u201cFollowing Michelle Pearson\u2019s death we have had initial contact with Greater Manchester Police and they are continuing inquiries.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sandra Lever watched her daughter die 20 months after she was left with 75 per cent burns in sick attack", "authors": ["Kelly Jenkins", "Image", "James Speakman Mercury Press", "Manchester Evening News", "Greater Manchester Police", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653473.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Michelle-Pearson-Mother-Sandra-Lever.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
