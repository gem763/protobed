It also eclipsed Hong Kong\u2019s previously reported records for a parking space, which were $664,000 in 2017 and $760,000 in 2018, but may not have set a world mark.\n\nThere have been several spots listed in New York City for $1 million over the past few years, but final transaction prices are unknown.\n\nParking in a public lot a block away from The Center is listed at $900 per month.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Someone must really like driving to work.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
