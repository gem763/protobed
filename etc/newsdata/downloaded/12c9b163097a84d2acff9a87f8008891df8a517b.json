Magazine asked Kimberley if they were planning on having a fourth child, and she replied: \"No! I had my tubes clamped while I was in there.\"\n\nMax added: \"I'm having a vasectomy too - we're not taking any chances.\n\n\"I'm sure we're going to be together forever but if we did split for whatever reason then Kim couldn't have kids with somebody else, so I shouldn't be able to either.\"\n\nKimberley spoke out about recovering from her C-section, which she says has been tough as she is a dancer.\n\n\"It's been brutal\", she said.\n\n\"I'm a dancer, so the toll it takes being cut in that way is hard.\n\n\"We have the most comfortable bed in the world but I can't get out of it as I don't have any core strength, so I've had to sleep on the sofa.\n\n(Image: Rankin)\n\n\"Max has been helping me - he does Pilates classes in the lounge.\"\n\nThe couple also explained the reason behind their new son's name.\n\n\"Ford\" comes from Tom Ford, because Kimberley said her big career break was \"getting the cover of GQ with Tom Ford\".\n\nThe \"Senna\" part is named after Formula One racing driver Ayrton Senna, because Kimberley's father was a racing car driver.\n\nKimberley was delighted to have a boy so that the family name could be carried on.\n\nKimberly said: \"For me, it was the most celebrated little penis I\u2019ve ever had!\"\n\n\"I\u2019m down to second\", joked Max.", "description": "The former Pussycat Doll had her tubes tied and her husband is also planning on getting a vasectomy", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20094170.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_World-Fashion-Awards-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
