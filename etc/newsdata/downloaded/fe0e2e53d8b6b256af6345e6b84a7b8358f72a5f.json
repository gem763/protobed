But Timoshenko\u2019s participation was never in doubt once he had made a workmanlike winning comeback at Goodwood in July.\n\nMuch like Land Of Oz, the selection possesses a rather languid racing style which suggests plenty of untapped potential and today\u2019s conditions should be no issue.\n\nRobin Goodfellow gives you all of his top tips ahead of a packed day of races on Saturday\n\nNEWMARKET\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 1.45 Ascension 2.20 Volkan Star 2:55 Molatham 3:30 Pinatubo 4:10 Timoshenko (nb) 4:45 Bravo Sierra 5:20 Matterhorn GIMCRACK 1.45 Ascension 2.20 Max Vega 2.55 Cherokee Trail 3.30 Pinatubo 4.10 Seinesational (nap 4.45 Show Stealer 5.20 Look Around\n\nYORK\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 2.05 Convict 2.40 Lampang 3.15 Johnny Drama 3.50 Aplomb 4.25 Fox Duty Free 5.00 Arrowtown 5.35 Addis Ababa GIMCRACK 2.05 Convict 2.40 Lampang 3.15 Coolagh Forest 3.50 Danzeno (nb) 4.25 Colour Image 5.00 Arrowtown 5.35 Ayutthaya\n\nCHEPSTOW", "description": "Sir Mark Prescott has endured a rather tumultuous relationship with the Cesarewitch but he boasts two brilliant chances of ending the hoodoo on Saturday.", "authors": ["Sam Turner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19609298-0-image-a-52_1570830387719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
