Kennedy III is everything you could want in a Kennedy. He\u2019s young (38), good looking, gives great speeches, and has top ratings from Planned Parenthood, the League of Conservation Voters and LGBT groups. But compared to incumbent Sen. Ed Markey, he\u2019s practically a member of the MAGA hat crowd.\n\nWhich is why JK3\u2019s all-but-certain run for the U.S. Senate is creating so much political whiplash among Bay State Democrats.\n\nOn paper, Rep. Kennedy\u2019s decision to challenge a 73-year-old political lifer like Ed Markey is straight from the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez playbook. New York Congressman Joe Crowley was a consistently liberal vote in the Democratic caucus with 20 years of seniority. He got whacked by AOC, not over policy, but identity.\n\nThe same story two years later in Boston, when City Councilor Ayanna Pressley put 10-term incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano out to pasture. It had nothing to do with his voting record \u2014 which would have been center-left in the old Soviet politburo. It was just time for racial, gender and generational change.\n\nIf JK3 makes his move, Mr. Markey will almost certainly get \u201chope and changed\u201d right into retirement.\n\nOnce again, on paper, Mr. Markey should be untouchable among the Massachusetts moonbats. His lifetime score from Progressive Punch is 99.02 out of 100 \u2014 second only to Elizabeth Warren. He\u2019s not just a supporter of the far-left fever-swamp fantasy known as the Green New Deal, he\u2019s the lead sponsor. All of the craziest things you\u2019ve heard about the GND \u2014 shutting down the entire fossil fuel industry, guaranteed federal jobs for all, $93 trillion in spending \u2014 Mr. Markey\u2019s said them all.\n\nIn front of a microphone.\n\nMr. Markey figured out long ago that, in Massachusetts, there\u2019s no downside to ideological insanity. In a state where no Republican has won a general election for U.S. Senate since 1972, the only political danger is in a Democratic primary. (Scott Brown won a special election in 2010 and was promptly thrown out two years later.)\n\nHow do you avoid being primaried? By embracing every loony left proposal that comes down the line. And so from taxpayer-funded abortion on demand up to the day of birth, to ending immigration enforcement and abolishing ICE, Ed Markey is with the progressive masses.\n\nThe question is, with a Kennedy on the ticket, will the progs be with him? Answer: No.\n\nSources close to Mr. Kennedy claim they\u2019ve got polling showing he\u2019s leading Mr. Markey outside the margin of error even before he enters the race. And political observers have noted that Mr. Kennedy has only recently evolved from the \u201csolidly liberal\u201d wing of his party to the \u201cYou know, that Castro guy was onto something\u201d base. In the world of Massachusetts politics that makes JK3 the moderate.\n\nSome Bay State lefties have figured this out. The Green New Deal activist group Sunshine Movement has endorsed Mr. Markey, and the Boston Globe has broken with 50 years of post-Chappaquiddick fealty and published pieces critical of Mr. Kennedy. The Globe even ran a column mocking JK3 as \u201cYoung Prince Joseph III\u201d who \u201cbought his House seat.\u201d\n\nWhen the Boston Globe decides to go full Fox News on Ted Kennedy\u2019s nephew, you know their world\u2019s gone haywire.\n\nMr. Markey has the endorsement of the elected establishment in Massachusetts, including Ms. Warren. But instead of bolstering his re-election bid, this has the perverse impact of making JK3 both the \u201cpolitical scion\u201d and \u201canti-establishment\u201d rebel in the race.\n\nIn the AOC era, how can he possibly lose?\n\n\u2022 Michael Graham is politics editor of InsideSources.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
