Mattis laughs off Trump barb at charity gala", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis is laughing off an insult hurled at him by President Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking at a New York charity event Thursday the day after Trump demeaned him as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d Mattis joked that he took it as a compliment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just an overrated general. I\u2019m the greatest, the world\u2019s most overrated,\u201d he told diners at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d\n\nTrump lashed out at his former defense secretary Wednesday, during a contentious White House meeting with members of Congress.\n\nThe meeting was intended to be a bipartisan discussion of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. forces from northern Syria, but it broke up after a testy exchange between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBefore the walkout, Trump disparaged Mattis, who had argued as defense secretary that U.S. troops were needed in Syria to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State fighters.\n\nTrump said Mattis was \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general. You know why? He wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI captured ISIS,\u201d Trump went on to say.\n\nMattis resigned as defense secretary last December after Trump said he intended to pull 2,000 American troops out of Syria. In his resignation letter, the retired Marine general told Trump he had \u201cthe right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\u201d\n\nSince then, he has largely refrained from criticizing the administration publicly, saying he owed the commander in chief \u201ca duty of silence.\u201d\n\nBut he did save a zinger for Trump at the laughter-filled gala, saying the \u201coverrated\u201d moniker didn\u2019t bother him.\n\n\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield \u2026 and Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis joked.\n\nOn a serious note, Mattis alluded to Trump\u2019s decision to have U.S. troops stand down in Syria, clearing the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against Kurdish forces who had been U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State group. On Thursday, the U.S. and Turkey agreed to a five-day cease-fire that requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate, largely solidifying Turkey\u2019s position in the region.\n\n\u201cWe owe a debt to all who fought for liberty, including those who tonight serve in the far corners of our planet, among them the American men and women supporting our Kurdish allies,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nThe annual roast draws luminaries from finance and politics. Hosted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, the benefit is named after a former New York governor who was the first Catholic to receive a major party nomination for president when he unsuccessfully ran in 1928.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis is laughing off an insult hurled at him by President Donald Trump.
