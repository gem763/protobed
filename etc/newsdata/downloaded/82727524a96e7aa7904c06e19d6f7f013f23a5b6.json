To our left was a huge, flat area, covered in olive trees and scrub bushes. Where it ended, the earth transformed sharply into forested mountains.\n\n\u201cThe city of Tenea covered this whole place,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s above sea level and there\u2019s a cool breeze, so the summer palace would probably have been built here.\u201d She pointed to a traditional restaurant tucked under a distinctive, almost square-shaped hill. \u201cAnd this taverna is built under a watermill,\u201d she said.\n\nKorka is one of the country\u2019s top archaeologists. A Greek American, she recently made the biggest discovery of her 40-year career. The lost city of Tenea, which is mentioned in multiple Greek myths and historical texts, such as the ancient legend of Oedipus, the mythical king of Thebes who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother, was uncovered by her and her team last October, buried under the fields we\u2019re now driving past.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A hidden world under an Italian sewer\n\n\u2022 The temples that had to be moved\n\n\u2022 The key to the origin of the Americas?\n\nAccording to myth, the city was founded by the Trojans sometime around 1100BC and built by prisoners of war. They chose this spot because it was on the road between Corinth and the ancient settlement of Mycenae. Oedipus was said to have been raised here after being sent away as a baby. And it was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the ancient region of Corinthia in the northern Peloponnese. Until now, however, no-one could work out exactly where it was \u2013 or why it disappeared.\n\nThe search for Tenea began in 1984. Korka was just five years into her career when she received a call from some local villagers digging a water channel. They had hit an ancient sarcophagus and broken it in half. Korka went to look. \u201cThe minute I saw it, I understood it was something unique,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, a find connects with someone. It\u2019s almost spiritual.\u201d The vase-shaped coffin had delicate paintings of lions on the interior and contained a skeleton and offerings to the deceased. \u201cWe don\u2019t have another one with drawings like that,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe also do not know what ancient paintings looked like\u2026 We have no other sample from the Archaic period.\u201d\n\nThe minute I saw it, I understood it was something unique\n\nKorka knew Tenea was thought to be in the area, based on ancient historians\u2019 writings, which stated it was somewhere between Corinth and Mycenae. But her young age, inexperience and a lack of further evidence made it impossible for her to get a licence for excavation. \u201cI did not have the confidence or ability to argue why this was so important \u2013 it was more intuition-lead,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, illicit antiquities smugglers had known about the site for years, and would often pay local farmers for vases and coins they came across. In 2010, Korka worked alongside the police and informants to intercept the illegal sale of two statues that had been looted nearby. \u201cThe statues proved Tenea was a very prominent city with high levels of art,\u201d she said. She finally obtained permission to dig in the area, and in 2013 the excavation began.\n\nWe stopped in the nearby village of Chiliomodi for coffee and pastries. The oldest houses here were built here around 200 years ago, and Korka explained that many of them used ancient rocks, likely from Tenea ruins, that were lying around. The local church has a carving of the Ancient Greek god of winemaking and theatre, Dionysus, embedded in the wall. \u201cWe think it was part of an ancient theatre, which we\u2019re still searching for,\u201d she said.\n\nChiliomodi is a peaceful, pretty place, largely untouched by tourism. The discovery of the ancient city nearby has brought energy and excitement to the community. In the bakery I noticed bottles of local olive oil named \u201cTenea\u201d, and there\u2019s a shop of the same name due to open nearby.\n\nKorka and her colleagues Konstantinos Lagos and Antonio Corso, who were driving with us, told me that the project didn\u2019t go exactly to plan to start with. \u201cWe had a small team and very little funding,\u201d they said.\n\nA geophysical survey of the area was carried out by a third party using technology. But when they started to dig, they found nothing \u2013 the shapes seen during the survey had been created by the limestone soil. \u201cSo we went back to where the first sarcophagus was found,\u201d she said. \u201cNearby we found about 40 others\u2026 they just kept coming out of the ground one after the other. It was like [the folk tale of] Ali Baba.\u201d\n\nNext, they discovered part of an ancient road, which lead the team to a Roman mausoleum from around 100BC in which several generations of a family were buried, plus a cistern that would have been used for rituals and sacrifices: \u201cWe knew this was outside of the city, so we decided to dig north instead.\u201d Last October, houses were discovered, and the team realised they had finally found the city itself. \u201cMost of the surface level findings had already been taken by looters,\u201d Lagos said. \u201cBut most of the actual city is 2m or 3m below ground.\u201d\n\nHow to visit Tenea The team is open to guiding visitors and organising educational events while the dig takes place in September and October. You can communicate with them through the Tenea Prjct Facebook account.\n\nWe stopped at a house in Chiliomodi that is being used as the conservation centre. The team excavates during September and October and spends the rest of year analysing artefacts and studying historical texts. Lagos told me that a huge number of coins have been found on the site, proving Tenea was a very wealthy place. \u201cWe\u2019ve found around 200 \u2013 you normally only get these kinds of numbers after many years of excavations,\u201d he said. He showed me gold leaf imitation coins that would have been buried with the deceased as a gift for the boatman in the underworld. \u201cMost people [at the time] were buried with pennies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in Tenea they used gold.\u201d\n\nOther finds include exquisitely painted vases, engraved lanterns and metal tools used by athletes (to scrape off the oil they cleansed their bodies with), leading the team to believe there is a stadium they have yet to find.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything in Tenea is unique,\u201d Korka said.\n\nThis backs up what the team knew about the society from historical texts: \u201cThe people here were different \u2013 they were Trojans. They had their own identity,\u201d said Korka. As well as being from a different place \u2013 the city of Troy was located in what is now Turkey, around 600km \u2013 the finds so far show they used different styles of ceramics and had different burial tradition to those living in nearby Corinth and Mycanae, such as placing the coin on the chest rather than in the mouth, as was common elsewhere in Ancient Greece.\n\nBut one of the biggest mysteries surrounding Tenea is why it disappeared. Most other major ancient Greek cities, such as Sparta, Athens and Corinth, remain inhabited to this day. It was unusual for a city as large as Tenea \u2013 there were probably around 100,000 inhabitants \u2013 to be completely abandoned, and no historical texts give a clue as to why.\n\nWe headed back to the car and drove up towards the mountains, as Lagos began to explain the team\u2019s theory. \u201cWe know Alaric, who was king of the Visigoths, raided Greece in 397AD,\u201d he said. Historians believe he destroyed cities partly to gain wealth, but also to spread Christianity. \u201cWe discovered a coin that was issued by Alaric\u2019s people. We also found a house that had been destroyed by a cannonball from around that year.\u201d\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story for Tenea. \u201cWe have found evidence of inhabitation from 200 years later, but it appears Tenea had lost a lot of its wealth,\u201d he continued, explaining that the finds from this period were not as grand or valuable as the earlier ones. \u201cBut after that, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nThe car climbed up a winding road, giving us spectacular views over the mountains and the plain under which Tenea rests. We stopped at a beautiful, crumbling Byzantine-era monastery. \u201cWe know the Slavs invaded this area around that time. We believe the people of Tenea abandoned the city and fled to these hills here,\u201d he said, gesturing around us. The Slavic tribes are known to have raided the area and violently clashed with local communities, so it seems Tenea\u2019s residents judged the hills to be safer. There were many streams around the city, and with no-one to attend to them they covered the city in silt, which eventually turned to earth and covered the city.\n\nIt\u2019s like an iceberg and we\u2019re just hitting the tip\n\nTenea\u2019s discovery has answered many mysteries already, such as where the city was located and perhaps why it was abandoned. But for the team, the most exciting thing is what it still may hold. They are expecting to find more houses, temples, a theatre and a marketplace \u2013 known in Ancient Greek as an agora \u2013 over the coming years. \u201cIt\u2019s like an iceberg and we\u2019re just hitting the tip,\u201d Lagos said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep giving interesting findings for the next 100 years.\u201d\n\nUnearthed is a BBC Travel series that searches the world for newly discovered archaeological wonders that few people have ever seen.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
