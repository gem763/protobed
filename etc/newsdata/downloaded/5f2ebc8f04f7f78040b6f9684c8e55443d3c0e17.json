A total of 346 people were killed in the crashes, resulting in a worldwide grounding of the Max.\n\nThe report, which is slated to officially be released on Friday, found that the MCAS was not evaluated as a \u201ccomplete and integrated function\u201d and that the certification process also suffered from the \u201clack of a unified top-down development and evaluation of the system function and its safety analyses, combined with the extensive and fragmented documentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith adequate FAA engagement and oversight, the extent of delegation does not in itself compromise safety,\u201d states the report, which is scheduled to be released officially later today (Oct. 11). \u201cHowever, in the B737 MAX program, the FAA had inadequate awareness of the MCAS function which, coupled with limited involvement, resulted in an inability of the FAA to provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of the Boeing-proposed certification activities associated with MCAS.\u201d\n\nThe report also questioned the limited number of workers at the FAA who were overseeing certification tasks, noting there were an \u201cinadequate number of FAA specialists\u201d involved in the certification of the Max jetliner. Additionally, the report found evidence of \u201cundue pressure\u201d on employees, possibly \u201cattributed to conflicting priorities and an environment that does not support FAA requirements.\u201d\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BA BOEING COMPANY 375.60 +4.60 +1.24%\n\nThe world\u2019s largest aerospace company is currently facing multiple lawsuits for both crashes, including a lawsuit that alleges Boeing concealed problems and refused to ground the plane on its own.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The report also questioned the limited number of workers at the FAA who were overseeing certification tasks.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/Boeing2073720MAX20RTR20FBN-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
