The report details extreme proposals by Trump \u2014 including shutting down the entire U.S.-Mexico border within a matter of hours \u2014 at the height of the immigration crisis this spring.\n\n\u201cPrivately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\u201d Adaptation from \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration\u201d\n\nThe report, which the Times said was based on interviews with more than a dozen Trump administration officials who had direct knowledge of the events, also detailed how then-Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen was pushed out of her position and how Trump\u2019s senior adviser Stephen Miller maneuvered to clean house at Homeland Security, replacing officials who objected to Trump\u2019s demands with more loyal hard-liners.\n\n\u201cLou Dobbs hates you, Ann Coulter hates you, you\u2019re making me look bad,\u201d Trump reportedly told Nielsen last spring.\n\n\u201cThe happiest he had been with Ms. Nielsen was a few months earlier, when American border agents had fired tear gas into Mexico to try to stop migrants from crossing into the United States. Human rights organizations condemned the move, but Mr. Trump loved it. More often, though, she drew the president\u2019s scorn,\u201d the report said.\n\nWhen told in March of the impracticalities of suddenly closing the entire border, Trump reportedly suggested tariffs instead \u2014 or at least the threat of tariffs \u2014 to force Mexico to help stem immigration.\n\nAfter months of Nielsen\u2019s objections to Trump\u2019s immigration demands, which frustrated the president, the last straw was reportedly when she told Trump in April it was impossible to build a cement wall along the entire border, as he had called for. Trump reportedly said it was time to make a change and that she should go, telling her he would wait a week to announce her resignation. He tweeted the news by that evening, the report said.\n\nThat opened the door to wholesale changes in Homeland Security\u2019s leadership, with more Trump loyalists taking control. In a separate report Tuesday, the Washington Post reported acting Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan \u2014 who took over for Nielsen \u2014 has been isolated within the administration and said he\u2019s been overshadowed by officials aiming to use the agency to enact a partisan immigration agenda.", "description": "President Donald Trump suggested to his advisers earlier this year that soldiers should shoot migrants in the legs, and that the border wall should be...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS445_trumpw_ZG_20191001193434.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
