They were shocked when they noticed an extra charge for $160 from the satellite broadcast service.\n\n\"Everything was fine until we went to disconnect and that's when all the surprises happened,\" Albright's son-in-law, John Manrique, told KGO.\n\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAlthough Albright had been using DirecTV for many years, her family had recently added an extra cable box to place in a back room when they or other caregivers came to stay. Unbeknownst to them, this addition sparked a new two-year agreement, but when asked for proof that they'd agreed to a new contract, DirecTV couldn't come up with it, Manrique said.\n\n\"Every time you hiccup they start you on a new two-year agreement basically,\" he said. \"It'll run the rest of your life if you accept some other feature or other. They got you.''\n\nIn addition, DirecTV informed the family that they would still have to pay the fee -- despite Albright's death -- because the account had been transferred to her daughter's name, Manrique said. However, the family only did so because Albright was no longer able to pay her own bills, he said.\n\nSoon after KGO's \"7 On Your Side\" team contacted DirecTV, the family received a letter of apology from AT&T, the parent company of DirecTV, which agreed to waive the early termination fee.\n\nAT&T did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.", "description": "A California family grieving over the loss of their 102-year-old matriarch was further distraught when they found out that DirecTV had charged an early termination fee.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/directv-gty-er-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
