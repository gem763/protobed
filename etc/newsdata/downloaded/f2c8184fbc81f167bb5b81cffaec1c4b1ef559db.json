It was a sequential collapse,\" Dr Zerbini told BBC News.\n\n\"Finally, they went after minke whales, the smallest of the great whales, before the moratorium was introduced in the 1980s.\"\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption There are seven distinct Southern Hemisphere populations\n\nEstimates of population size depend on a range of data and accounting techniques.\n\nPretty good records were kept by the whaling industry itself, so there is some confidence in describing the humpbacks' status at the outset of commercial exploitation and the dire predicament in which the animals subsequently found themselves.\n\nDocumenting the return to healthy numbers is, broadly speaking, a mix of observation - surveys from ships and planes off Brazil - and modelling.\n\nHumpbacks were protected from the 1960s, and even though there was some illegal Soviet whaling at that time, the whales' recovery would likely have been well under way by the beginning of the 1970s.\n\n\"But we didn't really measure anything until the 1980s and it wasn't until we did the first proper assessment at the start of the 2000s that we realised just how well they were recovering,\" Dr Zerbini said.\n\nAt a species and at a global level, humpbacks are listed as being of \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. But there is still quite some uncertainty about the precise status of all the different sub-populations.\n\nThere is also the question of how the increased numbers in this southwest Atlantic group will play into ecosystem dynamics.\n\nThe humpbacks will be consuming a few million tonnes of krill a year, and it's not yet known how likely this is to limit the abundance of the food resource to other predators.\n\nSouth Georgia, for example, is home to huge colonies of penguins and fur seals, all of which predate on the tiny crustaceans.\n\nThere's evidence also the krill themselves are restricting their range, retreating poleward as the oceans warm.\n\n\"There has been a southward shift in krill in the south Atlantic and what that might mean for whales is that they may have to travel further south to find optimum feeding grounds,\" co-author Dr Jennifer Jackson from the British Antarctic Survey told BBC News. \"And, potentially of course, a reduction in krill is going to affect the number of whales that can be supported by the habitat.\"\n\nThe latest population assessment is published in the Royal Society journal Open Science.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Today, South Georgia is a wildlife oasis and these animals all eat krill\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "description": "The population first ravaged by commercial whalers in the 1900s is almost back to where it was.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r2r7l.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
