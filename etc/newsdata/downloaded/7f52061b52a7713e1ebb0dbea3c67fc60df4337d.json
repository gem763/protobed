Many in the center of the capital saw his death through the prism of their difficult daily lives \u2014 not through the lens of history that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fellow African leaders emphasized.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad that Mugabe has died with the economy,\u201d said Agnes Humure, 37, a shopkeeper rushing to work in Harare\u2019s central business district. \u201cI personally don\u2019t know who is going to wake it up.\u201d", "description": "As Zimbabweans learned of the death of their former leader, who held the country in his grip for decades after its independence, the reaction was muted.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Moyo", "Norimitsu Onishi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/world/06mugabe-reaction4/06mugabe-reaction4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
