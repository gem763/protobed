She\u201bs motivated many, many students.\"\n\nCross said the growing environmental movement aligns with what she was taught as a youngster growing up in the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, on Montreal's South Shore: don't waste anything.\n\nHer sign reads: \"Save our mother.\"\n\nFree public transit\n\nThe protest in Montreal begins at noon ET at the foot of Mount Royal on Parc Avenue.\n\nMany Montreal businesses, as well as unions and community organizations, are also closing for the day so their employees can attend the demonstration.\n\nMontreal police advise the public not to drive downtown Friday, as traffic will be congested between Berri and Peel streets, from the Old Port to St-Joseph Boulevard. Public transit is free all day. (CBC )\n\nPolice have warned downtown Montreal will be difficult to navigate, and Montreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante announced public transit will be free all day.\n\nPlante estimates the protest could draw upwards of 300,000 people.\n\nCulmination of yearlong series of strikes\n\nMarches are planned elsewhere in Canada on Friday, including in Vancouver and Toronto.\n\nBen Clarkson, a spokesperson for La Plan\u00e8te s'invite au Parlement, said the gathering in Montreal is the culmination of a yearlong series of climate strikes, which began in August 2018. La Plan\u00e8te is one of the groups organizing Friday's climate march whose name translates as \"the planet goes to Parliament.\"\n\nMore than 150 countries have since participated in the #FridaysForFuture movement, launched by Thunberg.\n\nClarkson said Montreal's protest movement is particularly powerful, and he's hopeful it will lead, ultimately, to significant change.\n\nWe have a history of popular mobilization that the rest of Canada and maybe the rest of North America doesn't have here in Montreal. - Ben Clarkson, La Plan\u00e8te s'invite au Parlement spokesperson\n\n\"We have a history of popular mobilization that the rest of Canada and maybe the rest of North America doesn't have here in Montreal,\" he said. \"That's been able to turn into and form into a very effective organizational group that has really grabbed onto this one day.\"\n\nDawson College student Kailey D'Elia shows off the sign she'll carry at Friday's march.
