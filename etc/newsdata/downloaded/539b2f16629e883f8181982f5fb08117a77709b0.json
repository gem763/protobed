The former vice-president is a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest.\n\nIn the ABC News interview that aired Tuesday, Hunter Biden conceded he may have made a mistake \"in the grand scheme of things\" for failing to see the political repercussions for his father. But he added, \"Did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\"\n\nHunter Biden also acknowledged that he likely would not have been named to the board of a foreign company if his last name weren't Biden.\n\n\"I don't think there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden.\"\n\nTrump and Republicans have targeted Hunter Biden for his work in Ukraine and China, alleging corruption.\n\nIn a July 25 phone call, Trump pressured Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. That phone call is the focus of a whistleblower complaint that triggered the formal House impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nHunter Biden, who served on that Ukraine board between 2014 and 2018, said he never discussed his business dealings with his father.\n\nHis interview aired hours before the former vice-president and other Democratic presidential candidates were set to appear at their fourth debate Tuesday night in Ohio.\n\n'I gave a hook to some very unethical people'\n\nHunter Biden, who recently said he would step down from the board of directors of a Chinese-backed private equity firm, blamed his father's political opponents for creating a firestorm over his work.\n\n\"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,\" he said. \"So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\"\n\nHe added: \"What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani\" \u2014 Trump's personal lawyer \u2014 \"and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea.\"\n\nTrump has denied doing anything wrong and has defended his phone call with Ukraine's president, calling it \"perfect\" and \"beautiful.\"", "description": "Hunter Biden is rejecting assertions he did anything wrong in engaging in foreign work in Ukraine and China.
