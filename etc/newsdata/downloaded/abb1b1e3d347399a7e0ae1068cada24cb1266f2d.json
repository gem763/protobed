He has since been living in another East African country.", "description": "A South African court has ordered the release of an Air Tanzania jet after it was impounded over a farmer's $33-million compensation claim, Tanzania's government says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8855/9d9a1eb966aa48a49a01b7b005904089.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
