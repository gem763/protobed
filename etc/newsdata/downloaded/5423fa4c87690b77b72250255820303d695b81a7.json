as well as complicating paperwork and logistics, it would also add tariffs of 10 per cent for cars and 4.5 per cent for parts.'\n\nThe Japanese company also recently announced it would be cutting 12,500 jobs worldwide by 2022 , though just 90 of these are believed to be Sunderland based", "description": "Nissan will reportedly reconsider its decision to build the next-gen Qashqai at its Sunderland car plant if Britain opts to leave the EU without a deal.
