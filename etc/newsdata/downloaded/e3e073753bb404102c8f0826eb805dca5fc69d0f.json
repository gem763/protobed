Currently exhibiting \"Form & Function: Shoe Art by Chris Francis,\" at The SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film in Atlanta, he has created hundreds of handcrafted shoes in many strange and interesting forms. This includes couch-heels, Facebook-heels, and Bauhaus inspired heels, which he says are all completely wearable.\n\n\u201cThe shoes on display at SCAD FASH are technically all are wearable. Art is a way for me to relax and explore new ideas that likely won\u2019t make sense on the store shelves,\u201d Francis says. \u201cSometimes I won\u2019t exhibit a piece if it is too wearable or too much like a store product.\u201d Most of the shoes are his fianc\u00e9\u2019s size, he explains, as she likes to \u201ctest them out.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in a small Indiana factory town, he spent his youth playing in abandoned steel mills and auto factories and has an obsession with punk that stems from a childhood of \u201cthrash metal, garage bands, and skateboard ramps\u201d. Experimenting with glass, concrete, metal and plastic, Francis has had metal poisoning twice and concrete poisoning once from creating the extreme shoes.\n\nImage courtesy of SCAD.\n\nNow 43 years old, Francis views his Los Angeles garage workspace as a place where punk is still alive. After making his first shoe in his kitchen, his bespoke creations have now been worn by rock legends like M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s Mick Mars, Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, and former Runaways guitarist Lita Ford. i-D sat down with Francis at SCAD FASH to learn more about these beautifully crafted punk-inspired creations.\n\nHave you always been creative?\n\nYes, since as far back as myself or anyone in my family can remember. My drawings were outside the norm as a child and I had great attention to detail. I became very fixated on painting in middle school after falling from a roof, subsequently causing head injury. I was completely paralyzed and blind for what seemed like a half hour after the fall. My head swelled and from that point on I was extremely creative.\n\nWhat did you do before you made shoes?\n\nI wore many hats. I was a finish carpenter in Hollywood building bars on the Sunset Strip. I built recording studios where I met many musicians. I hung off high-rise buildings as a rope access installer for giant super graphics. That moment was when I decided to pursue art. While hanging outside the 73rd floor and looking down at hawks flying beneath me, I realized the danger of the profession and thought that art was a far better investment towards my future. When I returned to Los Angeles, I began making leather jackets in my kitchen.\n\nImage courtesy of SCAD.\n\nThe first shoe you made was also made in your kitchen. Can you tell me about that?\n\nI had been making leather jackets and handbags for about a year and was invited to a Louis Vuitton party where a bespoke shoe-maker from France was hand-stitching shoe soles in front of guests. I was so inspired that I attempted to make a shoe in my kitchen the next day and somehow managed to make a wearable pair of platform boots by the end of that week.\n\nYou've created such a collection. Do you have any favorites?\n\nI\u2019ve got lots of favorites for all kinds of reasons. \"Shoe Machine,\" inspired by Russian Constructivism, became a marquee part of this exhibition. Even though it didn\u2019t look like any known shoe of mine\u2014it wasn\u2019t understood\u2014I really believed in its potential and thought it had power both graphically and imaginatively to set the stage for the entire exhibition. \"Audacity of Huge\" is also a favorite because it launched the Brutalism collection and a new realm of sculptural thought for me. Although made to last and possessing the ability to support human weight, \"Audacity of Huge\" is not very wearable by a conventional definition. Yet, the shoe doesn\u2019t need to be worn.\n\nTell me about the shoe that gave you lead poisoning?\n\nI was working on a shoe called \"Hard Cuts\" which required an Oxy-Acetylene torch for the brazing of the metal. I traded a pair of shoes for the torch and with only a brief tutorial on how to use it, I began bronze brazing the hard-cut concrete nails together without wearing a respirator. I inhaled the fumes of burning Zinc and Cadmium for several days, which led to bone crippling pain. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t complete the pair.\n\nWhat's your process for coming up with new ideas?\n\nLiving life and paying attention to the world around me is the best inspiration I\u2019ve found for new ideas. I\u2019ve chosen shoes as my main expressive medium so it helps me stay focused. Art has no limits, and I think that can be overwhelming. Too much freedom can almost serve as a prison, but by staying fixated on one form, it helps me focus my energy efficiently and stay very productive.\n\nWhere are the shoes made now? In your kitchen?\n\nI got thrown out of the kitchen a long time ago. My studio is operated from a house in Los Angeles that has a designated room for every part of the process. It\u2019s very much like the punk houses I used to hang out in as a kid. These places were very creative with music happening in the garage, skateboard ramps in the back yard, ideas all around. My workspace makes me feel like punk is still alive, at least in one small place in the world.\n\nWhat shoes are you interested in creating right now?\n\nMy future plans are not limited to shoes; I plan to create handbag collections as well as revisit clothing design. I\u2019ve taken shoes both as art pieces and as wearable accessories unusually far and with no restriction of creative ability; I intend to expand the concept of the entire house to include forms outside of just footwear. I\u2019m very open-minded. If retail makes the most sense for the delivery of an idea, I\u2019ll cross that bridge and artistically approach retail. Right now though, it\u2019s mostly museums and galleries that are my arenas, so art pieces make the most sense.", "description": "Chris Francis grew up on thrash metal and now makes bespoke heels for rockstars, artists, and the sartorially adventurous.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da091e505193d0009ba486a/lede/1570809233690-Screen-Shot-2019-10-11-at-114654-copy.jpeg?crop=0.9753xw:0.9988xh;0.016xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
