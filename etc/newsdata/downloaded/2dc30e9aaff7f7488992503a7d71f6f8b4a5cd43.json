But 45 per cent said they have hired a private tutor, or would consider consulting one for themselves, so that they could help with after-school work.\n\nMany parents admit they have watched YouTube videos, with two-thirds of the 1,600 parents surveyed saying it helped them get to grips with what their children were supposed to be learning.\n\nA poll reveals that 82 per cent of parents with youngsters at secondary school struggle. Physics, maths and chemistry were proved to be the most baffling\n\nAnd more than a quarter said they would consider hiring a tutor for their child, though most said they would enlist extra help \u2018only if they are really struggling\u2019. Physics was voted the hardest subject, with 81 per cent of parents struggling, followed by maths (55 per cent) and chemistry (43 per cent). The easiest subjects were history, geography and religious education.\n\nLast month, the Sutton Trust revealed that 27 per cent of secondary-school children have had private tuition, while nearly a quarter of teachers have taken on private tuition outside school in the past two years.\n\nAnd last year Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker called homework \u2018a waste of time\u2019, claiming it \u2018brings stress to the home, stress to the child, stress to the parents and stress to the parent-child relationship\u2019.\n\nBut the poll by The Knowledge Academy revealed that only 11 per cent of parents agreed, with 89 per cent supporting homework in some or all subjects. However, one common complaint by parents to emerge was frequent changes to the curriculum.\n\nNearly two-thirds have encouraged their child to ask someone else for help or to figure it out for themselves\n\nAlex Dyer, founder of Tutor House, said: \u2018There are a number of reasons why parents find it difficult to help their kids with homework. Communication between schools and parents is often minimal, so they worry about teaching their child the wrong thing, and in a world of distracting stimuli, getting children engaged and focused on homework can be a problem.\n\n\u2018There is also the issue of what the children are learning, and a parent\u2019s ability to keep up with it. Subject matter and methodologies are constantly changing, so they\u2019re always going to be unfamiliar with them.\u2019", "description": "Poll reveals 82 per cent of parents with secondary school-age children struggle.
