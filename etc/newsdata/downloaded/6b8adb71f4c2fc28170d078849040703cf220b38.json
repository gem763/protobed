But they\u2019re not. And we know why. Because the people involved are disproportionately from poor and working-class families.\n\nAs someone said to me the other day, if there was a train crash and 100 people were to tragically die, there would be an immediate government inquiry.\n\nBut in the capital alone around 70 people have been stabbed to death this year and I can\u2019t see anything being done to stop things getting worse.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nDaily Mirror news\n\nThe problems are well known \u2013 poverty, drug gangs, a climate of fear, but what are the solutions?\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel\u2019s headline- grabbing solution is to put more people in prison. But that doesn\u2019t tackle the root of the problem.\n\nThe Health \u00adFoundation, an independent charity, has a far more sensible suggestion. It\u2019s calling on schools to focus on children\u2019s wellbeing and teaching young people to be happy.\n\nJo Bibby, the charity\u2019s director of health, said more time should be devoted to lessons in art, drama and even yoga.\n\nYears ago I would have been sceptical about teaching \u00adchildren to chant \u2018Om Shanti\u2019 and how to do the downward dog. But she could be on to something.\n\nOK, maybe not about the chanting \u2013 I\u2019d suggest cooking and more music classes. But with \u00adchildren going to school feeling unsafe, with the trauma of knowing someone in your school or local area has been killed or even the increased pressure to do well in exams, schools should be focusing more on pupils\u2019 mental wellbeing and giving them creative outlets.\n\nThis should be backed by \u00adgovernment support and money and go hand in hand with policies designed to make our streets safe and schools places where children go to learn. Right now youth society feels like a ticking time-bomb when all we want is our kids going to school checking for keys and books, not whether they have knives on them.", "description": "A four-year-old, the same age as my son, has been caught with an unnamed weapon.
