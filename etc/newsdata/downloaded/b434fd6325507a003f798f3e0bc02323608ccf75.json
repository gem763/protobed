Agholor responded by inviting the man to the Eagles\u2019 next home game.\n\nAgholor was ripped again by fans and a former Eagles player on Sunday night after he appeared to not make an effort for a deep ball in the fourth quarter, a likely touchdown that would have pulled the Eagles closer at 30-17 with 11 minutes left in the game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u2018You wouldn\u2019t even dive for that football?\u2019\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles receiver Nelson Agholor is under fire again after a play Sunday night.

Deep down inside, there's either some pitbull, some dog in you or there ain't. There's nothing but puppy in him. When I saw him not lay out for that ball, could it have been a better ball, absolutely, but not to see the effort. One thing that doesn't cost you anything is effort. You're going to go up to the window tomorrow and pick up your paycheck and you put that effort out. You wouldn't even dive for that football in a game that mattered?\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one. Search \u201cAgholor\u201d on Twitter ... it\u2019s not pretty.\n\n\u2018The ball was out of position\u2019\n\nFor his part, Agholor said after the game that the ball was \u201cout of position,\u201d and indicated that perhaps Carson Wentz didn\u2019t place it properly.\n\n\u201cI tried to get open,\u201d Agholor said. \u201cI was hauling tail, make a move on the safety, use the space that I had to run across the field, and I was running and by the time I was trying to track it, the ball was already out of position. I wish I was able to get there, but I don't know what happened. \u2026 I don't know if he was rushed or whatever, but we had enough field and I was trying to get there.\u201d\n\nWentz was pressured on the play, and there were at least some on Twitter who said the pass was overthrown.\n\nBut the visual of Agholor not laying out for the ball or doing something to at least make the catch, even if it wasn\u2019t for a touchdown, is what critics are responding to.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Agholor is under fire again, this time for perceived lack of effort.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W6GHr5g33fZWvfv6oq6HXw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X3J1p8kiZsLB4pZHSK_k.g--~B/aD0zNDQyO3c9NTEyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6f59afb0-f415-11e9-9b8f-bf894dcacf30", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
