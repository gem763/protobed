It also issued an executive order allowing states or \u201clocal governments\u201d to ban refugee resettlement.\n\nTrump\u2019s war on refugees is tearing down US's life-changing resettlement program Read more\n\nIn practice, experts warned, not only will fewer people be able to enter the US than ever before, but these decisions will pull apart the infrastructure that supports refugees when they arrive in the US. Families will therefore struggle to stay together.\n\nJen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy at Church World Services, said the move was \u201ctantamount to destroying the program\u201d.\n\nAdvocates are especially concerned about 8,000 refugees who have been approved for travel to the US and may now have their journeys delayed or cancelled.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the United States becoming a bad actor when it comes to refugee protection,\u201d Smyers said. \u201cThis is the United States saying \u2013 during a time when the world is facing the largest displacement crisis in history \u2013 the US is going to roll up its mat and go home. It\u2019s really astounding\u201d\n\nSenior US officials said on a call with reporters the cap was set so low because the administration is struggling to respond to the number of people seeking asylum at the southern border. In fact, the asylum program is distinct from the refugee program.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, with the justice department, oversees asylum applications. The state department oversees refugee resettlement. Both work with other agencies, including each other.\n\nSmyers said the White House claim was a \u201cbold-face lie\u201d.\n\n\u2018The US allowed me to send my kids safely to school\u2019\n\nSince the refugee system was formalized in 1980, the US has on average set an admission ceiling of 95,000 a year \u2013 though it often falls short of that cap. Even after 9/11, the US admitted about 27,100 refugees in 2002 and 28,000 in 2003.\n\nRefugee resettlement is a slow process that involves the most intense scrutiny of any form of US immigration. On taking office, Donald Trump ordered a review of the vetting system, which the administration has since deemed secure.\n\nTrump's plan for those seeking safe haven: a ticket to the violent heart of Central America Read more\n\nBasma Alawee resettled in Orlando, Florida, in 2010, with her husband and young daughter. They had lived in Iraq through several wars but her husband\u2019s work as a translator for the US military put their lives in danger.\n\nAlawee said the new refugee cap was lower than she expected and she was worried for families waiting to be reunited with relatives.\n\n\u201cI really love this country because this country allowed me to practice my freedom, to speak freely, to practice my religion,\u201d Alawee said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to have a home and send my kids safely to school and I want to see other people enjoying that too.\u201d\n\nAlawee, who trained as a chemical engineer, worked as a teacher in the US and became an activist after Trump implemented his travel ban on certain Muslim-majority nations. She is now the director of the We Are All America campaign in Florida, advocating for refugee rights, and the Florida delegate for the Refugee Congress.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A young migrant from Honduras waits at the Mexico-United States border crossing in Tijuana.

Last year, it admitted 502 from those countries, according to state figures.\n\nThere are 5,000 slots reserved for people fleeing religious persecution, though it is not clear how that determination is made. There are 4,000 spots for Iraqis who helped the US. At the end of July, more than 100,000 had applied, according to Reuters. The final 7,500 spots are for everyone else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned people interviewed and who are able to get on a plane right away will not be able to come based on these numbers,\u201d said Jennifer Sime, the senior vice-president of US programs at the International Rescue Committee (IRC).\n\n\u2018We used to be a beacon of hope\u2019\n\nSime said that along with the lower ceiling, it will be harder for families to reunite if the order to allow states and \u201clocal governments\u201d to ban refugees survives anticipated legal challenges.\n\nReunification has become more difficult because of the shrinking number of resettlement agency offices, which help refugees on things such as how to buy a home, find language courses or get a job.\n\nMore than 100 offices have closed down, according to Refugee Council USA, because there are too few people to process. More are expected to close.\n\nWhen refugees flee their homes, family members often lose touch, putting their refugee applications on different timelines.\n\nIf a mother and child have arrived in Maine, for instance, and it suddenly stops allowing refugees, reunification will be delayed as the family tries to travel to another state to file the father\u2019s application. The same could be true if Maine simply has to shut down resettlement agencies because not enough people are coming in.\n\nRefugees have often lost family members and may form close ties with uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents, but it is more difficult to get the government to prioritize reunification with such relatives. If parts of the country become islands for refugees, this will only get more complicated.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s sad is I don\u2019t think the US wants to be a world leader in refugee resettlement anymore,\u201d Sime said.\n\n\u201cWe used to be, and that used to be something people were proud of, that we were this beacon of hope and freedom for people who had been persecuted throughout the world, regardless of where they came from, and that is certainly not something this administration is interested in upholding.\u201d", "description": "Administration announced it would set a refugee cap of 18,000 people for the fiscal year, and allow states to ban resettlement", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8151fd82a4517f78864ce61e12c78d392ababea8/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43ee746c675019cf8d6d659cabd57db3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
