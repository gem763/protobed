It was a really good break.\u201d\n\nAfter his eagle attempt came up short, he tapped in a three-foot putt for a final-round 4-under 66 and a a 13-under 267 total - just ahead of two-time defending champion Scott McCarron.\n\n\u201cIt probably looked five, six feet and I was sure glad it went in,\u201d Short said. \u201cAll the hard work you put into this stupid game comes to the top.\u201d\n\nShort\u2019s final round included six birdies and two bogeys to give the 55-year-old golfer from Austin, Texas, just his second-ever PGA Tour Champions victory. His last one was also in Canada at the 2014 Quebec Championship.\n\n\u201cMaybe I need to move here,\u201d he joked.\n\nThe start of the final round of the three-day event was delayed by 30 minutes due to thick fog and golfers also had to battle chilly conditions at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club until it warmed up in the afternoon.\n\nMcCarron rolled in a 39-foot putt for eagle on the 18th hole to card a round of 5-under 65, which pulled him into a tie for the lead with Short and Tom Gillis at 12 under.\n\n\u201cIt was going a little faster than I wanted, kind of banged the stick and went in,\u201d McCarron said. \u201cJust to do that to have a chance was really cool, but I shouldn\u2019t have put myself in that position to begin with.\u201d\n\nThe Charles Schwab Cup points leader then watched as Short made his clutch birdie, while Gillis fell back into fourth at 10 under with a double bogey on the last hole.\n\n\u201cWes obviously got a great break on 18, hit the rocks in the hazard and bounced on the green and birdied it to win the tournament,\u201d said McCarron, who had bogeys on 16 and 17 before his eagle on the final hole. \u201cSometimes those things happen when you win. He got the good breaks and I made a few bad swings with poor timing, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nSecond-round leader Steve Flesch shot 69 to fall back into third at 11 under.\n\n\u201cI wanted to play aggressively and I drove it great and I ironed it okay on the front, but I just didn\u2019t make any putts today,\u201d Flesch said.\n\nJoe Durant, Billy Andrade and Tom Byrum finished in a tie for fifth at 9 under.\n\nCanadian Golf Hall of Fame member and former Calgary resident Stephen Ames had a 69 to finish in a tie for 29th with six others at 3 under.\n\n\u201cBesides freezing, it was really good,\u201d said Ames, who recently relocated from Vancouver to Turks and Caicos. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t play as often in the cold weather, I tend to struggle a little bit with it. That\u2019s always been my nemesis is cold weather.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wes Short Jr. took full advantage of a fortunate bounce.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/champions_tour_golf_87967_c0-275-4000-2607_s1770x1032.jpg?f339e8c6ca476808a09df96f7d7140a0a0426d67"}
