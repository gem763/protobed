So, who, exactly, is he?\n\nFor one, Allen was a confident child.\n\nKyle Allen was a big fan of Roger Staubach growing up. His dad knew him. Staubach sent him an autographed picture. \u201cAnd my cocky 10-year-old butt sent him a signed picture back.\u201d \u2014 Joe Person (@josephperson) September 18, 2019\n\nThat confidence was perhaps not misplaced. Allen was the nation\u2019s top-ranked quarterback in 2014 among top recruiting sites (ESPN, Rivals, Scout and 247Sports) following a career that saw him throw for more than 8,000 yards and 86 touchdowns at Desert Mountain High School.\n\nHe got an early taste of being teammates with Christian McCaffrey, playing alongside the running back in the 2014 Army All-American Bowl.\n\nHe would commit to Texas A&M, where he became teammates with Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray in 2015, and beat Murray out for the Aggies starting job. Allen led the team in passing and total offense that season, after earning Liberty Bowl MVP-honors the year before when he threw for 294 yards and four touchdowns against West Virginia.\n\nMurray took part in \u201cwildcat\u201d run packages and replaced Allen as the starter in late October of the 2015 season.\n\nBoth quarterbacks eventually departed, with Murray transferring to Oklahoma and Allen to Houston, where he played five games in 2017. Allen set the Cougars single-game completion percentage record when he went 31-of-33 (93.9 percent) passing against Rice.\n\nWhen Allen takes the field Sunday, he will become one of 20 quarterbacks age 26 or younger to start a Week 3 game, the most in a single week in the Super Bowl era, according to NFL Research. He will also become the 40th different quarterback to start a game this season, the most through the first three weeks of an NFL season, according to ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nAllen, an undrafted free agent in 2018, will be backed up by 2019 third-round pick Will Grier.\n\nThe timetable for Newton\u2019s return is uncertain but it\u2019s clear that Panthers offensive coordinator Norv Turner has held back on utilizing Newton as a running threat this season.\n\nThe 30-year-old former league MVP ran the ball at least 90 times in each of the first eight seasons of his career. This year, he\u2019s only run the ball five times for -2 yards through two games. Newton hasn\u2019t been effective through the air, either. He\u2019s only completed 56.2 percent of his passes for 572 yards, with no touchdowns and one interception.\n\nDespite the physical punishment Newton has taken over the years, he has only missed five games over his nine-year career. Sunday will mark his sixth.\n\nNewton battled a shoulder injury in 2018 and, with the team eliminated from playoff contention, the Panthers turned to their backup, Allen, to close out the season against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nAllen went 16-of-27 passing for 228 yards, two touchdowns and zero interceptions on the way to a 33-14 victory, snapping Carolina\u2019s seven-game losing streak.\n\nThe Panthers are hoping for a similar performance this Sunday.\n\nMore NFL:\n\nAntonio Brown released by New England Patriots amid NFL investigation\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nLamar Jackson is off to a historic start but he\u2019s a bad bet to win NFL MVP", "description": "Allen will face off against college teammate Kyler Murray on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.", "authors": ["Jake Russell", "Sports News Aide"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GMXCUQW3YUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
