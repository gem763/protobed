The first store, which opened in Montclair, California, had its headquarters in the store's backroom. Throughout the years, Hot Topic expanded its merchandise, introducing clothing and capitalizing on a growing market for anyone obsessed with anything.\n\nRead more: We shopped for groceries at Costco and Trader Joe's and easily saw which store is better for the average shopper\n\nThe company still maintains remnants from its early days as a sanctuary for the teen with a penchant for the dark. Though today, customer requests and analytical data-sifting tools help determine what merchandise is \"hot\" enough to sit on the shelves. The community that converges in stores represents an array of diverse passions, usually celebrating the atypical.\n\n\"To our customers, Hot Topic is more than a retailer,\" said Vranes. \"We represent community and self-expression.\"\n\nHere's the story of how the chain was able to get to where it is today, a store that is constantly adapting to meet the demand for what's hot in the world of fandom.", "description": "From its humble start in a California garage to its soaring presence in malls across the continent, here's how Hot Topic made it big in North America.", "authors": ["Shoshy Ciment"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72b4872e22af32db350e95-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
