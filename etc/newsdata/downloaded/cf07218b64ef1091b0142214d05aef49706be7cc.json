(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Stephen Strasburg took a gem into the ninth inning and Juan Soto ran all the way to first base with his bat following a go-ahead home run, the same way Houston slugger Alex Bregman did earlier.\n\nWashington has matched the Astros pitch for pitch, hit for hit, win for win \u2014 even home run celebration for home run celebration.\n\nStrasburg gutted through without his best fastball to throw five-hit ball for 8 1/3 innings, and now it's onto a winner-take-all Game 7 to decide the first World Series in which the visiting team won the first six games.\n\nEaton and Soto hit solo homers off Justin Verlander in the fifth, Anthony Rendon had five RBIs, including with a two-run homer in the seventh, and the Nationals beat the Astros 7-2 Tuesday night to tie the Series at three games apiece.\n\nFired up after a disputed call at first base went against them in the seventh, the Nationals padded their lead moments later when Rendon homered off Will Harris. Washington manager Dave Martinez, still enraged at umpires, was ejected during the seventh-inning stretch, screaming as a pair of his coaches held him back while the crowd sang along to \"Deep in the Heart of Texas.\" Rendon added a two-run double off Chris Devenski in the ninth.\n\nNationals pitcher Max Scherzer, boosted by an injection of painkiller, is primed to return from an irritated nerve in his neck to start Game 7, Martinez said before the game. Scherzer was warming up in the seventh before Rendon's homer, then sat down as Martinez became the first manager tossed from a Series game since Atlanta's Bobby Cox in 1996.\n\nNow the Nationals will attempt their ultimate comeback in a year in which they were written off time after time, hoping for the first title in the 51-season history of a franchise that started as the Montreal Expos and the first for Washington since the Senators in 1924. Zack Greinke will be on the mound for the Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins and are seeking their second title in three seasons.\n\nVisiting teams have won three straight Game 7s in the Series since the Cardinals defeated Texas at home in 2011.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: and", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Stephen Strasburg took a gem into the ninth inning and Juan Soto ran all the way to first base with his bat following a go-ahead home run, the same way Houston slugger Alex Bregman did earlier.", "authors": ["Ronald Blum", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
