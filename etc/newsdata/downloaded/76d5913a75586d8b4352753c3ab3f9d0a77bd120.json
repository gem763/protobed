But Johnson added another note saying he was opposed to an\n\nextension and British government minister Michael Gove said on\n\nSunday that Brexit will happen by Oct. 31 as the government\n\nseeks to get the Brexit bill through parliament.\n\nAnalysts said market focus will turn to this week's vote on\n\nJohnson's deal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC\n\novernight that he was confident enough lawmakers would back the\n\ndeal this week.\n\n\"The weekend's events, if anything, have further reduced the\n\nrisk of disorderly exit,\" said Adam Cole, chief currency\n\nstrategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.\n\n\"If there is a knee-jerk negative reaction in the pound as\n\nwe emerge from the weekend with a greater overhang of\n\nuncertainty than hoped and some of the long positions are\n\nunwound, it should be faded soon.\"\n\nThe European Union will play for time rather than rush to\n\ndecide on London's reluctant request to delay Brexit again,\n\ndiplomats said on Sunday. While weary of the Brexit process, EU leaders are keen to\n\navoid a disorderly exit and are unlikely to reject the request.\n\nThey hope the deal can eventually be approved in London.\n\nGoldman Sachs GS.N said on Sunday that it lowered the\n\nprobability of a no-deal Brexit to 5% from 10% and maintained\n\nits baseline view that the UK will leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\"The uncertainty is likely to weigh on sterling when trading\n\nresumes in Asia Pacific on Oct. 21. Volatility will remain\n\nelevated until a clearer picture emerges,\" said Marc Chandler,\n\nchief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.\n\nImplied volatilities on sterling options GBPVOL= were\n\nmostly little changed in early Monday, with one-month\n\nvolatilities quoted at 11.600/14.200% GBP1MO= .\n\nRisk reversal spreads widened slightly in favour of sterling\n\nputs, pointing to investors' caution over the pound's fall.\n\nElsewhere, currency moves were limited as investors pondered\n\nthe shifting scenarios for Brexit.\n\nThe euro eased 0.13% to $1.1159 versus the greenback,\n\noff Friday's two-month high of $1.1172.\n\nThe dollar was little changed at 108.48 to the\n\nsafe-haven yen, still not far from its 2-1/2-month high of\n\n108.94 yen marked on Thursday.\n\n\"Although many eyes are still on Brexit, there is not so\n\nmuch nervousness in the market as the risk of a no-deal Brexit\n\nhas actually reduced over the weekend,\" said Shinichiro Kadota,\n\nsenior forex and rates strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\n\n\"Apart from Brexit, traders are looking at central banks'\n\npolicy decisions.\"\n\nA big week for central banks kicks off on Thursday with the\n\nEuropean Central Bank meeting, the last one for President Mario\n\nDraghi, while the main focus is on the U.S. Federal Reserve's\n\npolicy meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\nChina's yuan CNY=CFXS was a touch firmer at 7.0680 per\n\ndollar after Beijing unexpectedly kept unchanged its new\n\nbenchmark lending rate on Monday, for the first time since its\n\ndebut in August, suggesting the country is keen to avoid overly\n\nloosening monetary policy.\n\nSterling falls https://tmsnrt.rs/35RTMtl\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "FOREX-Sterling slips from 5-month high on Brexit delay jitters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/forex_4_800x533_L_1413209320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
