The historic mansion includes a dozen bedrooms, its own church, seven acres of gardens and an elaborate history.\n\n\n\nMore: Three \u00a310M-Plus Mansions Hit Guernsey\u2019s Tiny Property Market This Week\n\nThe home hit the market on Friday with Daniel Buxton of estate agents Cowley Groves.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe stature of the house is hard to quantify, but it is certainly exceptional for the Island in that it combines both a rich history, impressive architecture and a very comfortable family home,\u201d according to the agents.\n\n\n\nEarly 13th-century bishop Simon Argyll is believed to have been the first to take up residence on the property, building what would be considered a modest wooden structure compared to the citadel into which Bishopscourt would evolve.\n\n\n\nOver a century later, bishops razed Argyll\u2019s house and replaced it with King Orry\u2019s Tower, which remains the oldest surviving structure on the property.\n\n\n\nA dramatic reception hall includes a medieval stained glass window. Cowley Groves\n\nThe home has undergone a modern update and restoration. Cowley Groves\n\nOne of several kitchens. Cowley Groves\n\nIn the mid-1600s, the English civil war brought one of the most tumultuous periods in Bishopscourt\u2019s history. It served as a Royalist stronghold until the Isle of Man surrendered to Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Parliamentary forces. It then hosted for some time parliamentarian commissioners, including James Chaloner, who is believed to have signed King Charles I\u2019s death warrant, according to an extensive history described in the listing.\n\n\n\nAs Bishopscourt expanded, its place at the center of island politics meant security was of chief concern. For instance, in 1825, 5,000 men marched on the property to demand the bishop end taxes on potato, turnip and green crops, according to the listing.\n\n\n\nAs a result, some of the building\u2019s walls were four- to 10-feet thick.\n\n\n\nWhile much of the current residence dates back to a 17th-century expansion, private owners since the late 1970s have carried out extensive restorations to modernize the home and transform it \u201cfrom an austere Bishops palace into a warm family home,\u201d said the listing agents.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Airbus Ruling Will Push Imported Wine and Cheese Prices Higher\n\nMansion Global could not independently confirm who currently owns the home, but it was last reported that property developer John Morphet purchased the home in 2010 for \u00a35 million.\n\n\n\nDecoration and relics spanning 700 years are still found throughout the estate, including an old ice house that now acts as additional storage and a main reception hall featuring stained glass from a now-demolished medieval chapel. From more recent history, there\u2019s a plaque in the garden commemorating three trees planted by King George V in 1920.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113589?size=1.5023474178403755&width=1280"}
