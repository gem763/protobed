Diabetes advocates maintain that comments like \u201cdiabetes on a plate\u201d contribute to the misconception that type 1 diabetes is caused by diet (it\u2019s not) and that type 2 diabetes is caused solely by eating sugary snacks, rather than a variety of factors.\n\nRelated:\u200b It\u2019s Not Just Insulin: Diabetes Patients Struggle to Get Crucial Supplies\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry did I just hear @PaulHollywood utter the words \u2018diabetes on a plate\u2019?

It\u2019s not known exactly what causes type 1 diabetes, but scientists believe factors like genetics or viruses may contribute. It is not caused by food. Type 2 diabetes develops when your pancreas stops producing enough insulin, or your body becomes resistant to the insulin you are producing. Factors that can contribute to developing type 2 diabetes are genetics, lifestyle habits such as a high fat and carbohydrate diet and lack of exercise, and age.\n\nRelated:\u200b What Happened When I Decided to Buy Insulin While on Vacation in Tahiti\n\nThe nonprofit Diabetes UK shared a tweet revealing they reached out to the show\u2019s producers and Channel 4 to explain why Hollywood\u2019s comment could be damaging.\n\n\u201cSome of you may have seen or heard about the reference to #diabetes made on this week\u2019s episode of #GBBO,\u201d the organization tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch with the producers and @Channel4 to explain how remarks like this can lead to misunderstanding, and be upsetting for people affected by diabetes.\u201d\n\nSome of you may have seen or heard about the reference to #diabetes made on this week\u2019s episode of #GBBO.
