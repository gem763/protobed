It doesn't matter how good you are, Messi or Ronaldo could go there and they would have difficulty because the team is not producing.'\n\nBerbatov believes Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) would struggle in this team\n\nMario Mandzukic has been heavily linked with Manchester United for several months\n\nIn an effort to bolster their attack, Manchester United have reportedly had contact recently with Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic and are preparing a bid for the 33-year-old after failing to land his signature in the summer.\n\nThe ex United No 9 said: 'When you sell two of your main strikers you need to bring in at least one, just in case.\n\n'Everybody can see that that Manchester United need a back up, (Anthony) Martial is injured and there isn't another really strong proven goalscorer. They have the talent in the young players but at the same time you need someone like Mandzukic.'\n\n'I think he is a really good football player and he hasn't played before in England but I hope if he comes he can straight away get into the rhythm of the Premier League.\n\nDimitar Berbatov played at Manchester United for four seasons, scoring 48 goals in all comps\n\nBerbatov even compared the Croatian to former Manchester United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic who had a barnstorming season at Old Trafford in the 2016/17 Premier League season.\n\n'Ibrahimovic was 34 years old when he signed for United and he didn't have any problems. Mandzukic is a similar age and hope he could have the same impact if he signs.\n\n'I think his age is a good thing, Martial, (Marcus) Rashford and (Mason) Greenwood are all young players so they need that time and assurance that they don't need to worry and they can learn from the experience of Mandzukic.'\n\nMarcus Rashford has been part of a struggling United side this season and fans expect more\n\nMason Greenwood is getting his taste of first-team football but isn't ready to lead the Reds line", "description": "Mario Mandzukic has been linked with Manchester United for several months.
