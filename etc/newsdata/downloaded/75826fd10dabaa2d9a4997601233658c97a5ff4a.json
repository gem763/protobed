They\u2019re the cutest couple and so down-to-earth,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cAnd I hate it \u2015 I see them get attacked, and it\u2019s not fair. They\u2019re just two of the most down-to-earth, compassionate people. They\u2019re doing so much good for the world.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres spoke about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s work with elephants in Botswana, and her and de Rossi\u2019s work with gorillas in Rwanda, adding that the famous couples all want to \u201cdo something together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I can\u2019t tell you how sweet they are,\u201d DeGeneres added, \u201cbut the most important thing is I got to hold little Archie \u2015 the baby. I fed Archie, I held Archie.\u201d\n\nShe joked that the little one \u201cweighs 15 pounds, which is, the exchange rate, is 17 dollars here!\u201d and said that \u201che looks like Harry and he had more hair than I did at the time.\u201d\n\nThough she didn\u2019t provide a photo of the group hanging out together, she did show the audience a picture she drew of Archie to lots of laughs.\n\nChris Jackson via Getty Images The Duke and Duchess of Sussex on an official visit to the Joff Youth Centre on Oct. 3, 2018 in Peacehaven, United Kingdom.\n\nDeGeneres revealed in August that she had met the duke and duchess, but didn\u2019t provide many details. She defended the royal couple on Twitter after Harry and Meghan were criticized for reportedly taking four private flights in 11 days, apparently contradicting the values of environmentalism and conservatism they regularly promote.\n\n\u201cPortia and I met Prince Harry and Meghan in England to talk about their work on wildlife conservation,\u201d DeGeneres tweeted at the time. \u201cThey were the most down-to-earth, compassionate people. Imagine being attacked for everything you do, when all you\u2019re trying to do is make the world better,\u201d she added.\n\nPortia and I met Prince Harry and Meghan in England to talk about their work on wildlife conservation.
