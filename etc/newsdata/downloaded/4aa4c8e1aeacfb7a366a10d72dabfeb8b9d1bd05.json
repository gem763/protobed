People cited the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator when reporting the news. She'll be released on October 27.\n\nTMZ added that Huffman won't serve the full 14 days because of the few hours she spent behind bars following her initial arrest as part of the college admissions scandal back in March. The outlet reports that the time it took for authorities to arrest her at her home, book her and ultimately release her after several hours will be counted as the fourteenth day of her sentence.\n\nSEE ALSO: Details emerge on the strict rules Felicity Huffman must follow behind bars\n\nHuffman was driven to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California, by her husband, William H.
