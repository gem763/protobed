But customers who ordered it from the online seller Booktopia were told it had been \u201cwithdrawn from sale\u201d and had their payment refunded.\n\nLawyers for Dylan Howard, a former reporter for Channel Seven who is now a senior executive at the tabloid media company American Media Inc in New York, wrote to Australian booksellers last month alleging that Farrow\u2019s book might contain \u201cfalse and defamatory allegations\u201d.\n\nRonan Farrow on investigating Harvey Weinstein: \u2018When family issues are thrown at me, it\u2019s a dirty move\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cOur client has put the publisher, Little, Brown Book Group Limited (in the USA and UK) and Hachette Australia Pty Ltd \u2026 on notice that if the defamatory content is included in the book, we are instructed to take such legal action as may be appropriate,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe letter urged booksellers to liaise with the publisher to determine that the allegedly defamatory content was not included in the book, and warned that Howard might include booksellers as a party to any defamation proceedings that might be started against the publisher.\n\nGuardian Australia contacted a number of bookstores on Tuesday and was told that most were yet to receive their shipment of the book, but had not received a notice not to sell.\n\n\u201cThe official release date is today but we haven\u2019t received stock yet,\u201d said David May of Sydney\u2019s Gleebooks. \u201cBut as far as I know we are planning to stock and sell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been asked to withdraw it. We would be expecting stock any day from a mainstream supplier. And we would be expecting to put it on shelves.\u201d\n\nOther stores said it was normal for deliveries to be delayed for a day or two until after the official release date.\n\nThe publisher, Hachette Australia, confirmed that \u201cthe book is out as planned\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any reason for delay \u2013 it\u2019s just people unpacking stock,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cIt\u2019s available from today.\u201d\n\nAnother independent retailer said that unless it was told to withdraw the book by the publisher it would not remove it from the shelves.\n\nIn response to questions from Guardian Australia, the legal firm acting for Howard, McLachlan Thorpe, said Howard had not \u201cwarned\u201d booksellers not to stock the book, \u201cbut rather he has put distributors on notice that they all are exposed to actions in defamation by our client if the book\u2019s demonstrably false claims about Mr Howard are published\u201d.\n\nIf the book included defamatory imputations, the author, publisher and booksellers would all be open to legal action, the lawyers said.\n\nThe book contains extensive references to Howard, who it alleges frequently met Weinstein and who was investigating Weinstein\u2019s accusers as editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer.\n\n#MeToo two years on: Weinstein allegations 'tip of iceberg', say accusers Read more\n\nIn 2017 Farrow named Howard as one of several individuals who had allegedly acted to protect Weinstein\u2019s reputation.\n\nFarrow\u2019s New Yorker article quoted an email exchange between Howard and Weinstein in December 2016 in which Howard allegedly told Weinstein about information obtained by one of AMI\u2019s reporters that cast the actor Rose McGowan, who has accused Weinstein of rape, in a negative light.\n\nIt was reported that Howard was overseeing a television production agreement between AMI and the Weinstein company, which has since been terminated. He said in a response included in the New Yorker article that he had \u201can obligation to protect AMI\u2019s interests by seeking out \u2013 but not publishing \u2013 truthful information about people who Mr. Weinstein insisted were making false claims against him\u201d.\n\nHe said he was careful to separate the corporate partnership from his journalistic obligations and that any off the record information that may have been provided to Weinstein would never have been allowed to be published, according to the New Yorker.\n\nHoward began his journalism career at the Geelong Advertiser and moved to the US in 2009. His contract with Channel Seven in Australia was not renewed in 2008 after he was cleared by a police investigation into the publication of the private medical records of Australian rules footballers.\n\nIn 2018 Howard sued Channel Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes program to prevent the release of footage of him obtained in the lobby of his New York office, Nine Newspapers reported.", "description": "One online distributor has withdrawn the #MeToo memoir, but other stores have stocked it, and the publisher insists it will not be withdrawn", "authors": ["Calla Wahlquist", "Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a1138c06ddecffe198e2a6a2386bb5bf0f54d5b/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa75608990d1ac19e3b563e16a44cfac", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
