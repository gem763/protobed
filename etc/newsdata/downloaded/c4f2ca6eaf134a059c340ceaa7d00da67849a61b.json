It roams on its own,\u201d he said, according to a transcript released Sunday by his office.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s myasthenia gravis. It\u2019s a nerve malfunction. I got it from my grandfather.\u201d\n\nThe condition causes muscle weakness, and can result in drooping of eyelids, blurred vision as well as weakness in one\u2019s extremities, according to the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe condition can generally be managed with treatment, but up to 20% of people who have the disease experience at least one \u201ccrisis\u201d that requires them to use a ventilator to help breathe, the NIH said.\n\nDuterte gave no indication as to whether he has had any serious incidents as a result of the disease.\n\nHis administration gives out very little information about his health and consistently says the president is in good shape.\n\nDuterte himself, however, has discussed his ailments in his frequent, rambling speeches. In October 2018 he told an audience how he was awaiting the results of a cancer screening.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m now physically, but I have to wait for that,\u201d Duterte said last October. \u201cBut, I will tell you if its cancer, it\u2019s cancer. If it\u2019s third stage, no more treatment. I will not prolong the agony in this office or anywhere.\u201d\n\nHis comments sparked immediate concern and speculation, but days later he said the tests had come back negative.\n\nDuterte has also said previously that he suffers from daily migraines and ailments including Buerger\u2019s disease, an illness that affects the veins and the arteries of the limbs, and is usually due to smoking.\n\nHe has cited his ill health as the reason for skipping events during summits abroad.\n\nThe president, known for his deadly crackdown on drugs, also revealed in 2016 that he used to take fentanyl, a powerful painkiller, because of a spinal injury from motorcycle accidents.", "description": "Rodrigo Duterte disclosed he suffers from myasthenia gravis, a year after suggesting he may have cancer", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2cb3d1ac575b742db51fca3e705e976ac75bf2e/3_0_2735_1642/master/2735.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbedbc743487f2c4cfbb03c704ee871a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
