Options range from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the whole endeavour.\n\nBritish lawmakers are due on Monday to hold another vote on a motion on whether to hold an early election, probably in mid-October, just over two weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\nBut opposition parties, including the Labour Party, said they would either vote against or abstain until a law aiming to block a no-deal Brexit is implemented.\n\nA Labour Party source said it would not back Johnson\u2019s bid on Monday for an election under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.\n\n\u201cWe will have that election when the time is right but I will make you this promise, we are not going to have a long wait,\u201d Ian Blackford told BBC television, adding that his opposition Scottish National Party (SNP) party would oppose Johnson\u2019s bid on Monday.\n\nJohnson has said he would rather die in a ditch than delay Brexit and has cast the opposition parties\u2019 bill aiming to stop a no-deal Brexit as a surrender to the EU that he would never go along with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to Brussels, I\u2019ll get a deal and we\u2019ll make sure we come out on October 31, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d Johnson said. When asked if he would resign if he could not deliver that, he said:\n\n\u201cThat is not a hypothesis I\u2019m willing to contemplate.\u201d\n\nBREXIT CRISIS\n\nAs opposition parties and Johnson\u2019s government haggle over an election date, British politics was in turmoil just over six weeks into Johnson\u2019s premiership.\n\nEngland\u2019s High Court on Friday rejected a legal challenge against Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament before Brexit but said it could be taken to the Supreme Court for a final appeal.\n\nJohn Major, a former prime minister who supported the court challenge, said Brexit was a deceit that would undermine the United Kingdom\u2019s standing and could even split it asunder.\n\n\u201cBrexit will reduce our global reach, not enhance it,\u201d Major said. \u201cOnce outside Europe, we British will have little or no voice. We are not used to being outside the inner circles of decision-making \u2013 and we will hate it.\u201d\n\nMajor said Johnson should fire Dominic Cummings, the advisor behind his high-stakes Brexit strategy whom Major cast as a \u201cpolitical anarchist\u201d.\n\nWhen asked about Major\u2019s call, Cummings told Reuters: \u201cReally?
