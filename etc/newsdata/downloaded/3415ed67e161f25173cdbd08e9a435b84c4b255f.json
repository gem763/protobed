From the age of 19 he amassed a staggering 20,000 images of child abuse that he sold for profit.\n\nInvestigators believe he would have attacked hundreds more children had he not been caught in 2014 when Australian police uncovered a network of paedophiles on the 'dark' web.\n\nHe was arrested by the National Crime Agency after flying home to visit his family for Christmas in 2015.\n\nHuckle maintained his innocence to police but later confessed to his parents. Horrified, they begged police to take him away.\n\nHuckle worked as an English teacher, infiltrating impoverished communities, targeting care homes and orphanages\n\nIn the worst case of its kind at the Old Bailey he admitted an unprecedented 71 charges over eight years, including rape, sexual assault and sexual activity with a child.\n\nRichard Huckle, who was given 22 life sentences after pleading guilty to abusing babies and young children, boasted about kissing a girl in a newly revealed diary\n\nAs he was taken from the dock an onlooker shouted from the public gallery: 'A thousand deaths is too good for you. I know one of those families. They mean nothing to you.'\n\nJudge Peter Rook QC said Huckle posed a substantial risk for an indefinite period: 'This was a prolonged campaign of rape of the children from a small community.\n\n'You targeted and groomed impoverished children and their families in a poor community, no doubt seeking to impress them with your relative wealth as a Westerner.\n\n'That community was particularly vulnerable because of its poverty. Your offending became entrenched in everyday life, your life revolved around abusing children.\n\n'Your distorted beliefs are deep-seated, your self-delusion knows no bounds. You were and are sexually obsessed with children. 'It is clear from your postings on hidden encrypted paedophile websites on the dark web, and from the manual you were in the process of drafting, that your life revolved around your obsession with your own sexual gratification by child sex abuse. It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle.'\n\nHuckle, who used churches he attended in Kent as a 'stepping stone' to gain access to victims abroad, sat with his hands clasped together as if in prayer as he was sentenced.\n\nThe judge said a 60-page child abuse manual he penned instructing others on how to target victims was a 'truly evil document'.\n\nHuckle passed a short letter through the glass dock before sentencing, in which he claimed he was disgusted with his behaviour.\n\nBut the judge said he showed no remorse or understanding of the public abhorrence over his campaign of rape. He added: 'In my view, you may well harbour feelings of regret but there is no feeling of genuine remorse in this case.'\n\nInvestigators have been unable to identify Huckle's victims as he has refused to hand over encrypted passwords to hidden files on his computer.\n\nHuckle's bloodied-body was found 'slumped' in his top floor cell at HMP Full Sutton, a Category A jail near York\n\nHe was prosecuted over the abuse of 23 children, but officers managed to uncover more than 20,000 indecent images and videos.\n\nAnthony Hill, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'It is hard to put into words the sheer depravity. For almost nine years, Richard Huckle subjected at least 23 children, some of them very young, to the most horrifying abuse imaginable.\n\n'He deliberately targeted and groomed vulnerable communities to gain their trust. He took photographs of the abuse to upload on the dark web to share worldwide.'\n\nAn NSPCC spokesman said: 'Huckle is a frighteningly depraved paedophile who bragged about raping babies and delighted in abusing infants who trusted him.\n\n'He left a trail of devastation and his sentence reflects the severity of his crimes. It is horrifying that Huckle was able to profit from this appalling abuse.'", "description": "Huckle's bloodied-body was found 'slumped' in his top floor cell at HMP Full Sutton, a Category A jail near York housing many of Britain's most notorious and violent prisoners.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/11/19686648-0-image-a-9_1571048295732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
