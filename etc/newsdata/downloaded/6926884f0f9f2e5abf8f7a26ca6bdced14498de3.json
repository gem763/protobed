You\u2019d be happy to stick with your longtime employer, but you\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s realistic, and your spouse doesn\u2019t want you to relocate. Here\u2019s how to think of this decision as an opportunity, not a chore.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my entire (12-year) career at one employer. It\u2019s the same company that my father and grandfather spent their whole careers at. >Unfortunately, the company is closing the plant where I work. They\u2019ve made promises to my group that our jobs will stay in the region. But they still have not selected a new location for our team, despite the fact that the announcement to close the factory was made almost two years ago. The actual closure is now coming in a matter of months. I have been approached by another firm about a position with similar responsibilities to mine, but in an entirely different field. I\u2019d be switching from a manufacturing company to more of a tech company. My commute would change from 30 minutes in a car to about an hour on a train. I\u2019m really passionate about the product we make at my current employer. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that we are being strung along, and it\u2019s going to end badly. I would be open to relocate to stay with the company, but my wife is from this area and would prefer to stay where we are. Should I stay or should I go?\n\nThis, of course, is one of the most familiar recurring dilemmas of work life. And in a way, it\u2019s one of the best dilemmas of work life. Maybe it doesn\u2019t feel that way right at the moment, but it\u2019s totally healthy to think about the pros and cons of making a change or standing pat. Appreciate that you always have choices, and that\u2019s something to be taken seriously and embraced, rather than avoided until a moment of crisis.\n\nThat said, I get it: These decisions are seldom easy. There\u2019s no way to avoid risk (and sometimes sticking with what you\u2019ve got is actually the biggest risk of all). So moments like this are a good time to ask yourself a question that\u2019s worth posing on a regular basis, as the answer is likely to change over time:\n\nWhat do you really want, and what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?\n\nShift your time horizon\n\nYou have already done much of the basic comparison legwork. You really dig your company/product; the new gig would include a more difficult commute. Maybe you should stay put!\n\nOn the other hand, your Spidey sense is telling you that your job will ultimately evaporate, or that keeping it will involve a move your wife doesn\u2019t want to make. Maybe smarter to go!\n\nNow try to reframe the decision with a longer time horizon. Think about what you want ten, twenty years from now. If staying in the area is a top priority, that may put certain limits on your career options. (That\u2019s the potential sacrifice.)\n\nBut the experience you acquire at this new firm seem more likely to build out your set of skills that will give you more flexibility in the future to do interesting things even as you stay in the same geographic location.\n\nImagine future regrets\n\nSticking with that longer time horizon, think about what you might regret some day. I know this sounds like a bummer, but it\u2019s just a thought exercise. I encourage you to lean into it: Think really expansively about what you might regret. The decisions you made, the decisions you didn\u2019t make, all of it.\n\nIn your case I suspect what you need to look at most closely is how much you want to remain with your current employer, weighed against how much you might end up resenting your spouse if you sacrifice that because you believe she\u2019d rather not move. Explore this. What if the move was just for a few years? How strongly does she really feel about that? How strongly do you really feel about it? How much of your apparent loyalty to this employer is tied up in the idea that you have a generations-long family relationship to it?\n\nNone of this is fun. But it\u2019s better to confront these issues than to avoid them, with an eye toward minimising everyone\u2019s potential future regrets. (Note that I didn\u2019t say \u201celiminate.\u201d Spoiler alert: We are all going to have some regrets.)\n\nTo me, it seems most logical to take the new gig. Accept the longer commute, pick some new skills, and keep open to whatever might come next. I\u2019m deeply sceptical that your current employer will ever reciprocate that generations-long sense of loyalty, but staying open to what comes next should include keeping up with your most supportive contacts at the company. It may be that five or ten years from now, you\u2019ll be more attractive to them than ever\u2014precisely because you took the risk to try out, and learn, new things.\n\nObviously you\u2019ll have to weigh that against your own long term goals, and potential future regrets. Just keep reminding yourself that coming to a career crossroads isn\u2019t such a bad thing. It may be a real opportunity.", "description": "You\u2019ve been approached about a new gig \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated.
