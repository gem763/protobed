Yeah, it was kind of s**tty, but whatever.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m copping s**t here because of [her] exes. You know, her husband is Australian.\u2019\n\nMiley couldn\u2019t stop grinning at being reunited with Cody after his trip to Australia (Picture: X17)\n\nHowever there were no signs of an argument once the pair had reunited, as they continued to put on some serious PDA \u2013 and we\u2019d expect nothing less based on what they\u2019ve been serving for the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe pair have been friends for years but only got together at the start of October after Miley called off her six-week romance with Kaitlynn Carter.\n\nMiley and Kaitlynn\u2019s brief fling came as she announced the end of her marriage to Liam Hemsworth just eight months after they tied the knot.\n\nCody had previously dated model Claire Wuestenberg, Gigi Hadid and Kylie Jenner way back in 2012.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
