The only clues: Show up in layered clothes and hiking boots and have a sense of adventure.\n\nThree tourists hike along a guided path at Nelson Rocks near Circleville, West Virginia. They were among 33 people to participate in a two-day mystery bus trip sponsored by the West Virginia Division of Tourism. Participants didn't know where they were going until they arrived at their destination\n\nFive hundred people applied; 33 were chosen. They were told to show up at a Washington, DC, bus station at 7am for the trip that would return them the next day.\n\nThe next clues came when they saw the bus, which was labeled 'Destination Unknown' but had a West Virginia license plate. The sides were covered in a photo of red, orange and yellow fall foliage, 'and we're heading west,' Espenscheid said.\n\nThat gave them a general idea, but still, what was there to do?\n\nPlenty. And that was the point of the trip, which was open to residents of Virginia, Maryland and Washington, DC.\n\n'I had never thought \"Hey let's go to West Virginia for the weekend.\" Outside of Harpers Ferry, I did not know what West Virginia had to offer,' Espenscheid said.\n\nMystery trips have grown into their own industry, both for individual and group travel.\n\nWhether traveling by bus, train or plane, these vacations vary widely in length, expense and destination.\n\nOften, clients are given a general idea where they're going. Others aren't told until they arrive at the airport. Some trips are even bought as gifts for others.\n\nTourists Maria Bedolla and Alfred Ting step off a tour bus that arrived at Canaan Valley Resort State Park in Davis, West Virginia, as part of a weekend mystery vacation. The two-day trip started in Washington, DC\n\nMystery trip organizers can help clients who have a hard time making a decision, are overwhelmed with where they want to go or have done so much research that the excitement is gone, said Denise Chaykun Weaver, who started Magical Mystery Tours nearly a decade ago after she arranged a trip for a friend on a whim to San Francisco.\n\nHer firm now books hundreds of trips per year.\n\n'There's this magical thing about a mystery trip in that you don't have control. You don't know where you're going,' she said. 'Surprises are really fun.'\n\nMany companies offer trips based on clients' interests, so there's no arm twisting. Travelers aren't going to be sent on a skydiving trip if they're afraid of heights.\n\n'We definitely get a lot of \"I want a beach, I want something warm\",' she said.\n\nPink Bus Mystery Trips of Fargo, North Dakota, started in 2007 as a fundraising event for ALS research and now plans vacations for women.\n\nIt took groups on sold-out trips to Michigan in June and Texas in October and plans a two-week trip to Scandinavia next September.\n\nAmong other online trip organizers are Pack Up + Go and SurpriseMeTrips. Upscale vendors include The Travel Mechanic and the Black Tomato while Rustic Pathways specializes in summer group packages worldwide for students.\n\nAlicia Tenise horseback riding in Canaan Valley in West Virginia on the mystery trip\n\nEspenscheid, a public speaker from Quantico, Virginia, said the West Virginia trip was especially attractive because her busy work schedule is already mapped out and involves a dress and high heels.\n\nShe recently went to Miami for speaking engagements and had another one in the works to Nashville.\n\n'How nice would it be to travel on a weekend and not have to plan it?' she said.\n\nA few hours into the West Virginia mystery trip, her group stopped at Blackwater Falls for a gourmet lunch.\n\n'Something out of a dream,' she said.\n\nThere was also horseback riding and hiking to Seneca Rocks that took them nearly 900 feet above the valley floor.\n\nThe group enjoyed dinner, poking around shops, cafes, breweries and other nightlife in the former coal mining and timber towns of Davis and Thomas.\n\nThey watched musical acts at a general store-turned-cafe and concert venue and spent the night at Canaan Valley Resort and Conference Center.\n\nBy the next evening, Espenscheid was back home - her sister didn't have to worry any longer.\n\n'I would absolutely do it again,' she said.\n\n'It got me out of my comfort zone. If I can sign up for another destination unknown where I'm not planning anything? It's part of the adventure.'", "description": "Mystery trips in the U.S. have grown into their own industry, both for individual and group travel.
