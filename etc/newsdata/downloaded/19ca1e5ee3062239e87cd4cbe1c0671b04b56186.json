You tweet all the time. I don\u2019t want to hear it from your press secretary who says you strongly condemn the video. I want to hear from you,\u201d Baldwin said Monday on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d\n\nShe argued that while memes and satire are prevalent among the \u201cYouTube-Twitter generation,\u201d this video wasn\u2019t acceptable in any context.\n\nThe video features a doctored scene from the 2014 film \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d in which Trump\u2019s face is superimposed on an attacker as he goes on a killing spree inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News.\u201d\n\nHuffPost, CNN, CBS, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former President Barack Obama, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and many others are among the victims of the fake rampage.\n\n\u201cThis is beyond the pale. There is no excusing it, no OKing it. How could anyone involved in an event like this think that this is OK?\u201d Baldwin asked.\n\n\u201cThere is no place for a video like this today in America. None,\u201d she concluded at the end of the segment. \u201cMr. President, it is now 2:49 p.m. Monday afternoon. Condemn this video now.\u201d\n\nMr. President, why is it taking you so long to condemn this video?\n\nYou tweet all the time.\n\nI don't want to hear from your press secretary...\n\nwho says you strongly condemn the video...\n\nI want to hear from YOU. pic.twitter.com/8mDpKOQVPS \u2014 Brooke Baldwin (@BrookeBCNN) October 14, 2019\n\nThe video was shown at a three-day conference hosted by the pro-Trump group American Priority, which was held at the president\u2019s Miami resort, the Trump National Doral, according to The New York Times in a report published Sunday. Multiple pro-Trump headliners were featured at the event, including Donald Trump Jr. and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nAmerican Priority told the Times that the video was shown as part of a meme exhibit and was \u201cnot associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted Monday that the president had not yet viewed the video but \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d it:\n\nRe: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video. \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 14, 2019\n\nThe president tweeted more than 30 times on Monday but he has yet to address the video himself.\n\nCNN denounced the video in a statement published on Twitter Sunday and called on the president to do the same in the \u201cstrongest possible terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone,\u201d the statement read.", "description": "The CNN anchor said the president tweets \"all the time,\" but not about a video of a fake Trump murdering critics and the media.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da4f40c200000cb0c500c58.png?cache=qkjruhs5sc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
