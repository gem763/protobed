In this version, blanched broccoli is cooked in olive oil that's been infused with garlic and anchovies (always optional) until it\u2019s very tender, then it\u2019s piled onto toasted bread. Grated extra-sharp provolone, which is a nice complement to the mildly sweet broccoli, is sprinkled on top, then the toasts are broiled until the cheese is melted and golden brown. You can use cauliflower, broccoli rabe or thickly sliced sweet peppers in place of the broccoli, but be sure to cook your vegetables until they are velvety soft \u2014 it provides a nice contrast to the crunchy bread. While these toasts work well on their own, they make an equally good accompaniment to roast chicken or grilled fish.", "description": "A beautifully assembled toast can make a lovely light dinner In this version, blanched broccoli is cooked in olive oil that's been infused with garlic and anchovies (always optional) until it\u2019s very tender, then it\u2019s piled onto toasted bread Grated extra-sharp provolone, which is a nice complement to the mildly sweet broccoli, is sprinkled on top, then the toasts are broiled until the cheese is melted and golden brown", "authors": ["Colu Henry", "David Tanis", "Pierre Franey", "Mark Bittman", "Sam Sifton", "Melissa Clark", "Kay Chun", "Kim Severson", "Sarah Jampel", "Tejal Rao"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/dining/ch-broccoli-toasts/ch-broccoli-toasts-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
