Either way, the president used the incident to apply fresh pressure on the Federal Reserve to aggressively cut interest rates.\n\nBLAME FOR IRAN\n\nBefore a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, Trump told reporters it \u201ccertainly would look\u201d like Iran was behind the attack.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know definitively,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s being checked out right now.\u201d The president said he didn\u2019t want war with Iran but added the U.S. is more prepared for a conflict than any other country.\n\nNow see: Here are the 3 key times the U.S. tapped into its massive emergency-oil reserves.\n\nWith oil prices skyrocketing after the attack and stocks dropping, Trump once again went after the Fed. Citing among other things what he called \u201cthe Oil hit,\u201d Trump tweeted \u201cBig Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus!\u201d The Fed this week is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75%-2%. That will be the second rate cut of the summer, though Trump has frequently complained the Fed\u2019s action is inadequate.\n\nRead: 3 things to watch as Fed meets on interest rates.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude CLV19, -1.51% for October delivery gained 14.7% Monday, while international benchmark Brent BRNX19, -1.45% climbed 14.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52% fell about 143 points, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.31% declined by 9 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.28% dropped 23 points.\n\nSee: U.S. oil just saw its biggest price surge since the financial crisis; Brent logs sharpest gain on record.\n\nOBAMA AND NETFLIX\n\nAlso on Twitter Monday, Trump suggested that lawmakers should investigate Barack Obama instead of him, focusing on the former president\u2019s book and Netflix NFLX, +0.05% deals. Barack and Michelle Obama signed a joint book deal worth a reported $65 million in 2017. They also inked a deal with Netflix last year to produce content. Last month, their first documentary \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d was released.\n\nLast week, the House Judiciary Committee approved guidelines for impeachment hearings on Trump. \u201cI have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal,\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday suggested Iran was responsible for the weekend attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-production infrastructure, and used the incident...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR398_trump__ZG_20190916161859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
