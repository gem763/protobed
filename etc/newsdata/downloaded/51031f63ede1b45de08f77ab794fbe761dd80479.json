Surveyors put the total cost of the catastrophe at $7 billion.\n\nAerial photos show miles of flattened and flooded communities across the Aboco Islands and Grand Bahama \u2013 both of which bore the brunt of Dorian\u2019s 185 mph winds. On the ground, local journalists reported that vast swathes of the islands were essentially uninhabitable with water and power supplies down and bodies piling up. Militias have been formed, local media said, to prevent widespread looting.\n\nAs aid workers poured into the country on Thursday and Friday, meanwhile, harrowing tales started to emerge from those who had been caught in the churning storm.\n\nOne man, Richard Johnson, told of how his six-year-old brother Adrian was missing after being whipped by the winds into churning flood waters. \u201cGiven the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not that hopeful.\"\n\nAnother survivor, Ramond King, said he could only watch as swirling gusts ripped the roof off his home \u2013 then took his neighbour's entire house away into the sky. \u201cThis can't be real, this can't be real,\" he said. \"Nothing is here, nothing at all. Everything is gone, just bodies.\"\n\nIn the waterside community of Mudd \u2013 now not much more than ruins \u2013 people were reported to be picking through the debris while avoiding a body hanging underneath a tree branch.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Some \u00a34.3 million has been put aside by the agency to fund a three-month emergency operation there.\n\nNeighbouring Jamaica has said it will send 150 military personnel to secure lawless areas, while, in Barbados, prime minister Mia Mottley linked the devastation to climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are on the frontline of the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the vulnerability that attaches therefore to us is a matter we\u2019re trying to get the international community to deal with consistently.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cPeople say the words and hear you, but they don\u2019t follow through.\u201d\n\nBut as both rescue and reckoning started in the Caribbean, the hurricane has now started to strike the US.\n\nAlthough downgraded to a category 2 storm, it looks set to cause significant damage as it barrels up the country\u2019s north-east coast. Millions of people have been ordered to evacuate in North and South Carolina.\n\nAlready overnight on Thursday, twisters peeled away roofs and flipped trailers in South Carolina, and left more than 250,000 homes and businesses without power. In Charleston, the state\u2019s oldest city, trees and power lines littered flooded streets.\n\nBy 4am Friday morning, the US National Hurricane Center said Dorian was moving north-east along the side of North Carolina at about 13 mph.", "description": "The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be \"staggering\", the country\u2019s government has warned \u2013 as the storm now begins to batter the US east coast.
