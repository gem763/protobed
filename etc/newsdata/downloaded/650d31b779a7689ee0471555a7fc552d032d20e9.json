Could recent generations be \u201clearning\u201d things that just aren\u2019t so? The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nAs the New Criterion\u2019s estimable Roger Kimball wrote, Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201c\u2018A People\u2019s History of the United States\u2019\u2026 has probably done more to poison the minds of high school students than any other work of history.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cDebunking Howard Zinn,\u201d Mary Grabar takes on an icon of the left who has sold 2.5 million copies of his wildly distorted book. Zinn\u2019s one-sided polemic against the United States has been used as a text in countless universities and high schools. The predictable result \u2014 many American youth soured on their country.\n\nMs. Grabar dissects her subject analytically, quoting him accurately and demonstrating that Zinn rarely returned that favor when writing about his targets. Columbus Day is being \u201cde-celebrated\u201d nowadays, in part because of Zinn\u2019s tendentious presentation of the explorer\u2019s supposedly genocidal interactions with native peoples. Ms. Grabar proves the opposite, pointing to Columbus\u2019 diaries, revealing what Zinn omitted.\n\nIndeed, Columbus prevented many abuses against the tribes he encountered and his diary reflects instructions to his men that they should employ \u201ckindness\u201d toward the natives. Zinn ignores such history entirely.\n\nZinn\u2019s ripest target is slavery, that huge stain on American history. But to him, capitalism is somehow the cause of human ownership. He never concedes that the famously capitalistic Abraham Lincoln and the free Union forces fought and died to end slavery. Zinn depicts abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass as anti-American, ignoring Douglass\u2019 famous 1852 speech, referring to our Declaration of Independence as that \u201cglorious liberty document.\u201d Douglass loved his country, but simply called upon his fellow Americans to live up to our founding ideals by ending human bondage.\n\nLincoln himself is caricatured as racist by Zinn, even suggesting that he \u201cinitiated hostilities\u201d with the Confederacy.\n\nMs. Grabar deftly exposes Zinn\u2019s shameful treatment of America\u2019s motives in World War II. In his twisted view, we were not fighting aggressive Nazism and fascism, but rather to advance imperialism and rapacious capitalism. Of course, the United States and Western democracies were less responsible for Hitler\u2019s defeat than were the Soviets. He opposed the use of atomic weapons, suggesting that our unreasonable \u201cinsistence on unconditional surrender\u201d was the primary obstacle to peace with Japan.\n\nMs. Grabar adds: \u201cZinn obscenely compares internment camps for the Japanese to Nazi concentration camps.\u201d Perhaps Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez studied Zinn prior to comparing today\u2019s border processing centers to concentration camps, just this summer.\n\nPostwar, following the Soviets\u2019 violent domination of Eastern Europe, Zinn wrote that President Truman \u201cworked to create an atmosphere of crisis and cold war.\u201d Stalin\u2019s ruthless nationalization of private property resulted in the starvation of millions of Soviet citizens. But Zinn praises the USSR\u2019s \u201castounding comeback\u201d from the ravages of war.\n\nAnd as Mao\u2019s Communist forces swept in to Peking, eventually murdering tens of millions, Zinn describes the \u201cclosest thing \u2026 to a people\u2019s government, independent of outside control.\u201d Ms. Grabar rightly calls this \u201canother lie,\u201d linking Mao to his master in Moscow, Stalin.\n\nZinn was reverential in hewing to Soviet propaganda lines. As Ms. Grabar put it: \u201cNo amount of proven treason, agitation for violent revolution, or, for that matter, mass murder and the immiseration of millions by socialist governments \u2026 would ever persuade Zinn to dial down his indignation at what he characterized as \u2018hysteria\u2019 about Communism.\u201d\n\nZinn painted an untruthful picture of North Vietnam, as conflict was mounting in the 1960s. The Soviet-armed North was, in Zinn\u2019s mind, simply part of \u201can upsurge all over the world of colonial peoples\u2019 demanding independence.\u201d But the North was essentially a Soviet colony, with support from Mao, bent on extending that brutal colonization to the relatively free South.\n\nZinn compared Ho Chi Minh to Thomas Jefferson, though Ho was a hard-line Leninist, trained in Stalin\u2019s Moscow. Ho\u2019s Communist forces openly practiced torture and terror on captured soldiers and civilians hesitant to cooperate with them. Over a million southeast Asians were murdered in the wake of the Communist victory there.\n\nMs. Grabar demonstrates how Howard Zinn constantly violated the methods of inquiry deemed essential by the American Historical Association. He routinely omitted critical portions of quotes and documents; he manufactured \u201cfacts\u201d; he downplayed significant events and amplified the unimportant.\n\nMary Grabar\u2019s sober research and analysis are more than equal to Zinn\u2019s pretend history. Any university, high school or student who persists in taking Zinn seriously should balance their readings with \u201cDebunking Howard Zinn.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Herbert W.
