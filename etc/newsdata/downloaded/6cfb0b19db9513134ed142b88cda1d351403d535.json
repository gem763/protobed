A spokesman for Exor NV, the Agnelli family holding which owns 29% of CNH and 42% of its voting rights, also declined to comment.\n\nMarchionne Style\n\nCNH is seeking to replicate a strategy used by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne: unlock value by separating businesses which investors rate at different levels.\n\nThe Dutch-registered CNH earlier this month unveiled a plan to split its business into two separately listed companies, with agricultural equipment on one side and commercial vehicles on the other.\n\nThe idea of separating CNH\u2019s truck business from the more profitable tractor unit has been under consideration for years. Last year, then-Chief Executive Officer Richard Tobin said he\u2019d consider spinning off Iveco after further strengthening CNH\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nTobin was a close aide of Marchionne, who championed separating businesses in the interest of shareholders. His strategy helped raise the value of the Fiat empire more than 10-fold during his tenure, with spinoffs of Fiat Industrial SpA, which later became CNH, and super-car maker Ferrari NV. Marchionne died last year.\n\nCNH Industrial was created in 2013 through the merger of Iveco producer Fiat Industrial with the CNH agricultural and construction-equipment division.\n\n(Updates with share reaction in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Daniele Lepido in Milan at dlepido1@bloomberg.net;Tommaso Ebhardt in Milan at tebhardt@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, Jerrold Colten, Ben Scent\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elliott Management Corp. has built a stake in CNH Industrial NV in a bid for constructive engagement with the truck and tractor maker controlled by Italy\u2019s Agnelli family, according to people familiar with the matter.Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, sees value-creation potential", "authors": ["Daniele Lepido", "Tommaso Ebhardt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
