Nevertheless, the art world was surprised to learn this week that the new owner of Sotheby's, Patrick Drahi, had named Charles F Stewart as his chief executive, replacing Tad Smith just two weeks before the start of the autumn auction season.\n\n\"It is clear with this news that Drahi's vision is to take Sotheby's in a new direction,\" said Abigail Asher, a longtime art adviser. \"It will be interesting to see what these changes bring.\"\n\nNew Sotheby's chief executive Charles Stewart has worked for Patrick Draghi before.\n\nSotheby's said the appointment was \"effective immediately,\" although it suggested Mr Smith had no hard feelings. Mr Smith served as chief executive since 2015 and declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed.\n\n\"Underscoring his confidence in Sotheby's long-term success, Mr Smith will become a shareholder of the company and act as a senior adviser to Mr Stewart,\" the Sotheby's statement said.\n\nThe choice of 49-year-old Mr Stewart is not entirely surprising. He comes to Sotheby's from Altice USA, a communications and media company also owned by Mr Drahi, and the two are said to be comfortable with one another. Mr Stewart has spent the past three years as co-president and chief financial officer of Altice USA. He previously served as chief executive of Itau BBA International, the European platform of the Latin American corporate investment bank, and spent 19 years as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.", "description": "The new owner has brought in his own chief executive, replacing the man who helped take the auction house private this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6034%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_51%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b45795591040976547b3c6209e6874c1ca7781ca", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
