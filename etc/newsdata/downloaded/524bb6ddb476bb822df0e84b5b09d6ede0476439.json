My local grocery store happens to be next to a Five Guys, and because it was before lunchtime\u2014around 11 a.m. or so\u2014I saw the employees unlocking and opening up the restaurant. Stopping and watching for a moment, I realized I\u2019d almost never seen that before. It\u2019s easy to think of visiting places like this almost like turning on a video game\u2014pop in the disc, and it plays. Drive to the strip mall, and the stores are just there. Shopping on a different schedule revealed a normally invisible pattern.\n\nOnce, while in college, I walked to my favorite local strip mall\u2014the one with the best Chinese takeout\u2014after all the stores had closed. It was a strange and almost indescribable feeling to see the line of shops that are usually lit up and bustling completely quiet and empty. If the traffic from the local highway let up for a minute, you could easily imagine that you were in some kind of post-apocalyptic wasteland. It was one of those things that seemed like it could teach a lesson, though as a college student I didn\u2019t really know what that lesson was.\n\nAs I\u2019ve studied urbanism, I\u2019ve figured it out: I had seen a vivid illustration of how inflexible and unadaptable this kind of suburban development is. You could walk down the main street of my college town at any time of day or night and come across at least a handful of people. There were a couple of bars, a supermarket open until midnight, and, of course, apartments above the shops and adjacent to them. The town collectively did not have a single, timebound use, and its streets and sidewalks were public spaces. That gave it a character and liveliness that the nearby suburban development lacked. You can talk all day about the merits of density and mixed-use development, but walking through a strip mall and a main street in the middle of the night and observing the difference might be the strongest argument yet.\n\nIn order to make this comparison, which is visible only or primarily at night, you need to get out at unusual times. If you\u2019re like most Americans, living and working in different places and not enjoying much true leisure time, you\u2019ve only ever seen your town or your place during a handful of times of day. Gracy Olmstead has written beautifully on how walking allows us to see the places we live and travel through from a different perspective\u2014to appreciate a level of detail that is simply impossible to notice when zooming by in an automobile. But if experiencing your place through different modes of transportation can reveal insights, so can seeing your place at different times. It\u2019s the only way to fully experience what it is.\n\n\u201cReston at 5 p.m.\u201d (my town and my usual time) is different from \u201cReston at 10 p.m.\u201d Everybody knows this on some level: we try to avoid the dark, crime, long lines, or whatever it may be by being in places at appropriate times. But we may not have a full sense of what those other place-times are. When I was in Italy last month, we often ended up walking home late at night. There were some seedy characters about, but there was also a vibrant late-night street life that felt very different from the crowds of power walking or selfie taking tourists during the day. Or try going into a restaurant at 2 or 3 p.m.\u2014having the whole place to yourself is an entirely different experience than being served in a packed house. When you think of times as places, there\u2019s a lot more to see.\n\nYou may see different people and kinds of people too. My local supermarket is crawling with young, well-dressed professionals in the early evening. It would be easy to think they constituted more or less the whole population of Reston. But when I go shopping during the day, I see families\u2014homeschoolers?\u2014as well as some more eccentric and probably poorer people (I see more of them late at night). You might see someone using cash and counting out coins. Or you might see seniors and retirees out for some leisurely exercise. I had to go to Northern Virginia\u2019s Fair Oaks Mall once for a DMV visit, as the DMV is inside the mall. The DMV and one or two stores open before the official mall opening time, so a few doors are unlocked early. It turns out the mall was full of mostly older people who used this as an opportunity to get some quiet, indoor activity. If I had not visited the mall at an odd hour, this would never have even occurred to me.\n\nPerhaps it doesn\u2019t matter all that much if you run into the poor folks or retirees. But for those who care about putting down roots in a place, it\u2019s a way to know more fully what that place is. It\u2019s also possible that local and municipal politics could be shaped for the better if everyone had a sense of what the entire community actually looked like. We should probably not be too heavily involved in local decisions that could affect people we do not know exist.\n\nIf a tree falls in a bedroom community when everyone is at work, does it make a sound? It\u2019s a good exercise to try and figure that out.\n\nAddison Del Mastro is assistant editor for The American Conservative.
