Scott Donahue, of Park Rapids, was diagnosed with blastomycosis and has been on a ventilator three times, had a tracheotomy, and a feeding tube during a three-month hospital stay, according to Duluth News Tribune.\n\n\u201cThey told my kids the second time I was on a ventilator they should get my family together because I probably wasn\u2019t going to make it,\u201d Donahue, a Type 2 diabetic, told the news outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a really serious thing and I\u2019m lucky to be here.\u201d\n\nCONNECTICUT WOMAN'S EEE-LINKED DEATH MARKS STATE'S FIRST SINCE 2013\n\nDonahue, who has been battling the rare fungus since March, said how he contracted the fungus remains a mystery, as it\u2019s typically found in moist soil and decomposing wood and leaves. He said he doesn\u2019t work with soil and hadn\u2019t been down to his dock because of snow. But their dog, who was diagnosed with the fungal infection in 2018, had been through the woods and down to the water before he started with a hacking cough that progressed to vomiting and convulsing, according to the news outlet.\n\nSymptoms of blastomycosis usually appear between three weeks and three months after a person has breathed in the fungal spores, but not everyone who is exposed will get sick. Those who do fall ill may experience fever, cough, night sweats, muscle aches, weight loss, chest pain and fatigue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nFACE TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT'S DONOR FACE HAS BEEN FAILING, DOCTORS SAY\n\nFor Donahue, his medical issues also started with a severe cough that eventually progressed to vomiting. After five days of antibiotics didn\u2019t help relieve what doctors reportedly thought was pneumonia, one of his sons called an ambulance.\n\nAt Essential Health in Fargo, N.D., a specialist diagnosed him with blastomycosis.\n\n\u201cI literally was in the same position in my hospital bed for almost three months,\u201d he told Duluth News Tribune. \u201cMy back still hurts. I lost 40 pounds. I used to weigh 175 and have pretty good size arm muscles. I use a walker and a cane, look like a twig and have almost no muscle tone. I turned 50 in the hospital.\u201d\n\nHe was eventually released from the hospital in July, and his twin sons moved home to help care for him, according to the news outlet. In addition to physical therapy, he was given an antifungal drug to take for the next year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe fungal infection is considered uncommon by the CDC, with Wisconsin typically accounting for the highest incidence rate. There is no vaccine to prevent the infection, and according to the CDC, it may not be possible to avoid being exposed to the fungus. People with weakened immune systems may want to consider avoiding activities that involve disrupting soil in areas where the fungus may live.", "description": "The man's dog had spent time running through the woods before developing a severe cough which lead to vomiting and convulsing.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/wet_soil_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
