And she says to me, 'Oh, I see a picture of her clearly in my mind.'\"\n\n\"And I just did not understand,\" the Mississauga, Ont., man said.\n\nEbeyer would go on to learn that he had something called aphantasia \u2014 though, at the time of the party, it didn't even have a name yet.\n\nTom Ebeyer, left, with his sister and mom. Growing up, Ebeyer couldn't describe how his mind was different. (Submitted by Tom Ebeyer)\n\nNo mental pictures\n\nWhat exactly is aphantasia? Close your eyes and picture a horse \u2014 what the horse looks like, what's around it.\n\nIf you were able to see a horse in your mind, then you have a mind's eye. But aphantasics like Ebeyer can't visualize anything in their minds.\n\nFor Ebeyer, this would come to a head whenever he was told to imagine something, like in a guided meditation \u2014 and he could never figure out what that meant.\n\n\"I remember feeling confused, I remember feeling extremely frustrated with the 500 blogs about how you could just meditate and you can visualize,\" remembered Ebeyer, \"and it would just drive me crazy\u2026 what are you talking about?\"\n\nWhen Tom Ebeyer realized he couldn't picture things in his head, he thought he was missing out on something. But once he learned there was a name for the way his brain worked \u2014 aphantasia \u2014 he started to see the strengths. 1:00\n\nAfter Ebeyer discovered this about himself, he talked to anyone who would listen, and realized that his differences extend further than the mind's eye. All of the senses are involved.\n\n\"If you go to a restaurant and you see something on the menu that you enjoy, you can smell and taste it. I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Or if you think of a song that you like, you can hear the sounds of the instrument in your mind. I could maybe hum to the rhythm of the music, but I don't actually hear the sound.\"\n\nSo what does imagination mean for those with aphantasia? Ebeyer described it as \"words and numbers just in my head,\" a kind of inner monologue.\n\nProfessor Adam Zeman coined the term 'aphantasia' in 2015 after gathering data from 21 people around the world. (Submitted by Adam Zeman)\n\nThe science of aphantasia\n\nResearch into aphantasia is still in its infancy, and there's lots to explore. For one, aphantasia, exists on a spectrum, where there are some who lack a mind's eye, but have a mind's ear. There are also hyperphantasics, who are at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Those with hyperphantasia have very strong mental imagery.\n\nDescriptions of the trait started popping up in medical journals as early as the 1880s, but the term \"aphantasia\" is fairly new.\n\nIt all started in 2005, when Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology at the University of Exeter in the U.K., encountered a patient who had lost the ability to imagine after undergoing a medical procedure.\n\n\"He was a very bright man in his mid-60s who had previously had a very vivid, visual imagination,\" said Zeman. \"And following this coronary procedure, he just found that he no longer could call images to the mind's eye.\"\n\nAfter running a series of tests, Zeman published an article describing this patient's case as \"Blind Imagination.\"\n\nNearly a decade later, Ebeyer was talking to a colleague about his inability to imagine, and she brought up Zeman's paper. Ebeyer got his hands on the paper and eagerly reached out to Zeman, in the hopes that he might have some answers.\n\nIt turns out that Ebeyer was one of 21 people who contacted Zeman, \"who said that they recognized themselves in the description of [the patient], but they'd always been this way,\" Zeman said.\n\nZeman sent Ebeyer and the 20 others a series of questionnaires, including a VVIQ, a vividness of visual imagery questionnaire , which was designed to rate one's visual imagery.\n\nEbeyer and the others scored very, very low.\n\nTom Ebeyer can experience his senses \u2014 like the view of a lake \u2014 in the moment. But he can't conjure them up later. (Submitted by Tom Ebeyer)\n\nAfter compiling this data, Zeman gave the neurodifference a name: aphantasia. \"Fantasia was the word Aristotle had used to describe the power of imagination,\" explained Ebeyer, \"so aphantasia is without.\"\n\nFinally, there was clarity for Ebeyer and other aphantasics. There was a word to describe how they perceive the world, but more importantly, they were no longer alone.\n\nTwo of a kind\n\nEbeyer had never actually met another aphantasic in person until this past summer, when documentary maker Paul Aflalo connected him with a London, Ont., woman.\n\nAmanda Jacobs, 25, realized she didn't have a mind's eye in early 2019. In fact, her discovery was eerily similar to Ebeyer's.\n\n\"I was reading an article\u2026 about someone who'd had a form of surgery,\" said Jacobs, \"and he woke up from the surgery and claimed that he could not see in his mind, and I'm like, OK, what is this 'seeing in your mind' thing?\"\n\nAmanda Jacobs, 25, had never met a fellow aphantasic before meeting Tom Ebeyer. (Paul Aflalo/CBC)\n\nWhen Ebeyer and Jacobs met over coffee, they quickly realized their similarities. Like Ebeyer, Jacobs can't conjure any of the senses \u2014 sight, sound, taste, smell, touch \u2014 independently of experiencing them in that moment.\n\nAnd for both Ebeyer and Jacobs, this extended further, to emotions and feelings.\n\n\"I have an emotional detachment to most of anything that's ever happened, unless it's right after the fact,\" said Jacobs. \"I remember the facts of what happened, but that emotional response, I don't feel it again.\"\n\nTom Ebeyer can remember events, but he can't re-live the emotions he felt at the time. He explains how his aphantasia makes him literally incapable of holding a grudge. 0:46\n\nEbeyer could relate. In 2007, Ebeyer's mother passed away unexpectedly, and though it was deeply emotional for him when it happened, it's now just a memory with no feelings attached.\n\n\"I know that that happened in my past,\" said Ebeyer, \"but that does not in any way affect my emotional well-being at this moment.\"\n\nFor Ebeyer and Jacobs, meeting each other meant feeling, possibly for the first time, that they weren't alone. \"It's validating,\" Ebeyer said to Jacobs, \"you've explained things\u2026 similar to the way I would explain them.\"\n\nNow that Tom has a word for the way his brain works, he can better explain his differences. (Paul Aflalo/CBC)\n\n\"It's really cool,\" agreed Jacobs. \"Because when I talk to my friends, my family, they just kind of [go] 'Yeah, whatever you say,' and I'm like, 'No, this is real!'\"\n\nNearly nine years after walking home from that party, Ebeyer feels a sense of belonging amidst his difference. He's since started a website devoted to aphantasia and a discussion forum.\n\n\"There's an acceptance, and validation. There's also a lot that's happened in the last nine years, and I'm confident we'll know more in the next ten years.\"\n\nTo hear the full documentary, tap or click the Listen link at the top of this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chris MacKenzie)\n\nPaul Aflalo is a storyteller, documentary filmmaker, radio and podcast producer.
