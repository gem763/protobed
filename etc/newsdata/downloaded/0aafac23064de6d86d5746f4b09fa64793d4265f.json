Recently, the leading streaming entertainment platform rolled out an erotic psychological thriller \u2018Hello Mini\u2019 and believe me, it\u2019s as progressive, bold and exciting as it gets. It is an onscreen adaptation of the page-turning novel \u201cMarry Me, Stranger\u201d by Novoneel Chakraborty.\n\nTo give you a better idea about the show, here\u2019s a quick round-up of the deciding factors.\n\nHere\u2019s What We Think About The Plot\n\nThe story revolves around 22-year-old Rivannah who recently shifted to Mumbai. However, looks like she hasn\u2019t come alone. There\u2019s someone following her - a deranged stalker who\u2019d go to unimaginable lengths to make her life miserable. An air of eeriness traces the course of the show, as the protagonist struggles with frantic phone-calls, creepy messages, someone who\u2019s constantly tracking every footstep of hers, even at her apartment.\n\nAdditionally, the plot is strategically intertwined with instances of harassment, mental illness, infidelity, and a lot of \u201cOh My God\u201d moments.\n\nThe genuine direction brings out the horror of stalking in ways more than one and succeeds in making the show an edge-of-the-seat watch.\n\nWatch The Trailer Here\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was really something!\n\n\n\nActors Bring Their A-Game To The Series\n\nThe cast does a stellar job in padding out the episodes with their convincing performances. Anuja Joshi (as Rivannah) is comfortably bold, winging the independent girl in a city avatar. Be it a steamy scene or a high-tension stalking sequence, she\u2019s got her A-game on. Priya Bannerjee (as Ishita) plays the free-spirited girl to the T. In addition to this, Ankur Rathee (as Abhiraj Mukherjee), and Arjun Aneja (as HR Prateek Basotia) deliver convincing performances as well. The plot has a lot of layers, and the cast does a fine job at bringing them alive on screen.\n\nOur Verdict\n\n'Hello Mini' Season 1 makes for a smooth binge-watch, thanks to its strategically placed cliffhangers, powerful performances, and the myriad of important issues it discusses. All 15 episodes of the show are streaming free on MX Player. Check it out now!", "description": "'Hello Mini' Season 1 makes for a smooth binge-watch, thanks to its strategically placed cliffhangers, powerful performances, and the myriad of important issues it discusses.
