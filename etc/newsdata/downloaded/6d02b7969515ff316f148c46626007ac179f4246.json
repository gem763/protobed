Amy Klobuchar hammered home her message that it\u2019s vital to win \u201cheartland\u201d states to win the White House, saying Democrats need to take their pitch beyond party stalwarts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other people that are dissatisfied with Donald Trump,\u201d the Minnesota Democrat told a local TV station outside a stop in Mason City. \u201cI think we\u2019d be doing a disservice to the citizens of this country if we didn\u2019t also reach out to them.\u201d\n\nA crowd packed a room at the Historic Park Inn Hotel to see Ms. Klobuchar, the latest of the more moderate 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to get a second look from voters.\n\nSome are responding to her pitch that, as a native daughter of the Midwest, she can win back Trump supporters in key Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThose blue-collar voters were the linchpin of Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met her and we know her and we like her,\u201d said JoAnn Hardy, a top Democratic Party official in Cerro Gordo County who talked up the Park Inn event. \u201cI think she definitely has the potential \u2014 she\u2019d make a great president. It\u2019s just trying to break through the pack.\u201d\n\nTo break through, she needs to get past Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, another more moderate candidate vying to supplant former Vice President Joseph R. Biden as the mainstream favorite in the race.\n\nMs. Klobuchar is enjoying a mini-surge lately. She qualified for next month\u2019s debate and raked in more than $2 million in contributions in the immediate aftermath of this month\u2019s debate, where she turned heads by pressing Sen. Elizabeth Warren to explain how she plans to pay for her universal Medicare for All health care proposal.\n\nFresh off a swing through New Hampshire, Ms. Klobuchar hit 5% support in the Granite State in a CNN poll released on Tuesday after not registering at all in a July poll.\n\nHer net favorability rating in New Hampshire has jumped 13 points since July, which was second only to entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u2019s 15-point increase.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire voters are starting to tune into the primary in a serious way, and they are seeing that Amy Klobuchar is the candidate who will unite Americans behind her message of not only winning but winning big in November 2020,\u201d said Scott Merrick, New Hampshire state director for the Klobuchar campaign.\n\nShe has opened a handful of field offices and has held about 30 events across all 10 counties in the state, according to her campaign.\n\nThough she\u2019s certainly looking to capitalize everywhere, a strong performance in Iowa, which shares a border with Minnesota, could be vital to propel her candidacy beyond the early state contests.\n\nIn a recent \u201cstate of the race\u201d memo, Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s campaign described her as \u201cthe senator next door\u201d to Iowa, site of the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s won every race, every place, every time,\u201d campaign manager Justin Buoen said in the memo. \u201cShe is uniquely qualified to win and will do so in a way that brings not just progressives, but independents and moderate Republicans along with her.\u201d\n\nMs. Klobuchar has opened 10 offices across Iowa, and her campaign said she has secured more endorsements from current and former Iowa state legislators than any other candidate in the race.\n\nMs. Hardy said the senator is relatively well-known in the northernmost parts of the state after she crossed the border to campaign for candidates in state legislative races in the past.\n\nMs. Klobuchar gained attention nationally during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh last year.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh ended up apologizing to Ms. Klobuchar after she had asked him if he had ever had so much to drink that he couldn\u2019t remember prior events. The justice had fired back by asking her the same thing.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s young, vigorous,\u201d said Dan Callahan, a top Democratic Party official in Buchanan County, Iowa. \u201cHer and Buttigieg both are Midwest people. They speak to our values, and both of them are making kind of a strong move right now, it looks like.\u201d\n\nSupport for Ms. Klobuchar ticked up slightly from last month in an Iowa State University poll taken after the debate, though she was still in the fifth position at 4%.\n\nMr. Biden sunk to fourth place, and a significant chunk of the former vice president\u2019s previous supporters shifted to back Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, said Dave Peterson, a Whitaker-Lindgren Faculty Fellow in Political Science at Iowa State University.\n\n\u201cShe benefited from Biden\u2019s fall,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the debate performance has helped Klobuchar \u2014 she got a decent amount of attention from that. And she\u2019s been doing a lot of events in Iowa.\u201d\n\nBut it could take something seismic \u2014 such as Mr. Biden deciding it\u2019s in the party\u2019s best interest for him to pull out \u2014 for candidates such as Ms. Klobuchar to truly break into the upper tier of contenders, said Cary Covington, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect that to happen. Jeb Bush didn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t expect Joe to do it,\u201d Mr. Covington said. \u201cBut if he were to do that, that would open the logjam for all of these candidates who are sort of standing in his shadow right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as he\u2019s in the race, [Cory] Booker and Klobuchar in particular and Kamala Harris to a lesser extent \u2014 they just can\u2019t get out from behind that,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
