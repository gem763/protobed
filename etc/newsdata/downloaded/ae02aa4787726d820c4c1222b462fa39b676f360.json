REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments on Tuesday widened the EU ban on pesticides linked to harming bees after deciding not to renew their approval for Bayer\u2019s (BAYGn.DE) insecticide known as thiacloprid.\n\nFarmers will not be allowed to use the insecticide, sold under brands Calypso and Biscaya, after April 30, 2020, when its current approval expires.\n\nA majority of EU countries approved the proposal of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, not to extend approval.\n\nThe Commission based its assessment on findings of the European Food Safety Agency published in January 2019. It highlighted concerns about the active substance being toxic for humans and present in too great a concentration in ground water, an EFSA spokesman said in an email.\n\nThe EU prohibited the use of three so-called neonicotinoids everywhere except greenhouses in April 2018. France has already outlawed all four insecticides and one other, including in greenhouses.", "description": "European Union governments on Tuesday widened the EU ban on pesticides linked to harming bees after deciding not to renew their approval for Bayer's insecticide known as thiacloprid.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443771886&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1BG", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
