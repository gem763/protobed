(AP) - Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier never forgot how quickly things unraveled in Buffalo\u2019s season opener a year ago.\n\nNeither did his players, 10 of them returning starters, who rose up in the face of adversity to play a key role in the Bills\u2019 stunning come-from-behind 17-16 win over the New York Jets.\n\nThough quarterback Josh Allen gets credit for rallying the Bills to overcome a 16-0 deficit over the final 19 minutes, Buffalo wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to win if not for its defense. Buffalo limited the Jets\u2019 offense to no points off of the Bills\u2019 three first-half turnovers - and eight points overall. New York\u2019s other points came off linebacker C.J. Mosley\u2019s interception return and a safety.\n\n\u201cOur defense didn\u2019t flinch,\u201d Frazier said Monday. \u201cThose guys stayed locked in and just concentrated on what they had to do and kept the game manageable, and we found a way.\u201d\n\nThat was a significant turnaround from a year ago, when a comedy of errors - including two interceptions by Nathan Peterman - had the Bills trailing 26-0 at halftime of an eventual 47-3 loss at Baltimore.\n\nFrazier credited coach Sean McDermott for putting the defense in various adverse situations throughout the offseason to see how the players would respond.\n\n\u201cSean did a great job throughout the offseason of \u2026 making us have to deal with some situations where sometimes you\u2019re like, \u2018Is this really going to happen,\u2019\u201d Frazier said, without going into detail. \u201cI felt very confident that we weren\u2019t the same group.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nBuffalo\u2019s defense picked up where it left off last year, when it allowed the second-fewest yards in the NFL. The Jets combined for one first down and 33 net yards offense immediately following the Bills\u2019 three turnovers - and 223 yards overall.\n\nBuffalo forced seven punts, matching a season high set three times last year, had four sacks, and didn\u2019t give up a play longer than 19 yards.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nBall security. Allen was credited with committing all four turnovers, and he could\u2019ve had at least one more if Marcus Maye\u2019s interception wasn\u2019t negated by Darryl Roberts being flagged for defensive holding.\n\nBoth interceptions were off tipped balls, including Mosley\u2019s pick-6, which bounced off the hands of receiver Cole Beasley. Allen lost one fumble while being sacked and another as a result of an errant exchange with center Mitch Morse, who missed a majority of the offseason due to core muscle surgery and a concussion.\n\nTurnovers were an issue for Allen during his rookie season, when he finished with 12 interceptions and lost two fumbles.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nReceiver John Brown, who signed with the Bills this offseason a year after turning them down to sign with Baltimore. He finished with seven catches for 123 yards and scored the deciding touchdown on a 38-yard reception with three minutes left. Brown\u2019s 123 yards receiving were the most by a Buffalo player since Sammy Watkins had 154 in a 34-31 loss to Miami on Dec. 24, 2016.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nReceiver Robert Foster, who was on the field for just 15 offensive snaps a year after finishing second on the team with 541 yards receiving and three touchdowns.\n\nINJURED\n\nStarting nickel back Taron Johnson\u2019s status remains uncertain after hurting his hamstring in the third quarter. McDermott says WR/KR Andre Roberts is improving after missing the opener with a quadriceps injury.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n6 - With 254 yards passing, Allen became Buffalo\u2019s first quarterback to top 200 yards in six consecutive games since Drew Bledsoe did that in his first six games with the Bills to open 2002.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nIt\u2019s back to the Meadowlands, with Buffalo preparing to face the New York Giants (0-1). After limiting Jets running back Le\u2019Veon Bell to 60 yards rushing and 32 receiving, plus a touchdown and 2-point conversion, the defense braces for Saquon Barkley. The Giants\u2019 workhorse had 120 yards rushing and 19 receiving in 35-17 loss at Dallas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier never forgot how quickly things unraveled in Buffalo's season opener a year ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/bills_jets_football_10608_c0-156-3736-2334_s1770x1032.jpg?1695e4d1b61edd9aa93144c599917e560d283c57", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
