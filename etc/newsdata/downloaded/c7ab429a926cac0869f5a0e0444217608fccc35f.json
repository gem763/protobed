Council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) \u2014 is scheduled to begin at 4:15 p.m. in Farragut Square. Hundreds of workers clad in the union\u2019s signature purple are expected to work their way past cars and buses along K Street, turn onto 19th Street NW, march past the World Bank building and continue onto Pennsylvania Avenue before circling up 17th Street toward the park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI stand behind janitors and 32BJ SEIU in their collective-bargaining efforts to get a fair contract,\u201d Nadeau said in a statement released by the SEIU. \u201cIn order to give our working families a fighting chance, we must be creating jobs that provide living-wage salaries and benefits.\u201d\n\nLast week, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) ushered waves of protesters into the street with a megaphone in hand.\n\nShe joined the group in a chant of \u201cs\u00ed, se puede\u201d and told them the District \u201ccannot move forward without the people that help to make our office buildings work.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the workers who will participate in Thursday\u2019s march spend their days cleaning and maintaining buildings along the SEIU\u2019s planned protest route: the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other businesses around International Square.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese are very prestigious sites, and it just highlights how important the work that they do is,\u201d said SEIU spokeswoman Julie Karant.\n\nBowser was joined last week by D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) and council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), who each took a turn addressing the crowd.\n\nOrganizers said the city leaders\u2019 presence sends a message to the workers \u2014 and employers \u2014 that the District values the workers and stands behind their pursuit of strong labor protections, better hours and wages of at least $15 an hour.\n\nIn Loudoun County, janitors are bargaining for their first labor contract. Negotiations with the Washington Service Contractors Association began Sept. 15.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are only a few days away from the contract\u2019s expiration, and we are still far\u201d from reaching an agreement, Karant said. \u201cNobody wants to go on strike, but they are certainly willing to do whatever it takes to support their families.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe demonstration will be the fourth in about three weeks to converge on D.C. streets during rush hour. The first two protests, in September, involved activists who rallied in support of action to tackle climate change.\n\nD.C. police did not issue a permit for the protest, but Karant said police had assured SEIU organizers that officers would be on site to secure the march as it works its way through traffic.\n\nAD", "description": "If the workers cannot reach an agreement by Oct. 15, thousands of janitors and building workers have threatened to strike.", "authors": ["Marissa J.
