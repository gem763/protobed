(NYSE: ) , Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (TSX: ) , Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ) and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) .\n\n4 Impressive Liquid Stocks for Maximum Returns\n\nInvestors may consider allocating their assets to stocks with favorable liquidity positions for big returns. Liquidity indicates a company\u2019s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.\n\nHowever, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.\n\nHence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of its underlying financial strength.\n\nMeasures to Identify Liquid Stocks\n\nCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company\u2019s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio \u2014 also known as working capital ratio \u2014 below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.\n\nQuick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio \u2014 also called \u201cacid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" \u2014 indicates a company\u2019s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.\n\nCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company\u2019s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.\n\nSo, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company\u2019s financial condition.\n\nFor the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks.com at:https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/544337/4-impressive-liquid-stocks-for-maximum-returns\n\nDisclosure: Officers, directors and/or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and/or hold long and/or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material.
