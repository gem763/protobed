I\u2019m naturally very shiny in my T-zone, and even though I do love to shine, there can be too much shine. If I\u2019m getting off an airplane or out at night for an event, I\u2019ll just tap on some powder. I\u2019ll never forget being a young model and starting to make my own money \u2014 this was one of the first things that I bought that was like, Wow, I\u2019ve made it. I bought a Chanel translucent powder at duty-free, and I was so proud to have it in my purse. I still feel that way when I see the Chanel logo.
