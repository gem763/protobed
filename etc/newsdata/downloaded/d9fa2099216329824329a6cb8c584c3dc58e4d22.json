One of the images shows her holding her holding her Birdie Mae. \"6 months. 100 pounds down (Yes, I tipped the scales at 240 ),\" Jessica wrote in the caption. \"My first trip away from #BIRDIEMAE and emotional for many reasons, but so proud to feel like myself again. Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder. \"\n\nClearly, dropping 100 pounds in six months sounds pretty remarkable\u2014and Jessica's followers chimed in to ask what exactly she did to lose the weight (seriously\u2013most of the comments are asking her how she did it). Jessica didn't divulge how she lost the weight (or at what rate), but it begs the question: Is it healthy to lose that much weight in such a short amount of time?\n\nRELATED: 8 Unexpected Ways Your Body Might Change After You Have a Baby\n\nThe short, totally underwhelming answer: It depends.\n\nTake Jessica's recent pregnancy, for instance: She mentioned her highest weight was 240, which means that some of those pounds that she eventually lost would have been the baby, placenta, fluids, and blood volume, says Cynthia Sass, Health contributing nutrition editor.\n\nWhether or not Jessica breastfed could've also played a role in her weight loss. Breastfeeding burns extra calories (about 300 to 500 a day, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office on Women\u2019s Health), which helps speed up weight loss in postpartum women.\n\nAccording to the US National Library of Medicine, a division of the National Institutes of Health, it's healthy for postpartum women to lose about a pound and a half a week, and most women return to their pre-pregnancy weight by six to 12 months after delivery.\n\nRELATED: 10 Reasons Breastfeeding Is Good for You\n\nPostpartum weight loss aside, healthy weight loss in general takes place gradually, typically at a rate of one to two pounds per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014that's because, per the CDC, healthy weight loss isn't about a diet or a program, it's about lifestyle changes that can last long-term through healthy eating and exercise habits.", "description": "\"Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder.\"", "authors": ["Samantha Lauriello"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WEfAlOm1YoIvJKYEO1VTBw--~B/aD0xOTc2O3c9MzUxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/health_338/304a923a9e5d65ffda74545826e9f41c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
