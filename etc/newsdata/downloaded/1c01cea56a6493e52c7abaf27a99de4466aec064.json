The San Francisco-based startup just doubled its valuation to $6.2 billion with this round, too.\n\nDatabricks also announced that it has hired David Conte as its CFO. Conte had served as CFO of the data analytics company Splunk, which he joined in 2011, a year before it went public. Conte had retired in May.\n\nDatabricks cofounder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said that despite the company's maturity, and its big new valuation, an IPO is \"not imminent.\"\n\nBut he also noted Conte's background, saying his new CFO joined Splunk when they had $100 million in revenue and left them when they were close to $20 billion of market cap.\n\nDatabricks hired the CFO who took Splunk public\n\n\"He took them public, and has taken other companies public,\" he told Business Insider. \"So he has a lot of experience with public markets. It's not hard to imagine that this is something that's going to happen down the line.\"\n\nIn any case, raising capital does not appear to be a problem for Databricks, which just raised $250 million in February. Ghodsi there was so much interest in the new round they could have raised up to $900 million, but opted to take in only an additional $400 million.\n\n\"We shared numbers and forecasts for everybody on what we're going to do, and we completely blew those numbers out of the water,\" he said. \"And it's largely thanks to this crazy demand.\"\n\nAsked about recent disappointing debuts of other famous unicorns, such as WeWork and Uber, Ghodsi said he was not concerned. The demand for Databricks' offering is strong, which even makes them confident about sharing financials that other unicorns may be reluctant to disclose.\n\nIn February, Databricks disclosed an annual rate of $100 million. The startup just updated that to $200 million.\n\n\"It's easier to do when the numbers are great,\" he said.\n\nDatabricks now has more than 5,000 customers\n\nDatabricks is part of a growing trend of cloud startups that use AI to manage and draw valuable insights from massive amounts of data. The company now has more than 800 employees and more than 5,000 customers, including Comcast, Shell, Expedia and Bechtel.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup has big plans for the funds aimed mainly at boosting its R&D efforts and for aggressive international expansion. Databricks will invest 100 million Euros in an engineering hub it launched in Amsterdam called the European Development Center.\n\nIt will also set up dedicated engineering teams for its open source technologies focused on data management and machine learning.\n\nThe company also plans to expand to key international areas, including Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.\n\nDatabricks has a major development center in San Francisco. But Ghodsi said expanding in Europe is important \"given some of the issues with visas and Green Cards in the US.\"\n\n\"It's great to have a second large development center,\" he said. \"This gives us some alternatives.\"\n\nGhodsi was born in Iran and fled with his family to Sweden during the 1979 revolution. He grew up and was educated in Sweden where he started a career in academe. He joined UC Berkeley in 2009 as a visiting professor, and ended up being part of major projects focused on developing new cloud technologies, particularly in data processing and AI.\n\nHe was involved in the development of Apache Spark, the major open source project for analyzing large amounts of data.\n\nGot a tip about Databricks or another tech company?
