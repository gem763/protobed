Brighter Futures\u201d; and eventually captured the attention of best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell, who included the work in his book \u201cOutliers: The Story of Success.\u201d\n\nBut recently, a pair of researchers has questioned whether decades-old research focused on a single school district should dominate policy discussions.\n\nThe pioneering work in question is the Beginning School Study, which tracked a representative random sample of first-graders who entered Baltimore City Public Schools in the fall of 1982 and found that by ninth grade, two-thirds of the increase in the achievement gap between poor and privileged students could be traced to differences in summer learning during the elementary years.\n\n\u201cThe Baltimore study was well done, but it\u2019s a historical fact,\u201d said Paul von Hippel, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIt was true for those kids on that test at that time. It does not seem to replicate.\u201d\n\nAs evidence, he offers examples of modern achievement tests that don\u2019t show a widening summer learning gap.\n\nBut even modern tests don\u2019t always agree, and using disparate results from dissimilar tests to demonstrate that one set of outcomes is superior to another is difficult at best.\n\n\u201cThere are at least five possible reasons why you might get answers about summer learning loss that are different from the original Beginning School Study,\u201d said Derek Briggs, director of the Center for Assessment, Design, Research and Evaluation at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you or the children in your life experienced the \u2018summer slide\u2019? If so, what\u2019s the solution? Join the conversation below.\n\nDifferences in: student populations; curricula; testing standards; scaling methods used to score tests; or common items, the overlapping content that allows student performance to be evaluated across grades, could all have an effect.\n\n\u201cChanges in achievement are based on performance on the same items,\u201d Dr. Briggs said. \u201cIf the way the items were chosen shifted, then it\u2019s hard to disentangle whether the reason you\u2019re seeing different things is because of scaling or because different common items were chosen, or because something else changed.\u201d\n\nIn articles published this year in the journals Sociological Science and Education Next, Dr. von Hippel and Caitlin Hamrock, director of research at the E3 Alliance, a nonprofit that serves Texas students, wrote that a primary reason some newer tests fail to show the same summer learning gap as the BSS is because modern tests are scored differently.\n\nThey acknowledge the tests they examined also differed in other ways, and they note that some contemporary tests do show summer learning loss.\n\nBut if the only difference between modern tests and the BSS were how they were scaled, psychometricians who measure educational achievement would anticipate the results to show the same trends, if not the same magnitude of variance.\n\n\u201cI would generally expect the direction to be the same, but a gap that looks huge in one type of model might not look so big in another type of model,\u201d said Leah Feuerstahler, an assistant professor of psychology at Fordham University who researches psychometric models.\n\nIn other words, if the Beginning School Study could be rescored using modern scaling methods, psychometricians would still expect to see widening achievement gaps, though the size of the gaps might differ. (That experiment isn\u2019t possible because the underlying data no longer exist.)\n\nSo, do contemporary test results disprove the existence of the summer slide?\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine may soon offer some insight. A committee was convened last year to study the state of the science on how summertime experiences affect school-age children, and the results are expected to be published later this month.\n\nIn the meantime, Karl Alexander, a sociologist who with his Johns Hopkins colleague Doris Entwisle conducted the BSS, has defended his work in the August issue of Education Next. And on one thing he agrees with his critics: \u201cWhy should we have to reach back 30 or more years to make the case for summer learning loss?\u201d Dr. Alexander writes.\n\n\u201cI, too, would welcome new and better data on this important topic.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com", "description": "A groundbreaking 1982 study found that learning slows for all children in the summertime and the achievement gap separating the rich and poor expands.
