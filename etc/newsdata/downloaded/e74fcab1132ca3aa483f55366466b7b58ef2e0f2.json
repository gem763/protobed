Visiting keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had saved brilliantly to deny Zaniolo but from the resulting corner, Dzeko was left completely unmarked at the far post and headed home.\n\nJavier Pastore and Chris Smalling had chances to increase Roma's advantage as the visitors continued to look susceptible at set-plays.\n\nAC Milan had momentarily drawn level after Theo Hernandez found the net for the visitors\n\nIt was another strong outing for Man United's Chris Smalling as he continues to impress in Italy\n\nThe result means pressure continues to grow on Milan new head coach Stefano Pioli\n\nPioli's men were handed a lifeline 10 minutes into the second half when Davide Calabria crossed and Theo Hernandez diverted home the equaliser via a deflection.\n\nBut just three minutes later, Milan squandered possession and Dzeko teed up Zaniolo who rifled home what proved to be the winning goal from the edge of the box.\n\nSubstitute Gianluca Mancini could have extended Roma's lead from another corner, Pastore had an effort ruled out for offside, and Donnarumma saved well to deny Zaniolo.\n\nMilan came close to grabbing a scarcely deserved draw in stoppage time but midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu drilled his shot into the side-netting.", "description": "Nicolo Zaniolo scored the winner as Roma heaped more misery on ailing AC Milan in Serie A by grabbing a 2-1 win at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday to make it six games unbeaten,", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20259764-0-image-a-9_1572219376454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
