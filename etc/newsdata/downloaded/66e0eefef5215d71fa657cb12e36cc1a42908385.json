One of the greatest experiences I had with working on both those episodes was that they were so open to bringing my ideas, particularly about battle scenes and how battles worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would\u2019ve definitely added my strategy and knowledge to that.\u2019\n\nFrom The Descent to Westworld, Neil has had endless experience in creating the horrifying and impactful movies and series, so it was no surprise when he created some of the best battle scenes in Game of Thrones.\n\nNeil wouldn\u2019t have rushed the final two episodes (Picture: HBO/Home Box Office, Inc.)\n\nThey all deserved better (Picture: HBO)\n\nNeil said: \u2018I kind of agree with a lot of the criticism that it was really rushed.\n\n\u2018Everyone ended up where they were meant to end up but they got there in a little bit of a rush in the end.\u2019\n\nGame of Thrones creator George RR Martin had also agreed with the extreme backlash to the series.\n\nHe lashed out at HBO producers for forcing him to throw the spotlight on characters he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have and cutting the finale short.\n\n\u2018It can be\u2026 traumatic,\u2019 the creator of Westeros told Fast Company. \u2018Because sometimes their creative vision and your creative vision don\u2019t match, and you get the famous creative differences thing \u2014 that leads to a lot of conflict.\n\n\u2018The [final] series has been\u2026 not completely faithful. Otherwise, it would have to run another five seasons.\n\n\u2018You get totally extraneous things like the studio or the network weighing in, and they have some particular thing that has nothing to do with story, but relates to \u201cWell this character has a very high Q Rating so let\u2019s give him a lot more stuff to do.\u201d\u2019\n\nLondoners won\u2019t be able to look at the Thames the same way again (Picture: Neil Marshall/Kraken Rum)\n\nIt might be a while until GOT fans get over what they felt like was a betrayal, George RR Martin is a bit too busy with the prequel Bloodmoon to dwell too hard on it and Neil has got his hands full with his upcoming movie The Reckoning and a super unnerving interactive experience Kraken Screamfest: Director\u2019s Cut happening in London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho\u2019s down?\n\n\u2018I wanted to do something that was different from everything I\u2019ve done before,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018All the dead and millions who have died at sea: ship captains, the pirates, the cruise liners are now coming back from the sea.\u2019\n\nSpooky.\n\nExpect to see the terrifying Kraken and a lot more shock-inducing undead characters who will be haunting London for two nights only.\n\nKraken Screamfest: Director\u2019s Cut will take place from Thursday, October 31 to Friday, November 1, at 2083 Acton Mews, Haggerston, London E8 4DG.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
