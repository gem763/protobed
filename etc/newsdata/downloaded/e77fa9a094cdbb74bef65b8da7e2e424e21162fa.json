The request said the goal wasn\u2019t to support the long-shot presidential bid, but rather to get in his good graces.\n\nAnother email and fliers soon appeared to follow, carrying a much more direct implication of quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cPlease help out with the one-dollar campaign so that he can get into the Democratic debate,\u201d reads an image of a poster emailed to POLITICO, according to a translator who is fluent in Yiddish. | POLITICO\n\n\u201cPlease help out with the one-dollar campaign so that he can get into the Democratic debate,\u201d reads an image of a poster emailed to POLITICO, according to a translator who is fluent in Yiddish. \u201cThe mayor promises that the new [synagogue] will be open for [us] ahead of the upcoming Sukkos holiday.\u201d\n\nA similar email sent to POLITICO said, \u201cthe mayor promised great favors\u201d including a \u201cpromise to remove the ban on entering our holy community\u2019s new bet midrash,\u201d where religious studies are conducted. \u201cNow you have the chance, once and for all, to save the future. Don\u2019t miss [the] opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe synagogue in question, a hulking frame of a building occupying a half-block in South Williamsburg, is at the center of a bitter fight that has split the Satmars in two. Aaron Teitelbaum heads up one sect while his brother Zalman leads the other, and each believes he is the rightful successor to their late father\u2019s leadership post \u2014 and the site on Bedford Avenue.\n\nThe correspondence, professionally translated by Arun Viswanath for POLITICO, indicates the Zalman faction secured a commitment from de Blasio to have his Department of Buildings allow construction to move forward on the property, which has been stalled for a decade by a stop-work order.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office insists that is not the case.\n\n\u201cAny allegations of quid pro quo activity are completely false and inaccurate. As always, decisions are made strictly based on merit,\u201d said mayoral spokesperson Avery Cohen. The stop-work order is still in place.\n\nRepresentatives of the Zalman faction went a step further, alleging it was a setup orchestrated by their rivals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doctored. There\u2019s no such email. It\u2019s doctored. It\u2019s a fact,\u201d Abe Deutsch, a politically active Satmar, told POLITICO in an interview. \u201cThe mayor is a very smart person and he\u2019s not going to do things that are not according to the law and we are not going to ask him something that is not according to the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do crazy things. He\u2019s running for president,\u201d he added. \u201cAll eyes are open on him.\u201d\n\nHe said a real email would have included a link to the mayor\u2019s fundraising page.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if [they] wanted to do damage, at least let the mayor get a few dollars,\u201d he added. \u201cYou want to do damage to him, at least let him get $50.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO reached out to the email address from which the fundraising plea came. A reply echoed Deutsch\u2019s comments: \u201cWe are aware of forged emails and posters that were spread in an obvious attempt to hurt us and the de Blasio campaign.\u201d\n\nHowever, a representative from the Aronite section of the community shot back that there was no forgery, and that the group was not involved in any fundraising for the mayor's presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI have no clue,\u201d Rabbi Moishe Indig, who represents the followers of Aaron, said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\nThe rewards of wading into the dispute have thus far been lackluster for de Blasio, who hopes to qualify for another debate scheduled for October. A fundraising page set up by the Satmar community on ActBlue.com showed 682 contributions for a total of $877 as of Thursday \u2014 far short of the stated 10,000 donation goal.\n\nThe mayor has publicly distanced himself from big money in politics and characterized his campaign as grassroots. However, nearly all of the cash he has been using to travel around the country and meet voters in early primary states has come from a small group of donors in New York City real estate, finance and legal circles. Some of those have business before the city.\n\nIn addition, the mayor\u2019s questionable use of two political action committees has already netted a formal complaint to the Federal Election Commission.", "description": "What began as a request for contributions to qualify for the upcoming primary debates has become the latest chapter in a family feud.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg", "Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d2/51/64ef6d0741dfaa7f89fd4aaaa7b5/0829deblas.jpg"}
