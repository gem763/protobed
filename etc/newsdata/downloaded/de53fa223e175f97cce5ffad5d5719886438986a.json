This is a no-brainer. What's sickening is when some of us blame a sick animal for its condition then give it hell when the bill at the vet's office turns out to be huge.\n\nSomething like this happened recently. A video of a man, thrashing his dog at the vet's office, is going viral. The sick man, hurled his ailing dog because the bill from its treatment was expensive.\n\nIn the video one can see that the man in grey shirt almost tears the dog off from the hands of the vet who was about to put the dog in a cage.\n\nMan ruthlessly hurls dog to the floor & kicks it after allegedly seeing the high medical bill https://t.co/MbcG0zR0Rd pic.twitter.com/eHNqblY8YB \u2014 Mothership.sg (@MothershipSG) October 7, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 315 SHARES 161 SHARES 164 SHARES 53 K SHARES\n\nAfter that, the man hurls his own dog to the ground with all its might. The dog seems to be lying there motionless but the man did not stop there. He starts kicking his dog in the face and neck area! Thankfully one of the nurses/attendants, angered by the man intervenes and kicks and pushes him away from the already sick dog.\n\nWe absolutely share the sentiments of the woman. How can a person who has lived with an animal be so cruel towards it only because its medical bill was expensive?\n\nIf only he realised that he could not afford the dog, he could have later given it up for adoption. The video is enraging; the man should actually be punished for animal cruelty.\n\nThere is no update on what happened to the dog, we just hope that it is safe and alive and not back with this monster of an owner.", "description": "A lot of consideration should go into the decision of having pets; you should have a welcoming and friendly home, you should have time for you and most importantly you should be able to afford its living.
