Will this one be male or female I wonder?\n\n\u2018Think Hessy has already been one of the chosen ones, like Nessy but less elusive.\u2019\n\n\u2018It seems to be doing fine,\u2019 Julia Cable, national co-ordinator for BDMLR, said.\n\n\u2018We watched it doing normal diving and surfacing behaviour. It is surfacing once every five or six minutes, which is normal.\u2019\n\nHumpback whales are one of the world\u2019s largest animals with adults ranging in length from 39 to 52 feet (Picture: PA)\n\nWhile humpback whales are sometimes seen off the British coast further north, Ms Cable said it was \u2018very unusual\u2019 for one to be seen within the Thames Estuary.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very likely that it just made a navigational error,\u2019 she added.\n\nHumpback whales are one of the world\u2019s largest animals with adults ranging in length from 39 to 52 feet and weighing around 30 tons.\n\nKnown for their lilting song, humpbacks feed in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth, fasting and living off their fat reserves. The balleen whale\u2019s diet consists mostly of krill and small fish.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
