Since the start of Monday\u2019s trading in Asia, WTI had reached as high as $63.47, for an intraday gain of 15%.\n\n, the international benchmark blend, settled at $69.02, up $8.80, or nearly 14.6%. It topped out at $64.83 earlier in the session, a 19% gain.\n\nThese were the biggest intraday gains since the 1991 Gulf War that sent crude spiking after the U.S. entered into battle with Iraq to free Kuwait from Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion.\n\n\"The impact and the next course of action will depend on the duration of the outage,\u201d said Vima Jayabalan, research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\nMackenzie added that, \u201cSaudi Arabia has enough reserves to cover the shortfall over the next week, but if the outage extends, then filling the gap with the right type of crude quality could be a challenge. Moreover, OPEC+ output cut predominantly consists of medium and heavy sour crudes.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s drone-based attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s main oil processing complex, Abqaiq, and the neighboring Khurais oil field halved the kingdom\u2019s crude output by half and daily world supply by 5%.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal initially quoted unidentified Saudi officials as saying that the Saudis expect to have a third of output, or 2 million barrels per day, restored by Monday and to rebalance supply in the coming days. But Reuters cited two sources at Saudi state oil company Aramco as saying that a full return to normal production volumes \"may take months.\"\n\nAdding to the traders\u2019 dilemma was how Saudi Arabia and its main ally, the United States, planned to respond to the attacks. Yemen-based Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the raids, but U.S. officials overwhelmingly accused Iran.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has said he\u2019s open to holding talks with Tehran to resolve his own country\u2019s sanctions conflict with the Islamic Republic, declined to name Iran as a suspect, though he said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond.\n\nMonday\u2019s rally came off market highs after Trump said he had instructed the release of emergency crude supplies from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is not known how much of SPR crude will be required to stabilize global supplies in the aftermath of the Saudi attacks. The affected Abqaiq processing complex and Khurais oil field in the kingdom accounted for nearly 6 million barrels per day of production.\n\nThe other thing holding the crude rally in check was the slide on Wall Street, as airline stocks tumbled on worries about pricier jet fuel, even as shares of oil companies surged.", "description": "Biggest Oil Rally in 3 Decades; What Next?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5T0TT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
