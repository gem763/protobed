He\u2019s mending, he\u2019s recovering.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on a few days off working but he\u2019s away from here, and then there\u2019s a picture. When you\u2019re at Man United, you do get pictures, speculation, I don\u2019t have any problem with that at all.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has insisted that he does not have a problem with images of Paul Pogba meeting Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane.
