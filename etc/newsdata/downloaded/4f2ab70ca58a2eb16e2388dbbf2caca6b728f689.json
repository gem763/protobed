In the Montreal area, that number climbs to 81.6.\n\nAsked about the survey, Jolin-Barrette said \"the city of Montreal is a French city,\" according to its own charter.\n\n\"We have to be proud of that distinctive situation,\" he said, pointing out that it's the largest French-speaking city in North America.\n\nThe online poll, conducted between Aug. 4 and Sept. 4, surveyed 1, 937 Quebecers, which included 1019 English-speaking Quebecers, 773 French-speaking Quebecers and 144 persons whose first language is neither English nor French.", "description": "The Quebec government says it has no plans to introduce legislation to force businesses to greet customers in French only,\u00a0instead of with the \"bonjour/hi\" used in many Montreal stores.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311691.1570461070!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/simon-jolin-barrette.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
