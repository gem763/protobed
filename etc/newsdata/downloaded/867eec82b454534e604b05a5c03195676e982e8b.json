It was an accident.\n\n'We both went up for a header, I had to flick the ball backwards and he tried to score. He headed the back of my head and broke his nose.\n\n'I didn't know I had done it until the next day when it was all over the papers. I was getting a lot of messages like I meant to do it, but It was alright.\n\n'He didn't kick me in training after that. I got a little bit of stick. It was light hearted, a lot of banter. I got back to school and people were asking about it. My mates had all seen it.'\n\nTomori has made some big strides since then during loan spells at Brighton, Hull and Derby - under his current Chelsea boss Frank Lampard last season - and now graduated from Chelsea's academy, benefitting from his manager's faith in youth.\n\nChelsea boys Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori at England HQ in St George's Park\n\nAnother step up awaits following his elevation to the England squad which has come quicker than he expected having made just eight Chelsea appearances this season.\n\nLampard allowed David Luiz to leave Chelsea for Arsenal safe in the knowledge he had Tomori coming through and currently rates the youngster as one of his top two defenders.\n\nSouthgate is a fan too and if he likes what he sees in training enough to hand Tomori a senior debut against either Czech Republic or Bulgaria any doubts about his international future will be over.\n\nTomori is also eligible to play for Canada, where he was born, and Nigeria.\n\nLike Abraham, defender Tomori is still eligible to represent other nations than England\n\nHe said: 'The last international break I didn't get a call-up from anyone. This international break, I was waiting for a call up and England called me up.\n\n'It wasn't England all the way. I had certain people and certain things that I had to consider.\n\n'I spoke to my family and people that I care about it and that's the decision I came to.\n\n'When England came calling, it was difficult to say no.'", "description": "Fikayo Tomori first made a name for himself as he came through the ranks at Chelsea when he broke Diego Costa's nose.
