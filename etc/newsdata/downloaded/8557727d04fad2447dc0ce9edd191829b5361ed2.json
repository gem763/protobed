Currently classed as a violent typhoon \u2014 the highest classification on the typhoon scale \u2014 forecasters are hoping that the storm may weaken slightly as it approaches the mainland, but nobody is taking any chances with its potential to do extensive damage, especially in light of the problems caused by last month\u2019s strong typhoon.\n\nWith safety at the forefront of everybody\u2019s minds, news and weather agencies have been sending out updates and alerts to the public on Twitter, and on Wednesday the national broadcaster, NHK, sent out an alert addressed to a specific subset of the public: foreigners.\n\nThe tweet (above) reads: \u201cTo all foreigners. Typhoon number 19 looks set to approach West to North Japan on 12-13 October. Typhoon number 19 is large and very strong. Please be careful.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with the message, which has been sent out in the interests of protecting foreigners in Japan, some people are taking issue with the way the message has been written. Instead of using regular Japanese, which incorporates complex kanji characters, the message has been simplified to be written entirely in hiragana, the fundamental syllabary first learnt at the beginner stage of studying the language.\n\nIn its everyday usage, Japanese is generally never written out solely in hiragana, and some took offense to what they felt was a dumbing-down of the language for foreigners. Others mentioned that an all-hiragana message is much more confusing to read and comprehend than kanji, especially as it\u2019s never written out this way.\n\nSome admonished the public broadcaster for not writing the message in English instead, while others piped up to remind them that not all foreigners speak English, making a simplified Japanese message useful.\n\nOthers commended NHK for providing an easy-to-understand alternative to the many other kanji-filled Japanese messages about the typhoon on the internet.\n\nSome saw the benefit of simplified Japanese notices, which can even be useful for native-born readers of the language with learning difficulties, but the fact that this message was specifically addressed to gaikokujin (\u201cforeigners\u201d) became a sore point.\n\nSo, given the many different opinions on the topic, why did NHK choose to write their message in hiragana? Well, included in the tweet is a link to a NHK news site called \u201cNews Web Easy\u201d, which contains \u201cNews written in easy Japanese\u201d. On this site, news articles are published in regular Japanese \u2014 with kanji \u2014 but they also include kana (hiragana written in smaller font above the kanji) to make it easier to read for beginners.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no option to include kana above kanji characters on Twitter, and the limited character space would make writing the kana in brackets after the kanji, which is sometimes done in a class context, more problematic.\n\nWhile people argued over NHK\u2019s all-hiragana message, there\u2019s actually a valid reason behind their decision to use the simplified language option. \u201cYasashii Japanese,\" as it\u2019s known, which translates to \u201cEasy Japanese\u201c, is a means of providing essential information to foreigners in Japan that came about following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995. At this time, it became apparent that there needed to be a way to accurately convey information in the event of a disaster or emergency for people who don\u2019t fully understand Japanese and English.\n\nEasy Japanese is also being promoted on the Tokyo Metropolitan Government\u2019s 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics Multilingual Support Council site. According to the site, this style of communication is \u201csimpler than ordinary Japanese and easy to understand for foreigners\u201c.\n\nThe need for simplified Japanese notices became evident after the Ministry of Justice conducted a survey in 2016 that found only 44 percent of foreign residents understand English, but 62.6 percent understand Japanese. With Japanese being the more widely understood language amongst foreign residents, a simpler type of Japanese was adopted to accommodate all levels of Japanese language ability, as a common way of conveying information to foreigners.\n\nIn addition to all this, if machine translations are used by people with a basic level of Japanese reading comprehension, the result of the machine translation can then be cross-checked with the easy Japanese version so that the reader can more fully understand what\u2019s being said.\n\nAll in all, no matter where you stand on the debate over NHK\u2019s \u201cEasy Japanese\u201d tweet, it\u2019s clearly evident that there are plenty of tweets offering information on Typhoon Hagibis right now in English and ordinary Japanese. For those who don\u2019t speak English but have a grasp of Japanese, however, there may be less information directly available from Japan sources, and that\u2019s largely who NHK\u2019s tweet will likely resonate with.\n\nStill, no matter where you\u2019re from or where you stand in terms of Japanese language ability, the most important thing is that you stay up to date with the progress of the storm and stay safe as Typhoon Hagibis approaches. And whatever you do, don\u2019t be that person who calls up for a pizza in the middle of a typhoon, endangering the lives of pizza delivery drivers like this one who battled Typhoon Jebi in Osaka.\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Typhoon alert goes off on train commuters\u2019 phones, tourists mistake it for Godzilla attack\n\n-- Typhoon Jebi hits Japan, blows away cars, roofs, and building facades \u3010Pics & Videos\u3011\n\n-- Typhoon Lionrock delays production of Calbee potato chips\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/11/typhoon-warning-from-nhk-japan-to-all-foreigners-causes-controversy-online/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Japan is currently lying in wait for the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, which is threatening to be the strongest typhoon of the season.
