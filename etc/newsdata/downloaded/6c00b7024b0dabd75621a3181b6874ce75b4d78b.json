It's not the only GoT spin-off project in the works at HBO: Naomi Watts is starring in a separate spin-off that began shooting this winter, and has since moved into post-production.\n\nFire & Blood begins with Aegon the Conqueror, whose death triggered the events of the first Game of Thrones season, and focuses on the timeline all the way up to the civil war that nearly destroyed the Targaryen family. Deadline is reporting that the war, which is known as the Dance of the Dragons and took place 170 years before the war involving the Baratheons, Starks, Greyjoys, and other families and players in Westeros.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin intimated on his LiveJournal in May that one of HBO's prequel series was based on Fire & Blood, adding that one of the shows he was \"not supposed to call THE LONG NIGHT will be shooting later this year\".\n\n\"Two other shows remain in the script stage, but are edging closer. What are they about? I cannot say. But maybe some of you should pick up a copy of FIRE & BLOOD and come up with your own theories,\" Martin said.", "description": "If you didn't have enough Game of Thrones in your life, HBO's reportedly given the green light to a prequel that's set to follow House Targaryen from the beginning....", "authors": ["Leah Williams", "Cecilia D'Anastasio"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2017/08/Game-of-Thrones-season-7-episode-2-dragonstone-dany-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
