Photo: Krithika Varagur\n\nI\u2019m a connoisseur of wet places, having spent the last few years in tropical Indonesia and then England. I\u2019ve had to learn the difference between water-resistant and 100 percent waterproof. The Patagonia Stormfront is the latter. Yes, \u00a3250 is a lot for a backpack. But after losing sheaves of notebook pages to damp, mildly water-damaging a passport, mortally endangering my laptop, and ruining perfectly good snacks, I had to take drastic measures. I found it, of course, by searching \u201cbackpack 100% waterproof \u201d online, and it was a rare enough request that even the all-weather arsenal of the Patagonia catalog sold only one thing that fit the bill.\n\nI\u2019ve taken it on small fishing boats in the Spice Islands, on Bosnian hiking trails when every afternoon brought a loud thunderstorm, and on my cycle commute every single day in London. Not a drop of water has breached it. I\u2019ve come to love its utilitarian shape, its simplicity (it\u2019s basically just a big reinforced sack), and its gorpcore credentials.\n\nSince the bag sits low on the hips and has no fussy loops, it doesn\u2019t engage in outfit interference, like making a dress bunch up (though it has chest straps, I wear them open). Due to the streamlined design, it looks weirdly good in polite society; once, at a weekday art opening in Whitechapel, the artist himself did a double take and said, \u201cWhoa, where\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\nAt first, I thought the Stormfront would be an occasional travel bag because it looks undeniably like \u201cgear.\u201d But it quickly made itself indispensable. Once you\u2019ve carried a completely waterproof bag, anything else makes you feel naked and exposed. The indignity of speculating over the precipitation forecast! With a Stormfront, you don\u2019t have to. I should note that I personally dislike roll-top backpacks for their size and the perceived inconvenience of opening them frequently, which ruled out the few other waterproof backpacks on the market. But if you don\u2019t mind, Sealline makes some great ones, and I can vouch for their Urban daypack, which I\u2019ve borrowed in a pinch. Still, the Stormfront is just so high performance and low maintenance. After a couple of weeks reporting in northern Nigeria, everything I owned was covered in a fine layer of Sahel dust, but all it took to restore my backpack was a wet wipe. And I can fit a small grocery haul in there too.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
