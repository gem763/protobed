Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law Wednesday that lets the state\u2019s prosecutors bring charges against those who\u2019ve received presidential pardons for the crimes in question.\n\nGOV. ANDREW CUOMO USES UNCENSORED N-WORD DURING LIVE INTERVIEW: 'PARDON MY LANGUAGE'\n\nAccording to Politico, the U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that state prosecutors can bring charges against people who have already faced similar federal charges. But New York\u2019s state law had included ways of blocking the state-level trials.\n\nCuomo\u2019s signature Wednesday helped erase those obstacles, the report said.\n\nOne test of the new law could come if Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani eventually faces charges of lobbying violations under the federal probe he is reportedly facing regarding business dealing in Ukraine, Politico reported.\n\n\"This critical new law closes a gaping loophole that could have allowed any president to abuse the presidential pardon power by unfairly granting a pardon to a family member or close associate and possibly allow that individual to evade justice altogether,\u201d New York state Attorney General Tish James said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cNo one is above the law, and this commonsense measure will provide a reasonable and necessary check on presidential power today and for all presidents to come.\u201d\n\nIn August, President Trump criticized The Washington Post after the newspaper printed a story saying the president claimed he would pardon aides if they broke the law in order to speed the process for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAnother totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly), I would give them a Pardon,\u201d Trump wrote at the time. \u201cThis was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier this month Trump posthumously pardoned Zay Jeffries, a World War II scientist who helped develop tank-piercing artillery that helped defeat the Nazis. After the war, Jeffries was convicted of business actions that violated Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\n\nOther recipients of Trump pardons have included Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff in Arizona; Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, a former chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney; Jack Johnson, a champion boxer; and Dinesh D\u2019Souza, a conservative author and filmmaker.\n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace and Melissa Leon contributed to this story.", "description": "So you\u2019ve committed a crime but received a pardon from the president of the United States.
