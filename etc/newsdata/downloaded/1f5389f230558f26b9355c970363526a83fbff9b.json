His 2020 bid has stalled, so why is he still zig zagging across Iowa? My colleague Edward-Isaac Dovere writes that he\u2019s getting reinforcement from the Clinton camp to keep going as a moderate in a party zooming to the left.\n\nAnd Michael Bennet? The Colorado senator isn\u2019t known for being a rabble-rouser (one pitch he\u2019s made to voters: \u201cIf you elect me president, I promise you won\u2019t have to think about me for two weeks at a time\u201d). Of late, he\u2019s pivoted to a mad-as-hell insurgent, promising to fight on in spite of the odds.\n\nMaybe these candidates also just have the money and time. The former Maryland congressman John Delaney announced his presidential run six months after Trump\u2019s inauguration, has visited all 99 of Iowa\u2019s counties, and has poured millions of his own wealth to prop up his campaign. Yet he\u2019s still something of an afterthought in most polls.\n\nFor other long-shot candidates, the end game may not even be the presidency, but a stepping stone to a cushy Cabinet position or higher office than the one they currently hold.\n\nStill, there\u2019s sliver of solace to be found for the Democratic candidates if they\u2019re looking: Some red states are cancelling their Republican primaries altogether, giving the Republicans mounting primary challenges against President Trump an even smaller shot to present themselves to voters.\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Watching\n\n(Mike Blake / Reuters)\n\nThe California emissions fight: The EPA\u2019s move to revoke California\u2019s authority to set stricter car-emission standards than the federal government fits a pattern for Trump, Ron Brownstein writes: The president seems to be out to punish states that voted against him in 2016.\n\nOn whistleblowers: David Frum contextualizes the latest scandal to hit Capitol Hill: A whistleblower report filed with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, alleging that President Trump made an improper \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy may be unthinkable for the GOP four years ago. On a whole host of international quagmires, from protests in Hong Kong to Russian meddling in U.S. elections, Trump has bent and broken the GOP\u2019s foreign policy dogma, Uri Friedman writes. But his lax approach to Iran, which allegedly attacked Saudi oil facilities over the weekend, might end up being the last straw for GOP hawks.\n\nHere\u2019s what biology class American schools where evolution isn\u2019t part of the curriculum. Not all schools teach this evolutionary history, Olga Khazan writes, including the high school she went to 20 years ago, adding that her \u201cexperience was far from unusual.\u201d\n\nOur Reporters Are Also Reading\n\n\n\n\u2023 Kamala Harris bets it all on Iowa to break freefall (Politico)\n\n\u2023 Is Tucker Carlson the Most Important Pundit in America?
