Many of those fighters had been held by Kurdish-led forces, but Turkey considers the Kurds an enemy. The White House said Washington had urged the captured fighters' native countries \u2014 specifically citing France, Germany and other European nations \u2014 \"to take them back, but they did not want them and refused.\"\n\n\"The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,\" it said.\n\n\"Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial 'Caliphate' by the United States,\" the White House said.\n\nA bipartisan congressional report last month urged the White House not to draw down troops in Syria to counter Iran's influence and halt a resurgence by ISIS.\n\nThe report by the 12-member Syria Study Group warned that the war in Syria is far from over and that ISIS is still a threat, contradicting the White House's claim on Sunday night that ISIS had been defeated.", "description": "Trump and Erdogan spoke by phone, but the White House didn't confirm Turkey's announcement that they will meet next month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4213454/1000x563_nbc-181116-trump-erdogan-al-1227_df1b2ee9bb89bbdf02fa0da8766bfdd9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
