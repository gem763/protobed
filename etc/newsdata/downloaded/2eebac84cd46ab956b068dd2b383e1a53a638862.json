Citing CFTC data, he says short positions make up more than 35% of the open interest of professional money managers, for only the sixth time since the 2014 crash.\n\nBut this time, Pies says in the call of the day, the fundamental data for oil\u2014in inventories, refining margins and other key indicators\u2014does not support the pile-up of shorts. If the economy does not enter recession, short positions could unwind quickly, he says.\n\nThe buzz\n\nA warning from chip maker Texas Instruments TXN, -6.03% cast a bearish pall on markets.
