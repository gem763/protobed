It was substantially above the reserve price of $2.8 million.\n\nWhat did you think it would go for? Between $2.7 million and $2.8 million.\n\nWhat was surprising about it?\n\nNow and then you come across a situation like this - you bought one property and there\u2019s only one address, but if you look deeper into the paperwork, you find two lots there. A long time ago this was all farmland and the way they subdivided the land, every [block is] a bit different.\n\nThe standalone home on a much smaller block than the local council would normally permit both upgraders and downsizers.\n\nMy vendor bought this from another agent. I had sold his principal place of residence the week before and he had the money to spend. He went to my competitor\u2019s auction. He didn\u2019t check the contracts, just turned up started bidding and got the property. It was the end of 2016. He paid $3.3 million.\n\nHis idea was to build one home for his family. Then we discovered there were two lots on the property. The owner identified it about a week after the purchase. He\u2019s a plumber by trade. He called me to confirm it. I also saw two lots.\n\nThat meant instead of building one luxury home on 1100sq m, he had the option to build a smaller house [alongside] his principal place of residence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you tried to do a subdivision on the same land lot you cannot do it. It doesn\u2019t fit the minimum frontage requirements. But because you already had two lots there, the council was powerless to stop my owner building two on the site. It's uncharted territory. No-one\u2019s ever sold a brand new house on 441 sq m in Strathfield.\n\nWas it a risk?\n\nThere was a lot of risk. In this prestige market you need to have the typical product, which is 700sq m and a 15-metre frontage, at least. To get half the land size and pretty much half the house, no one\u2019s done that before.\n\nCompetition for the smaller house with pool pushed the price well above the $2.8 million reserve.\n\nIf you look at the quality of the finish, he\u2019s gone all-out. It\u2019s marble all the way through. The construction cost was $850,000. That's 3800 per sq m.\n\nEveryone in Strathfield thinks you need 1000 square metres [but] there\u2019s this void in the market. People want quality and low maintenance \u2013 people with busy lives upsizing, they want the small, calm, inner-city house. Once you fill in that void and there\u2019s no stock around, the price just shoots.\n\nHow did the auction play out?\n\nWe had eight registered purchasers. most of them around the $2.7 million, $2.8 million price point. That\u2019s what they indicate beforehand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe successful bidders are a downsizing empty-nester couple. They used to live in Strathfield, then moved to Parramatta. They miss living in Strathfield and are moving back again. The underbidder [couple] was two young professionals, upgrading from a townhouse.\n\nThe downsizer competed directly with the upsizer all the way from $2.8 million to $3.25 million. Those two parties didn\u2019t even give anyone else a chance to bid for the property. They would just return fire within seconds. It took seven minutes exactly.\n\nDo you reckon we\u2019ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?\n\nc) Next cycle. It\u2019s nearly impossible to find a land parcel in Strathfield to replicate this type of sale.\n\nThe council I deal with here is probably one of the most restrictive councils in Sydney. They do not permit duplex developments. That\u2019s why this was even more rare. On the other side of Parramatta Road, in Concord, you can build duplexes on nearly every corner. Due to the fact that you can\u2019t build duplexes in Strathfield, this product is a rarity for my marketplace.", "description": "An undiscovered subdivision allowed this owner to tap a much-needed void in an inner-western Sydney market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2562%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ea6c0562a3750cda876950df5349d9bd3919a699", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
