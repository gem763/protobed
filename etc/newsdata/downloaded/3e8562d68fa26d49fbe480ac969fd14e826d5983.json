Madison recognized that \u201cthe people\u201d can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, \u201cto guard the society against the oppression of the rulers\u201d; it is equally necessary \u201cto guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part.\u201d What we now call a \u201cliberal democracy\u201d is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.\n\nThe opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban or Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other \u201coutsiders,\u201d and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary \u201cus.\u201d As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, \u201cThe only important thing is the unification of the people \u2014 because the other people don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Populism is democracy without liberalism.\n\nWe suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as \u201cpopulists,\u201d including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, \u201cthe people\u201d as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders \u2014 who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market \u2014 is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they\u2019re not populists either.\n\nToday, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today\u2019s Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nIt may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call \u201cnorms.\u201d Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right \u2014 and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left \u2014 have deeply corroded that faith.", "description": "America\u2019s dual faith in individual liberty and democracy is under attack by the president\u2019s populism.", "authors": ["James Traub"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/opinion/17Traub1/17Traub1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
