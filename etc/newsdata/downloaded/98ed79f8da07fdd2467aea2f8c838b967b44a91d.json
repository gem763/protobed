With almost half the pursuing bourse\u2019s board nominated by Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed chief executive, the slapdown from the mouthpiece of the Communist party signals growing resistance to the bid.\n\n\u201cThe LSE rejection alone would probably have derailed HKEX\u2019s ambitions, but the People\u2019s Daily article surely represents the end of any acquisition hopes,\u201d said Brock Silvers, managing director at Kaiyuan Capital.\n\nThe People\u2019s Daily piled on following LSE Chairman Don Robert\u2019s strong rejection of the bid, issuing on Friday a laundry list of geopolitical and business reasons why the LSE finds the $36.8 billion proposal wanting. The offer had problems with \u201cstrategy, deliverability, form of consideration and value,\u201d he said. The People\u2019s Daily also took a swipe at the popular resistance to China\u2019s increasing control over the city.\n\n\u201cSome people in Hong Kong still have a negative view toward integrating into the development of the nation, as they don\u2019t see what opportunities it brings to Hong Kong,\u201d according to the commentary. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t only show how short-sighted it is from an economic perspective, but also how narrow-minded from a political perspective.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for HKEX on Saturday said the bourse had no immediate comment on the People\u2019s Daily\u2019s article. HKEX shares were down 2.2% on Monday. LSE shares fell 2.1% in early trading in London.\n\nCharles Li, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., appears undeterred by the LSE\u2019s rejection and is preparing to make his case for the takeover directly to LSE investors. Beyond the political, regulatory and commercial hurdles HKEX faces, the Hong Kong bourse is also demanding LSE walk away from its own $27 billion deal for data provider Refinitiv.\n\nWith the purchase of Refinitiv, the former Thomson Reuters financial and risk business, LSE is seeking to transform itself into a global force in data and trading platforms. The deal is central to its strategy and has proved popular with investors, sending LSE shares surging even before HKEX came knocking.\n\nRon Arculli, a former HKEX chairman, said he thought LSE\u2019s rejection letter offered HKEX a glimmer of hope. By saying that the initial bid undervalued the U.K. company, the London exchange may have left \u201ca little crack in the door that may still be open,\u201d Arculli said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday.\n\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange is planning to undermine LSE\u2019s case for buying Refinitiv and characterized the company as a low-growth utility weighed down with debt.\n\nThe dealmaking for LSE involves some of the world\u2019s highest-profile financiers. Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s Blackstone Group is on one side, as lead investor in Refinitiv; on the other, Ken Moelis\u2019s firm is advising HKEX. The winning side will have to persuade the $320 billion Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund and the LSE\u2019s biggest shareholder, which has so far declined to comment on the HKEX proposal.\n\nHere is a rundown of the LSE\u2019s criticisms of the offer:\n\nThere\u2019s not enough cash in the bid, which is too low anyway.\n\n\u201cThree-quarters of your proposed consideration is in HKEX shares, representing a fundamentally different and much less attractive investment proposition to our shareholders.\u201cEven assuming your proposal were deliverable, its value falls substantially short of an appropriate valuation.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s unrest makes that stock even less attractive.\n\n\u201cWe see the value of your share consideration as inherently uncertain. The ongoing situation in Hong Kong adds to this uncertainty. Furthermore, we question the sustainability of HKEX\u2019s position as a strategic gateway in the longer term.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s HKEX\u2019s unusual relationship with its government.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that your unusual board structure and your relationship with the Hong Kong government will complicate matters,\u201d the LSE said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Hong Kong bourse\u2019s unsolicited takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange Group Plc suffered a further setback after China praised the British firm\u2019s scathing rebuff.The official People\u2019s Daily wrote Saturday that there are \u201cpersistent worries\u201d about Hong Kong given the current unrest", "authors": ["Andrew Davis", "Alfred Liu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uUC07d1wGRb9_3q64QcK_Q--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/75407ed841afb04cab12f188b1e609e6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
