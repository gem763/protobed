Occasionally, their selfies also come with a warning: \u201cSocial media seriously harms your mental health.\u201d\n\nThe phrase, printed on the back of a transparent cellphone case, appears once in a while, usually in their mirror selfies or when they\u2019re photographed holding their phone. They\u2019re not alone: multiple models and influencers have been photographed with the case, including Madison Beer, Hailey Bieber, Delilah Belle, and dozens of other Instagram users who tag themselves with the case every month.\n\nMultiple studies have found that prolonged social media use is linked to depression and loneliness, and easing the pressures that come with constant connectivity has been a focus of large tech companies in recent years. This case\u2019s popularity suggests it\u2019s not just typical users who feel the platforms\u2019 effects: the world\u2019s most beautiful people who have millions of followers and whose careers depend on Instagram amplifying their looks also worry about the effect social media has on their brains and self-esteem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a constant reminder on my stories that we just do it for the likes,\u201d says Petra Vukotic, an Italian model with nearly 25,000 followers who sometimes poses with the case. \u201cI look at it as a reminder for me that the likes and social media are a drug. It\u2019s addictive. It\u2019s a form of validation that we are worthwhile.\u201d\n\nThe mental health warning phone case comes from Urban Sophistication, a four-year-old brand that specializes in clothes and accessories featuring self-referential, ironic branding and phrases. The team released the $35 case in December 2017, and it remains a best-seller that\u2019s turned into a signifier for models, wannabe influencers, and Instagram users who post on social media regularly.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say we expected that, but that was the best scenario we had in mind,\u201d says Elad Yam, 23, who owns Urban Sophistication with his sister Neta, 21.\n\nThe irony of sharing its message through the very medium it\u2019s warning against is intentional, and the case likely resonates with Instagram\u2019s power users because it physically manifests the complicated relationship they have with the app. One of Instagram\u2019s biggest hurdles, possibly the most important one currently, is building an uplifting space that doesn\u2019t drive its most successful users into spirals of despair.\n\nChristina D\u2019Alessandro, who has nearly 8,500 followers, says the case communicates how she feels about her relationship to Instagram. \u201cEven though I would get all of these compliments \u2026 at the end of the day I felt alone,\u201d she says over Instagram DM.\n\nPeople noticed her scoliosis in photos, D\u2019Alessandro says, which made her self-conscious. \u201cWhen I got my confidence back was around the same time I discovered this case, and I wanted people to know that whether good or bad, social media will affect you!\u201d\n\nNeta and Elad said they felt a tension between creating for Instagram while also remaining thoughtful about their products and messages. Neta says she deletes the app from her phone occasionally, even just for hours at a time. \u201cI guess that inspires the idea because it\u2019s just how we feel,\u201d she says. \u201cBut also, you can\u2019t be without [Instagram], so it\u2019s very mixed feelings.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re tied to Instagram whether they like it or not. To their benefit, Neta and Elad know how to capitalize on it. The duo wanted their mental health message to reach as many people as possible, so they settled on a case because people carry their phones with them all the time. That means the case shows up in photos routinely, unlike a shirt someone wears only once in a while. A phone case is primed to go viral.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a better place to have this warning than on social media, on our Instagram?\u201d Elad asks. \u201cSo when you scroll through your feed every now and then, you see this warning.\u201d\n\nThe siblings started out making T-shirts and got their break when they met Kardashian family pal Jonathan Cheban on a flight. (He was later photographed wearing their work, as well as Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, and Kourtney Kardashian.) But their products most resonated on Instagram once they introduced their phone cases. The mental health case, in particular, took on a life of its own. Elad says most people come across the case in a photo and then seek it out for themselves, although celebrity stylists sometimes reach out for their clients, too.\n\nStarting their business four years ago meant taking advantage of the tools Instagram provided them. The siblings tagged people, hoping they\u2019d see their products, and messaged influencers looking for a response. \u201cAt some point, you see that some celebrities do read their DMs,\u201d Neta says. \u201cWe saw Instagram makes the world so small. You understand that everything is accessible.\u201d\n\nPlus, Instagram\u2019s algorithm seized on the viral nature of the case and distributed it on Explore pages and at the top of people\u2019s feeds. The models who posed with it propelled it even further.\n\nBut as their brand grew, Neta and Elad faced the same pressures as influencers to keep producing relatable content. \u201cYou get in this realm of content, content, content, when it\u2019s supposed to be about what that content is about,\u201d Elad says.\n\nThe women I spoke to about their cases all say the same thing: they use Instagram, they\u2019re good at it, and it gives them a platform \u2014 but it also makes them feel bad.\n\nMaria Gabriela Santos, who has around 7,700 followers, says it\u2019s easy to forget that social media presents the way we want to be seen online, and not who we really are. \u201cI hope that everyone realizes how social media changes our minds and the way we see each other,\u201d she says over Instagram DM. \u201cOur social media appearance is not our real personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe irony is that we all know that \u2018consuming\u2019 too much social media is bad for our mental health, and we still do it,\u201d she says. \u201cLike smoking, you get addicted!\u201d\n\nInstagram has acknowledged that its app can encourage negative behavior and thinking, and it\u2019s started experimenting with ways to remedy the issue. The company began testing a feature earlier this year that hides the like count on posts, so people can \u201cfocus on the photos and videos.\u201d It also implemented multiple features to address online bullies. Apple and Google have designed time management tools so people can limit their app usage, and all of these changes happened over only the past two years.\n\nInstagram launched Elad and Neta\u2019s business and empowered them to sell their cases. It gave their phone case buyers a platform to share their photos and grow their own brands. All that reach and desire to engage an audience of millions doesn\u2019t come without trade-offs, however. When you entangle your life in an app that makes you feel bad, the only option other than quitting is to stick it to the platform with a phone case that says it all.", "description": "Models on Instagram, including Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber, have been photographed using an Urban Sophistication phone case that warns their followers about the effect social media has on their mental health.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldIU7d9FaFjwUAo24qQSfGuezNE=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19056091/acastro_190816_3611_SM_Iphone_case_0001__1_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-20"}
