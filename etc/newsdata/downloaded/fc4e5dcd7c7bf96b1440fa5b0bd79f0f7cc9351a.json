I\u2019m a big boy. I can ignore his bullying, even his followers\u2019 death threats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut this goes beyond Trump skewering me.\n\nHe is engaged in a coordinated attack on every journalist\u2019s ability to hold him accountable, call out his lies and critique his failed policies.\n\nTrump targeted me last week after watching a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d discussion of the damage being done by what I called his \u201cbrutish\u201d strategy for forcing China to agree to a new trade deal.\n\nI was asked if Democrats did not agree with the president\u2019s decision to confront China for its unfair trade practices, including stealing intellectual property.\n\nI said yes, it is true that Democrats have pressed for a better trade deal with China. But I added that Democrats are disturbed by the president\u2019s heavy-handed use of tariffs. It has led to a damaging trade war that is pushing the world to the edge of economic recession.\n\nAnd I added that despite Trump\u2019s denials, his use of tariffs is driving up prices for American consumers while fostering a lack of economic stability. As a result, big business is less likely to make capital investments. That hurts the stock market.\n\nThat last point, I mentioned, has been made by the Wall Street Journal editorial board, hardly a bastion of liberal economic thought.\n\nNote the absence of any personal attack on Trump. It was a commentary on the president\u2019s policies.\n\nSeveral hours later, my phone exploded after Trump tweeted:\n\n\"Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby, he couldn\u2019t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family,\" the president wrote. \"Yet he is always nasty and wrong!\"\n\nHe followed that up with another attack on me in front of reporters on the White House lawn. This time he excoriated me, my network and my Fox colleague Donna Brazile Donna Lease BrazileTrump: 'Top shows' on Fox News, cable are 'Fair (or great)' to me Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network Trump criticizes Fox, which 'isn't working for us anymore' MORE.\n\n\"Fox is a lot different than it used to be, I can tell you that,\" Trump shouted. \"Juan Williams. Then they have the wonderful woman that gave Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall Swing-seat Democrats oppose impeachment, handing Pelosi leverage Labor Day jitters on both sides of America's political divide MORE the questions. That was a terrible thing. And, all of a sudden, she's working for Fox. What's she doing working for Fox? Fox has changed. And my worst polls have always been from Fox. There's something going on at Fox, I'll tell you right now. And I'm not happy with it.\"\n\nI know what it is like to be targeted by powerful people who don\u2019t like my views.\n\nAs a Washington Post reporter covering the corrupt administration of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, I was badmouthed by Barry and his supporters. They called me an \"Uncle Tom\" working for a white newspaper. I got menacing calls warning me not to start my car, telling me where my children went to school. Then, as the calls intensified, my house was broken into \u2014 my wife found a butcher\u2019s knife left on the bed.\n\nLater in my career, National Public Radio fired me and its top executives called me a bigot in need of psychiatric attention. Why? In commentary, I admitted that after the 2001 terror attacks, I got nervous about getting on planes with people dressed in Muslim religious garb even as I supported building a mosque near Ground Zero.\n\nBut those attacks are a step down from a blitz launched by the president using the world\u2019s biggest Bully Pulpit at a time of deep political polarization, rising hate crimes and hate speech on social media.\n\nAllow me to make two points:\n\nFirst, what happened to me is a chilling example of how this president does not respect the First Amendment rights of any journalist.\n\nHe long ago crossed a bright line by labeling journalists the \u201cenemy of the American people.\u201d During the 2016 campaign, his supporters could be heard shouting \u201cLuggenpresse\u201d \u2014 the Nazi-popularized German word meaning \"Lying Press\" \u2014 to American reporters.\n\nAnd in 2017 he tweeted NBC and other broadcast networks are so \u201cdistorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.\u201d\n\nMy second point has to do with his support for online provocateurs who delight in trolling liberals while feeding conservatives a diet of fear and grievance.\n\nIn July, he held a \u201cSocial Media Summit\u201d at the White House with a guest list that included the man famed for pushing a distorted edit of a video to malign former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenPanel: Why young voters aren't backing Biden Biden not trying to 'mislead anybody' with war story The Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall MORE as a babbling idiot.\n\n\u201cInstead of combatting Russian social media misinformation ... the President has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites ... to the White House,\u201d tweeted Sen. Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerReport highlights Instagram, deepfake videos as key disinformation threats in 2020 elections GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson to resign at end of year Senate Democrats warn Trump: Don't invite Putin to G-7 MORE (D-Va.).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe president\u2019s top message to these fake content providers or non-journalists is a promise to prevent social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter, from cracking down on them.\n\nIn fact, the social media outlets, including Twitter and Facebook, have been slow to crack down on the highly profitable spread of lies, conspiracies and online bullying.\n\nSorry to disappoint, Mr. President, but I will continue to point out your failures: How about telling your pal #MoscowMitch to send you the bills he is blocking to protect against future election interference?\n\nBut just because you attack me personally, I will not refrain from praising you.\n\nKudos to you for criminal justice reform and backing school choice, Mr. President.\n\nBet you weren\u2019t expecting that.\n\nAbout that photo\u2026\n\nIn his critical tweet about me, Donald Trump mentioned a photo taken at Fox News in New York and states I asked for a picture with him. That is a total misrepresentation of what happened.\n\nI was standing with my colleague, Ed Henry, when Trump walked through security. He came right over to me. We talked and then, while he talked with Ed, the building\u2019s maintenance man, an older man, waved at me and asked if he could get a picture with Trump. I went over to Trump and made the request. He obliged. Then the maintenance man, now joined by other people, offered to reciprocate by taking a photo of me with Trump; Ed with Trump and more.\n\nI never asked for a picture with Trump and never brought my family into the conversation.\n\nHow sad to see the president distort a moment of civility and kindness from all involved \u2014 including himself \u2014 because of my commentary on his handling of trade negotiations with China.\n\nJuan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.", "description": "OPINION: President Trump misrepresented a brief interaction as part of his larger war on a free press.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_williamsjuan_fromjw.jpg"}
