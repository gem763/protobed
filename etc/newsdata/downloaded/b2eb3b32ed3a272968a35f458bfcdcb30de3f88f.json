What a time to be alive,' he said.\n\nAustrian writer Peter Handke poses in Chaville, in the Paris surburbs, on October 10, 2019 after he was awarded with the 2019 Nobel Literature Prize\n\nHandke has denied that genocide at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war - something ruled genocide by the U.N. war crimes court in several convictions of top wartime commanders and political leaders.\n\nHandke has also claimed that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in the besieged Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and compared Serbia's fate to that of Jews during the Holocaust - although he later apologised for a 'slip of the tongue'.\n\nSlobodan Milosevic, pictured, prepares to vote in Belgrade in 1998. The UN was unable to try 'the butcher of the Balkans' for the conflict that tore Yugoslavia apart during the 1990s because he died while awaiting trial at the Hague in 2006\n\nOpponents have called him 'an ideological monster'. Salman Rushdie once crowned him 'International Moron of the Year' and an 'apologist for [a] genocidal regime'.\n\nHis victory astonished observers, who had expected the Academy to acknowledge the #metoo movement and their own failings in recent years by making a 'safe' choice, by moving to broaden its perspective from that of a narrow group of self-regarding intellectuals.\n\nHandke, whose works include The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick and Slow Homecoming, also called for the Nobel to be abolished in 2014, saying it was a 'false canonisation' of literature - an assertion his critics would certainly now agree with.\n\nThis is not the first time his political reputation has caused headaches for the literati.\n\nWhen he received the International Ibsen Award in 2014, the PEN Norway writers' association called for the selection jury's resignation. One academic called it like 'giving the Immanuel Kant Prize to Goebbels'.\n\nDigging up the dead: International War Crimes Tribunal investigators clearing away soil and debris from dozens of Srebrenica victims buried in a mass grave near the village of Pilica\n\nPictures that shocked the world: Prisoners were kept in horrific conditions while many Bosnian men were slaughtered without mercy\n\nAn official biography posted on the Nobel Prize merely acknowledged: 'Although he has, at times, caused controversy he cannot be considered an engaged writer in the sense of Sartre, and he gives us no political programs.'\n\nA former lover, Marie Colbin, has also accused Handke of violence. In a letter reported in a 1999 article by Salon, she wrote: 'I still hear my head being pounded on the stone floor\u2026and also the fist in my face.'\n\nThe 2018 award - delayed because of the sex scandal that endangered the award's future - went to an altogether more widely respected writer, Polish author Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nTokarczuk trained as a psychologist before publishing her first novel in 1993. Since then, she has produced a steady and varied stream of works and her novel 'Flight' won her the high-profile Man Booker International Prize last year. She was the first Polish author to do so.\n\nAcademy member Anders Olsson said both Handke and Tokarczuk had accepted their prizes. 'I only talked to Peter Handke myself. He was very, very moved. At first he did not utter any words', Olsson said. He added self-consciously: 'It is not a political prize, it is a literary prize.'\n\nAuthor Olga Tokarczuk shares the prize with Peter Handke. Tokarczuk trained as a psychologist before publishing her first novel in 1993. Since then, she has produced a steady and varied stream of works and her novel 'Flight' won her the high-profile Man Booker International Prize last year. She was the first Polish author to do so\n\nTokarczuk, 57, won for 'a narrative imagination that with encyclopaedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life', a statement said.\n\nHandke was recognised for a body of work which includes novels and drama 'that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience'.\n\nPrevious winners include Remains Of The Day author Kazuo Ishiguro, Doris Lessing and Bob Dylan.\n\nThe literature prize was cancelled last year after a mass exodus at the Swedish Academy following sexual abuse allegations.\n\nJean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former Academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011. Arnault also allegedly leaked the name of Nobel Prize literature winners seven times.\n\nIn March, the foundation behind the literature award said the Academy had revamped itself and restored trust.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation had warned another group could be picked to award the prize if the Academy did not improve its tarnished image.\n\nSince then, the organisation has appointed new members and apparently reformed some of its more arcane rules after a rare intervention by its royal patron, the king of Sweden.", "description": "An Austrian playwright infamous for alleged genocide denial and defending 'Butcher of the Balkans' Slobodan Milosevic was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature today.", "authors": ["Josh White For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19546070-0-image-a-126_1570722997121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
