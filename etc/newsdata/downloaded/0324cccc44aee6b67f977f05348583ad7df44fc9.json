Massive long squeeze \u2013 more than $205M in liquidations on BitMEX in the last hour,\u201d Larry Cermak explained in a recent tweet.\n\nBitcoin slid by more than 6% in the last 20 minutes.

Will open SHORTS if the Trendline breaks down. This one Trendline is holding the entire Market\u2019s fortune for next few weeks,\u201d they explained while pointing to the below chart.\n\nClosing all open Positions and staying flat until i see a clear bounce from this trendline.
