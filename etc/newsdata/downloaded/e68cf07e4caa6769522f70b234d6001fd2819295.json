His company still owns the skating rinks, which is among his oldest businesses, but it\u2019s the first time Trump\u2019s own organization has attempted to downplay the connection between the president and his businesses.\n\nTrump has previously called one of the venues \u201cthe greatest ice rink in the country\u201d.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) It is that time of the year. The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park. The greatest ice rink in the country.\n\nOne employee at the Wollman rink this week told a Washington Post reporter that the move may be an attempt to keep from losing customers who are averse to the president\u2019s politics. In 2017, the New York Post reported that an elite private school on the Upper East Side canceled its annual ice-skating party after parents refused to send their children to a rink bearing his name.\n\nBut the Washington Post also reported the rinks\u2019 income actually rose between 2015 and 2018.\n\n\u201cYou know what this tells me?\u201d Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University told the Washington Post. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman. He knows the name Wollman [rink] is better without Trump.\u201d\n\nThe ice rinks were a boon to the Trump name and contributed to his rise to local and national celebrity. Trump took over the project after New York City stalled and busted its budget in its renovation. The former real estate mogul finished the project ahead of schedule, boosting the Trump brand.\n\nImages posted on Twitter by a local reporter on Saturday showed the ice rink now bears the name \u201cWollman Rink Central Park\u201d.\n\nJames Ford (@jamesfordtv) No sign of the @Trump name anywhere anymore as @CentralParkNYC prepares to open its ice rink concessions, even though @realDonaldTrump \u2018s company is under contract to operate them into 2021. pic.twitter.com/nV5iQH3g76\n\nBut according to a Washington Post photo, one Trump sign proved too large to cover \u2013 a white tarp put over it still left a big red \u201cT\u201d sticking out.", "description": "A report from the Washington Post says the company has not offered a reason for removing the president\u2019s name", "authors": ["Mario Koran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/578df7c37b2b23c085fd0393a3a4957c85abfa54/457_138_2206_1323/master/2206.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e3490fd19aac5e2e279a55feadd628e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
