Flight attendants seem unconcerned. This is going to be a long flight.\"\n\nAs the situation developed, she tweeted: \"He has also removed his socks. He just shouted at a man who boarded with a ukulele (also have questions) to COME SIT WITH ME AND MAKE SOME MUSIC. Wtf is going on.\n\n\"I alerted the flight attendant. He offered to move me (which would mean losing my bulkhead legroom) but just shrugged when I suggested he ask the man to put his pants back on.\"\n\nShe later posted she had landed.\n\n\"Two hours in he stood up and took four mini bottles of wine from the cart. Then he fell asleep. Then six hours in he got cold so PUT ON HIS PUFFY JACKET,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Finally, his pants went back on. Good news: nothing bonds a group of passengers like a man half naked in your section.\n\n\"Shout out to the flight attendant who slipped me extra wine and did keep checking in to make sure I was good.\"\n\nMs Thompson said the man removed his trousers in the plane bathroom pre-take off and put them back on in the aisle, next to other travellers, after landing.\n\nShe told her Twitter followers he was neither American or French.\n\nAnd she confirmed no ukulele was played.", "description": "Fellow traveller Lizzie Thompson was flying from Paris to Los Angeles with Air France when she said the male passenger came on board without any trousers on", "authors": ["Lucy Clarke-Billings", "Image", "Lizzie_Thompson Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14029681.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Air-France.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-21"}
