It shouldn\u2019t have been said, and it shows a level of insensitivity to a horrific period in our history of our country. And this is one of the things that \u2014 stop using this kind of language.

I would advise him to stay away from that, and again, this level of insensitivity to a dark period is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of CNN's \"Situation Room,\" Representative Will Hurd (R-TX) stated that President Trump's tweet comparing the impeachment | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hurd-1022-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
