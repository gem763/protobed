[This protest has been] organised by a smaller group [within Extinction Rebellion].'\n\nRoads are now closed in the middle of peak hour traffic, and commuters are being warned to avoid the area.\n\nMedical Director of the Queensland Ambulance Service Dr Stephen Rashford said the protest was 'a waste of valuable emergency services'.\n\n'Honestly, enjoying our rights in Australia to safely protest does not give you the right to act like a moron and tie up valuable emergency services,' he said in a tweet.\n\nTuesday morning's bridge protest is just the start of many rallies to be held in the city and around the country this week.\n\nProtesters have promised a 'Water Birth For A Better Earth' event at Southbank River Quay.\n\n'Swarming Flash Mobs' will also roam Queens Gardens throughout the week.\n\nA 'swarm for survival' is planned for Wednesday, an 'extinction rave' for Friday night and a 'nudie parade' for Saturday.\n\nThe militant protester claimed to have sent a video to Queensland Premier Anastasia Palaschuk demanding she declare an urgent climate emergency\n\nProtesters plan to block major intersections, march nude and use bikes to disrupt traffic during a week of protests throughout Australia as part of the global Extinction Rebellion movement.\n\nPolice have been put on notice across the nation with climate change activists declaring they expect to be arrested.\n\nAt least 100 protesters are expected to camp each night in Melbourne's Carlton Gardens.\n\nIn South Australia, activists will disrupt Adelaide's CBD, with similar events planned in Sydney during the week.", "description": "Climate change protester Paul Jukes, 49, has been hanging from a makeshift harness below the bridge since 7am Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19420616-0-image-a-41_1570495152059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
