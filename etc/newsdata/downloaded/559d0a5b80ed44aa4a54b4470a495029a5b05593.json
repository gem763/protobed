It\u2019s bloody hot. So it\u2019s extremely acceptable that instead of hugging a mug of gl\u00fchwein or a hot toddy, you wanna suck back a crisp, refreshing-yet-spicy gin. That\u2019s where the limited-release Australian Christmas gin comes in.\n\nPerfectly paired with that cheeky extra chunk of Nan\u2019s Christmas pud long after everyone\u2019s slipped into a food coma, the 2019 Christmas gin has once again been distilled with head distiller Cam Mackenzie\u2019s favourite December 25 treat: the Women\u2019s Weekly Christmas pudding.\n\nConsidering juniper already has flavours that are quite similar to the pine needle scent of a real-life Chrismas tree, Cam\u2019s stroke of genius when he tried distilling a whole pud a few years back birthed a tradition \u2013 a traditgin, if you will \u2013 that\u2019s becoming just as beloved as his late Mum\u2019s routine of baking the family\u2019s Christmas pudding on November 2nd every year.\n\nAs is also tradition, the Four Pillars Aussie Christmas gin won\u2019t be available until November 2 \u2013 when Cam\u2019s childhood home would be ripe with the smells of a pudding boiling away on the stove \u2013 so keep an eye on the distillery\u2019s website for the moment you can treat yourself to an early Xmas present. You bloody deserve it, mate.", "description": "As is tradition, Four Pillars is gearing up to release its 2019 Australian Christmas gin, which is essentially a boozy version of what your Nan bakes.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/four-pilars-xmas-gin-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
