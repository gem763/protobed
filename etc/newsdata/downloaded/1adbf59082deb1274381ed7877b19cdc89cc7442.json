But just north of the border, a Canadian ALS patient opted for physician-assisted suicide after giving up his fight against not only ALS, but also Canada\u2019s socialized health care that refused to cover the treatment he needed.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 41-year-old Sean Tagert died after Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), a single-payer health provider in British Columbia, denied giving him the 24-hour in-home health care his doctor said he needed.\n\nVCH offered Tagert 15.5 hours of home care but not the 24-hour care he needed, reported the CBC. He was later offered as much as 20 hours per day, but his doctor said that was still not enough.\n\nIf Tagert wanted 24-hour care, he would have been required to pay $7,905 a month for the remaining hours, a cost he could not afford. In fact, just days before Tagert\u2019s death, VCH officials arrived abruptly at his home to announce a further cut in funding for his care.\n\n\u201cEnsuring consistent care was a constant struggle and source of stress for Sean as a patient,\u201d said Tagert\u2019s family in a public statement. \u201cWhile he succeeded, with the help of many, in piecing together a suitable care facility in his own home ... gaining the 24-hour care he required was extremely difficult, especially as the provincial government refused to fully fund home care.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSadly, Tagert\u2019s situation debunks the claims made by Sanders and Warren about single-payer systems. Patients receive neither high quality nor comprehensive health care, nor are they alleviated from having to self-pay for the treatment they need.\n\nEven the name \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is just a marketing tool to garner public support; the existing Medicare program that most seniors like and want to keep would be eliminated to make room for a one-size-fits-all government program.\n\nFurthermore, although single-payer proponents won\u2019t say it, euthanasia is a grim reality of socialized medicine. In 2018, about 3,000, or just over 1 percent of deaths in Canada were medically assisted.\n\nAdvertising for Canada\u2019s MAiD service (Medical Assistance in Dying) is ghoulishly displayed in emergency rooms. The \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\" has even done studies on how physician-assisted suicide could reduce annual health care spending across Canada by almost $138.8 million. So while the VCH denied Tagert\u2019s funding for care in the last days of his life, there apparently were no barriers to funding his death.\n\nTo some, suicide might even be considered the moral thing to do, since every dollar a terminal patient uses is a dollar other patients cannot have.\n\nRationing of care is not only common; it\u2019s necessary to balance the books in single-payer systems. The government budgets a certain amount of spending for health care, and no more. Inserting itself into the doctor-patient relationship, government dictates what treatments are allowed, based in part on cost. And patients pay for their health care with their most precious resource \u2014 time spent in waiting lines.\n\nAccording to the Fraser Institute, the average wait time in Canada for medical treatment is 20 weeks, and only 15 percent of those who would benefit from palliative care are able to receive it in the last year of their life.\n\nAlthough Democratic presidential candidates and other single-payer proponents use patients like Ady Barkan as convenient symbols for why we need single-payer, they dismiss, deny, and ignore its harsh realities, especially socialized medicine\u2019s most innocent victims \u2014 like Sean Tagert.\n\nBest and most sincere wishes to Ady Barkan and his family as he continues to fight this horrific disease. But under a single-payer Medicare for All system, patients, especially those with terminal illnesses, sadly do not face a better outcome.\n\nErin Humiston is director of policy communication at the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI).", "description": "Under a single-payer Medicare for All system, patients, especially those with terminal illnesses, sadly do not face a better outcome.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/getty-2006-05-15-medicare_services-ny-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
