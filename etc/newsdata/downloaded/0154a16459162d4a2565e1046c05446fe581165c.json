I know what she was trying for,' she said.\n\n'Anyway we're Glasgow and she was trying for Edinburgh. Not that I am rubbishing Maggie Smith because she is a great lady.'\n\nSlip of the tongue: Miriam was trying to tell the presenters she was scared of Maggie Smith, when she accidentally started saying 'f**king' before awkwardly trying to correct herself\n\nShe went on to say 'I'm f**king scared of her actually,' but only seemed to mime the middle of the word, as she only pronounced the 'f' and 'king'.\n\nHolly and Phillip immediately burst into hysterics as they lent back, with Holly clutching at her stomach as she said: 'Wow, you can't be scared of her, not you.'\n\nMiriam stayed serious as she added: 'Of course, she is quite something.

But she is a great ornament to our profession'\n\nHarry Potter co-stars: Miriam had launched into a Scottish accent while answering a question when Phillip commented she 'had a touch of the Maggie Smith'\n\nThe sex-based outburst left studio guests - Tory MP Sarah Wollaston and Lord Adonis - with the giggles, while Mr Peston was forced to apologise.\n\n'I've never been groped unfortunately because I wasn't attractive enough,' the actress began.\n\n'But let me tell you, I did have an experience with Warren Beatty.\n\nIntimidated: Miriam went on to say 'I'm f**king scared of her actually,' but only seemed to mime the middle of the word, as she only pronounced the 'f' and 'king'\n\n'When I went for an interview for Reds a long time ago for the film, I was told I could only see him in his trailer.\n\n'So I knocked at the door in the lunch hour he said \"come in,\" he looked me up down, up down and said, \"do you f***?\" And I said, \"yes, but not you\".\n\n'And he said, \"why is that?\" and I said, \"because I'm a lesbian\" and he said, \"can I watch?\" and I said, \"now pull yourself together and get on with the interview\".\n\n'And I got the job.
