Upfront costs are still high, but there's a growing number of ways to get around that,\" Colin McKerracher of the consultancy Bloomberg NEF tells Axios.\n\n\"Municipal buses will probably go electric faster than any other major vehicle segment,\" he said.\n\nDriving the news: Mitsui is putting $200 million behind Proterra's leasing program in an effort to speed up North American sales growth. The 12-year leases include performance warranties and midlife replacement.\n\n\"The battery leasing credit facility, the first of its kind in the North American public transit industry, is expected to lower the upfront costs of zero-emission buses and put Proterra electric buses at roughly the same price as a diesel bus,\" the companies said.\n\nThe big picture: Electric buses are competitive with internal combustion models over time, thanks to the absence of diesel fuel costs.\n\nBut they're more expensive on the front end.\n\nAnd, the vast majority of deployment is in China.\n\nBy the numbers: Proterra CEO Ryan Popple, whose company largely serves U.S. transit agencies, tells Greentech Media that leasing immediately ends the gulf between a $500,000 diesel bus and a $750,000 electric model.\n\n\u201cOn a percent basis, it takes the upfront premium for an electric bus from 50 percent to zero,\u201d he said to Greentech.\n\nThe Proterra-Mitsui venture is the latest move in financing. Last year, bus maker BYD teamed up with Generate Capital to launch a programthat enables leasing of electric buses.\n\n\"The area where it's unique is Proterra and Mitsui have segregated the upfront cost and associated risk of the core differential on electric vs. diesel or [compressed natural gas] buses, which is the battery itself,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Ravi Manghani tells Axios.\n\n\"This approach mitigates the inherent hesitation of electric buses and makes the sales cycle mimic that of traditional buses,\" he says.\n\nGo deeper: Electric buses are having a moment", "description": "Buying a battery is one of the industry's major expenses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ZKwkRcljhZ_YC3H3iurZqxNHJBA=/0x287:5442x3348/1920x1080/2019/04/17/1555503672066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
