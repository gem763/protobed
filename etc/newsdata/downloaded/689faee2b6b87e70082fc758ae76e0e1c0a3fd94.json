USA TODAY\n\nIt\u2019s Week 6 of the fantasy football season. If you are looking for an unexpected roster replacement or an inexpensive starter for your daily fantasy lineup, here are players who could help.\n\nThese deep sleepers are players flying under the radar whose matchups suggest they could have a big game in Week 6. Just remember, they are risky fantasy plays given the other options likely available.\n\nQB Case Keenum, Washington Redskins\n\nFantasy owners are down on Keenum -- and who can blame them? He hasn\u2019t played as well as he could, he\u2019s been hurt and he has a talented rookie waiting in the wings to replace him. This week, however, he back in the starting lineup against a Miami Dolphins team giving up 301 passing yards and three touchdowns per game.\n\nWhile the Redskins are expected to run the football a lot this week, they won\u2019t be able to do it for the entire game. Keenum is in line for around 250 yards passing and multiple touchdowns, making him a great play in deeper leagues and two-quarterback formats.\n\nCardinals running back Chase Edmonds ran for 68 yards and a touchdown last week against the Bengals.

With David Johnson battling a nagging back injury and yet to practice, it\u2019s odd to see Edmonds ranked so low in Week 6 running back rankings. Even if Johnson plays, Edmonds should see an expanded role in what should be a high-scoring game against a less than intimidating Atlanta Falcons defense. It would not be a surprise to see him get at least 100 all-purpose yards and a score.\n\nWR Geronimo Allison, Green Bay Packers\n\nAllison has struggled to post significant statistics, but he does have two touchdowns to his credit. With Davante Adams set to miss another game, and the Detroit Lions defense focused on stopping the run, this sets up as a game where Allison should break out for another touchdown and 60-80 yards receiving.\n\nWEEK 6 FANTASY RANKINGS:How the players stack up at each position\n\nTE Noah Fant, Denver Broncos\n\nThe rookie draws a matchup against a Tennessee Titans defense giving up an average of over 50 yards and one touchdown to tight ends. Fant generally gets enough targets to post a similar stat line in what seems like a lean week for finding a plug-and-play tight end off the waiver wire.\n\nAtlanta Falcons defense/special teams\n\nWhile the Falcons defense has struggled so far, this week\u2019s matchup against the Cardinals makes for a good game. Quarterback Kyler Murray has given up 21 sacks and four interceptions through five games. Murray will throw the ball plenty, which means there will be many opportunities for sacks and for mistakes in the passing game. The Falcons defense should have its best week of the season and we should expect a top-10 finish.\n\nJim Saranteas, aka \"The Fantasy Greek,\" is a contributing writer for Ourlads.com, part of the USA TODAY Network.", "description": "With David Johnson nursing a back injury, is Arizona Cardinals backup could fill the void; QB Case Keenum back in the saddle for Redskins.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
