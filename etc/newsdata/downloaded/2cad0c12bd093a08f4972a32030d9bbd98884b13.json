REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya/File Photo\n\n\u201cI congratulated the regional commissioner for caning the students. I told him that he didn\u2019t beat them hard enough,\u201d Magufuli told a public rally in Songwe region, in the southern highlands.\n\nMagufuli, nicknamed \u201cBulldozer\u201d for his focus on discipline, said the students deserved punishment because they were accused of setting fire to dormitories. Critics, including the local government minister, had said the official violated the students\u2019 human rights because they had not been given a fair trial, and only teachers or headmasters are authorized to administer corporal punishment.\n\nThe East African nation\u2019s leader has courted controversy before. His government refused to share information on Ebola, it\u2019s economic growth figures were disputed and he once told Tanzanian women to \u201cset your ovaries free\u201d and bear more children.

Holding a stick in each hand, he is seen beating students one by one as they lay on the ground.\n\nThe clips sparked public anger among Tanzanians on social media.\n\n\u201cI condemn this barbaric act ... the regional commissioner abused his powers by punishing the students contrary to procedure,\u201d Anna Henga, executive director of the Legal and Human Rights Centre, said in a statement.\n\nMagufuli said the students, accused of torching dormitories, got what they deserved.\n\n\u201cWe must use the cane against children at schools and at our homes. We must have a disciplined nation,\u201d he said.\n\nSome western diplomats have complained that Tanzania is giving short shrift to due process, human rights and rule of law. The government rejects the criticism.\n\n\u201cWhat human rights are they talking about?\u201d said Magufuli, who ordered all students in A-level classes at the school to be suspended until their parents pay for the damage caused by the alleged arson.\n\nMagufuli\u2019s backing of the official appeared to overrule any possible action by Tanzania\u2019s regional administration and local government minister, Suleiman Jafo, who told journalists earlier that he would demand an explanation from the official for whipping the students.", "description": "Tanzanian president John Magufuli on Friday backed an official who sparked outrage and violated the country's rules by beating more than a dozen students with a stick, and Magufuli urged parents and school teachers to do the same to build a disciplined nation.", "authors": ["Fumbuka Ng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437323221&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9405X-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
