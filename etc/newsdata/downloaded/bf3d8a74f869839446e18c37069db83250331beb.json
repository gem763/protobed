No Trump defender from the White House appeared on the US Sunday morning news shows, nor did any members of the congressional Republican political leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s course of self-defense, meanwhile, appeared to be increasingly erratic. The president told House Republicans that his reportedly outgoing energy secretary, Rick Perry, was the secret Machiavelli behind a phone call Trump held with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, central to the scandal, Axios reported.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people know this but, I didn\u2019t even want to make the call,\u201d Trump was quoted as saying. \u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to.\u201d\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nA spokesperson said that Perry had urged Trump to speak with Ukraine about natural gas but not about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, or a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian election tampering, which were the topics Trump raised on the July call.\n\n\u201cLesson to all of you Trump aides,\u201d tweeted Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress, \u201che\u2019s taking you all down with him so you might as well get off the boat while you can.\u201d\n\nAfter a week in which his campaign seemed to dither over Trump\u2019s constant attacks, Biden published a pugilistic op-ed in the Washington Post declaring \u201cenough is enough\u201d. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family,\u201d the piece concluded. \u201cAnd come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Biden criticized Trump on Twitter.\n\nJoe Biden (@JoeBiden) In my experience, asking a foreign government to manufacture lies about your domestic political opponent is not \u201cdone all the time.\u201d https://t.co/w8K8C17yUj\n\nNews of at least one more whistleblower with direct knowledge of Trump administration interactions with Ukraine emerged Sunday. \u201cI can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying 12 August disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General,\u201d tweeted Andrew Bakaj. \u201cNo further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nTrump spent Sunday morning tweeting outrage at Democrats and at Mitt Romney, who has been the only GOP senator to condemn Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings in strong, clear terms.\n\nDid Trump commit a crime? The impeachment inquiry, explained Read more\n\nAt the weekend, Maine Republican senator Susan Collins said of Trump\u2019s comments last week saying China should investigate the Bidens, that: \u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nBut the efficacy of Trump\u2019s efforts to keep Republicans onside in his defense was also visible at the weekend, with Pompeo telling reporters in Athens that it was the government\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d to investigate a conservative conspiracy theory placing Ukraine instead of Russia at the heart of 2016 election tampering. That conspiracy theory has been debunked thoroughly.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, scrambled on Sunday to make amends for his admission on Friday that he had heard the state department was trying to put together a deal in which military aid for Ukraine would be tied to Zelenskiy\u2019s cooperation in Trump\u2019s alleged conspiracy against Biden.\n\nJohnson used an appearance on NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press to become adamant about how Trump had personally told him there was no such linkage, and then, to the intense frustration of host Chuck Todd, Johnson peddled the Ukraine election tampering conspiracy. \u201cWhat happened in 2016?\u201d said Johnson. \u201cWho set him up? Did things spring from Ukraine?\u201d\n\nBut Colin Powell, the former secretary of state under George W Bush, called the whistleblower a \u201cpatriot\u201d in an appearance on CNN.\n\n\u201cThe Republican party has got to get a grip on itself,\u201d Powell said. \u201cRepublican leaders and members of the Congress \u2026 are holding back because they\u2019re terrified of what will happen [to] any one of them if they speak out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who has mounted a primary run against Trump, accused Trump of betrayal.\n\n\u201cThis president deserves to be impeached,\u201d Walsh said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThis president betrayed his country again this week \u2026 He stood on the White House lawn and told two foreign governments to interfere in our election. Donald Trump is a traitor.\u201d\n\nMinnesota senator and Democratic 2020 election candidate Amy Klobuchar amplified that message, comparing the Ukraine scandal to Watergate.\n\n\u201cThis is impeachable,\u201d Klobuchar told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s acting like a global gangster, going to one leader after another trying to get dirt on his political opponent. I consider that a violation of our laws.\u201d", "description": "Republican defenders mostly silent, with two vivid exceptions, as at least one additional whistleblower steps forward", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09485718a045852ca1a6e81b4d9ef7311530cfff/0_328_4961_2979/master/4961.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=445000e894d8940f50766d225a269c44", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
