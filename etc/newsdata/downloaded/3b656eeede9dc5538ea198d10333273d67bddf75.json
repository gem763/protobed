Former Veep Joe Biden calls for impeachment, saying Trump \"betrayed the nation.\" Trump's personal lawyer is in the spotlight. And we're counting subpoenas so you don't have to.\n\nYes, he did\n\nFormer Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden went all in on impeachment while addressing a crowd in New Hampshire.\n\n\"Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed the nation and committed impeachable acts,\" Biden said. \"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\"\n\nTrump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway?\n\nIs he a 'foreign agent'?\n\nRudy Giuliani, whom Trump dispatched to Ukraine this year to help spur an investigation of political rivals, is now in the spotlight for his appearances and business ties overseas. Federal law requires Americans who work on behalf of foreign governments to register with the the Justice Department.\n\nGiuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, has said that he's not required to register as a \"foreign agent\" for his work with other countries.\n\nEnforcement of the law has ramped up in recent years, snaring a former Trump campaign manager and a former Trump national security adviser.\n\nFrom 'America's mayor' to Trump's pit bull: Rudy Giuliani emerges as central figure in Ukraine firestorm.\n\nGet your subpoenas here\n\nStruggling to keep up with the growing list of subpoenas coming out of the House since it launched its formal impeachment inquiry way back on Sept. 24?\n\nWe are, too. So we made a handy cheat sheet of all the current and former White House officials to have been sent an invitation to appear or to provide info. We'll update it every time a new subpoena goes out, so bookmark that link. And we're curious \u2013 is that number bigger or smaller than you thought it would be?\n\nWhat to watch for the rest of the week\n\nTwo Ukrainian-born business partners who have given big donations to Republican campaign committees and dined with Trump at the White House are among the witnesses House Democrats want to question.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman helped Rudy Giuliani meet a key Ukrainian prosecutor as the president's personal lawyer sought to discredit Biden.\n\nParnas is scheduled to appear before committees on Thursday and Fruman on Friday.\n\nBut their appearances are in doubt after their lawyer said earlier this week they had not had enough time to prepare and complained that the lawmakers\u2019 requests for documents were \u201cunduly burdensome.\u201d\n\nOh, one more thing\n\nTrump has been calling for the impeachment of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intel Committee Chair Adam Schiff over the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut can they be impeached? Go ahead. Click.\n\n\u2014 See you tomorrow, OnPolitics friends.
