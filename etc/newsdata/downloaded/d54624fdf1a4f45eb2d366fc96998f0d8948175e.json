(Giphy)\n\nHello! You're reading the CBC Arts newsletter, and if you like what you see, stick around! Sign up here, and every Sunday we'll send you a fresh email packed with art, culture and a metric truckload of eye candy, hand-picked by our small and mighty team. Here's what we've been talking about this week.\n\nHi, art lovers!\n\nYep. That's me. Holed up in my apartment watching The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance because, just like this guy, the original's been haunting my nightmares since my dad bought a VCR. (Anyone in Calgary doing the same? Apparently your city's experiencing a \"golden age of puppetry.\") Between all the rave reviews and the extremely thorough behind-the-scenes coverage, I'll admit it's pretty much the only pop-culture event that can distract me from putting together my TIFF schedule. (Stay tuned for our staff picks early next week.)\n\n\n\nOther random things I discovered this week that have nothing to do with what I'm mainlining on Netflix: David Byrne launched a website that's devoted to good news (or, per its title, Reasons to be Cheerful). I can't stop thinking about the fact that there's going to be a movie about Flamin' Hot Cheetos (and that it isn't a biopic of Chester Cheetah). Before you hire a wedding photographer, watch this. And if you know an \"art boy\" (who's not already engaged to an Oscar winner), their time is now.\n\nAnd because we promised you eye candy\n\n(Instagram/@daumaceramics)\n\nAs someone who owns way too many air plants, these ceramics by Daumante Stirbyte have some obvious appeal. (She'll be bringing some of her fantasy-inspired work to Toronto's Gardiner Museum Sept. 6.)\n\n(Instagram/@kiriesousakukamasayo)\n\nThrough the magic of newsletter analytics, I can predict that most of you will really, really, really like the work of paper artist Masayo Fukuda. (Yes, that's paper. I love how much you all love paper.)\n\n(Instagram/@laurenceval)\n\nWho saw this white rabbit in Montreal? Laurence Valli\u00e8res made that cardboard sculpture for the city's Mural Festival, and she's in Toronto this Labour Day long weekend to build an all-new installation at the city's Stackt Market.\n\nYou've got to see this\n\nLast stop: Regina! - We've reached the end of the line, readers, and for the final travel guide of the summer, we're checking out Regina. Saskatchewan's capital is Zachari Logan's new home on the prairies. (This time last year, the artist was showing us around Saskatoon.) Find out what's good!\n\nWe have a winner! - Short Film Face Off wrapped Saturday, and the winner of this year's $40,000 prize \u2026 will be revealed when you watch the episode on CBC Gem. (Find all of this season's shorts there, too!)\n\nDevastating photos from the final days of Honest Ed's - Toronto's weirdest landmark is now a symbol of rapid development. But before the wrecking crew arrived, local artist Kristan Klimczak spent years documenting the world inside Honest Ed's. The result is her new photo book, You Lucky People. She gave us a sneak peek.\n\nFollow this artist\n\n(Instagram/@beadthisinyourstyle)\n\nBead This in Your Style (@beadthisinyourstyle) - The team at CBC Indigenous tipped us off to this account. Launched by Saige Mukash, a Cree artist living in Quebec, it's inspired by those \"draw this in your style\" Instagram challenges.The twist? Saige gets artists to bead things instead. This strawberry was submitted by Brit Ellis, a Haudenosaunee artist from Toronto, and you can find more of her work at @blu_hummingbird. (That shading! So good!)\n\nGot questions? Typo catches? Story ideas?\n\n\n\nThink this was a way more terrifying kids movie than The Dark Crystal ever was? (I would agree with you.)\n\n\n\nWe're just an email away. Send us a note, and we'll do our best to get back to you.\n\n\n\nAnd if someone forwarded you this message and you like what you've read, here's where to subscribe for more.\n\nUntil next week!\n\nXOXO, CBC Arts", "description": "Plus, the week's top stories and your usual helping of eye candy.", "authors": ["Leah Collins Is The Senior Writer At Cbc Arts."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268679.1567526629!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/essence-still-image.jpg"}
