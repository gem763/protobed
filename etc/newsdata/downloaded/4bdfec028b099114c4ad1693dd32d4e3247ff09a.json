In spite of it being illegal, we still hear from many people who have been treated unfairly in the workplace simply because they are older.\u201d\n\nThe over-50s have made up nearly 80 per cent of employment growth over the past 10 years. In 2008, nearly eight million over-50s were employed. By the end of 2018, their number was close to 10.4million.\n\nMs Abrahams said: \u201cWe need to step up efforts to make sure that everyone is valued according to their abilities rather than an arbitrary characteristic such as their age \u2013 this is just a number and bears little relation to the skills and competencies that someone possesses.\u201d\n\nStuart Lewis, founder of Rest Less, said the findings show \u201cconfirmation that age discrimination doesn\u2019t just occur in the recruitment process, but also with older employees who receive less workplace training, and are more likely to be made redundant than their younger counterparts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany in their 50s and 60s are stuck between a rock and a hard place - with an ever increasing state pension age forcing them to work for longer, and widespread age discrimination making it harder than it should be to find and retain employment.\u201d\n\nLast year, MPs warned that one million over-50s were being lost to the workplace because age discrimination legislation was not working.\n\nThe Commons' women and equalities committee said companies must adapt to an ageing workplace and offer more flexible conditions for workers who were having to care for elderly relatives.", "description": "Workers in their 50s are more than twice as likely to be made redundant than those in their 40s, new analysis of official data has shown.", "authors": ["Anna Mikhailova", "Deputy Political Editor", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000002727238-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
