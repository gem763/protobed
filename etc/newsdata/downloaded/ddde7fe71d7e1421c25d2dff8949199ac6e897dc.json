Air entering at Mach 5 can reach in excess of 1,000 degrees.\n\nReaction Engines...", "description": "Hypersonic planes that can take passengers from London to New York in under an hour are a step closer to reality thanks to British technology.", "authors": ["Ellie Zolfagharifard", "James Titcomb", "Robin Pagnamenta"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/22/Capture-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqtj3dwFXC6QzeM5TDP45K_QyybZWB9o1cUEhDhBNi6hw.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
