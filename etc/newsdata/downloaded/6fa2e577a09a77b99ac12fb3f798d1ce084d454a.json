He said he reported his concerns to the lead counsel at the NSC.\n\nVindman is scheduled to be deposed on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. CBS News obtained a copy of his prepared opening statement, the details of which were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nRead Vindman's opening statement here.\n\nOn the July 25 call, Mr. Trump urged Zelensky to investigate supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elections and the energy company Burisma, which had employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter.\n\n\"I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\" Vindman wrote in his opening statement. \"This would all undermine U.S. national security.\"\n\nVindman will be the first White House official who participated in the July 25 call to testify before the House committees.", "description": "Alexander Vindman, who listened to the president's July 25 call, will tell lawmakers he \"did not think it was proper\" for Trump to encourage investigations", "authors": ["Stefan Becket"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/cc0241e8-cf9e-45b0-9c8f-3ab72c49ae15/thumbnail/1200x630/524ce9ab7b252b35e1f977fde61ce1aa/screen-shot-2019-10-28-at-10-12-19-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
