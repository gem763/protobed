My father, who visited regularly on business, was keen to show us its most famous landmarks, hence the photo of my mum standing wearily between the Twin Towers. As a grumpy 10-year-old, my priorities included a visit to FAO Schwarz (to jump on the giant piano) and the Warner Brothers store to purchase a plastic Marvin the Martian. I never had a burning desire to return, until a spate of recent architecture tours taught me that, sometimes, the most fascinating aspects of a city are those hiding in plain sight.\n\nSo three decades later I\u2019ve returned, in the year that Solomon R Guggenheim\u2019s iconic museum turns 60.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

My guide is architect Arthur Platt, and the starting point is Manhattan\u2019s west side, near the elegant Hudson River Park. Platt points out that in the 1980s, people simply didn\u2019t visit Manhattan\u2019s waterfront \u2013 now New York\u2019s priciest real estate. \u201cIronic, given rising sea levels,\u201d adds Platt dryly.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Planners saw the beautification of Europe\u2019s urban areas (including London, where the Garden City movement was transforming suburbs) and hired Paris-trained architects to work their magic. Materials of choice were limestone and stucco, used to adorn Beaux Arts landmarks such as Manhattan\u2019s Grand Army Plaza.\n\nToday, the struggle for time and privacy shapes Manhattan\u2019s architecture. Platt points across the water to 200 Eleventh Ave, which has its own car elevator, allowing tenants to park in their apartments, and Tribeca\u2019s 70 Vestry, the recently completed residential complex designed by Robert AM Stern. Its limestone exterior and drive-in courtyard (a decadent rarity, but once a staple of Manhattan\u2019s most iconic buildings, including John Lennon\u2019s home, The Dakota) pays homage to the City Beautiful era.\n\nThe beauty of water-based tours is that they allow you to see details invisible from street level. Nearing Manhattan\u2019s southern tip, we pass the waterfront Star of David-shaped Museum of Jewish Heritage. Platt tells me that the six-tiered rooftop represents the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. As we slide up Manhattan\u2019s east side towards the Bronx \u2013 the only mainland borough \u2013 we\u2019re reminded that skyscrapers perched on this blustery island must be practical, not just beautiful. Through a jungle of buildings, we glimpse 601 Lexington Avenue, built in 1977 as Citibank\u2019s headquarters. It was America\u2019s first skyscraper with a mass damper \u2013 a 400-tonne weight that reduces sway. Later, we marvel at the quirkiness of the recently unveiled American Copper Buildings, with its sky bridge pool which allows residents to swim between towers.\n\nThe next day, I explore the Lower Manhattan and Wall Street area from ground level, on a tour led by former banker and architecture enthusiast Annaline Dinkelmann. I was expecting a tight tangle of financial institutions, but Dinkelmann explains that, post-9/11, laws stated that headquarters of huge companies must be split into smaller clusters, resulting in random chunks of empty office space. These were then filled with caf\u00e9s, boutiques and even schools, creating a more colourful neighbourhood. There\u2019s plenty of history, too. We pass the Fraunces Tavern, a squat brick building built in 1719 which appears to lean against the skyscrapers behind it.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s so much history here that anyone wishing to build a new skyscraper must first conduct an archaeological dig. On Broad Street, Dinkelmann points to a glass panel in the pavement which allows passersby to peer at the remains of a 17th-century tavern, discovered during a dig. Nearby, a sunny outline of yellow bricks marks the former footprint of Stadt Huys (city hall), built in 1641. It was New York\u2019s first skyscraper.\n\nEqually groundbreaking is Beaver Street\u2019s Delmonicos (America\u2019s first restaurant with a printed menu), opened in 1837. Its terracotta exterior isn\u2019t just for show, but chosen for its fire-resistance, making it the city\u2019s first fireproof building. New York was clearly ahead of its time in architectural terms, and Dinkelmann points out that its skywards expansion was never uncontrolled, thanks to laws such as the one introduced in 1916, which required skyscrapers to have a staggered layout, allowing light to permeate.\n\n9/11 proved that the most innovative buildings aren\u2019t infallible, and it\u2019s ironic that the one targeted in the world\u2019s first vehicle bomb attack still stands proud. It was a horse-drawn cart, not a car, which exploded outside the JP Morgan & Co building in 1920, killing 30 people. The perpetrators were never found and the visibly scarred wall, pockmarked by shrapnel, has never been repaired.\n\nAfter the tour, I walk over to the Oculus, the new transportation hub for the rebuilt World Trade Centre. Stepping into this enormous white space feels like entering a dinosaur\u2019s ribcage. It\u2019s a reminder of New York\u2019s constantly shape-shifting skyline, but also that beauty can be found in the most unexpected places \u2013 after a visit to the Oculus, Waterloo station looks rather bland.\n\nFurther proof comes that evening. My dinner is at Legacy Records \u2013 chosen because I was desperate to try its famous honey-lacquered duck. But I\u2019m even more taken with the building\u2019s design, and the gorgeous interior \u2013 an elegant mix of wood, brass and marble. I discover it was the former studio of a record label, prior to its transformation by designer extraordinaire Ken Fulk, and subsequent regular appearances in Architectural Digest. And then there\u2019s my hotel, the seemingly innocuous Millennium Times Square New York. Selected because of its proximity to the places I needed to be, it turns out to be a beautiful explosion of art deco fabulousness. Perhaps there\u2019s more to New York than giant pianos and Marvin the Martians, after all.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nVirgin Atlantic flies from London Heathrow to New York from \u00a3272 return.\n\nStaying there\n\nDouble rooms at the Millennium Times Square New York from \u00a3152, B&B.\n\nMore information\n\nWall Street Walks\u2018 Secrets of Downtown tour costs \u00a328.\n\nAIANY\u2019s Around Manhattan Architecture tour costs \u00a369.", "description": "The Independent\u2019s hotel recommendations are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
