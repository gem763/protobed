Or as cable news has been calling it all week, his \u201cgenitalia.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst off, this fucking sucks,\u201d the host said. \u201cSecondly, you're the news, just say penis. Why are you say saying \u2018genitalia?\u2019 That sounds like 20 dicks. It sounds like a rat king of dicks.\u201d\n\nAfter new allegations against the Supreme Court Justice emerged in the new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, this past week, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) went on ABC\u2019s This Week to dismiss any and all concerns about his behavior.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the American people made a judgment that the evidence wasn't there, the corroboration wasn't there,\u201d Cruz told George Stephanopoulos, adding, \u201cAt some point, they just have to let the anger go and recognize that the democratic process actually moves on. And I think it's time for them to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, should I let the anger go? Should I calm down? Should I smile more?\u201d a furious Bee asked Cruz. \u201cShut the fuck up, bitch!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people didn't get to make a judgment on this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe Senate did and they decided not to do a proper investigation. So yeah, as long as an alleged sexual assaulter is ruling our laws about my body, I remain vexed.\u201d\n\nBee also addressed the controversy over a New York Times excerpt from the new book that initially left out the detail that friends of Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser say she did not remember the incident. Along with the \u201cgod awful\u201d tweet that began with \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun...\u201d the host said, \u201cThese were huge fuck ups for The New York Times.\u201d But she lamented the fact that those \u201cfuck ups\u201d allowed Fox News to \u201cdeflect, focusing on editorial errors instead of the information.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting that Fox & Friends believes the victim who doesn't remember, but not the ones who do,\u201d Bee said. \u201cThough, to be fair, I can't recall Fox & Friends ever doing anything in good faith or anything good at all, except that one time Tucker Carlson fell asleep on air.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered how Tucker Carlson sleeps and the answer is on television.\u201d\n\nFor more, listen to Samantha Bee on The Last Laugh podcast below:", "description": "The \u201cFull Frontal\u201d host slammed Cruz for saying people should calm down about Kavanaugh: \u201cAs long as an alleged sexual assaulter is ruling our laws about my body, I remain vexed.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_1/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568863878/SB_1_jhusrg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
