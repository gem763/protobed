'It was a good move for me, but it was in the UK and living in a hotel you don't have to do much. You just lie on your bed.\n\n'But here, I'm living on my own in an apartment where you have to pay bills, cook food, clean and shop for groceries. You have to do these things yourself and so this move wasn't just about on the pitch, it's also helping me grow as a person off it.\n\n'I used to struggle being on my own when I was younger. I was a kid who couldn't keep still and couldn't sit on my own; I needed someone with me. When I first came, my dad stayed with me for a week in the hotel and my family still come out a lot. But when I'm on my own I love it. I feel that here I'm living like a professional footballer.\n\nKenny has been developing under the guidance of former Huddersfield boss David Wagner\n\nThe 22-year-old right-back has already tested himself against some of Europe's biggest teams\n\n'When I'm in Liverpool I finish football and I'm like a normal lad, going for a Nando's or to Costa with the lads. Here I'm going home, I'm putting recovery pants on, having a cup of tea and watching telly, and that's me.\n\n'I think I'm feeling the benefits of relaxing and not moving. Doing what a footballer should do: train, eat, rest, sleep. That routine. I went back for a few days during the international break but I was glad to get back here. I love my apartment. I'm playing every week. You can't really beat that feeling.'\n\nWhile Kenny - who takes three German lessons after training every week - continues to adapt to a complete change in scenery in Gelsenkirchen, he has certainly flourished on the pitch under the guidance of former Huddersfield manager David Wagner.\n\nKenny has taken inspiration from Germany icon and Bayern Munich legend Philipp Lahm as he looks to make a name for himself among Europe's elite.\n\n'He was an all-rounder, could play left, right, in the middle,' said Kenny regarding the World Cup and Champions League-winning star. 'For me, he was always outstanding and the best right-back.'\n\nBut while there is a massive road ahead of him to emulate Lahm, Kenny hasn't shown any sign of nerves - playing the full 90 minutes in Schalke's seven Bundesliga fixtures so far this season, scoring once and producing two assists.\n\nKenny has admitted Bayern Munich and Germany icon Philipp Lahm is his role model\n\nThe young English full-back has been flying down the flanks so far, but one moment in particular really got supporters talking and it came in unlikely fashion.\n\nKenny's only Bundesliga strike was a moment to savour, rounding off a comfortable 3-0 victory over Hertha Berlin late on by drilling home into the bottom corner first-time after running onto a pass on the edge of the box. He had announced himself in style.\n\nHis surging form led to him being named Bundesliga's Rookie of the Month for August (an award voted by fans, clubs and pundits) - following in the footsteps of now England international and Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho.\n\nHe has quickly become a fan favourite at the Veltins-Arena, playing in front of a 63,000-capacity stadium, and Wagner has more than appreciated his impact after taking a huge step out of his comfort zone.\n\n'I had a good picture of Jonjoe and, after I joined Schalke, we all together agreed that we had to sign a right-back', Wagner said.\n\nThe Englishman has already become a fan favourite at the Veltins-Arena since his loan move\n\n'As soon as I found that we were not able to afford someone to buy because of our financial restrictions, Jonjoe was one of the first names I put on the table when I discussed with our board. Luckily, they agreed to try to sign him and luckily he decided to join our football club.\n\n'I can tell you what, he is already close to becoming a fan favourite here in our stadium. He has done an amazing job so far and scored a wonderful goal against [Hertha] Berlin. He is, for sure, one of the best signings which we have made this summer.'\n\nKenny has already played against some of Europe's big teams, including Bayern and RB Leipzig, helping his side to a statement 3-1 victory away at the latter prior to the international break.\n\nHe has been a mainstay in the Royal Blues' season so far, helping his side claim 14 points from their opening seven games - just two behind surprise leaders Borussia Monchengladbach in what was is an extremely bunched up Bundesliga table.\n\nThe Liverpudlian has struggled to force his way into Everton's first-team plans of late\n\nIt goes as far as saying that Kenny has in fact been one of Everton's standout players so far this season despite not having kicked a ball for Marco Silva'a side.\n\nWhile Everton struggle in the Premier League, Kenny's stock is starting to rise - albeit perhaps not in the way he planned - and he is already putting himself back in the frame at Goodison Park ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nWith Seamus Coleman getting no younger and Djibril Sidibe struggling for match time after signing on loan from Monaco, Kenny has the chance to seize the initiative and impress the Everton hierarchy at the highest level in the German top-flight.\n\nAnd what better way to mark his time in the Bundesliga than helping Schalke get back to the top echelons of the game. After missing out on Champions League football at the end of last season, the club have one goal in mind.\n\nBut Kenny's ambitions reach much wider than that. While his sole focus is Schalke in the short-term, breaking into Everton's first-team remains his biggest dream.", "description": "For the majority of young footballers, being sent out on loan by your boyhood club can seem like a daunting task so early on in their career.
