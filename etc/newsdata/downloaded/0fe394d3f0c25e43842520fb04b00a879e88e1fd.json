David Rowe\n\nAll of which means mortgages are more important to the banks than they have ever been and speaks to why the banks won\u2019t meekly roll over in the face of yet another Frydenberg whacking.\n\nIndeed, it was notable that Shayne Elliott \u2013 who irked Frydenberg last week with his QE summit proposal \u2013 was quickly out of the blocks on Monday, declaring that the inquiry would be a \u201cgood opportunity to provide facts in what is a complex space\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, NAB\u2019s chief customer and retail bank boss, Mike Baird, appears to be looking forward to putting his case.\n\nImportant opportunity\n\n\u201cThis is an important opportunity to discuss the challenges of an increasingly low-interest-rate environment and engage in a broader discussion about how we support all our customers \u2013- both depositors and borrowers,\u201d he said on Monday morning.\n\nAfter the detailed inquiries into the mortgage market by both the ACCC and the Productivity Commission in the past few years, it\u2019s hard to imagine what revelations Frydenberg\u2019s fresh probe will come up with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only really new ground is around the impact of very low-interest rates on the banking sector.\n\nThis is where the banks will surely focus.\n\nThe big four will say that with official interest rates now so close to zero, they cannot pass through the full rate cuts to deposit holders without rates going into negative territory. And so, to protect their margins \u2013 and by extension their profits, and the dividends they pay to the millions of Australians who received them \u2013 the banks simply cannot past all of the cuts in official rates through to mortgage holders.\n\nBut the big four\u2019s problem is that this argument is both perfectly logical \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re a bank shareholder \u2013 and unlikely to make a jot of difference in the politically charged environment in which they find themselves.\n\nMassive profit pool\n\nThat\u2019s mainly because, despite all the muck that\u2019s been heaped on the big four in the last few years, their profit pool is both large and visible; they remain on track for a total cash profit of $28.3 billion in the 2019 financial year, down just 4 per cent on 2018 and on an average return on equity of 11.2 per cent.\n\nRightly or wrongly, it\u2019s the size of those profits that makes the Prime Minister and Treasurer feel like they can so openly charge the banks with profiteering.\n\nOf course, the more philosophical question of how the nation should balance financial stability with banking competition \u2013 particularly given the longstanding four pillars policy that enshrines the status quo \u2013 will likely get a much of a run here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question for the banks and their investors is whether this inquiry might come up with any new ways to nip away at their sector\u2019s profit pool/dividend stream.\n\nCould, as former Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris urged last week, a stern and strictly enforced \u201cbest interests duty\u201d for bankers and mortgage brokers force these groups to pro-actively help customers switch into cheaper loans? (This is in train now but will likely be, ironically, held up by the new probe.)\n\nCould the banks be forced to be more transparent about the average rate they charge mortgage holders \u2013 that is, after discounts \u2013 rather than the inflated standard rates they advertise now?\n\nCould the government create a central rate comparison portal that actually made it easier to compare rates?\n\nAll these initiatives would chip away at bank margins and profits. But in this populist environment, the banks will likely need to give ground somewhere \u2013 or face even more government intervention.", "description": "The banking sector's retreat to simplicity in the wake of the royal commission means its more reliant on mortgages than ever before.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5714%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cef4b0b131c7a3b334fe32f580cc64228a0cf201", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
