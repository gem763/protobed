Bezos, under pressure from investors, was eager to make aggressive acquisitions to expand the company's footprint.\n\nHe wanted to be an \"everything store,\" Randolph writes in his new memoir, \"That Will Never Work.\"\n\n\"At that point, [Amazon] had almost $100 million in revenue in selling books,\" Randolph says, with about 600 employees, according to his book.\n\nRandolph and Hastings knew they had to take the meeting and flew to Seattle to meet with Bezos and his team.\n\nBut they were surprised by what they found at Amazon: \"We went into that office and it was a pigsty,\" Randolph says.\n\n\"People were squeezed in there. The desks were all doors \u2014 like old wooden doors ... on wooden posts,\" Randolph says. \"And Jeff was in an office with four other people.\"\n\nRandolph says it didn't take long for him and Hastings to figure out that Bezos wanted to buy Netflix to jump-start Amazon's entry into the video market.\n\nAnd after the meeting wrapped, Bezos' team offered Netflix \"somewhere in the low eight figures\" to acquire the company.\n\n\"When someone uses 'low eight figures,' that means barely eight-figures. That means probably something between $14 million and $16 million,\" Randolph writes in his memoir.\n\nBut considering Netflix was only two months old, that was a pretty significant number for a short amount of work. Randolph owned 30% of the company, while Reed owned 70%. Both of them would have walked away with several million dollars.\n\nOn the plane ride home, Randolph says that they discussed the pros and cons of selling.\n\nThe biggest pros were that the company wasn't yet making any money; it didn't have a repeatable, scalable or profitable business model; and while they were doing plenty of business (most of it through DVD sales), their costs were high.\n\nPlus, they both knew that if they didn't sell to Amazon, they would soon be competing with it.\n\n\"So long, DVD sales. So long, Netflix,\" Randolph writes.\n\nBut in spite of that, both Randolph and Hastings also knew they were \"on the brink of something.\" Netflix had a working website, a smart team and deals in place with a handful of DVD manufacturers. They had also figured out how to source virtually every DVD on the market and Netflix was \"unquestionably the best source on the internet for DVDs.\"", "description": "Two months after launching Netflix, the company's co-founders got a call from Amazon \u2014Jeff Bezos was interested in buying the company for millions of dollars.
