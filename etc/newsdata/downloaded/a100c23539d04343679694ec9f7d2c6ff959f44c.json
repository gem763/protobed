When I started this journey, my loving husband, who also needs to lose weight, told me he\u2019d rather eat ice cream every day and die five years sooner than diet.\n\nTrying to lose weight when your partner either doesn\u2019t need to for health reasons or is just not interested can lead to some tricky relationship situations. It can also make it hard to stay on track with your own weight-loss goals.\n\nThe buddy system\n\nA partner, friend or family member can be helpful in weight loss, particularly when that person is also trying to lose weight, says Rene\u00b4 Dailey, associate professor of communication studies at the University of Texas at Austin, who led a study about partners and weight loss.\n\nWorking together is what Dailey calls \u201csynchronization,\u201d and says when you and your partner can join in a goal for weight loss, you\u2019re more likely to be successful.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight and would like your partner to join you, it\u2019s easy to find yourself trying to do it through motivation or convincing. However, that\u2019s a mistake, says psychotherapist Eliza Kingsford, CEO and founder of Empowered Wellness, which operates weight-loss programs in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\n\u201cYou will never be able to force that motivation on your partner if they do not want to change. Your partner must want to commit to changing their lifestyle and you should never try to do it for them,\u201d Kingsford says.\n\nDr. Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness, a weight loss clinic in Washington, D.C., says it\u2019s important to support your partner\u2019s autonomy and decisions. If your loved one doesn\u2019t want to lose weight, you can\u2019t cajole the person into it.\n\nKahan suggests that you can point out how weight loss could help your partner be more able to do enjoyable things, such as have more energy to play with grandkids or not get winded playing tennis. But ultimately, it\u2019s up to the individual, he says.\n\nNegative impacts on relationships\n\nWhen one partner loses weight and the other doesn\u2019t, it can lead to serious relationship problems. A recent study by North Carolina State University found that when one partner lost 30 or more pounds, that had a negative impact on the relationship, causing arguments about food, as well as nagging and resentment.\n\nA study in the Journal of the American Medicine Association found that weight loss surgery led to an increased rate of divorce (41% higher than in other marriages).\n\nKingsford explains that relationship issues connected to one partner\u2019s weight loss are caused \u201clargely due to the fact that one partner is evolving and changing and the other partner is staying the same. This is difficult in any relationship. But with weight, there is a visual representation of this change.\u201d\n\nAlso see: This $17 product could be a key to losing weight permanently\n\nShe suggests that communication is essential to navigating the situation. Talk about what you\u2019re thinking and feeling so your partner can be part of your growth process. If you can grow together, you\u2019re less likely to grow apart.\n\nManaging food preferences at home\n\nOne common problem for people in relationships \u2014 especially if they live together \u2014 is that the person who is not trying to lose weight brings food into the house that is detrimental to the other person\u2019s weight-loss plan.\n\nFor example, Joe Wooden, 55, of Baltimore, has lost 25 pounds with his weight loss and exercise plan, but his wife Laurie doesn\u2019t need to lose weight. \u201cThere\u2019s food at the house I wouldn\u2019t otherwise have in the house, like cookies or cupcakes that I can\u2019t eat,\u201d Wooden says.\n\nThe best way to navigate this situation is to \u201cstart by acknowledging that they have the right to eat whatever they want,\u201d Kahan says. Then, ask for support.\n\n\u201cEven if he or she is not able to commit to keeping junk foods out of the house, putting them in a place that is not front and center in the kitchen can be helpful, such as on a lower (or higher) shelf and hidden behind other items,\u201d he adds.\n\nDealing with criticism\n\nYou might find your partner trying to \u201chelp\u201d you make better choices, which can make you feel criticized. Wooden says his wife sometimes will ask him things like \u201c\u2018Should you be eating that? Should you be eating so late?\u2019 It makes me feel bad,\u201d he says.\n\nDailey recommends trying to \u201creact positively to [your] partner\u2019s suggestions for healthier choices. For example, if you have asked your partner to help you make time for your workout, don\u2019t be critical when they suggest you take your daily walk.\u201d\n\nNegotiating lifestyle changes\n\nYour weight loss journey will likely create changes that impact your lifestyle as a couple. Wooden says, \u201cWe don\u2019t go out to eat as often, so we don\u2019t socialize with friends as much as we used to.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 10 diet hacks to help you lose weight\n\nDailey recommends talking about the impact of your effort on your life together. If your partner wants to maintain a certain lifestyle, such as frequently eating out, look for a compromise \u2014 maybe a restaurant with healthier options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to negotiate mutually acceptable solutions when the partners have different goals. But individuals trying to lose weight could see where their partners are willing to change,\u201d she says.\n\nHow your partner can support you\n\nWooden\u2019s wife, Laurie, admits she feels guilty that her husband is trying so hard to lose weight when she doesn\u2019t need to and can continue to enjoy treats. Her solution: \u201cI try to turn the guilt back into support for him, like joining him for a walk in ninety-five-plus degrees when I really don\u2019t want to, but he needs to,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso see: This one thing in your marriage increases the risk of divorce by 33%\n\nDailey notes that getting some kind of acceptance or validation from your partner is important for staying on track. \u201cMessages such as \u2018I know exercising every day is hard, but I know you can do it\u2019 are likely more effective than \u2018Quit complaining and do it!\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nThe bottom line to weight loss success is to \u201cavoid equating weight with appearance, or weight loss with morality,\u201d Kahan says. \u201cAvoid value judgments \u2014 both of your spouse and others, as well as self-judgments.\u201d\n\nFocusing on your own goals and not judging yourself or your partner will help you stay on track.", "description": "Experts provide tips for how to negotiate and stay on track with your goals", "authors": ["Brette Sember"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL312_na_wei_ZG_20190612163146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
