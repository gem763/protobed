Mr Varley and Barclays had each denied wrongdoing.\n\nMr Jenkins, 64, was the chairman of investment banking in the Middle East, while Mr Kalaris, 63, headed the wealth division and Mr Boath, 60, led the European corporate finance arm.\n\nThe trio is each charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation.\n\nThe case centres on claims of secret payments to Qatar as part of a deal to raise more than \u00a311bn ($13.6bn) from investors in two tranches in June and October 2008.\n\nIt is claimed that these multi-million pound payments to investors, including to the then prime minister of the Gulf state, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, were not property disclosed to the markets.\n\nThe cash injection from Qatar helped Barclays avoid the government bailout fate of High Street rivals, including Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\nThe defendants were charged in 2017 after the SFO spent years investigating the allegations. The trial is regarded as a high stakes case for the SFO, which has been accused of failing to pursue companies and individuals over their part in the financial crisis.\n\nThe charges against Mr Jenkins relate to his involvement in the June and October Qatar fundraisings. The cases of the two other men relate to the June fundraising only.\n\nMonday's Old Bailey trial will start with jury selection, and the case is expected to last several months.", "description": "The Old Bailey trial of three top bankers over a 2008 Qatar fundraising is set to start on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/827A/production/_109120433_gettyimages-1082220500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
