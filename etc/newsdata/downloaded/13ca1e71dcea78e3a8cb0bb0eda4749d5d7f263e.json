He was getting worried and used an app to track her phone.\n\nIt showed that she was just two blocks away.\n\nMeanwhile, at around 8pm earlier that evening, customers had been waiting for their takeaway orders at an American-Chinese restaurant.\n\nSuddenly the door opened and a woman in jogging clothes staggered in wildly.\n\nCCTV caught the stunned members of the public scatter in shock, but when they saw she was bleeding heavily they rushed to help.\n\nIt was Wendy.\n\nShe\u2019d been stabbed six times in the head and neck, and once more in the back.\n\nIt was incredible she\u2019d managed to make it from the street outside into the building, and CCTV even showed her trying to warn people there was an attacker.\n\nStrangers desperately tried to save Wendy and emergency services rushed her to hospital.\n\nAt the same time Daniel hurried to where her mobile was tracked and realised something was seriously wrong.\n\nThere were blue lights and signs of a crime scene.\n\nHe thought perhaps Wendy had been hit by a car, but he soon discovered his fianc\u00e9e had been stabbed in the street.\n\nAnd despite doctors doing all they could, Wendy died from her injuries.\n\nA random attack\n\nA makeshift memorial started to appear at the restaurant Wendy had gone into.\n\nFlowers, candles and a pair of running shoes were left outside.\n\nThe community were in disbelief.\n\nIt was thought of as a safe neighbourhood.\n\nInvestigators were quick to pin down a suspect.\n\nThere was a knife left at the scene and CCTV showed a man stealing it from a supermarket just before the stabbing.\n\nIt matched the description of eyewitnesses.\n\n(Image: The Washington Post/Getty Images)\n\nWithin 48 hours, a homeless man called Anthony Crawford, 24, was arrested in a local park just a mile away.\n\nHe had no connection to Wendy.\n\nIt was just a random attack.\n\nOn news of the arrest, Wendy\u2019s mum Cora made an extraordinary statement of compassion.\n\n\u2018I want to say that I have forgiven,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018My heart has been broken in a thousand pieces, but I forgive the man because I know it wasn\u2019t him.'\n\n'It was somebody else \u2013 it was evil.\u2019\n\nWendy\u2019s loved ones had been planning a wedding, but now they were planning a funeral.\n\nCora vowed to bury her daughter in the wedding dress she never got to wear.\n\nDaniel even ran the Boston Marathon in Wendy\u2019s honour seven months after her murder.\n\nHis T-shirt read: \u2018Love wins. Wendy wins.\u2019\n\nWith Anthony arrested, he was assessed to see whether he was fit to stand trial.\n\nHe had a history of mental health problems, and had hallucinated in the past due to synthetic drug taking, but on his arrest, he had only cocaine in his system.\n\nWhen experts deemed him fit to stand trial in June, Anthony pleaded guilty to first-degree murder.\n\nThe court heard that DNA belonging to Anthony and Wendy was found on a knife with a five-and-a-half inch blade.\n\nHe\u2019d stolen it from a nearby supermarket and walked five blocks.\n\nWendy had stopped at a junction waiting for a traffic light when he attacked and stabbed her seven times before running off.\n\nA man fitting the description of Anthony was seen rushing from the scene, leaving a trail of blood.\n\nThe court heard how Wendy staggered to where people were waiting for takeaways.\n\nIn September, Anthony made a statement at his sentencing. \u2018I want to apologise to my family for my poor decision,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I want to apologise to the Martinez family for my poor decision \u2013 I don\u2019t know what else to say about my mental health.\u2019\n\nHis lawyer said there was no explanation as to why his client had attacked Wendy.\n\n\u2018He is trying to understand what happened,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018He is searching for the reasons.'\n\n'But we all know the reason.'\n\n'It\u2019s Mr Crawford\u2019s mental illness.'\n\n'The monster is not Mr Crawford.'\n\n'The monster is his brain.\u2019\n\nRunning for Wendy\n\nWendy\u2019s mum Cora called her daughter a \u2018princess\u2019 who inspired so many.\n\n\u2018She only did what hundreds of people do each day,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018She took a run in the city that she loved.'\n\n'This is the worst nightmare I have ever lived.\u2019\n\nCora spoke of Wendy\u2019s Christian faith, which would have allowed her daughter to show her attacker love and mercy, and she would do the same.\n\nDaniel echoed that sentiment when he spoke in court.\n\nHe turned to Anthony and said, \u2018I do not wish for anything bad for you.'\n\n(Image: The Washington Post/Getty Images)\n\n'I hope you will begin a path of peace and redemption.'\n\n'What you did was horrible, but nothing is impossible.'\n\n'I hope you give it a try.\u2019\n\nDaniel called Wendy his \u2018dream come true\u2019.\n\nWendy\u2019s brother, Juan, asked the judge to send Anthony to prison for 35 years \u2013 representing the age of his beloved sister when she died.\n\nThe judge eventually sentenced him to 30 years, plus five years of supervised probation.\n\n\u2018You cruelly, viciously, savagely and needlessly ended the life of someone who everyone seems to agree was a wonderful person,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I recognise the mental issues that may have contributed to these actions, but they have created inescapable, enduring and permanent harm.\u2019\n\nFive days later it was the year anniversary of Wendy\u2019s death and there was a run arranged in her memory.\n\nAcross the US, supporters ran and shared the hashtag #RunforWendy.\n\nWendy\u2019s memory is also being kept alive in other ways.\n\nThe Wendy K Martinez Memorial Scholarship at the Florida Atlantic University that she attended, gives scholarships to Latina students.\n\nAnd the Wendy Martinez Legacy Project, set up at FiscalNote, where she worked, aims to advance women in technology and inspire people to unite through running.\n\nHer family and friends will make sure Wendy\u2019s message of compassion lives on. \u25a0", "description": "Wendy Martinez, 35, was planning her big day when she was brutally murdered in the street by Anthony Crawford", "authors": ["Gail Shortland", "Image", "The Washington Post Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707399.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_wendy-martinez-ABC-News-Gocom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
