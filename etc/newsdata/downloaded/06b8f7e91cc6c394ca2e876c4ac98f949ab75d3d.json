Today, your RAGBRAI Director for the past 16 years and the entire RAGBRAI staff has resigned.\n\nRAGBRAI\u2019s parent companies (Des Moines Register & Gannett/USA Today) claim \u201cwe will uphold First Amendment principles\u201d, but they refused to offer me that same opportunity to openly speak to the RAGBRAI Nation and answer the hundreds of passionate questions asked about the future of RAGBRAI following the Des Moines Register\u2019s handling of the Carson King story.\n\nI have always been totally transparent with the RAGBRAI Nation and have earned their trust since my first day in 2003. In these past few weeks, my efforts to communicate with our loyal riders has been consistently blocked as it did not mesh with the company\u2019s PR narrative to spin the Carson King embarrassment. There are hundreds of questions that have been left unanswered in an attempt to save face for the Register, without regard to how it affects RAGBRAI.\n\nI was informed, \u201cLeadership and our PR professionals are in agreement that we don\u2019t want to issue any more public statements on this matter \u2014 it is largely dying down publicly, and they see no advantage to re-igniting it at this point.\u201d And then added, \u201cglad to work with you on talking points for interviews regarding RAGBRAI if the Carson King situation comes up.\u201d\n\nSo, after 16 great years of service, I was effectively hushed and offered talking points to deal with a mess that had nothing to do with RAGBRAI!\n\nI can no longer be an effective leader when my principles are compromised by the leadership of Gannett/Des Moines Register. If we balked this time, I couldn\u2019t image any future thoughts of making decisions in the best interest of YOU the riders and the great state of Iowa.\n\nSo, the entire RAGBRAI staff resigned today.\n\nI promised my mentor Jim (Greenie) Green that I would maintain this great ride across Iowa. I also made that pledge to the late wagon master Don Benson and 89-year-old co-founder John Karras.\n\nYou will see this team that just resigned resurface in the near future. So stay tuned!\n\nThank you for trusting us with the GREAT RIDE!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTJ Juskiewicz,\n\nRAGBRAI Director", "description": "In a Tuesday post on RAGBRAI's Facebook page, TJ Juskiewicz said the Register, \"refused to offer me the opportunity to openly speak to the RAGBRAI Nation, and answer the hundreds of passionate questions asked about the future of RAGBRAI following the Des Moines Register's handling of the Carson King story.\"", "authors": ["Matt Breen"], "top_image": "https://s3-ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/quincy-network/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/RAGBRAI-2019-e1571172129917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
