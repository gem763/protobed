[Photo/IC]\n\nSweep of Minnesota gives stellar bullpen time to relax, reload\n\nNEW YORK - New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman threw just 70 pitches in September.\n\nAlone among MLB teams, the Yankees never used a pitcher three days in a row during the regular season.\n\nA bullpen featuring Chapman, Zack Britton, Adam Ottavino, Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle is a relief for New York fans and fear-inducing for opponents.\n\n\"I just think it's a luxury to have it happen this way,\" Ottavino said after New York swept the Minnesota Twins in their AL Division Series on Tuesday.\n\n\"Luckily, we took care of business this year and got a nice lead and were able to kind of stagger our appearances a little bit heading down the stretch. It's good because we're expecting a big workload here in October.\"\n\nIf ever relievers were ready and rested during the postseason, it is this group as the Yankees head into the AL Championship Series against Houston or Tampa Bay starting on Saturday. And now they have more days to rest, increasingly important in a postseason in which none of their starters pitched into the sixth.\n\nNew York's bullpen had a 2.03 ERA in the sweep of Minnesota, allowing three runs and 10 hits in 13.1 with 16 strikeouts and seven walks.\n\nThose are stellar numbers in an October of bullpen blowups in the other three series, where \"relief\" pitchers entered Tuesday with a discomforting 5.85 ERA.\n\nCloser Mariano Rivera was the singular key to the Yankees' five World Series titles from 1996-2009, but now general manager Brian Cashman has put together a seemingly bottomless bullpen in Aaron Boone's two seasons as manager.\n\n\"When you get into these postseason games, especially when you have some off days sprinkled in, you don't worry as much about workload,\" Boone said.\n\n\"You just kind of weigh what matchups you like better, especially as you get to the second, third time through an order.\"\n\nModern baseball has turned the strategy around. Somehow get past the first few innings, then bring in the power arms. Only in this New York group could the loss of Dellin Betances for nearly the entire season be considered minor.\n\nChapman averaged 98 mph with his fastball, down from 101 mph three years ago.\n\nWhile the six-time All-Star's velocity was lacking early this season, the 31-year-old left-hander topped out at 102.7 mph in the summer, and he has gradually doubled his usage of sliders to 31 percent during his four years with the Yankees.\n\nChapman converted 37 of 42 save opportunities with a 2.21 ERA, .182 opponents' batting average and 85 strikeouts in 57 innings.\n\nHis appearances have been far more limited with New York than when he was traded to the Cubs in July 2016 and helped Chicago win its first World Series title in 108 years.\n\nThat year, Chapman threw 159 pitches over nine games from Sept 1 through the end of the regular season, then 273 more while appearing in 13 of Chicago's 17 postseason games.\n\n\"I think that was a different scenario,\" Chapman said. \"I believe our bullpen is much more solid, more compact, more options.\"\n\nNew York, which re-signed Chapman as a free agent ahead of the 2017 season, used him just five times in September and twice against the Twins - a total of 44 pitches\n\n\"He's a horse,\" Yankees starter Luis Severino said.\n\nBritton, another 31-year-old left-hander, was among baseball's top closers while a member of the Baltimore Orioles in 2015 and '16, then was slowed by a forearm injury in 2017 and tore his right Achilles tendon during an offseason workout.\n\nHe returned the following June, not nearly as fearsome, was dealt to the Yankees and re-signed as a free agent in January.\n\nBritton's 1.91 ERA this season was his best in three years as he dominating batters with a slider that at times was difficult to control. His 78.5 percent of groundballs was tops among MLB relievers.\n\n\"I knew that the idea from spring training on was don't throw three days in a row,\" he said.\n\n\"That allows those recovery days throughout the season that maybe we normally wouldn't get. That was big. That was for the postseason where, ideally, they'd like to throw us every single game with the days off. So we're ready for it.\"\n\nOttavino, a 33-year-old right-hander, left Colorado as a free agent, and the native New Yorker signed with the Yankees in January.\n\nHe had a 1.90 ERA, .195 batting average against and 85 strikeouts in 57 innings.\n\n\"Everyone feels really strong in our bullpen just based on the fact that we've had some designated days to focus on recovering,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes it's not the physical recovery that you need, but just kind of taking a mental break through the course of a long season. We've had a lot of opportunity to do that, and it really helps.\"\n\nTwo junior members complement the trio.\n\nChad Green, a 28-year-old right-hander struck out 98 in 69 innings but had a 4.17 ERA that was inflated by a poor April, resulting in a trip to the minors from April 23 to May 12 to retool his mechanics.\n\nTommy Kahnle, a 30-year-old right-hander, rebounded from a poor 2018 and had a 3.67 ERA, .199 batting average against and 88 strikeouts in 61.1 innings.\n\nBoone knows he has far more top choices than a Sparky Anderson, known as 'Captain Hook' when managing the Cincinnati Big Red Machine in the 1970s.\n\n\"Especially coming into that first game where you have four days off,\" Boone said. \"When you have a very well-rested bullpen and hopefully guys that you can extend even more, if we like a better matchup, we won't hesitate to go to it.\"\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e89a0a310cf3e97a0697f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
