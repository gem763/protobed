(AP) - Eno Benjamin scored his third touchdown of the game on a 3-yard run with 4:41 remaining, leading Arizona State to a 24-17 victory over No. 15 California on Friday night.\n\nThe Golden Bears (4-1, 1-1) lost their perfect record and quarterback Chase Garbers to a right shoulder injury, spoiling their highest ranking in a decade. The loss also left the Pac-12 with no undefeated teams before the end of September.\n\nThe Sun Devils (4-1, 1-1) bounced back from a 34-31 loss to Colorado in the conference opener last week thanks to a strong performance by Benjamin. He had 29 carries for 100 yards, also scoring on an 11-yard run in the first quarter and a 4-yarder in the third quarter.\n\nJayden Daniels added 174 yards passing and 84 more on the ground as Arizona State earned its second road win this season against a ranked team, also beating Michigan State 10-7 two weeks ago.\n\nNO. 12 PENN STATE 59, MARYLAND 0\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) - Sean Clifford threw for 398 yards and three touchdowns, ran for a score and carried No. 12 Penn State to yet another lopsided victory over Maryland.\n\nPenn State scored on its first four possessions, led 38-0 at halftime and finished with 619 yards in its Big Ten opener. After Jan Johnson got things started by ending Maryland\u2019s first possession with an interception, Clifford cruised into the end zone from the 8 and the rout was on.\n\nAfter halftime, most of fans remaining from a rare sellout crowd of 53,228 at Maryland were cheering for the Nittany Lions (4-0, 1-0).\n\nClifford threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to KJ Hamler for a 14-0 lead, connected with Nick Bowerson on a 15-yarder to make it 28-0 and hit Journey Brown for 37 yards for a 35-point cushion. After making his 14-for-30 performance against Pittsburgh a distant memory, Clifford remained on the sideline with 5:45 left in the third quarter and Penn State up 45-0.\n\nThe Terrapins (2-2, 0-1) garnered only 128 yards in offense.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eno Benjamin scored his third touchdown of the game on a 3-yard run with 4:41 remaining, leading Arizona State to a 24-17 victory over No. 15 California on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/arizona_state_california_football_35495_c0-841-1835-1910_s1770x1032.jpg?141aba5adb70e5b5876cbe477d82b27d9949976f", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
