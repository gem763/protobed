Sales of new energy vehicles contracted for a second month in a row in August, and are likely to grow at a slower pace this year to 1.5 million vehicles, down from a previous forecast of 1.6 million, according to an industry association.\n\nTesla has fared better, with China sales rising 98% in the first seven months of this year thanks to strong demand for the Model 3, according to research firm LMC Automotive.\n\nTesla plans to eventually make 500,000 cars a year at its China factory\n\nTesla has embarked on a new phase of construction work at the factory in a sign of confidence in its China strategy. The new facilities will include battery pack production units, according to a company source and documents.\n\nThe so-called 1.5-phase works, which have not previously been reported, include a production workshop and an energy center, construction documents showed. Construction is scheduled for completion by around the end of this year.\n\nTesla also is looking to hire battery-related production engineers in Shanghai, according to its job advertisements.\n\nSee also: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22\n\nThe plant, which Tesla says will be simplified and more cost-effective than its existing Model 3 line, will have 500,000 units of annual capacity when the second phase is completed, doubling from initial phase capacity of 250,000 vehicles.\n\nThe factory, China's first fully foreign-owned car plant, is a reflection of Beijing's broader shift to open up its car market.\n\nShanghai authorities have offered assistance to speed up construction, and China excluded Tesla models from a 10% car purchase tax on Aug. 30.\n\nState partners of the Tesla project include Shanghai Construction Group, China Construction Industrial & Energy Engineering Group, State Grid, Power Construction Corporation of China, and MinMetals' Shanghai unit Baoye, according to multiple sources involved in the construction project.\n\n(Reporting by Yilei Sun and John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Stephen Coates)", "description": "Tesla's China factory gained key government approvals last month and is on schedule to start production in October.", "authors": ["Yilei Sun", "John Ruwitch"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94afa371cffc06e21589e6?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
