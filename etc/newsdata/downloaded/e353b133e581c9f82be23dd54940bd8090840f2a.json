[Photo/NASA TV]\n\nWASHINGTON -- Two US astronauts carried out the first-ever all-female spacewalk for humankind as they ventured outside the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday.\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir began the spacewalk at about 7:50 am US Eastern Time (1250 GMT), according to NASA live TV. They have been tasked with replacing a power controller that failed during the weekend.\n\nKoch wore a suit with red stripes and Meir wore a suit with no stripes. This is Koch's fourth spacewalk and Meir's first. Meir will be the 15th woman to spacewalk and the 14th US spacewoman, according to NASA.\n\nIt is NASA's second attempt to set the milestone in human spaceflight. The first attempt was canceled in March when the US space agency failed to provide enough spacesuits for two women.\n\n\"I think it's important because of the historical nature of what we're doing. In the past women haven't always been at the table. It's wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted,\" said Koch in a recent NASA interview.", "description": "Two US astronauts carried out the first-ever all-female spacewalk for humankind as they ventured outside the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/19/5daa553da310cf3e97a1fb8c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
