He emphasized that innovation will produce a greener auto industry.\n\nThe protests over the weekend in Germany came just days after 16-year-old Swedish climate-change activist Greta Thunberg led a large protest outside the White House and called on Congress and President Donald Trump to take action on the climate crisis.\n\nThunberg, who gained notoriety last month by sailing to the United States from Europe as an alternative to air travel, encouraged young people to participate in Global Climate Strikes on Sept. 20 that are planned for major cities around the world.\n\n\u201cI am so incredibly grateful for every single one of you and I\u2019m so proud of you who have come here,\" Thunberg told the crowd gathered on Friday in a park across the street from the White House. \u201cNever give up, we will continue and see you next week on Sept. 20.\u201d", "description": "Chancellor Angela Merkel has challenged automakers to builder greener cars.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cars-1-gty-er-190915_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
