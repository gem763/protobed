They don't have to bother with them.\"\n\n\n\nTrump attacked Johnson for \"not doing his job\" in a city that the president has often ridiculed as a \"war zone\" for its high murder rate (there have been 425 homicides there so far this year). Chicago is \"embarrassing to us as a nation\" and \"Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison\", he said.\n\n\n\nAfter linking the case of Empire actor Jussie Smollett, who faked a racist assault by MAGA cap-wearing Trump supporters for publicity, to the impeachment inquiry (both \"scams\", he said), the president went on to praise the police responders in Ohio after Connor Betts opened fire with a AR-15 rifle in the early hours of 4 August, killing nine people and injuring 27.\n\n\"Boom, boom, boom\", the president said. \"They were out there. Perfect. There was no fear. There was no anything. They reacted.\"\n\nHere's Alex Woodward's report.", "description": "Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the US National Security Council, will tell the House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday that he raised concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky having already warned\u00a0superiors about the administration\u2019s bid to pressure the country into investigating the son of domestic political rival", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/09/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
