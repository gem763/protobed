The controversial new president has even gone so far as to call China \u201cPublic Enemy Number One\u201d, sparking fears of a trade war in that tariffs would be introduced for Chinese imports.\n\n\n\nWhile it is still early days in the Trump regime and a tumultuous period in global economic activity, China's strong supportive stance on economic globalisation and it\u2019s clearly articulated and executed intentions to invest in Africa and, in particular, South Africa bode well for the future of the local mining industry, says Van der Merwe.\n\nIncreased investment into the mining sector, beneficiation and manufacturing industries will only improve South Africa's economy in the years to come, provided South Africa is able to create an environment agreeable to such investment.\n\nREAD: Four areas where mining does a lot for South Africa\n\n\u201cWe are on the brink of the next commodity boom and if timed right there are huge benefits to gain.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must first fix the current state of affairs within the industry. In fact, it may be the fruits won from international instability that aid South Africa to fix certain domestic factors and ensure prosperity and longevity of the mining industry.\u201d", "description": "Global uncertainty following Brexit and the election of US President Donald Trump could have favourable spin-offs for mining in Africa, say two legal experts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4770/e54dc5312c7b4a8b8a54a1ee7d0ab045.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-07"}
