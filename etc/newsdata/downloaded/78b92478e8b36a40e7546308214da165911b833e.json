(AP) - A new film dives into the mystery around a Latina labor leader who organized farmworkers years before Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta and then disappeared.\n\n\u201cAdios Amor: The Search for Maria Moreno\u201d on PBS focuses on a Mexican American mother of 12 who galvanized poor agricultural workers during the late 1950s and early 1960s until she vanished.\n\nDirector and producer Laurie Coyle says finding archive photos of Moreno sparked the idea. Coyle says a photographer and radio reporter remembered Moreno as an important advocate but didn\u2019t know what happened to her.\n\nThe documentary examines how the Texas-born farmworker emerged as a leader in California before moving to Arizona.\n\nThe film, a presentation of VOCES, PBS\u2019 Latino arts and culture documentary program, is slated to premiere Friday on most PBS stations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new film dives into the mystery around a Latina labor leader who organized farmworkers years before Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta and then disappeared.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Russell Contreras"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
