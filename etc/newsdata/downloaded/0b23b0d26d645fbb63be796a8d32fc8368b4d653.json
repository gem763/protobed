Miss Tate believes he would have been caught sooner if her complaint had been acted upon.\n\nHM Inspector of Constabulary Zoe Billingham said it was 'shocking' that one in 10 police officers, around 35,000 staff, did not have up to date background checks\n\nMr Gilbertson has said the \u2018scale of offending had got beyond anything that I had imagined was possible' and a report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary last month criticised predatory officers but claimed the scale of the problem was tiny (file image)\n\nAnother woman, a domestic violence victim called Julie, was bombarded with suggestive texts by Lancashire PC Ilshan Ali after he was assigned to her case.\n\nPC Simon Salway sent sexual messages to Lorraine Tate after she witnessed a beating of a taxi driver outside her flat\n\nOne message read: \u2018Your duvet is the luckiest thing going, it gets to wrap itself around you.'\n\nIt later emerged that Ali had targeted four vulnerable women \u2013 three of them domestic violence victims. Last year he was jailed for two years for misconduct.\n\nFigures show seven times more police officers than doctors or teachers were fired or convicted for sexual misconduct in the six months to October 2018.\n\nDavid Gilbertson, a former commander at Scotland Yard, said he started compiling a database of abuse in 2015 because he was alarmed at the absence of official figures.\n\nHe added: \u2018The scale of offending had got beyond anything that I had imagined was possible.\u2019 But he warned that many women may be suffering in silence.\n\nA report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary last month criticised predatory officers but claimed the scale of the problem was tiny.\n\nExposure: Predator Police Uncovered will be screened on ITV at 10.45pm on Tuesday.", "description": "David Gilbertson (left), former Scotland Yard Commander, found 227 officers were fired or convicted for exploiting victims in the UK from 2015-18.This includes PC Simon Salway (inset).", "authors": ["Michael Powell For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19637820-0-image-a-10_1570917254983.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
