There seems to be one law for Boris and another for everybody else.\u201d\n\nMaltby, like many others in the Irish Sea coast resort, voted to leave. In the 2016 referendum it was the most Eurosceptic place in north-west England with 67.5% saying they wanted to leave the EU.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Sullivan: \u2018The Queen should take charge!\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nAmid reports that the government will seek to lay out a people v parliament campaign in any general election, one of the key questions about the supreme court\u2019s decision that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful is whether voters will conclude that the judges were justified \u2013 or decide that Brexit is being thwarted by an establishment stitch-up.\n\n\u201cYes, we voted to leave but we didn\u2019t ask for this mess,\u201d Maltby says. \u201cThis is undemocratic. Now all I want him [Johnson] to do is get us a deal and then resign.\u201d\n\nOutside JK\u2019s steakhouse and cafe bar, leave voter Tony Shaw, 76, and his partner Brenda Green, 70, who voted to remain, are now in agreement. They both feel Johnson\u2019s position has become untenable.\n\n\u201cI am not impressed,\u201d says Shaw, who was pleased by the judges\u2019 decision. \u201cHe\u2019s tried to overrule the country and stop democracy and that is way out of order. He should not be allowed to get away with this. I voted to leave because I did not like the idea of being ruled by the European Union but what is the point when our own politicians just do what they want and get away with it?\u201d\n\nBut for James Sullivan, 26, who also voted to leave, there has been one delay too many and now there is only one drastic solution.\n\n\u201cThe politicians obviously can\u2019t seem to get this right. All they seem to think about is tactics. We should be following the examples of Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Norway where the royal families get involved in politics. It\u2019s time for the Queen to take charge!\u201d NP\n\nSouth Gloucestershire \u2013 53% leave\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The whole country will vote Boris.\u2019 Ken Balkwill in the Kings Chase shopping centre.\n\nPhotograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian\n\nIn Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, 66-year-old Ken Balkwill declared himself a staunch fan of Johnson. \u201cBoris will sort it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s an election I\u2019ll vote for Boris, my wife will vote for Boris, my son will vote for him. The whole country will vote Boris.\u201d\n\nBalkwill did not accept the supreme court\u2019s ruling. \u201cBoris never broke the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the law courts to decide how the country should be run. The government is there to run the country. The courts should let it get on with it.\u201d\n\nPaul Boyce, 72, a retired railway worker and a leave-supporting Tory, agreed. \u201cI think the law courts have too much power. What\u2019s going to happen now? Is the government going to have to go the courts every time it passes a new law?\u201d\n\nKingswood lies three miles east of Bristol city centre, its name originating from the time when it was part of the royal hunting estate. Bristol voted for remain but Kingswood falls within South Gloucestershire, where 53% voted to leave.\n\nJake Turner, a 19-year-old worker at the fruit and veg shop in Kings Chase shopping centre, was too young to vote in the EU referendum. He thinks he would have voted leave but if there is a second referendum might plump for remain.\n\nOn Johnson, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man for the job but actually I\u2019m not sure who could do that job. I certainly don\u2019t trust Jeremy Corbyn, he scares me. He promises so much but the country wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d\n\nYvonne Kelly, 51, who runs the flower shop in the shopping centre, was one of the few that thought the court had been right to find against Johnson.\n\n\u201cI think Boris is arrogant, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in touch with real people and what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cTo turn round and close parliament like he did shows that arrogance. I\u2019m more leaning to Labour at the moment.\u201d SM\n\nPerth \u2013 61% remain\n\nKenneth Sloan was pretty clear that Johnson deserved to lose in the supreme court. \u201cI think Boris wanted to game the system,\u201d Sloan said as he waited outside Primark in central Perth for his wife with their small white dog. \u201cWe\u2019re a parliamentary democracy, and we need to go back to parliament.\u201d\n\nSloan, 42, added: \u201cThis talk about how they shouldn\u2019t get involved in the political system: there\u2019s the rule of law, you can\u2019t just do what you please. He said it wasn\u2019t about Brexit in the first place but it clearly was, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t need such a large prorogation.\u201d\n\nIn many respects Perth exemplifies Scotland\u2019s recent political history and its political tensions. Once regarded as a Tory stronghold, it is now represented by Scottish National party MPs and MSPs. In the 2017 snap election, the Conservatives came within 21 votes of beating the veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart in Perth & North Perthshire \u2013 one of the narrowest margins of the election.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kenneth Sloan: \u2018There\u2019s the rule of law, you can\u2019t just do what you please.\u2019 Photograph: Robert Perry/The Guardian\n\nA day after the supreme court judgment, voters in the city were split over whether the court was right to overrule Johnson: there were furious leave voters and delighted remain voters.\n\nDouglas Glen, a pro-Brexit businessman and former army officer, said the court\u2019s intervention raised profound questions that could only be resolved by a fresh election. \u201cI think it\u2019s the beginning of a major constitutional crisis in the UK,\u201d he said.\n\nGlen was nonplussed by the earlier high court ruling in England that said the prorogation was lawful and dismissive of the three senior Scottish judges in the court of session whose ruling against Johnson was upheld by the supreme court. They were too easily influenced by Scotland\u2019s nationalist devolved government, he said.\n\nQuick guide The six key paragraphs in the supreme court's verdict Show Hide That the court judgment was not about Brexit \u201cIt is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d That the court had the right to act \u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019 \u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the vonstitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful \u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c That parliament has not been prorogued \u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d What happens next? \u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d The full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.\n\n\u201cIn the future, how on earth will this work if anyone who doesn\u2019t like anything will take it to the supreme court?\u201d Glen asked. \u201cWhat we need is an election. I think the House of Commons has become divorced from the people. People know when they\u2019re being had and the people of this country are being really, really had.\u201d\n\nA fellow leave voter, Elaine, who declined to give her full name, said the court ruling had shattered her confidence in democracy. \u201cI was disappointed that the judges got involved because they shouldn\u2019t be above parliament. Parliament should be making our decisions, whether they\u2019re right or wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019m quite optimistic that it will all come right somehow,\u2019 said student Fern Smith on Perth High Street. Photograph: Robert Perry/The Guardian\n\nFern Smith, a 19-year-old student who was too young to vote in the 2016 referendum, said she would vote remain if there was a second vote and backed the supreme court\u2019s decision. But since the country had voted leave originally, she said, that should be honoured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that it was ruled out because the rest of parliament didn\u2019t seem happy with it. It felt right that someone outside parliament told him not to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it has definitely been screwed up. I\u2019m quite optimistic that it will all come right somehow. It\u2019s going to happen so we might as well embrace it and hope for the best.\u201d SC", "description": "Leavers and remainers in Blackpool, Gloucestershire and Perth are united by strength of feeling", "authors": ["Nazia Parveen", "Steven Morris", "Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe895e318ca163584ab36b718cad55fa8195341/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1857abe7487ffd97936bc8e92e610c5c", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
