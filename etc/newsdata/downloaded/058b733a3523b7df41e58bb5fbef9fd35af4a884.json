Courtesy of Nick Molnar\n\nNick Molnar was in his early twenties when he had a vision to turn an installment payments system into a millennial-friendly fintech sensation. His company Afterpay, which allows online shoppers to buy items and pay for them over four interest-free installments, has moved aggressively from a small startup in Australia into the US and UK online retail space, and currently has a market capitalization of around $8 billion, according to MarketWatch.\n\nThe cofounder and CEO said that he found that the dynamics of raising capital were \"very different in the Australian market than it is in the US.\" Molnar and his cofounder Anthony Eisen floated on the Australian Stock Market (ASX) in 2016 \u2014 only nine months after the business launched \u2014 to gain access to capital so that they could focus on growth.\n\n\"We were very pleased with the decision to list on the ASX, as it gave the company the financial resources needed to realize the value of the business,\" he explained. \"And, importantly, with our public balance sheet, we were able to demonstrate the highest level of business compliance and the ability to guarantee payment settlements to our retail partners \u2014 a critical factor to our business success.\"\n\nMolnar said that the top priority after listing on the stock market was managing scale, and this was achieved through investing equally in people and technology.\n\n\"We focused on attracting top talent to the company with expertise in retail, commerce, and payments technology, as well as expanding our platform capacity and accessibility to meet the consumer and retailer demand for Afterpay,\" he said. Afterpay has more than 500 employees globally, and since launching in the US in May of 2018, it has a staff of around 100.\n\nTheir latest investment has been in tech, as they look to be market leaders in focusing on helping their retail partners grow.\n\n\"We invested in the Afterpay Shop Directory, a highly visual and intuitive way for shoppers to find brands and specific items to buy,\" said Molnar. \"This directory has become a critical customer acquisition tool for our retailer partners and a strategic differentiator for the business. In July 2019, it referred nearly four million customers to US retailers \u2014 with some retailers seeing more referrals from Afterpay than the largest social media sites.\"\n\nGoing from zero to $8 billion in under four years has taught Molnar that keeping on top of great talent is the best way to spend their money.\n\n\"Looking back, there is always room to improve,\" he said. \"We continue to focus on attracting the best talent across all of the markets in which [we] operate. To date, Afterpay's best talent has come from executives and internal teams' own network, our board of director members' network, and recruiting based on Afterpay's growing brand in the US.\"", "description": "With the fintech market projected to be worth over $300 billion by 2023, the key question is shifting from how to raise capital to how to spend it.", "authors": ["Elle Hardy"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9fa97d4af90945e24c29ac?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
