You can also set up emergency contacts, and instruct the phone to detect falls.\n\nSetting up Show When Locked\n\n\u201cShow When Locked\u201d can be important if you have a chronic condition such as diabetes or an allergy that could trigger a health crisis; it means that if you need help, the information will be available to someone without having to unlock your phone. On your Apple Watch, the info will be available on a slider that appears when you press and hold the side button.\n\nOn your iPhone, find and open the Health app.\n\nTap the person icon on the upper right corner of the Summary screen.\n\nIn the \u201cMedical Details\u201d part of the profile screen, tap \u201cMedical ID.\u201d If this is the first time you\u2019ve used the app, you\u2019ll find that most of the page is taken up with a form that contains places for information about allergies, medications, blood type, etc. If you\u2019ve already used the app, you\u2019ll just see the info you\u2019ve already entered; in that case, tap \u201cEdit\u201d in the screen\u2019s upper right corner to see the full page.\n\nAt the top of this screen (which is labeled \u201cMedical ID\u201d), activate \u201cShow When Locked.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up an emergency contact\n\nSetting up your watch to call a specific person when there\u2019s an emergency is a little convoluted, but it\u2019s worth the effort.\n\nOn the same Medical ID page, scroll to the bottom of the screen to find the \u201cEmergency Contacts\u201d section and tap on \u201cadd emergency contact.\u201d You\u2019ll get a list of your contacts.\n\nSelect the contacts who\u2019ll get a message with your location informing them that you\u2019ve called emergency services. Tap \u201cDone,\u201d then \u201cBack,\u201d then \u201cDone\u201d to return to the Health app\u2019s Summary page.\n\nSummoning help\n\nIf you want to take advantage of the Emergency SOS feature on your Apple Watch, you first have to toggle this feature in your phone\u2019s Watch app:\n\nSelect the Emergency SOS screen.\n\nToggle \u201cHold Side Button\u201d on.\n\nTo start an Emergency SOS call on your watch, hold down the side button until the Emergency SOS slider appears (you\u2019ll also see \u201cPower Off\u201d and \u201cMedical ID\u201d sliders). Either drag the slider or keep holding the side button down; emergency services will be called, followed by a notification to people in your emergency contact list. If you\u2019ve activated the feature by mistake, you can tap a few times to cancel the call and the notifications.\n\nThis is not bulletproof. If your watch doesn\u2019t have cellular service, your phone will need to be nearby, or your watch will have to be connected to a known Wi-Fi network with Apple\u2019s Wi-Fi Calling feature. (You can set up Wi-Fi Calling by using your iPhone\u2019s Settings app and going to \u201cPhone\u201d > \u201cWi-Fi Calling,\u201d and then turning on \u201cWi-Fi Calling on This iPhone\u201d and \u201cAdd Wi-Fi Calling For Other Devices.\u201d )\n\nKeep in mind that if you travel (or live) outside the United States, the service could work differently. You may have to select which service you need; for example, police, fire, or ambulance. If you have the Watch\u2019s fifth edition along with a cellular service, you can summon local help in most countries (there are exceptions), but the watch won\u2019t notify your emergency contacts.\n\nFall detection\n\nYour watch can also detect serious falls. If it thinks you\u2019ve taken a tumble and can\u2019t move, the watch will send an alert to ask if you\u2019re okay. If you don\u2019t respond, the watch will tap your wrist, then send an alarm, and then call emergency services. You can toggle this feature in your phone\u2019s Watch app:\n\nSelect the Emergency SOS screen (see above).\n\nToggle \u201cFall Detection\u201d on. You\u2019ll get a warning that if you\u2019re physically active, you\u2019re more likely to accidentally trigger fall detection. Tap \u201cConfirm.\u201d", "description": "The Apple Watch Emergency SOS function is designed to notify people that you\u2019re in trouble and what your location is, so that someone can come to the rescue. \"Show When Locked\" will allow important medical conditions to be seen even if your phone is locked.
