And while that shift might carry less of a political risk, national security experts believe it could be a gut punch to U.S. diplomatic and security interests in a part of the world that has been a particular sore spot for the president: Europe.\n\nThe Trump administration is set to move $771 million worth of funding away from projects earmarked to the European Deterrence Initiative, a program created by the Obama administration that was designed to reassure anxious European allies that the U.S. would back them up in the wake of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2019, the Deterrence Initiative\u2019s budget ballooned from $1 billion to $6.5 billion; Trump himself has pushed for increases to the program in his budget proposals. So while plenty of EDI funding still remains, deferred cash from the program accounts for two out of every five dollars that the administration is diverting to the wall from overseas\u2014raising more questions about Trump\u2019s inconsistent posture on the threat posed by Russia, along with his willingness to support NATO, which he has characterized as a financial burden on the U.S.\n\nThose familiar with the region are now sounding the alarm about what signals the raiding of EDI sends to Russia and to U.S. allies in Europe. \u201cThe signal it sends to Russia,\u201d said a congressional aide, \u201cis that the U.S. isn\u2019t serious about its deterrence initiative for Europe, we\u2019re not serious about our commitment to NATO and to our allies. The messaging is bad, and it\u2019s compounded with all the other bad things Trump has done to harm relations with Europe.\u201d\n\nThe move is another slap in the face to European allies who have spent the last two and a half years frustrated and bewildered, said Jim Townsend, who was deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO affairs under Obama. \u201cThey\u2019re punishing the Europeans,\u201d said Townsend, who pointed out specific impacts from the cut list. Close to $16 million, for example, is being axed for U.S. special forces training facilities in Estonia\u2014a country that is particularly wary of Russian expansionism.\n\n\u201cIn my old office in the Pentagon,\u201d said Townsend, \u201cI\u2019m sure the Estonians have already shown up and gone, \u2018what the fuck?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe deferred EDI funds affect 25 military construction projects spread out over 13 countries, from the United Kingdom and Spain to countries on NATO\u2019s front lines\u2014such as Estonia and Poland\u2014that stand to be most immediately impacted by any escalation of hostilities between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nExperts are especially concerned with that latter group, pointing out that the administration has dried up funding for projects that most directly affect U.S. military readiness: In Poland, for example, $130 million will be deferred for the construction of ammunition and fuel storage facilities, as well as the building of railway extensions and staging areas.\n\n\u201c In my old office in the Pentagon, I\u2019m sure the Estonians have already shown up and gone, \u2018what the fuck?\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Jim Townsend, deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO affairs under Obama\n\n\u201cWe already have a problem with cross-border transport in Europe, especially the eastern flank,\u201d said the congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the matter. \u201cThe eastern countries are the most vulnerable, their infrastructure is relatively new. Taking money from there increases vulnerability.\u201d\n\nThe State Department referred The Daily Beast to the Department of Defense for comment about whether or not affected countries were informed of the funding shift. In response to questions, a Pentagon spokesperson pointed to a Sept. 3 Defense Department press briefing during which officials said they were \u201cnotifying countries\u201d of the cuts, while adding little else in the way of detail.\n\nThe administration\u2019s decision making, said Jonathan Hoffman, assistant to the Secretary of Defense, is intended \u201cto provide time to work with Congress to determine opportunities to restore funds, as well as work with our allies and partners on improving cost burden sharing for the overseas construction projects.\u201d\n\nGiven the significant increase in EDI\u2019s budget over the last five years, the cuts aren\u2019t as big as they sound, said Alina Polyakova, a fellow and Russia expert at the Brookings Institute, though she added the U.S. shouldn\u2019t divest from initiatives that shore up NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nBut Polyakova argued that the move adds to a growing trust deficit between the U.S. and Europe in the Trump era. Already, the administration is withholding $250 million in annual military aid to Ukraine that is intended to deter Russia, sparking bipartisan frustration on Capitol Hill. And ever since he started out as a candidate, Trump has repeatedly criticized the NATO system, arguing that the U.S. contributes too much and Europe too little.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaotic and is sending mixed signals to all of our allies in Europe, including EU and NATO member states,\u201d said Polyakova. \u201cYou have this, withholding aid from Ukraine, the sanctions policy on Russia, it\u2019s really confusing if you\u2019re in Kiev or Warsaw.\u201d\n\nEvelyn Farkas, former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine under Obama, said the U.S. looks again like an unreliable ally. \u201cIt raises the question of whether the president is sufficiently committed to deterrence of Russia and security of U.S. personnel and U.S. interests in Europe as opposed to on our border.\u201d\n\nBut several experts argue that the EDI funding should not be confused with security assistance to NATO countries. \u201cWe don\u2019t have facilities because we\u2019re being nice to the Greeks or the Estonians,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cWe have them because we feel we need them\u2026 Having a strong U.S. force posture deters Russia, helps the U.S., and helps the Europeans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is stuff we\u2019re going to need if we\u2019re going to make sure the Russians understand we\u2019re gonna fight and defend an ally, and we\u2019ve got the capability to do so.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, aides concede there is not much they can do to stop the Trump administration from transferring the Europe security funds\u2014or funds for projects in the U.S.\u2014to the border wall. Lawmakers are sending letters demanding answers from the Department of Defense, and are mulling other steps they can take. While they press for more explanations as to why projects in their states and districts are being put at risk, the impact of the overseas cuts remains decidedly on the back burner.\n\n\u201cThey were looking for easy targets,\u201d said Farkas of the administration\u2019s raiding of European deterrence funds. \u201cThere is no natural constituency for overseas projects, so it seems to be the least politically painful way to go.\u201d", "description": "National security experts believe it could be a gut punch to U.S. diplomatic and security interests in a part of the world that\u2019s been a sore spot for the president: Europe.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567989839/190908-Brodey-Trump-tease_wtc3bz", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
