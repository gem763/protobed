He was told to be quiet by others watching the film.\n\nHe is said to have then stood up on his seat, placed his hands on his chest and shouted out \"Allahu akbar\".\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\nThe panic deepened further when people incorrectly claimed he had a gun, Le Parisien reported.\n\nA cinema-goer, named as Victor, told Le Parisien: \"It was total panic.\n\n\"People jumped over seats and women fell to the ground in the aisles.\"\n\nDuring the evacuation the man was wrestled to the ground by other cinema-goers and security guard but he managed to escape.\n\n(Image: Sipa/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHowever he was stopped outside by police and arrested.\n\nHe was later found to be unarmed and identified as a 34-year-old from the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt.\n\nAfter the cinema was evacuated it was searched by a bomb squad and dogs for any weapons or explosives - nothing was found.\n\nAccording to Le Parisien , the cinema's management said that the newly-released mover attracts \"a specific kind of viewer, notably people who are against the system.\n\n(Image: Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\n\"There have been minor incidents in other theatres.\"\n\nHowever one of the cinema's directors told The Hollywood Reporter the man had been working with an accomplice to distract visitors so they could steal people's possessions.\n\nJoker has became the most successful R-rated movie in history, collecting $849million (\u00a3659m) worldwide.\n\nIt stars Joaquin Phoenix in the lead role and was released in the UK on October 4.", "description": "People fled in terror from the screening in Paris after the incident on Sunday", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Sipa Rex Shutterstock", "Warner Bros.
