I\u2019m Martin Farrer, bringing you the top stories from home and abroad this Friday morning.\n\nStephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will meet EU\u2019s top negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels this morning after talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, provided renewed hope of a Brexit deal. The two leaders hinted at a \u201cpathway\u201d to an agreement when they emerged from their country house meeting in Cheshire with an upbeat message that took European bureaucrats by surprise. Varadkar will also report to Brussels on the meeting, and Barnier will assess whether sufficient progress has been made for in-depth talks to start before next Thursday\u2019s crunch summit in Brussels. Both Varadkar and Johnson agreed there was enough for substantive talks, although the taoiseach warned there was \u201cmany a slip between cup and lip\u201d. Downing Street refused to say if Johnson had conceded ground on the Irish border issue \u2013 potentially causing conflict with hardliners in his ranks \u2013 and EU officials were also reluctant to discuss details. One EU official predicted a week of no sleep for negotiating teams but described the chances of a deal as \u201cambitious\u201d.\n\nThe pound soared on the news and this morning\u2019s papers are full of optimism. Back in Westminster, pro-remain MPs said they would test the water for a second referendum when parliament sits for the so-called \u201csuper Saturday\u201d next weekend.\n\nUS red lines \u2013 The Trump administration has tried to clarify its policy towards Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria by setting out red lines that Ankara must not cross. As the death toll from the bombardment of communities along the Turkish-Syrian border continued to mount, a senior official said the US would not tolerate any suggestion of ethnic cleansing in the heavily Kurdish area, or \u201cindiscriminate artillery, air and other fire directed at civilian population\u201d. Despite the widespread view that Donald Trump sanctioned the Turkish invasion, the official condemned the military action. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan earlier pushed back against criticism by threatening to send millions of Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey towards the EU. Our Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, reports from the city of Qamishli on the bitter mood among Kurds fleeing the fighting. \u201cAfter giving 5,000 martyrs, this is how they respond to our sacrifice,\u201d one said. And Bethan McKernan hears the view from the other side where Turks fear the onset of war.\n\nAt home, Trump saw two Soviet-born American associates of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, charged with funneling foreign money into his election campaign. But at a rally in Minnesota, the president tried to weaponise the impeachment inquiry launched against him by Democrats, lashing out at Joe Biden as the crowd chanted \u201cLock him up!\u201d.\n\nBBC under pressure \u2013 Competition from streaming services such as Netflix will place increasing pressure on the BBC\u2019s finances as the cost of making programmes goes up and younger viewers see no need to pay the licence fee. A report by the Commons culture committee points to data showing that people under-34 spend on average more than twice as much time each day watching YouTube than they do BBC 1, BBC2, ITV 1, Channel 4 and Channel 5 combined. But the MPs also called on the government to ensure that all over-75s receive a free licence.\n\nSocial housing threat \u2013 Councils say the government has \u201ctrashed\u201d plans to build more social housing across the country after it raised the cost of Treasury loans. Local leaders say the one percentage point increase on public works loan board (PWLB) finance, which was imposed \u201cout of the blue\u201d this week, could delay or scupper housebuilding and regeneration schemes. Sharon Taylor, the leader of Stevenage council, says it is \u201canother big blow for local government finance\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stormzy, centre back row, with some students starting at Cambridge University. Photograph: Stormzy\n\nGown with the kids \u2013 A record number of black British students are studying at Cambridge University thanks in part to a scholarship scheme set up by the musician Stormzy. Cambridge say 91 black British students have started as undergraduates this year, up nearly 50% on last October. Stormzy, a grime music star, announced that he was setting up two scholarships and is also paying for the tuition fees and living expenses of two more.\n\nSelfie alarm \u2013 Police in Japan have revealed an extraordinary case in which a pop star was allegedly attacked by a stalker who tracked her down by analysing details reflected in her eyes in selfies posted on social media. In one image, he deciphered a train sign from which he located her local station. He then lay in wait for her one night in September and assaulted her.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: the problem of diplomatic immunity\n\nHarry Dunn died in a collision in August with a car allegedly being driven by the wife of a US diplomat, who left the UK soon after under the rules of diplomatic immunity. Patrick Wintour looks at what might happen next. And author Jonathan Safran Foer on changing the way we eat to avoid climate catastrophe.\n\nToday in Focus dunno Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/10/10-57750-20191011_TIF_HarryDunn.mp3 00:00:00 00:24:42\n\nLunchtime read: Naomie Harris, from Moonlight to action hero\n\nAfter a career of eye-catching supporting roles such as in Moonlight, the Bond films and Pirates of the Caribbean, Naomie Harris plays the lead as a New Orleans cop in her new film Black and Blue. The British star says her intense approach to her work (after Moonlight she was \u201ccompletely burned out\u201d and wanted to open a nail salon) meant she always preferred playing second fiddle. But supporting roles might a thing of the past for the 43-year-old who tells Cath Clarke about growing up in Finsbury Park, the time she was groped by \u201ca huge star\u201d, how Phoebe Waller-Bridge was on call to sex up the latest Bond script and playing a gun-toting cop \u2013 \u201cI was like: \u2018Oh my gosh, I am an action hero in this movie. This is not how I envisioned my career at all\u2019.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nAn ill wind may be blowing for some at the Rugby World Cup but for Eddie Jones and England life is suddenly unexpectedly calm as they face a free weekend at the seaside in Japan. Scotland\u2019s coach, Gregor Townsend, believes his side will not be denied a last-eight chance but the weather and a reluctance to relocate or postpone Sunday\u2019s game against Japan suggest otherwise. Gareth Southgate has moved to smooth relations with Bulgaria before the Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday after he and members of the England squad were accused of making \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cderogatory\u201d remarks. Kieffer Moore, a former lifeguard, saved Wales\u2019 Euro 2020 qualification hopes from drifting into troubled waters with a goal that spared them a crushing defeat in Slovakia.\n\nSimone Biles continued to stake her claim as one of the most dominant athletes of her generation as she bulldozed all competition to win her fifth world championships individual all\u2011around gold medal in Stuttgart. And Chris Silverwood has preached a return to the old-fashioned values of batting time and relentlessness with the ball as the new England men\u2019s coach outlined his vision of a Test team who can regain the Ashes in two years\u2019 time.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe entrepreneur who saved HMV from administration earlier this year is set to open a huge new store in Birmingham city centre under the venerable old brand. The supermarket-sized outlet will stock 80,000 CDs and 25,000 vinyl albums in a bold expansion that Doug Putnam thinks can defy slumping physical sales.\n\nBusinesses in the US are lamenting the prospect of tariffs on British imports such as Jammie Dodgers, Scottish shortbread, clotted cream and Irish bacon. Sean Kavanagh-Dowsett, co-owner of the Manhattan restaurant Tea & Sympathy, says: \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact us, and as always it\u2019s going to get passed on to customers.\u201d The pound has held on to its Brexit-related gains overnight to sit at $1.244 and \u20ac1.129, while the FTSE100 looks like opening down 0.5%.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nBrexit dominates most the front pages. The Guardian splash says \u201cJohnson and Varadkar: \u2018We can see a pathway to possible Brexit deal\u2019\u201d, while the Times is on the same wavelength with \u201cBritain and Ireland on \u2018pathway to agreement\u2019\u201d, as is the Telegraph with \u201cDeal can be done by Oct 31, say Irish\u201d. The FT are also on the same track with \u201cJohnson and Varadkar see Brexit deal \u2018pathway\u2019 as talks shift mood\u201d. The Scotsman agrees that \u201cJohnson and Varadkar can \u2018see pathway\u2019 to Brexit deal\u201d. The Mail chances its arm a bit more and asks \u201cDare we dream of a deal?\u201d, while the Express is also in a questioning mood with \u201cHas Boris only gone and done it?\u201d. The Metro says \u201cIrish eyes are smiling\u201d and the i says \u201c\u2018Pathway to a deal in sight\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe Sun leads with the Rooney/Vardy bust-up \u2013 \u201cBecky\u2019s wagony\u201d \u2013 and the Mirror diverges from Brexit with Rod Stewart\u2019s wife shedding \u201cTears for my brave Rod\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
