Holy smokes. Right now you can get the Echo Dot as a package deal with one month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $10.98. Yes, you read that price correctly. This Echo usually retails for $49.99, while the lowest price we've ever seen it go for is $22. Any way you cut it, this deal is honestly insane.\n\nWe think Amazon might just be trying to clear their inventory in preparation for the newer model to be released this November, which comes with an LED clock display. But if you're willing to just ask Alexa the time (or look at your watch), the current model will more than suffice. It's our favorite affordable Amazon echo speaker, but at this price, Amazon just took the affordability to a whole new level.\n\nIf you've been wanting a voice assistant for a while now, I'm stating the obvious here, but now's the time to buy. With over 50,000 skills, Alexa can assist you in ways you didn't even know you needed, whether you need help tracking your fitness goals and staying healthy, improving your sleep habits, or just the basics like checking the news, traffic, and weather, setting reminders and alarms, adding things to your shopping list, and gaining voice control for your compatible smart home devices.\n\nIf you shop this crazy deal, just remember to cancel Amazon Music Unlimited before the month is up, unless you'd like it to auto-renew for $9.99 a month. But with your new Echo, you can just have Alexa remind you. Pretty convenient, eh?\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
