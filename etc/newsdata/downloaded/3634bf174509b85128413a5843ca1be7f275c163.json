They include Exodus International, which offered gay \u201cconversion therapy\u201d before it closed down in 2013 and apologised to gay people for \u201cyears of undue judgment by the organisation and the Christian church as a whole\u201d; and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which opposes same-sex marriage.\n\nChick-fil-A CEO puts an end to speculation, comes out \u2026 as anti-gay Read more\n\nIn 2012, Chick-fil-A\u2019s chief executive, Dan Cathy, said: \u201cWe are very much supportive of the family \u2013 the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that \u2026 We want to do anything we possibly can to strengthen families.\u201d\n\nLast week, eight days after Chick-fil-A opened in Reading, the Oracle shopping mall announced it would not extend the chain\u2019s initial six-month lease.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe always look to introduce new concepts for our customers, however, we have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-fil-A to trade with us for the initial six-month pilot period, and not to extend the lease any further.\u201d\n\nReading Pride said its protests at the outlet would continue until its closure.\n\nChick-fil-A, which opened its first diner in Atlanta, Georgia in 1946, claims to be \u201cthe largest chicken quick-service restaurant chain in America\u201d. Its founder, Truett Cathy, developed a \u201cbusiness philosophy based on biblical principles\u201d, according to the company\u2019s website. Its outlets are closed on Sundays.\n\nThe chain has also faced controversy in the US. Last year, Rider University in New Jersey declined to offer Chick-fil-A an outlet on campus despite demands from students because the company was \u201cwidely perceived to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community\u201d.\n\nLast month, a lawsuit was filed against San Antonio international airport over its refusal to allow Chick-fil-A to open an outlet. Five citizens demanded that an injunction should be brought against the airport barring any company \u201cbased wholly or partly on that person or entity\u2019s support for religious organisations that oppose homosexual behaviour\u201d.\n\nChick-fil-A has been approached for comment.", "description": "Reading branch of US chain to close after protests over stance on same-sex relationships", "authors": ["Harriet Sherwood", "Hannah Jane Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f27307fb7fe2f72ef54799d75c74efa3c96bad/0_31_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cf78a6096399f69e6a64e96caaa9c6a3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
