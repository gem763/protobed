These people are looking at my child and saying all this hurtful stuff. He\u2019s a completely innocent child.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLidl Ireland early last month tweeted that it was having to block and report \"offensive and racist tweets\" from former journalist Gemma O'Doherty about the couple's inclusion in the ad.\n\nThe prominent provocateur, who is widely described in Irish media as a conspiracy theorist, began whipping up an online campaign to boycott Lidl after seeing the ads featuring the family.\n\nDuring the programme's presenter Ryan Tubridy read out a comment about the couple posted on Twitter by Ms O\u2019Doherty.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cGerman dump @lidl_ireland gaslighting the Irish people with their multicultural version of \u2018The Ryans\u2019. Kidding no-one! Resist the Great Replacement wherever you can by giving this kip a wide berth. #ShopIrish #BuyIrish.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe tweet reportedly attracted a slew of vile responses - including comments from Twitter users about \"race/ancestor betrayal,\" and replies attacking immigrants and \"Africans\".\n\nIreland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar condemned the abuse.\n\nThe leader of the government called the social media attacks on the County Meath couple \"disgusting\".\n\nMs Ryan, who is from Ireland originally and is an actor, earlier told Newstalk she moved to London when she was 19 and met Mr Mathis, a construction worker, seven years ago.\n\nThe couple decided to move back to Ireland together last year after travelling, and settled down to have baby Jonah.\n\nShe told media the abuse was centred on the couple's multicultural relationship, with trolls accusing them of not representing \"real\" Irish families.\n\nLidl Ireland tweeted on September 8: \"We are proud of our multicultural & diverse team and our customers. We are proud to work with, and serve, each and every one of them. Everyone is welcome in our store.\"\n\nMs O'Doherty later labelled reports on the abuse targeting the couple and the ad \"fake news\" and \"hysteria.\"\n\nThe couple criticised Ireland's police force, as well as Facebook and Twitter, saying none of them had done enough to crackdown on the family's online abusers- despite their concerns their toddler was a target.\n\nAfter the couple reported the matter to the Garda the force reportedly told the couple it was a civil matter.\n\nThe couple has previously said they bore no ill-will towards Ms O'Doherty, saying she had actually done them a favour by highlighting a weakness in hate crime legislation in Ireland.\n\nIn order to report the hate speech the couple were being forced to search for and read abusive tweets about themselves to collect evidence.", "description": "Fiona Ryan and Jonathan Mathis have been been subject to vile racist abuse since they featured in an ad campaign for Lidl with their baby boy", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Lidl", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524222.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lidl-abuse.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
