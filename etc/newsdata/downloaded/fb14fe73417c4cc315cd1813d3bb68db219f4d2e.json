Predictable United fail to win on the road again\u200b\n\nWitness David de Gea aiming long goal kicks at the 5ft 3in frame of Angel Gomes and you will understand just how insipid and predictable this performance was by Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side continue a worrying slump in form with a goalless draw against AZ Alkmaar in Den Haag.\n\nViewed in isolation, a point away from home against a competitive side like AZ is hardly a disastrous result. United sit second in Group L after two games, with four points to their name. Context, however, is essential. United have still not won away from home since that in Paris, 211 days ago. They have scored seven goals in their last nine, home and away.\n\nMost worryingly of all, they do not look a side that can win football matches. Their only scoring opportunity of any real note was Mason Greenwood\u2019s first-half shot inside the box, blocked by Ron Vlaar. Other than that, it was misplaced passes, fumbles in possession and a crippling lack of ideas\n\n2. Williams does not disgrace himself on full debut\n\nThis will be a memorable night for one United player, at least. The 19-year-old Brandon Williams made his full debut at left-back, having appeared as a substitute against Rochdale last week, and it is only fair that he is spared any of the blame for this lifeless display.\n\nThat is not to say he was perfect. One failure to pick up a De Gea pass frustrated his goalkeeper. But there were encouraging moments from the teenager, who was particularly willing to offer attacking support on the overlap. On this evidence, he can do a job but United need more than that.\n\n3. James centre-forward experiment fails\n\nDaniel James began the evening playing up front with Mason Greenwood wide. It lasted all of around 20 minutes. James was isolated and ineffective, without the strength required to hold the ball up against AZ\u2019s centre-halves. There were even times when he looked to the bench for precise instructions on where to play.\n\nSolskjaer realised his error and switched James wide right, but even there appears to be a waste of his obvious talent. The young winger has admitted he prefers playing on the left where he can cut inside and test the goalkeeper, but he has so far been given few opportunities to play his natural role.\n\n4. Matic and Fred midfield lacks any sort of imagination\n\nFred and Nemanja Matic started at the base of midfield together, just as they did in the equally uninspiring win over Astana. Together they cost \u00a387m, yet offer only some defensive solidity. Their selection here - away from home - was perhaps more understandable than a fortnight ago, but was it really necessary?\n\nNeither offer much in the way of invention. Matic has never pretended to, at least. But Fred was supposed to bring dynamism to United\u2019s midfield upon his \u00a352m arrival last year. He is the club\u2019s sixth-most expensive signing in its history and yet, it seemed every ambitious pass he attempted was inaccurate.\n\n5. Plastic pitch can be no excuse\n\nSolskjaer was worried by the condition of the artificial surface at the ADO Den Haag Stadium. \u201cOne of the worst I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said in his pre-match press conference. He suggested that not only did it pose an injury risk to his players but that they would struggle with the bounce. A case of getting excuses in early?\n\nUnited should not point to the pitch when attempting to explain this performance. They cannot afford to. Astana\u2019s ground, which they visit in late November, will be another evening on an artificial surface and no amount of bounce will excuse failing to beat a team currently third in the Kazakhstani Premier League.", "description": "Manchester United were frustrated in the\u00a0Europa League\u00a0after a stalemate against\u00a0AZ Alkmaar.\u00a0 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side lacked all sorts of inspiration and failed to break down the Dutch side throughout.
