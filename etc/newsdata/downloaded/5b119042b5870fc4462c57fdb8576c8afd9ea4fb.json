It had been down as much as 3%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) also fell nearly 3% from five-week highs before trimming losses. Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: ) was up slightly..\n\nFor the year so far, videogame spending is down 6% to $8.3 billion, led by a fall in hardware spend as gamers await the console refresh cycle next year.\n\nThe next-generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles are expected to launch in time for the holiday season next year.\n\nWith just a handful of big titles released last month, the fall in video game sales shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, with some saying the data can be overlooked, particularly with the usual strong slate of game released in the lead up to crucial holiday season.\n\nBut if demand continues to wane in the coming months, that could be cause for concern. For the moment, however, gaming stocks have played their way into a better position so far this year, with the EA and Take-Two boasting double-digit gains.", "description": "StockBeat: Traders Exit Video Game Stocks as Spending Lull Continues", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA740XO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
