Earlier this year, Virginia Democrat Kathy Tran committed the worst sort of Kinsleyan gaffe, if the word \u201cgaffe\u201d is appropriate when discussing the horror of what Tran was proposing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a legislative hearing in January, Tran\u2019s Republican colleague Todd Gilbert asked her about her bill remove existing restrictions on third-trimester abortions.\n\n\u201cSo how late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?\u201d Gilbert asked. \u201cI\u2019m talking about mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, through the third trimester. The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks,\u201d Tran replied.\n\n\u201cSo where it\u2019s obvious that a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that she\u2019s about to give birth, would that still be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she was so certified?\u201d Gilbert asked. \u201cShe\u2019s dilating?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, you know, that would be a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make,\u201d Tran replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI understand that. I\u2019m asking if your bill allows that,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\n\u201cMy bill would allow that, yes,\u201d Tran replied.\n\nVirginia governor Ralph Northam fueled the fire surrounding Tran\u2019s late-term-abortion bill when he made comments about having a \u201cconversation\u201c with a woman about what should be done with a child born alive with deformities after an attempted third-trimester abortion. Tran\u2019s bill was shot down this year by a subcommittee on a 5\u20133 party-line vote, but as voters head to the polls next week to decide control of Virginia\u2019s legislature, Republicans are warning that, in handing Democrats unified control of government for the first time in a generation, voters would also be paving the way for Virginia to impose the most extreme abortion laws it has ever had.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing wisdom is basically that Republicans have to go squishy on the issue of abortion. Democrats have overreached so far on the issue that we\u2019re seeing it being an extremely effective issue up and down the ballot,\u201d Virginia Republican-party executive director John Findlay tells National Review. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our top voting messages across the entire state.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the polls and most political observers say Republicans have their work cut out for them next Tuesday. Republicans currently control the house of delegates 51\u201349 and the senate 20\u201319 (with one vacancy). All 40 senate seats are up for the first time since Donald Trump was elected president, and Virginia\u2019s suburbs have trended Democratic since 2016. There are six GOP-held senate seats in districts that Democratic governor Ralph Northam carried in 2017. Furthermore, a judge required the state to redraw some districts in the House of Delegates because of alleged racial discrimination, and the new lines will likely help Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be at least a little surprised if the Republicans held on to either chamber,\u201d Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics tells National Review. \u201cThe playing field is pretty good for the Democrats now. We\u2019re talking about a lot of seats in northern Virginia, greater Richmond, Hampton Roads. Those places are all suburban. A lot of these districts are either diverse or they have pretty high formal-education levels, which are two indicators of the Democratic trend these days.\u201d\n\nDemocrats at the state level have been plagued by multiple scandals. Governor Northam faced calls to resign after a medical-school yearbook photo appeared to show him in blackface standing next to someone dressed up as a member of the KKK. He originally apologized but later claimed he wasn\u2019t in the photo. Virginia\u2019s Democratic lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax faces rape allegaitions. But a September Washington Post poll found that registered Virginia voters support Democrats over Republicans 49 percent to 42 percent in the fall elections, and a Christopher Newport University poll released Monday showed voters preferring Democrats to Republicans by double digits in four key senate races. \u201cEverything is so nationalized that Trump being in the White House is just more important\u201d to the outcome of next week\u2019s election than the Northam and Fairfax scandals, says Kondik.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Virginia GOP\u2019s John Findlay blames a \u201ccompliant news media that has spent zero time\u201d really investigating Northam and Fairfax. \u201cWe\u2019re using Northam as a cudgel in most of our target districts across the state,\u201d says Findlay. One glimmer of hope for Republicans is that the polls have underestimated Republican support before, as recently as 2013 and 2014.\n\nBut Democrats have a strong advantage in campaign cash. The Virginia Public Access Project reported in mid October that Democrats had raised $32 million this year, while Republicans had raised only $21 million. And outside spending is favoring the Democrats as well. The anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List is spending $200,000 in Virginia, but the pro-abortion-rights Emily\u2019s List is spending $2.1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Democrats have also blunted the GOP\u2019s message about late-term abortion by running away from the abortion bill sponsored by Kathy Tran. After the backlash, U.S. senator Tim Kaine said he opposed Tran\u2019s bill, and one of the Democrats who voted for it in committee said he probably would vote against it if it came up again. But most Democrats stayed silent. After Republican candidate Kelly McGinn hit delegate Danica Roem, a Democrat and the first transgender member of the Virginia legislature, for supporting the abortion bill, Roem finally publicly opposed the bill this month.\n\nBut even if Democrats have obscured the radical nature of their abortion agenda, Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, warns that an extreme agenda is exactly what Democrats will implement if they gain complete control of Virginia\u2019s government for the first time in nearly three decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are no more pro-life Democrats in Virginia,\u201d says Turner. \u201cCurrently there are no sitting members of the general assembly on the Democratic side who oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d Virginia, like most states, prohibits state tax dollars from being used to fund elective abortions for Medicaid recipients. Among the states that do fund Medicaid abortions, only seven have done so voluntarily, while the other ten are under court mandates to do so. Providing taxpayer funding of abortion for Medicaid recipients has a dramatic effect in increasing the abortion rate.\n\n\u201cIf they get full control, it is their avowed intention \u2014 and they said as much during the general assembly \u2014 to pass a radical agenda that mirrors the one that passed in New York, stripping out all of Virginia\u2019s . . . reasonable pro-life laws,\u201d says Turner. \u201cKathy Tran\u2019s bill was not the only bill introduced to achieve that agenda last year. There were actually eight bills.\u201d\n\nOne would end Virginia\u2019s 24-hour waiting period for abortion. Another bill would declare abortion a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d After that bill and a Senate bill identical to Kathy Tran\u2019s bill failed to advance in committee, Democratic governor Ralph Northam said, \u201cWhen we can\u2019t change people\u2019s minds, we change seats.\u201d While Virginia Democrats might find the specific language of the Tran bill too toxic to bring up again in 2020, it is clear is that they will push their agenda as far as they think they can if they win full control. This time, they might just try to do a better job of concealing the truth about what they are trying to accomplish.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
