The lawsuit was a break in practice by the Royal Family, which more traditionally tries to avoid legal action.\n\n\"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person,\" Harry said in a statement attacking the British tabloid press, when he announced the lawsuit. He compared the treatment of Meghan to the coverage of his mother, Princess Diana.\n\nSince Meghan was first linked to Harry, her supporters have criticized some of the media's coverage of her. In 2016, Harry publicly denounced harassment Meghan was receiving online, as well as the \"racial undertones\" of some of the tabloid stories written about her.\n\n\"She would have expected a level of press interest and public interest,\" Lynch told CBS News. \"What she wouldn't have expected was xenophobic undertones to that interest. It doesn't matter who you are in public life, you should never be subjected to that on an almost daily basis,\" Lynch said.\n\nMeghan Markle: Adopting a stiff upper lip is \"probably really damaging\"\n\nIn a recent documentary, the royal couple spoke about the difficulties they've had with media coverage of them.\n\n\"I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, and that's the part that's really hard to reconcile,\" Meghan told the documentary makers, British broadcaster ITV News.\n\n\"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\" Harry said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Lynch told British broadcaster ITV News that Markle had called her to thank her and the other authors of the letter for their support.", "description": "\"She would have expected a level of press interest...
