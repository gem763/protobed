Working with a financial professional like a Certified Plan Fiduciary Advisor (CPFA) can help you to find resources you\u2019ll need when planning for your golden years. Read on to discover how CPFAs can support you through the retirement planning process.\n\nWhat is a Certified Plan Fiduciary Advisor?\n\nA Certified Plan Fiduciary Advisor (CPFA) is a financial professional that demonstrates expertise and experience working with retirement plans. During the CPFA certification, candidates spend around two months learning about fiduciary services for retirement plans.\n\nCPFAs can help their clients objectively review their financial status, identify potential concerns, and recommend the appropriate solutions for addressing these retirement matters.\n\nCPFA Qualifications\n\nThe National Association of Plan Advisors (NAPA) is an organization designed for retirement plan advisors. This organization oversees all coursework and exams required to become a CPFA.\n\nTo achieve a CPFA certification, candidates must pass the NAPA CPFA examination. Unlike other certifications, there are no experience or education requirements. However, for candidates with little to no experience, it\u2019s recommended that they take NAPA\u2019s 401(k) Practice Builder. But, essentially, all candidates must simply take the course modules, study, and then pass their 70-question exam. The exam fee is $360, but $334 for NAPA members. The course modules are $980, or $650 with NAPA membership.\n\nThe CPFA exam covers an array of topics including fiduciary roles and responsibilities, fiduciary oversight, plan investment management, and plan management. All exams are conducted at Prometric Testing Centers around the U.S. These exams ensure that the candidates can retain the information the modules provide and can apply it to situations their clients may face.\n\nCPFA Continuing Education\n\ncpfa More\n\nAfter a candidate passes the CPFA exam, they will receive their CPFA designation. But, to maintain the designation, all CPFAs must complete the continuing education requirements. To keep their designation they must earn 10 credits every year. Those credits cost $595 annually, but can cost as little as $65 if a NAPA firm partner pays for them.\n\nOf the 10 credits that the NAPA requires, one must be on ethics and professional topics. This requirement ensures that the CPFA is current on their knowledge of retirement plans.\n\nDo You Need A CPFA?\n\nMany people struggle to plan for their retirement. There are so many different questions and concerns that arise when you begin planning for your future. That\u2019s why it\u2019s nice to have the expertise of a CPFA professional on your side who can help guide you when planning and making financial decisions.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration passed a rule through the Department of Labor holding that investment advisors have what is called a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to their clients. Fiduciary duty requires professionals to serve the best interests of your client above all else.\n\nJobs adhering to this standard typically require a high degree of specified knowledge. The average person usually can\u2019t understand or refute advice given by such professionals. Those professionals could inflict great harm on their clients by acting in their own interests.\n\nThese criteria broadly establish the two most common elements of a fiduciary duty: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. Though the Trump administration dropped the law, fiduciary duty remains an important standard for many investment professionals. If you value your retirement funds over a firm or institution\u2019s profits, a CPFA or other fiduciary professional may be the right fit for you and your portfolio.\n\nHow to Find a CPFA\n\ncpfa More\n\nStory continues", "description": "If you\u2019re overwhelmed by retirement planning, it\u2019s wise to partner with an expert who puts your interests first.
