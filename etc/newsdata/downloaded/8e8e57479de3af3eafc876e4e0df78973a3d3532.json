The woman is on a mission and there is another saviour she needs to protect at all costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the epic fight scenes, gun battles and high-octane sequences turned up to 11, Dark Fate has been hailed a Terminator masterpiece.\n\nSpeaking of her \u2018affection\u2019 for Arnold as they reunite on screen, the action stalwart revealed to Metro.co.uk that despite the difference in age since she last took on Sarah, the script hardly went easy on her.\n\nAnd she loved it.\n\nBoss (Picture: Paramount Pictures)\n\n\u2018I always want to do as much as possible on any film. I don\u2019t want to give up one second of film to someone else,\u2019 she told us exclusively ahead of the release this week.\n\n\u2018Even though the stunt women might be fitter and more able to take those falls, I love Sarah Connor and \u2026 I was constantly on the stunt women, \u201chold that weapon tighter, I want you to have tendonitis in your right elbow like I do!\u201d\n\nBack in the OG Terminator (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018This fierceness that I have that, apparently, is unmatchable.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018[The] Stuntwomen were fantastic, but I was constantly, \u201cbend your elbow with that weapon, get your stance down, hold that tighter\u201d, because that\u2019s the kind of work that I put in and don\u2019t want anyone else to mess it up.\u2019\n\nSarah Connor is still a force to be reckoned with (Picture: Paramount Pictures)\n\nYep, we\u2019re sufficiently intimidated.\n\nArnold echoed his co-star\u2019s sentiments, as he mused on her \u2018no quit\u2019 spirit.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s really into it,\u2019 he told us.\n\n\u2018One time I watched her submerged in a HUMV in the water and it was up to here [motions to neck], so you could only breathe like this and she\u2019s in that vehicle for hours and they kept saying \u201cdoes she want to come out for a bit, to relax?\u201d [Linda would reply] \u201cNo no no, I\u2019m in character right now, let\u2019s finish this\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She gets so into it and it\u2019s such a pleasure to watch that when someone is really into it, she\u2019s in the character and no work is too much.\u2019\n\nLinda worked her butt off, literally, to get into peak health to run around shooting guns for two hours, ditching carbs for a year and enlisting the help of Serena Williams\u2019 trainer.\n\nAnd Arnold was impressed.\n\n\u2018I have to say I was blown away by Linda\u2019s performance because not only from an acting point of view, the physicality of it. When you talk about her age, it\u2019s not the same when you\u2019re 60-years-old and you jump around [as] when you\u2019re 20 or 30; it\u2019s much more difficult.\n\n\u2018But she trained like crazy and put the hours and reps into it and did the weapons training and was as good as she was in Terminator 2 \u2013 if not better.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s some praise.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is in UK cinemas Wednesday 23 October.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
