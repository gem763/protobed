REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo\n\n\u201cRepression remains the only answer from the Spanish state. They are trying to build again a narrative of violence before the rulings. They will not achieve it. The pro-independence movement is and will always be peaceful,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nIf it is confirmed the materials seized were to be used in explosives, it would mark a first for CDR, a police spokesman said. Its members have been accused of rebellions and terrorism before but the charges were dropped.\n\nIn October 2018, in a bid to mark the one-year anniversary of the region\u2019s referendum, members of the CDR occupied a train station in the Catalan city of Girona and blocked highways, forcing train cancellations and snarling traffic. They later attempted, but failed, to storm the Catalan parliament.", "description": "Spanish police arrested on Monday nine people linked to Catalonia's pro-independence movement who prosecutors said were plotting violent acts and had been charged with terrorism and possessing explosives.", "authors": ["Jose El\u00edas Rodr\u00edguez", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432986446&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1AN", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
