For example, when he was appointed in July, McEwan said he was particularly proud of an indicator in the most recent RBS employee survey that showed staff had never felt safer to speak up.\n\nThat shift took five years to come through and no doubt he\u2019ll be hoping for a speedier response at NAB. But the example emphasises why McEwan will put culture near the top of his priority list.\n\nThe second big priority for investors will be around costs. Under the three-year transformation plan announced by McEwan\u2019s predecessor Andrew Thorburn in November 2017, NAB is aiming to cut $1 billion in costs, slash product numbers in half, cut IT applications by between 15 and 20 per cent and remove 4000 net jobs by the end of the 2020 financial year.\n\nThe bank has made good progress \u2013 as recently as NAB\u2019s June quarter trading update we saw expenses had been held flat \u2013 and McEwan will no doubt be keen to finish the job.\n\nBut the market will be looking for what\u2019s next.\n\nIn November 2017, Thorburn and chairman Ken Henry set the bank a long-term target of getting its cost-to-income ratio towards 35 per cent; on JP Morgan\u2019s numbers it will sit at 46.6 per cent at September 30, falling to 43.3 per cent at the same time in 2020.\n\nAnd while it is true that NAB\u2019s target was set before the royal commission unleashed a barrage of new risk and compliance costs, the market will want to see whether McEwan and Chronican re-endorse the aspirational goal.\n\nGetting towards a 35 per cent cost-to-income ratio would require some very hard and probably unpopular decisions. Slashing branch numbers \u2013 something McEwan has been prepared to do at RBS \u2013 would be an example.\n\nThe other question is what McEwan\u2019s leadership team will look like as he tackles culture and costs.
