In fact, there\u2019s a reason it happens to so many of us: Tucking ourselves in for the night is like a cue to our bodies to wind down. Plus, some studies show that the heft of linens like down comforters and weighted blankets can reduce anxiety and relieve stress (less stress means better sleep).\n\nTroubled sleepers know just how important it is to have everything right to get a good night\u2019s sleep. The room temperature needs to be perfect, there shouldn\u2019t be a device on the bedside table and you absolutely can\u2019t be too hot or too cold \u2014 which begins with the right bedding.\n\nLuckily, the arrival of cooler temperatures means it\u2019s time to break out the heavyweight linens under which it\u2019s much easier to lull ourselves to sleep. Some top-name duvet inserts and down alternative brands, however, can set you back enough to keep you awake a night. But you can find affordable alternatives to brands like Buffy and Brooklinen.\n\nThat\u2019s why we took a spin through Amazon\u2019s down comforter selection to find affordable duvet inserts you can rest easy about. Turns out Amazon\u2019s best-selling down comforter is only $30 (and has just under 11,000 reviews). All of the recommendations below have 1,000 or more reviews on Amazon and ratings of at least 4.3 stars.\n\nTake a look and, if you like what you see, sign up for HuffPost\u2019s sales and deals newsletter for more editor-sourced products and reviews.
