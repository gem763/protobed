Focusing on premium affordability alone will not address the root cause.\"\n\nThe submission argued that premiums were rising as a result of\n\n\"urbanisation and population growth in risk-prone areas along with the longer-term impact of climate change, which is expected to increase the frequency and/or severity of weather-related events\".\n\n\"Money spent on prevention and mitigation generates greater sustainability as it makes homes and businesses more capable of withstanding natural perils, reduces the economic and insured losses when disasters do occur, and results in prolonged reductions in premium, thus improving affordability.\"\n\nProposed measures would include more research, better communications between federal, state and local governments, and \"exploring mechanisms to finance public mitigation which consider how the benefits from investment in mitigation accrue to stakeholders\".\n\nAPRA's comments put the regulator in line with the insurance industry, which has long been calling for governments to invest more in infrastructure and construction projects that would make communities more resilient to natural catastrophes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its own submission, the Insurance Council of Australia said: \"With the exception of removing stamp duty on insurance, we urge caution in considering measures which propose to offer a quick solution to premium prices, without forming part of an overall scheme to improve resilience or reduce hazard exposure in Northern Australia.\n\n\"Quick solutions to pricing without addressing the underlying cause, risks disincentivising community engagement in critically-needed disaster mitigation and therefore only delays the issue of insurance affordability to the near future.\"\n\nA number of submissions from strata bodies and organisations confirmed insurance premiums were continuing to rocket. The Strata Community Association of Queensland, the industry body for the body corporate industry in Queensland, said the situation was getting to crisis levels, with some of its members unable to secure any insurance.\n\n\"Two years ago, the real concern was the escalating premiums. It is now that insurance simply is not available to some strata communities. The situation is worsening with each month that passes as more insurers are withdrawing from the northern market or limiting their offering in a substantial way. This is now becoming a crisis,\" the submission stated.\n\nIn a report last week on climate risk, the Reserve Bank of Australia warned changing weather patterns could lead to some risks becoming uninsurable.\n\n\"Insurers are most directly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change. This can arise through natural disaster claims, crop insurance, and health and life insurance,\" the report said.\n\n\"While insurers can increase their premiums to reflect higher risk, it is difficult to accurately price new and uncertain climate risks. If insurers underprice these risks, it could threaten their viability in the event of extreme weather events resulting in very large losses.\"\n\nIn its April budget, the federal government allocated $3.1 billion over five years to a \"North Queensland Flood Recovery Package\", most of which would help farmers affected by the February floods in Queensland.\n\nIt also set aside $3.9 billion for a new \"Emergency Response Fund\" to help recovery from future natural disasters. However, it did not set aside money for pre-emptive action such building flood defenses or making buildings more resilient to damage caused by natural catastrophes.", "description": "APRA has called for a major shift of emphasis from disaster recovery to disaster resilience and mitigation, but federal funding favors the former.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.21%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6eddef5d59cbbf16c24dab55b281f2a8efc68579", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
