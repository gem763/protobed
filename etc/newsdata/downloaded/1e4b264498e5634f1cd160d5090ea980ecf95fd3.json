Those two decisions \u2014 letting Murray walk and then using a high pick on a running back one year later \u2014 were connected. The Cowboys rightfully believed running backs are their best when they are also their youngest \u2014 and therefore cheapest.\n\n\u201cOne of our analytics guys said most backs, they deserve to get their money their first four years in the league, and then they trickle off,\u201d Cowboys personnel czar Stephen Jones said back in 2016, during Elliott\u2019s brilliant rookie season. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to be paying\u201d Elliott on his rookie contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEzekiel Elliott ends holdout, signs extension with Cowboys\n\nRead between the lines, and the Cowboys\u2019 vision seemed to be treating Elliott the way they approached Murray: Wring out his best years before his services become expensive, and then have the discipline to let a popular, star player sign elsewhere.\n\nAlong the way, though, Elliott became too valuable. In a league that devalues running backs, Elliott stands as an outlier, a game-changer at the center of everything his team does. He boosts the passing game with both his route-running and, when asked, his pass blocking. He helps Dallas\u2019s defense by keeping the Cowboys on offense. He takes pressure off quarterback Dak Prescott. He transcends the modern template of what a running back means to a team.\n\nHis talent made the Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones cave after his summerlong holdout. On Wednesday, Elliott agreed to a six-year, $90 million contract extension, with $50 million of it guaranteed. Contracts like that tend to reshape positional markets, but it would be unwise to assume Elliott is anything but an outlier off the field, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, sorry, Melvin Gordon, but Elliott\u2019s payday does not mean your jackpot is imminent. The Los Angeles Chargers have played hardball during Gordon\u2019s holdout, and that will be a far more common tack for teams facing a holdout from a running back on a rookie deal, which is a phenomenon likely to repeat in the coming seasons.\n\nThe nation's best high school running back is switching positions, and Adrian Peterson approves\n\nPlayers such as Alvin Kamara, Joe Mixon, Christian McCaffrey and Dalvin Cook may hope their teams submit to their demands and give them an extension in the same neighborhood of Elliott\u2019s \u2014 or even one in the same county. But given how the NFL views running backs, those potential standoffs are more likely to end up like Gordon\u2019s: with the team unwilling to budge and with the player forced either to play out his contract or sit out on principle.\n\nNFL teams view running backs as interchangeable and prone to early decline, and so they would rather use their salary cap on other parts of the roster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElliott, simply put, is different. His talent is different. His versatility is different. His primacy to his team\u2019s success is different. His situation is different: Elliott plays for an owner who is 76 years old and desperate to win his first Super Bowl in nearly 25 years.\n\nAnalysis: Ezekiel Elliott cashed in with a massive deal. The numbers say he isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nTwo of the closest comps to Elliott may be Kamara and McCaffrey, and both figure to create challenging contract conundrums for their teams with strong 2019 seasons. But neither the Saints nor the Panthers are quite as reliant on their running backs as the Cowboys are on Elliott.\n\nIf any running back could force his team to pay a monstrous extension in line with Elliott\u2019s, it may be the New York Giants\u2019 Saquon Barkley. Aside from Elliott, no running back is as crucial to his team\u2019s attack, and Barkley provides the best approximation of Elliott\u2019s speed, power, elusiveness and pass-catching ability. The Giants made the rare move of using a top-five pick on Barkley, as the Cowboys did Elliott, and they will be breaking in a young quarterback as early as this season, having used the sixth pick in April\u2019s draft on Daniel Jones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, though, the Cowboys did not just offer a pathway forward for teams seeking contractual harmony with a star running back. They needed Elliott in a way other teams, almost certainly, will not think they need their running back. The Cowboys, remember, drafted Elliott after showing the NFL how and when to move on from a running back. The Cowboys envisioned doing the same with Elliott, and those plans for how to handle Elliott\u2019s contract negotiations say more about the state of the running back position than what actually happened.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins. Two decades in, success remains elusive.\n\nAaron Rodgers can do it all. If the Packers got their offseason right, he might not have to.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. and Cleveland are an unlikely fit but might be exactly what each other needs\n\nAD", "description": "Elliott broke the bank after a standoff with the Cowboys, but other running backs in his position may not enjoy the same outcome.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/S-K6xGNTd498VLo-YZyRCvnHfa0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YQVFOXGPDMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
