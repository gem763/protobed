Brexit is not a big deal for Primark, it is more of an event for other people.\u201d\n\nABF also said it has \u201ccompleted all practical preparations\u201d for Brexit and has contingency plans in place for potential disruption.\n\nABF expects full-year sales at Primark to be 4 per cent up on last year, but much of the growth is due to additional stores being opened.\n\nLike-for-like sales, which strip out that effect, are set to fall 2 per cent globally and 1 per cent in the UK, the company said. ABF\u2019s shares fell 1.8 per cent on Monday after the trading update. Final results will be reported on 5 November.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

However, the thing to remember is it can\u2019t follow this method forever.\u201d", "description": "Primark has promised customers it will not raise prices despite a rise in costs from the falling pound.", "authors": ["Ben Chapman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/23/16/gettyimages-458446476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
