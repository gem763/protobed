Along with having streets lined with designer brands from around the world, they\u2019re also known for serving up expensive versions of average cuisine, like this 2,500 yen ramen we tried last year.\n\nOn Oct 10, Ichiran will open a branch in this Tokyo\u2019s high-class neighborhood; but it\u2019s not just any old Ichiran, it\u2019s a fancy one. It\u2019s being advertised as a \u201cPremium Shop,\u201d most of which are specialty shops in Japan\u2019s Kyushu area. That means the Ginza branch will be the first Premium Shop in Tokyo.\n\nSo, what makes it so special? Ginza Ichiran will specialize in \u201cnatural tonkotsu ramen\u201d (\u5929\u7136\u3068\u3093\u3053\u3064\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3 in Japanese) that has a rich pork bone broth that doesn\u2019t leave the stomach feeling heavy and comes with a dollop of \u201csecret red tare\u201d sauce, a blend of chili peppers and about 30 other spices and seasonings. It\u2019s served up in a multi-tiered box to keep ingredients separate until you\u2019re absolutely ready to eat it.\n\nThe noodles and broth are going to be made specially for this branch, so if you think \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s still Ichiran,\u201d then think again.\n\nAnother fun quirk about Ginza Ichiran is that it has no seats and no private rooms; it has just 24 \u201cflavor concentration\u201d counter spaces where you can do nothing but savor and contemplate the matsuri festival going on in your mouth.\n\nEach bowl will run you 1,180 yen, so be prepared for a quality experience. Since Ginza Ichiran will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 a.m. the next morning, you can pop in for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or after a night out on the town.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pork-free alternative to Ichiran Ramen, you can check out their non-pork broth branch located in Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku neighborhood.\n\nRestaurant information\n\nGinza Ichiran/\u9280\u5ea7\u4e00\u862d\n\nAddress: Tokyo-to, Chuo-ku, Ginza 8-3-11 Wako Bldg.
