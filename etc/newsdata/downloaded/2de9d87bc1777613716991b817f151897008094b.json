The yellow Labrador retriever, which belongs to the 79-year-old driver Brent Parks, was in the back seat and jumped onto the folding console. That's when the .22-caliber handgun under the console went off.\n\nPolice say cloth from the seat covers could have gotten into the trigger well of the gun, making it discharge.\n\nThe 44-year-old Springer, who lives in Nash, Oklahoma, and is Parks' caretaker, was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\nPolice say Parks told them the gun isn't usually loaded.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Enid News & Eagle, http://www.enidnews.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
