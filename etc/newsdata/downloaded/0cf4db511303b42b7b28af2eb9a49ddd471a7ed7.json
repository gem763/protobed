It is happening already.'\n\nThe international study realigns popular scientific thought on Arctic permafrost melt which posited that Arctic plants mostly mitigated carbon emitted during the winter when they flourished in the summer.\n\nNot only are the plants failing to absorb carbon, but according to scientists, the pace of emissions is likely to increase.\n\nProjections show that if global emissions remains static, that melting permafrost, which has long sealed-in carbon rich soil, may release 41 percent more carbon by the end of the decade.\n\nAs glaciers retract, they expose permafrost that has stored deep sinks of carbon. As that ice warms it releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and exacerbates climate change\n\nMost projections show the world has failed to meet benchmarks for curbing emissions outlined by accords like the Paris Agreement.\n\nProjections foreshadow a disconcerting future for an already-embattled Arctic.\n\nEarlier this summer about 90 percent of the surface of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet melted between July 30 and August 2, during which time an estimated 55 billion tons of ice poured off the island and into the ocean, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nTo help mitigate surface melt and its subsequent contributions to sea level rise, scientists have proposed increasingly elaborate solutions like using glass beads to reflect sun.", "description": "Scientists have keyed in on permafrost erosion like the kind pictured above and now have evidence that the melt is releasing twice as much carbon into the atmosphere than previously thought.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/19/20095990-0-image-a-9_1571853649423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
