Last spring was a major exception, though, as it fell to Suga to announce the name of Japan\u2019s new imperial era, Reiwa.\n\nSuga holding up a placard with \u201cReiwa\u201d written in brushstroke calligraphy has become one of the most memorable images of the year in Japan, so much so that people who don\u2019t know/remember his name simply refer to him as \u201cReiwa Oji-san\u201d (\u201cOld Man Reiwa\u201d), and this month Suga got an extension on his five minutes of fame with his shocking taste in sweets. A weekly travel program recently revealed that Suga has a soft spot for pancakes, and that his favorite place to get his fix is a restaurant in Tokyo called Satsuki. But while a fondness for flapjacks isn\u2019t anything unusual, the price of Suga\u2019s snacks are, as Satsuki charges over 3,000 yen for its pancakes.\n\nOur reporter Mr Sato was instantly intrigued. Wanting his taste buds to experience the same pleasures as one of Japan\u2019s top politicians, he dashed out the door and headed for Satsuki\u2026only to be stopped by security staff before even entering the building. He was ordered to pass through a metal detector, and the reason why is because of Satsuki\u2019s exact location: the sixth floor of the New Otani Hotel. One of Tokyo\u2019s swankiest accommodation options, the New Otani regularly hosts guests of the state, periodically prompting advanced security protocols. On the day Mr Sato stopped by to satisfy his sweet tooth, a number of foreign dignitaries were staying at the hotel while in the country to attend the enthronement ceremony of Japan\u2019s new emperor, Naruhito, which took place on Oct 22.\n\nOnce the authorities were sure Sato wasn\u2019t a security risk, he was let inside the hotel and made his way to Satsuki. Looking at the menu, he saw that the cafe\u2019s current seasonal pancakes come covered with marron (chestnut) cream, and his mouth watered as he waited for his order.\n\nHowever, Tokyo\u2019s most expensive pancakes don\u2019t just require a financial investment on your part, but a temporal one as well, as they took about 20 minutes to prepare. Mr Sato remained patient, however, examining the fancy trio of maple syrup bottles which were already waiting on the table. Imported from Canada and produced by the company Decacer, they were separated into heavy, medium, and light versions, and Mr Sato felt honored that they\u2019d come all the way across the Pacific just to make his meal extra sweet.\n\nFinally, Mr Sato\u2019s pancakes arrived! Now, for 3,080 yen (after tax), you might be expecting a massive number of pancakes, but that price actually gets you only two. However, we\u2019re not sure if we should call it a \u201cshort stack,\u201d since the pancakes come side-by-side, not atop each other, and each pancake itself is incredibly tall.\n\nOr maybe we should call them thick? Either way, the pancakes were so dense that Mr Sato almost thought they were obanyaki (a traditional Japanese griddle cake that\u2019s shaped like a hockey puck with a hollow core), but sure enough, these were pancakes.\n\nSlicing into one revealed a beautiful cross section where Mr Sato could see how the batter had bubbled at the top, creating a pillowy soft and fluffy outer layer.\n\nSlicing off a piece soaked in chestnut cream, Mr Sato took a bite and was blown away. The pancake immersed his taste receptors in such a rich, creamy, warm sensation that he almost felt like he was biting into a Japanese-style tamagoyaki omelet. He could almost feel his taste buds becoming angry at him for not providing such deliciousness sooner, and his sense of contrition grew as he added a pour of maple syrup, which made everything even better.\n\nGiven the cost of the pancakes, Mr Sato\u2019s mind told him he should take things as slow as possible, taking ample time to savor every tiny bite. Meanwhile, his stomach was clamoring for him to deliver more of this disc-shaped ambrosia as quickly as possible.\n\nThere was a mild pang of mental indigestion when the bill came and he say the total (4,537 yen, which included a 950-yen cup of coffee and 375-yen service charge), but it quickly went away as he luxuriated in the lingering aftertaste of his splendid splurging.\n\nRestaurant information\n\nSatsuki (Hotel New Otani) / \u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\uff08\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30bf\u30cb\uff09\n\nAddress: Tokyo-to, Chiyoda-ku, Kioicho 4-1\n\n\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u5343\u4ee3\u7530\u533a\u7d00\u5c3e\u4e95\u753a\uff14\u2212\uff11\n\nOpen 11 a.m.-9 p.m.\n\nWebsite\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- We try epic pancakes at Japanese coffeehouse chain Doutor\n\n-- Behold the fluffiest rice omelet in Tokyo\u2026possibly the world!\n\n-- Pancake cafe from Fukuoka comes to Tokyo \u2014 and we love their divinely fluffy pancakes!\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/26/eating-tokyos-most-expensive-pancakes-required-us-to-go-through-a-security-check/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Ordinarily, Yoshihide Suga isn\u2019t exactly a trend-setter, since Japan\u2019s 70-year-old Chief Cabinet Secretary usually doesn\u2019t get much time in the limelight.
