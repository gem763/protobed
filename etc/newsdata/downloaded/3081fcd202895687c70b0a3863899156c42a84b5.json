John Bel Edwards; Trump may be the reason why", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump loomed large over Louisiana\u2019s governor\u2019s race a day after Gov. John Bel Edwards fell short of winning Saturday\u2019s primary outright, forcing him to face businessman Eddie Rispone in next month\u2019s runoff.\n\nEdwards and many of his biggest supporters thought he would win re-election Saturday night by taking at least 50% of the vote.\n\nBut Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, was held to 46.6%, while Rispone won a spot in the runoff with 27.4%. U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham finished third with 23.6%, out of the money, and he promptly endorsed Rispone, a fellow Republican.\n\nMiles Coleman, an LSU grad who is associate editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a nationally-respected political newsletter and website at the University of Virginia, rated the Nov. 16 runoff a \u201ctossup.\u201d\n\nPolitical analysts on Sunday said Trump\u2019s late entrance into the race spelled the difference on Saturday.\n\nAbout 200,000 more people voted in the primary compared to the 2015 runoff election that Edwards won, an increase of about 17%. An analysis on Sunday by Jim Kitchens, who was the governor\u2019s pollster four years ago and was an independent consultant for his campaign this year, indicated that most of the 200,000 were white rural voters who voted for Rispone or Abraham.\n\n+2 After losing in primary, Ralph Abraham endorses Eddie Rispone; 'it's the end game that is important' MONROE \u2013 As Republicans Eddie Rispone and Ralph Abraham shared a stage with Donald Trump at a rally in Lake Charles on the night before Louisi\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Trump effect. He accomplished his task. He created a runoff,\u201d said Kitchens, who is based in Florida.\n\nOn Saturday, Rispone said he received a congratulatory call from Trump just before going on stage at 10:30 p.m. to greet supporters at L\u2019Auberge Hotel and Casino in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe president offered another boost early Sunday morning on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\n\u201cBig upset! Now @EddieRispone, who will be a great Governor, will win!\u201d\n\nJohn Couvillon, an independent pollster based in Baton Rouge, said he thought that the recent push for Trump\u2019s impeachment by Democrats in Washington hurt Edwards, even though the governor distanced himself from the effort.\n\nTrump won the state by 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election and remains popular among conservative Louisiana voters. Republicans hold all the seats elected statewide, except governor, majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature, along with every seat in the Congressional delegation with the exception of one specifically drawn to ensure a minority representative.\n\nTrump punctuated his role by rallying Republican voters in Lake Charles on Friday night with a 90-minute show that repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet, four days after his son Donald Jr. rallied Republicans in Lafayette.\n\nEdwards had counted on collecting at least 33% of the white vote to win the primary. An election-eve survey by veteran pollster Verne Kennedy for a group of businessmen showed the governor winning as much as 42% of the white vote.\n\nBut Edwards won only 31% of the white vote on Saturday, estimated Couvillon.\n\nGreg Rigamer, a respected New Orleans-based pollster, on Thursday night had Edwards winning just under 50% overall.\n\n\u201cThe atmospherics were not there for the first-primary victory that they deluded themselves into thinking,\u201d Couvillon said of the Edwards campaign.\n\nThe Florida-based Kennedy was chastened on Sunday after predicting that Edwards would win the primary with at least 55% of the vote, a forecast that had buoyed many of the governor\u2019s top supporters on Saturday. Since 1991, Kennedy has polled each Louisiana governor\u2019s race for a group of businessmen that includes John Georges, the owner of The Advocate | The Times-Picayune.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been off by more than 2%,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEither the black vote was way low or Trump made a real difference.\u201d\n\nCouvillon\u2019s analysis of the results indicated that Trump played an outsized role.\n\nCouvillon estimated that black voters accounted for 26.5% of the overall ballots cast, which was only 0.5% below what Kennedy had forecast. Couvillon also estimated that black people gave 91% of their votes to Edwards, which was 1% more than Kennedy had forecast.\n\nPolitical Horizons: Poverty not addressed in campaign for Louisiana governor Gubernatorial candidates danced around all sorts of issues during the campaign, but never spoke directly about persistent poverty \u2014 the key re\u2026\n\nSaturday night\u2019s results mean that Rispone and Abraham combined for 51% of the overall vote. Adding the 0.8% won by Patrick \u201cLive Wire\u201d Landry, a Republican minor candidate, brought the Republican vote overall to almost 52%.\n\nSo the race begins with Edwards needing only 3.5% more to win the runoff, and with Rispone needing only to secure all the Republican votes in the primary to become Louisiana\u2019s next governor.\n\nLandry, a building engineer at a downtown New Orleans hotel and a part-time artist, said on Sunday he will vote for Rispone.\n\nReferring to the governor, Landry said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to know he\u2019s going to be fired next month.\u201d\n\nGary Landrieu, who won 0.75% of the vote as an independent, had little good to say about Edwards on Sunday, accusing the governor of trying to evict Landrieu from the marina and shipyard he owns in New Orleans.\n\n+13 Gov. John Bel Edwards to meet Eddie Rispone in runoff for Louisiana governor's race Republican millionaire Eddie Rispone, making his first bid for public office, edged his way into a Nov. 16 runoff with incumbent Democratic Go\u2026\n\nOscar \u201cOmar\u201d Dantzler, a Democrat who won 0.8%, declined to express his preference because he was unhappy with the newspaper\u2019s treatment of him.\n\nEven before the votes were counted, Robert E. Hogan, chairman of LSU\u2019s political science department, said Rispone\u2019s rise from political novice to Trump acolyte showed he hit a nerve with GOP voters, even as he refused to spell out his plans.\n\n\u201cRepublican voters remain captivated by the idea of an outsider who can \u2018fix\u2019 the problems of government,\u201d Hogan said in an email.\n\n\u201cVoters respond favorably to bumper-sticker platitudes about \u2018bureaucrat\u2019 and \u2018big government,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you have the money to buy enough political ads that repeat such messages, it is possible to get voters to act on those predispositions.\u201d\n\nRispone also showed no qualms in attacking Abraham, a three-term congressman, as \u201ca career politician\u201d who had \u201cvoted 300 times\u201d with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and had missed more votes than any other member of Congress this year while running for governor.\n\nRispone\u2019s attacks prompted howls of protest from conservative political leaders, including radio talk-show host Moon Griffon and The Hayride, a conservative political organ.\n\nBut with his ads in heavy airplay, Rispone shot past Abraham late in the campaign.\n\n\u201cNegative campaigning works, especially when it is directed at a siting congressman,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThis suggests that voters harbor a deep well of anti-establishment sentiment that Rispone effectively leveraged.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, both remaining candidates met privately with their key advisers in Baton Rouge to plot strategy and plan to raise money. Rispone has an advantage. He spent more than $11 million of his own money in the primary and presumably can write more big checks in the runoff.\n\nRispone gained one addition to his campaign on Saturday night: He will now have State Police protection through Nov. 16.", "description": "President Donald Trump loomed large over Louisiana\u2019s governor\u2019s race a day after Gov.
