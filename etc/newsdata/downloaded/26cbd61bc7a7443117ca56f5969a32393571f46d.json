Low valuation, however, is just one of the factors they will be looking at, and Big Oil is not in a hurry\u2014they could sit on the sidelines and watch more drillers in the shale patch become distressed with debt and become even cheaper before approaching it.\n\nRelated: The Coming M&A Wave In U.S. Shale\n\nApart from the right valuation, the supermajors are also looking at whether a potential target would be a strategic fit, and how much value it would bring to the firm and its shareholders.\n\n\u201cI expect consolidation to happen over some period of time,\u201d ExxonMobil\u2019s chairman and CEO Darren Woods said at the Barclays energy conference this week. Exxon announced earlier this week that it was bowing out of its assets offshore Norway, on top of its intention to back out of its UK North Sea assets as well, as the oil major looks to focus on its assets in the US and Guyana.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re keeping a watchful eye. I think we\u2019re there for the long term. And as opportunities present themselves, we\u2019ll take advantage of them,\u201d Woods noted.\n\nJeff Gustavson, Vice President, Chevron North America Exploration & Production Mid-Continent Business Unit, also spoke at the same conference, saying that \u201cWe\u2019re not under any pressure to transact and I think we demonstrated that earlier this year, not to name any specific situations, but I think we proved that out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, we\u2019re always looking, we\u2019ll take an opportunistic approach like we always have to M&A and that includes what\u2019s going on in the Permian Basin. I\u2019m not saying we will transact, but we\u2019re always \u2013 we\u2019re always looking,\u201d Gustavson said, enumerating the three key factors that Chevron is looking at in acquisitions\u2014strategic fit, assets competitive to the others in Chevron\u2019s portfolio, and the value sense for investors.\n\nA month before the bidding battle for Anadarko started, European supermajor Shell said in March that it was \u201cdefinitely actively looking at opportunities\u201d to increase its Permian position.\n\nRelated: The Lithium Glut Is Far From Over\n\nAt the start of the bidding war for Anadarko, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Chairman and Chief Analyst, Simon Flowers, said:\n\n\u201cThe bidding war for Anadarko is merely the latest episode in the Permian M&A saga. Operationally, the basin is being industrialised. The logical next step from industrialisation is concentration. There are lots more deals to come.\u201d\n\nSix months later, conditions are even more favorable for Big Oil to take over larger swathes of the biggest oil production basin in the U.S. Independents may also consolidate among themselves in order to survive.\n\nAs the industry matures in the Permian, Exxon and Chevron ramp up production, lower margins, and push out the independents, a white paper commissioned by Hastings Equity Partners in partnership with the University of Houston Energy Research showed last month.", "description": "The Permian used to be a place for wildcatters, but as investors are starting to lose patience with the so called \u2018independents\u2019, big oil is ready to go bargain hunting in America\u2019s hottest shale basin", "authors": ["Tsvetana Paraskova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
