Elizabeth Warren during the most recent Democratic presidential debate Tuesday for going too easy on big corporations.\n\nThe \u201cFahrenheit 9/11\u201d filmmaker, 65, was tweeting during the event when something the 70-year-old presidential candidate said caught his attention. Warren explained that she has a plan to combat corporations only caring about their bottom line that she calls \u201caccountable capitalism.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL MOORE BLASTS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT CANNES FILM FESTIVAL\n\nIn short, the plan calls on companies to be held accountable to their employees and their local communities rather than just shareholders. Moore, who has an estimated net worth of $50 million and who Business Insider previously reported has nine homes, is typically known for his left-leaning point of view. He took issue with Warren\u2019s plan in that it doesn\u2019t do enough to dismantle capitalism.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in \u2018accountable capitalism,\u2019\u201d Moore tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThere is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It\u2019s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBowling for Columbine\u201d director also took jabs at former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their respective stances on healthcare at the debate.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden, Amy K and Pete B just boosted the Republican chances of winning in November 2020 by their passionate defense of the for-profit, capitalist-greed health \u2018care\u2019 system,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe only one that appeared safe from Moore\u2019s taunts was Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nLIBERAL FILMMAKER MICHAEL MOORE BLASTS 'LAME DEMS' AFTER 'FRAIL OLD' MUELLER TESTIFIES; SAYS 'TRUMP MUST BE GLOATING IN ECSTASY'\n\n\u201cWow!

Amazing!\u201d\n\nSanders returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked at the debate how he could \u201creassure\u201d Americans that he was up for the task.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I\u2019m going to reassure the American people,\u201d Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "Michael Moore took a jab at Sen.
