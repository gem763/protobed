Woods followed that 3-over-par start with birdies on four of the next six holes to close his first nine and then five more birdies with no bogeys on the last nine. When he was finished, he had carded a 6-under 64 for a share of the lead with defending U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland. It was his lowest PGA Tour round since he shot a 62 to open the 2018 BMW Championship, and the lowest season-opening round of his career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to get off to a quick start and figure it out from there,\u201d Woods said, per the Associated Press. \u201cThe start I got off to wasn\u2019t very good, I hit bad shot after bad shot \u2026 and the next thing you know, things aren\u2019t looking so good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWoods\u2019s nine birdies were one shy of his personal-best for a PGA Tour round and the most he\u2019s made in one round since a victory at Doral in 2013. His 64 was the lowest round of his career when hitting three or fewer fairways and tied for the lowest round of his career when carding at least three bogeys. The 7.23 strokes he gained over the field was his best mark since the 2012 Arnold Palmer invitational.\n\nWith three more similar rounds, he very well could tie all-time leader Sam Snead with his 82nd career PGA Tour win.\n\nRemains to be seen if he'll hold the 1st round lead outright, but Tiger is 10-for-16 (62.5%) in his PGA Tour career with the outright 18-hole lead.\n\n\n\nInsane Tiger stat no. 54,381:\n\n\n\nIn comparison, Jack Nicklaus' win percentage on the PGA Tour with a 54-hole lead/co-lead was 59.3% \u2014 Justin Ray (@JustinRayGolf) October 24, 2019\n\n\u201cAfter the start, the ball striking was better, the putting was really good,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI was hitting a lot of good putts, the ball was rolling tight which was nice.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe Zozo Championship at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club in Inzai City, Japan, is Woods\u2019s first PGA Tour tournament since he had arthroscopic knee surgery in August. After his stirring Masters victory in April, Woods played in only six more tournaments all season, missing the cut at both the PGA Championship and British Open and failing to qualify for the season-ending FedEx Cup tournament finale. Earlier this week, Woods pointed to his knee as the reason his season went downhill.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice to be able to squat down and read putts and start going at it full speed again,\u201d Woods said after Monday\u2019s skins game in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s just been wear-and-tear over the years. It\u2019s just been stressed out for a very long time.\u201d\n\nConditions were windy Thursday and seem likely to only get worse, with predicted heavy rain causing Friday\u2019s tee times to be moved up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a grind,'' Woods said, per ESPN. \u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a lot of golf on the weekend for all of us.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "After three bogeys to start, Woods has one of the lowest rounds of his career.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gD2KZf0zpFRo6mt5NYMbmsUi7CY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PNJRGQHWI4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
