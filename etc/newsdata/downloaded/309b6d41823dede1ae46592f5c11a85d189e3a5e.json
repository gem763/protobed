(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nDid you know that Stephen King\u2019s books are almost all interconnected? You probably did, it\u2019s definitely one of those fun facts about the prolific author that gets thrown around a lot. But do you know how that multiverse comes together and just how deep those connections go?\n\nIf not, this video by Birth.Movies.Death is an excellent introduction to the wacky horror fantasy world that King has created through decades of books (of varying quality) and with them a slow dribble of Easter eggs and little connections that turn King\u2019s isolated tales of terror and trauma into one big, complicated, sprawling and unending tale of terror and trauma. And also cowboys, sometimes?\n\nThe new adaptation of It doesn\u2019t make any big gestures toward this interconnected vision of King\u2019s, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind as the current deluge of King adaptations hits theatres and TV.\n\nIt might make things a little more entertaining, or at least remind you that somewhere in this shared universe, a version of Stephen King is puttering around, doing King-ly things with his time. Probably writing another horror novel.", "description": "Did you know that Stephen King\u2019s books are almost all interconnected?
