She was held without bond.\n\nPrior to the discovery of Kamille's body, police had been offering a $28,000 reward for information on her whereabouts\n\nA candlelight vigil was held for Kamille in Linn Park in front of Birmingham City Hall on Wednesday evening\n\nBirmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said investigators have not determined any links between the suspects and Kamille or her family.\n\n'We believe that this was something they thought about and acted upon and they saw an opportunity to take a young child, and they did,' Woodfin said prior to the charges being filed.\n\nPrior to the discovery of Kamille's body, police had been offering a $28,000 reward for information on her whereabouts.\n\nA funeral service for Kamille has been scheduled for Sunday at the New Beginning Christian Ministry in Birmingham.\n\nPastor Sylvester Wilson said Kamille's mother previously attended the church.\n\nThe church has a 700-seat sanctuary and can use its fellowship hall as an overflow auditorium.\n\n'It's open to the public. I already know that our church is nowhere big enough to hold this crowd,' Wilson said.\n\nInvestigators said they suspected Stallworth and Brown within 24 hours of Kamille's abduction. They released surveillance images of Stallworth in their search for the couple\n\nThe city has announced a website for anyone who wants to make donations to help pay the child's funeral and burial expenses.\n\nMore than $12,000 has been given and organizers said any leftover money will go to nonprofits that help at-risk people.\n\nAlso, Crime Stoppers of Metro Alabama said it was establishing a permanent reward fund in the girl's name to help in future child abductions.\n\nThe group said it had received more than $35,000 in donations linked to the girl's disappearance.\n\n'There is no silver lining in the Cupcake tragedy,' Frank Barefield, chairman of the organization's board, said in a statement.\n\n'However, we are deeply moved by the public's generosity during the investigation of her kidnapping. We hope the memory of Cupcake is somehow kept alive not only in our community, but also in the generosity of these donors.'", "description": "Patrick Devone Stallworth, 39, and his girlfriend Derick Irisha Brown, 29, were both charged on Thursday with capital murder over the little girl's death in Birmingham, Alabama.", "authors": ["Emily Crane", "Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197356-0-image-a-29_1572035688954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
