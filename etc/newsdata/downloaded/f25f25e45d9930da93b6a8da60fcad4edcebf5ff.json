Much of the military operates on 1980s and 1990s computer systems, and the Defense Department has spent billions of dollars trying to make them talk to one another.\n\nThe decision was a surprise because Amazon had been considered the front-runner, in part because it had built cloud services for the Central Intelligence Agency. But that was before Mr. Trump became publicly hostile to Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. The president often refers to the newspaper as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d and has accused it of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nIn public, Mr. Trump said there were other \u201cgreat companies\u201d that should have a chance at the contract. But a speechwriter for former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says in a book scheduled for publication next week that Mr. Trump had wanted to foil Amazon and give the contract to another company.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Technology Dod-Jedi-Contract.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
