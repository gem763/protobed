Those details were instead relayed to him by another \u201chalf a dozen\u201d White House and intelligence officials in the course of their day-to-day work. Despite this, there is ample reason to believe the whistleblower\u2019s version of events. Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, said his allegation \u201cappears credible\u201d after independently questioning some witnesses about him. The whistleblower didn\u2019t personally witness Trump\u2019s fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The White House\u2019s own memo of the conversation nonetheless confirms that Trump asked him to probe Biden and his family.\n\nTrump and his allies have insisted that the president did nothing wrong. The whistleblower, nevertheless, describes how many of those who witnessed the Zelenskiy call drew the opposite conclusion. The complaint describes White House officials and lawyers discussing \u201chow to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d Those officials allegedly spent the next few days suppressing access to records about the call, including moving the transcript of it to a server where highly classified material is stored. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders have also pointed to the lack of an explicit quid pro quo to exonerate him. This requires an aggressive level of willful blindness. Trump personally ordered a halt to U.S. security aid to Ukraine in early-to-mid July, told Zelenskiy that the U.S. \u201c[does] a lot for Ukraine\u201d in the July 25 call, and then immediately asked him for a \u201cfavor\u201d from Zelenskiy: investigate the stolen DNC emails during the 2016 election, meet with Giuliani, and \u201clook into\u201d Biden and his son. The Ukrainian government seems to have understood it was a shakedown. Their public readout of the call at the time said Trump had \u201cexpressed his conviction\u201d that Zelenskiy\u2019s government would be able to \u201ccomplete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that whoever filed the complaint seems to have done everything by the book. Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, defended his conduct while testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. \u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he followed the law every step of the way.\u201d Even with federal laws that protect whistleblowers from retribution, acting as one can still seriously hinder\u2014or even end\u2014one\u2019s career. Trump reportedly told his aides earlier this week that the whistleblower was \u201cclose to a spy,\u201d and alluded to the traditional punishment for espionage: execution.", "description": "While Donald Trump talks about patriotism, others act on it.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/666876b3c659aa56ecabc69ff6532178b7cbd3e1.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
