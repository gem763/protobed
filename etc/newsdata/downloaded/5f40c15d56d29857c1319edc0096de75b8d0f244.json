Mrs Sacoolas\u2019s husband Jonathan was initially described as a diplomat, but is now believed to be a spy.\n\nThey are also bringing a federal case against Donald Trump\u2019s administration for whisking her out of the country shortly after the accident, despite \u2013 contrary to initial belief \u2013 her not having diplomatic immunity.\n\nThe Foreign Office confirmed on October 13 that she did not have diplomatic immunity, and the Dunn family accuse the Trump administration of breaking the Vienna Convention, which dictates how diplomatic immunity works. On Thursday they sued the Foreign Office.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration have tried to twist and contort the laws on diplomatic immunity to argue that Mrs Sacoolas should be permitted to skip the UK after her actions and escape justice,\u201d said Mr Seiger.", "description": "Harry Dunn\u2019s parents have announced that they are taking legal action against both the American woman who killed their son and the US government, for letting her flee the UK.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "Philip Johnston", "Matthew Goodwin", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Michael Deacon", "Olivia Utley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213110256-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
