The term calls to mind a set of quasi-verified self-care practices that range from legitimate (meditation) to dubious (like \u201cseed cycling\u201d). We\u2019ve grown to trust and rely on wellness practices in our daily lives, especially given the rising costs of, you know, actual healthcare. So, it\u2019s not surprising to see companies capitalize on that trust any way they can. You know what millennials aren\u2019t buying? Real estate, because we\u2019re freaking BROKE. You know what industry is suddenly undergoing its own wellness revolution? Real estate, baby!\n\nAccording to a new report by Curbed, a growing number of real estate developers are promoting a \u201chealthier\u201d home environment as the key to living longer. What makes a home environment healthier? Here\u2019s what the developer of a wellness-oriented \u201ccondo project\u201d in Florida who spoke with Curbed about the building\u2019s in-unit amenities said: \u201cAir purification systems, circadian living lighting, a Savant home audio system, and the Darwin system, a new smart-home solution that monitors environmental pollutants.\u201d The starting price for one of these spaces? A casual $1.65 million.\n\nOK. First of all, I didn\u2019t know we had Smart House in real life now, which is what the \u201cSavant\u201d and \u201cDarwin\u201d systems amount to. Savant regulates things like air and water temperature, lighting, and in-home audio systems: \u201cWhen you're entertaining outside, just tap your \u2018Cocktail Hour\u2019 scene to stream a playlist to the patio and fade up your pool lights as day turns to night,\u201d the website advises. Yup, love to entertain at cocktail hour on my poolside patio! Can\u2019t get enough of it! The Darwin system also regulates lighting, along with air and water quality, and \u201csleep environment,\u201d which just sounds ominous. But honestly, it doesn\u2019t really matter what I think about any of this shit, because it\u2019s so prohibitively expensive that there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019ll ever own a home with this equipment...not least because I\u2019ll probably never own a home at all!\n\n\n\nSo, where is the real estate wellness innovation for normal people, people whose dad didn\u2019t, like, invent blankets or whatever? Worry not, comfortable-but-not-loaded urban dwellers:\n\nCheck out the affordable, $1,000/month \u201cJapanese-style\u201d sleeper pods (perhaps like these?) at Haven, a Venice, California \u201cwellness community\u201d that touts community-building, yoga, and \u201cthe freedom to \u2018cross-pollinate ideas\u2019\u201d among its benefits. Hmm, that totally doesn\u2019t sound familiar.\n\nAnd people living below the poverty line can reap the sweet, longevity-increasing rewards of wellness too, by, uh, living in housing projects that comply with the regulations in Fannie Mae\u2019s healthy housing incentives program, which includes upgrading to Energy Star appliances, improving insulation, and installing solar lighting. I don\u2019t want to knock attempts to make affordable housing greener and safer for inhabitants, but the disparity between these two efforts is so obvious that it\u2019s a little insulting.\n\nPer this vision of wellness-oriented real estate, the rich suck in pollutant-free air, shielded from \u201cmagnetic fields\u201d and under-sink chemical emissions, while poor people might get to live somewhere that doesn\u2019t actively give them asthma, and the chunk of Americans stuck in the middle will get to live in bunk-beds and \u201ccollaborate\u201d until the sun burns out. Seems like the secret to optimizing wellness in your living space is the same as the secret to losing weight quickly and painlessly: Just have an immoral amount of money. Why didn\u2019t I think of that? I could\u2019ve been rich!\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "The real estate market has caught on to the neat trick of selling people things based on vaguely defined \"health\" benefits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da6111e9ba232000aa3d4eb/lede/1571167285516-GettyImages-976283122.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7195616883116883xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
