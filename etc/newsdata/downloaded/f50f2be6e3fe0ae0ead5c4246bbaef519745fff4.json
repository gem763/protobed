Democrats are investigating Trump\u2019s overtures to the Ukrainian government to pursue politically motivated investigations as the administration was also withholding military aid to the country.\n\n\u201cIf this witness had something to say that would be helpful to the White House they would\u2019ve wanted him to come and testify,\u201d Schiff told reporters Monday. \u201cThey plainly don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

A series of State Department officials have testified this month about their concerns as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, took charge of Ukrainian policy and as Trump pushed out the U.S. ambassador there.\n\nWilliam Taylor, the current top diplomat in Ukraine, testified last week that he was told the aid would be withheld until the country conducted investigations into Democrat Joe Biden and his family and into Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nDemocrats are now looking to hear from staff to the National Security Council, who they hope will have insight into White House discussions as the aid was withheld. Two current staffers, Alexander Vindman and Tim Morrison, are also scheduled to appear this week. It is unclear if they will appear.\n\nSchiff said the three committees leading the inquiry will move on even if the witnesses don\u2019t show up. Democrats have indicated that they are more likely to use that evidence to write an article of impeachment on obstruction of justice than they are to engage in court battles. \u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope a dope in the courts, so we will move forward,\u201d Schiff said afterward.\n\nIn Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit, he asked a judge to decide whether he should accede to House demands for his testimony or to assert \u201cimmunity from congressional process\u201d as directed by Trump. He said he \u201ccannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches,\u201d and without the court\u2019s help, he said, he would have to make the decision himself \u2014 one that could \u201cinflict grave constitutional injury\u201d on either Congress or the presidency.\n\nThe court had yet to rule by Monday morning, and his lawyer said in a letter that he was waiting for a judge to step in before committing to testify.\n\nThe three chairmen of the House committees overseeing the inquiry told Kupperman\u2019s lawyers in a letter over the weekend that the suit was without merit and appeared to be coordinated with the White House. They called the suit \u201can obvious and desperate tactic by the President to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nIn a letter Sunday obtained by The Associated Press, Kupperman\u2019s attorney, Charles Cooper, wrote that it was not his client who was challenging Congress\u2019 constitutional claims.\n\n\u201cIt is President Trump, and every president before him for at least the last half century, who have asserted testimonial immunity to their closest confidential advisers,\u201d Cooper wrote. \u201cIf your clients\u2019 position on the merits of this issue is correct, it will prevail in court, and Dr. Kupperman, I assure you again, will comply with the court\u2019s judgment.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Charles Kupperman, who was a deputy to John Bolton, did not show up for a deposition Monday as part of the House's impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Mary Clare Jalonick", "Eric Tucker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/charles-kupperman-house-subpoena.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
