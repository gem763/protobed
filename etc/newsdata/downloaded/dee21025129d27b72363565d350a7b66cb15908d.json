Repeatedly outnumbered and outgunned by a foe whose avowed purpose was to overrun his platoon, Sean\u2019s \u201cOutlaws\u201d battled furiously in the most rugged terrain on the planet\u2014the towering Hindu Kush Mountains. Eighty-five percent of his platoon received Purple Hearts for wounds incurred in battle, but his men gave far more than they received. Outlaw Platoon killed over 350 enemy fighters in some of the biggest firefights of the Afghan War. His platoon remains one of the most decorated Army units since 9-11.\n\nSean was wounded in action on June 10, 2006 when his platoon was nearly overrun, for the first time, by a force that outnumbered them almost ten to one. Refusing to leave his men as they battled the enemy at point-blank range, Sean was knocked unconscious and wounded two more times during the firefight. Each time, he returned to his feet to lead his men again. His selfless example prompted one of his Soldiers to remark later, \u201cSean Parnell saved us all.\u201d\n\nAfter the June 10, 2006 battle, Sean continued to suffer from untreated head and neurological wounds. For weeks after, cerebral-spinal fluid leaked from his ears and nose while he continued to patrol with his men. His dedication to his men came at great personal cost: when he returned home following the 06 deployment, his wounds forced him from the army and he was medically discharged.\n\nSean retired a highly decorated Captain, and was awarded two Bronze Stars, one for Valor, and the Purple Heart.", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:17:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/303/6df23d00-6e8a-43a1-b3bb-b0ea12f16d2e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
