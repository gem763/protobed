However, those involved said there were no guarantees in a process that was changing by the day.\n\nIt comes as the rebels, including former Tories who were subsequently thrown out of the party, prepare for a legal battle in case the prime minister attempts to defy a law forcing him to ask for an extension on 19 October. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, but the new law would envisage a Brexit extension until the end of January 2020.\n\nOpposition parties have agreed to block a general election before a Brexit extension has been agreed.\n\nThe sounding of EU leaders over an extension has angered Tory Brexiters. The Conservative MP and former cabinet minister David Jones said: \u201cSenior EU figures gave private assurances to British MPs, as a consequence of which they supported the surrender bill. This confirms the level of EU interference in our internal affairs and makes the need for Brexit all the more pressing.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Johnson said he would not seek another extension from Brussels, as the incoming law compels him to do if no agreement is in place by 19 October. \u201cI will not. I don\u2019t want a delay,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDavid Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister when Theresa May was in Downing Street, said it would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d if Johnson chose to break the law.\n\nLidington, a former Europe minister, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he did not think Johnson would be willing to break the law. \u201cI cannot believe it will come to that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Aylesbury MP, who voted for a general election this week, said the prime minister time should be given the time to secure a deal with the EU.\n\nHe said: \u201cI understand why the PM is opposed to this [Brexit delay]. Having talked to him \u2013 it is no secret I have differences with him on European policy \u2013 I was persuaded that he was serious about getting a deal.\n\n\u201cHe basically said to me, please give me until the European council to really get in there and negotiate that deal and come back to parliament. My decision was I would give him that opportunity to get that deal.\n\n\u201cIt is such a fundamental principle that we are governed by the rule of law that I hope no party would question it. Defying any particular law sets a really dangerous precedent.\u201d", "description": "MPs prepare for legal battle in case PM attempts to defy law forcing him to ask for extension", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91de4a7326d4c6a6e65ce713112e35d546b5ed0e/0_10_3531_2119/master/3531.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22adbaa33a2ed16c2cfe059264886fcb", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
