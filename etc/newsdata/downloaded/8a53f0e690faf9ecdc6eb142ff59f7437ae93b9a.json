The boiling point apparently came on Sunday, October 6, when a train traveling through Hanoi was forced to re-route because there were too many tourists on the tracks, which were built in 1902 by the French.\n\n\"Though the railway cafes attract tourists, they are, in fact, violating some regulations,\" Ha Van Sieu, vice chairman of the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, told reporters at a press briefing.\n\nHe did not mention specific regulations, but noted that the street has been an issue for some time.\n\nIs this the prettiest street in Hanoi?\n\nIn 2018, Vietnam-based writer Dave Fox told CNN Travel that \"overtourism is a new buzzword for something that has been going on a long time.\"\n\nA longtime Hanoi resident, he watched as \"train street\" transformed from a cool novelty into a safety concern.\n\n\"Travelers need to be mindful of optics,\" he added.\n\nWhen it comes to overtourism, some destinations face more of a challenge than others. While Hanoi's government can close down cafes, it's hard to totally shut down a public street inhabited by local residents.\n\nStill, controlling crowds and curbing bad social media behavior is an ongoing problem in the travel industry, including other destinations in Asia.\n\nRelated content Hanoi's best boutique hotels", "description": "Authorities are clamping down on cafes that line Hanoi's \"train street.\" The thoroughfare is a popular draw for tourists who come to view trains rumble down an active track just inches away from homes and other buildings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191010120159-train-street-hanoi-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
