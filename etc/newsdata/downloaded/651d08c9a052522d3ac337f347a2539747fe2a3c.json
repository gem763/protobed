Already, the company allows parents to limit screen time across Windows 10, Xbox One and Android via the Microsoft Launcher. However, it hadn\u2019t yet allowed parents to limit the amount of time a child could spend in a specific app or game, as its competitors do.\n\nInstead, its existing controls allowed parents only to dole out a set amount of hours of screen time. Parents could choose to either leave the time up to the kids to manage, or limit it at the device level \u2014 like, only allowing one hour of Xbox time but permitting more screen time on the PC, for example.\n\nHowever, the current trend in screen time management is not to approach all screen time as unproductive and unhealthy. Instead, it\u2019s about configuring limits on the more addictive apps and games that eat up increasing amounts of children\u2019s time, while permitting educational tools to have fewer limits.\n\nFor older kids and teens, social media apps like TikTok or Instagram could be the culprit, while younger kids may just be spending too much time \u201changing out\u201d in virtual worlds like Roblox and Fortnite. Problems on this front have gotten pretty bad. Mobile games are under fire for using gambling tactics like loot boxes to engage children. And Fortnite is now the subject of a lawsuit that claims that, in part, the game\u2019s addictive nature is due to its use slot machine-like mechanics and variable reward systems, which manipulate children\u2019s brains.\n\nWithout being able to limit these apps directly, kids may end up using all of their allotted screen time on just the one app or game they\u2019re obsessed with at the moment.\n\nApple had already allowed per-app time limits with the launch of its screen time controls in iOS 12. And Google more recently updated its own Family Link software, now preinstalled on new Android devices, to include a similar feature.\n\nWith today\u2019s update, Microsoft is now on board, too.\n\nThe new app and game limits parents set will apply across Windows 10, Xbox and Android devices running Microsoft Launcher. In other words, kids can\u2019t get more game time just by switching devices.\n\nThe controls also allow parents to offer more screen time on certain days \u2014 like weekends, for instance \u2014 than others.\n\nTo use this feature, parents will need to create a family group and make Microsoft accounts for all the kids.\n\nOnce enabled, kids will get a warning about their screen time 15 minutes before the limit is reached, and then again at five minutes. Because kids will often beg for a few more minutes, Microsoft made it easy for parents to grant or deny more time via email or via a Microsoft Launcher notification on their own Android phone.\n\nThe per-app time limits are launching today in preview within Microsoft\u2019s existing family settings.\n\n\u201cUltimately, our goal is for the app and game limits feature to provide flexible and customizable tools to meet each family\u2019s unique needs,\u201d the company explains in an announcement. \u201cYou as parents know what\u2019s best for your children \u2014 no technology can ever replace that \u2014 but we\u2019re hoping these tools can help you to strike the right balance,\u201d it says.", "description": "Microsoft is following Apple and Google\u2019s lead with today\u2019s launch of per-app and per-game time limits in its parental control software.
