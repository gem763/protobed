That essentially allows drones and cruise missiles to \u201chide\u201d in the topography, making it difficult for opposing ground-based radars to detect them.\n\nLow-level flight can mask the attacker\u2019s approach.\n\nSecond, these weapons systems, which are often smaller in size than larger conventional aircraft or ballistic missiles, are harder for radar systems to detect due to their smaller radar cross-section.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the target, you can\u2019t shoot it down.\n\nThird, cruise missiles and armed drones are often mobile, meaning the threat can come from any number of directions. Indeed, cruise missiles can be launched from the ground, from aircraft, and from ships and submerged submarines.\n\nIf radar isn\u2019t pointed in the right direction at the right time, you won\u2019t see the attack coming.\n\nBut armed drones and cruise missiles have disadvantages as well. One is that they aren\u2019t invincible. Armed drones and cruise missiles have limited range and slower speeds, both of which can limit their effectiveness and increase their vulnerability.\n\nThey can be shot down.\n\nIndeed, the Saudis claims to have shot down a number of armed drones (and seemingly, ballistic missiles) of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, launched into Saudi Arabia from Yemen during the ongoing conflict.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Saudi air-defense radars may well have been looking to the south toward Yemen, where the drone and missile threat was well-known\u2014and not to the north toward the Persian Gulf, from which an attack wasn\u2019t expected.\n\nArmed drones and cruise missiles can effectively and efficiently augment a country\u2019s air power and military might, and diversify the threat a potential opponent must defend against. The attack on the Saudis will only make these weapons systems more popular.\n\nWithout question, now would be a very good time for the U.S. to take stock of our armed drone and cruise-missile defenses.\n\nAs a senior fellow for national security affairs, Peter Brookes develops and communicates The Heritage Foundation's stance on foreign policy and national security affairs through media appearances, research, published articles, congressional testimony and speaking engagements.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The fact is that defending against these modern weapon systems can be tough\u2014and the failure to be able to defend against them can be quite consequential.", "authors": ["Peter Brookes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1e8V1e9xyyC1d2ySTkkS8Q--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/da4c7b15dccf9b4e974df4f4b8e43582", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
