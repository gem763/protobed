Nixon", "language": "en", "text": "While it is usually unwise to predict a decision of the United States Supreme Court, here is a dramatic prediction about the great impeachment debate that grips the nation today.\n\nIn the coming months, probably sooner than analysts expect, the Supreme Court will uphold and affirm the unanimously decided case of U.S. v. Nixon and apply its guiding principle to critical pending legal cases and impeachment proceedings advancing in Congress.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt this defining moment, President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE will then be required to release critical evidence now being withheld and allow testimony from administration officials compelled by conscience, patriotism and respect for law to testify before Congress and courts.\n\nHistoric cases are moving at an expedited pace to the Court of Appeals level. The time is rapidly approaching for another definitive Supreme Court ruling on the great constitutional question of whether a president can aggressively and comprehensively claim privileges to systematically prevent critical witnesses and evidence of potential crimes and impeachable offenses from being presented to Congress and courts \u2014 which would effectively place President Trump above the law.\n\nThe coming Supreme Court decision will have such a momentous constitutional and practical influence that it will forever define the historic legacy and reputation of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughUS Supreme Court readies for Trump Senate confirms Trump judicial pick labeled 'not qualified' by American Bar Association Clarence Thomas: There's a 'different sets of rules' for criticizing me because I'm conservative MORE, Neil Gorsuch Neil GorsuchMajority disapprove of Trump Supreme Court nominations, says poll Supreme Court agrees to hear challenge to consumer agency Difficult issues involving human sexuality require dialogue, not scorn, misinformation MORE, Samuel Alito Samuel AlitoCan a black high school guard be fired for quoting the n-word?

Nixon, that the president must allow relevant evidence and witnesses to be presented, or that U.S. v. Nixon was wrongly decided, and the president possesses unchallengeable unitary power to prevent critical evidence of potential crimes and impeachable offenses from being considered by Congress and courts.\n\nThe aggressive, sweeping and systematic efforts of the Trump administration to ignore subpoenas and prevent testimony of witnesses and production of evidence means the Supreme Court is being asked to effectively legalize obstruction of justice, abuse of power and destruction of evidence.\n\nThis aggressive and all-encompassing attempt to sabotage all investigations over many months has had the judicial impact, for which the president bears ALL responsibility, of pushing into election year one of the most profound and consequential constitutional decisions since John Marshall took the oath of office as chief justice.\n\nAgainst this unprecedented presidential obstruction of evidence and sabotage of investigations, a growing list of widely admired and vastly respected administration insiders, motivated by a deep patriotism and alarmed by dangers to our national security, have been inspired to extraordinary profiles in courage at a critical moment in history by openly defying illegitimate orders to refuse to present evidence and testify before Congress.\n\nWhen these enormously credible officials present their testimony in public to the country in nationally televised hearings, the effect on public opinion will be powerful and profound. Their credibility, stature, career courage, vast experience and patriotic passion will stand in decisive and dramatic contrast to the banana republic tactics employed by the president and his desperate supporters to slander and demean them by attacking their motives and patriotism.\n\nThe coverup is losing. The facts and truth are emerging. The persuasive and decisive evidence is mounting. A large majority of Americans want the investigation to proceed fully and fairly, unimpeded and unobstructed.\n\nIn U.S. v. Nixon a unanimous majority, understanding the enormity of the matter, ruled after expedited consideration that the Nixon coverup must end and the evidence must be expeditiously provided.\n\nIn my view, the Supreme Court will not, by a 5-4 party-line vote of Republican-appointed justices, find that the unanimous decision of U.S. v Nixon was wrongly decided.\n\nIt is far more likely that Chief Justice John Roberts, sitting where Chief Justice John Marshall once sat in the citadel of justice where the Nixon-era court once decided, will steer the court toward a broad historic decision declaring for time immemorial that no American is above the law \u2014 including President Trump.\n\nBudowsky was an aide to former Sen.
