Jesus of Nazareth has now appointed one of his successors, Greta Thunberg.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe tweet made a resurgence of sorts recently, due no doubt to Thunberg\u2019s speech at the United Nations \u2014 the one where she wagged her finger at the adults of the world over climate change, while self-righteously proclaiming, \u201cHow dare you, how dare you.\u201d\n\nLeftists and their religions.\n\nThey\u2019re all so busily scouring the world for saviors \u2014 outside of looking to the actual Savior, Jesus Christ Himself.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama Depicted As Jesus: \u2018The Truth\u2019 Painting Draws Criticism For Controversial Metaphor,\u201d another headline, this one from HuffPost, shockingly stated in December of 2017.\n\nThat piece went on to recount how a painting by Michael D\u2019Antuono generated quite a bit of controversy for its feature of a painted Obama, a crown of thorns atop his head, arms splayed and raised, casting a dejected look downward.\n\n\u201c[I]n a position that is reminiscent of the crucifixion,\u201d is how HuffPost wrote it.\n\nThe artist, as HuffPost went on to report, said he received 4,000 or so emails from \u201cthe irate Christian Right\u201d who saw the painting as \u201cblasphemy.\u201d\n\nYa think?\n\nWhat\u2019s even more curious is D\u2019Antuono expressed disbelief at the \u201cirate Christian Right\u201d for what he said was misinterpreting his painting\u2019s meaning.\n\n\u201cThe crucifixion of the president was meant metaphorically,\u201d he explained. \u201cMy intent was not to compare him to Jesus.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably true.\n\nLiberals, after all, have little concept of Jesus, of the Bible, of moral compasses and values and virtues that come from the Creator. So how can they honestly be held accountable for what they don\u2019t know?\n\n\u201cDemocrats under fire for removing \u2018God\u2019 from party platform,\u201d The Washington Post reported in 2012.\n\n\u201cDemocrats Drop \u2018God\u2019 From Party Platform,\u201d Christian Headlines reported in the same time frame.\n\nTo Democrats, God is just another political tool.\n\nTo leftists, Jesus is just another word for someone who preaches a sacrificial message that carries a socialist hope \u2014 like an environmentalist calling for mass, global regulation to supposedly save planet Earth.\n\nTo radicals, Jesus is Greta Thunberg is Barack Obama is \u2014 whomever.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
