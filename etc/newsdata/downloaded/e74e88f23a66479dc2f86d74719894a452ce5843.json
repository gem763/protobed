GaijinPot went to the open campus to find out more.\n\nBy Mike Kozlowski Oct 6, 2019 7 min read\n\nThere\u2019s little question that Japan is one of the premier places for media creation. Anime, video games, graphic design\u2026 they\u2019re industries that are popular overseas as well, and many a person has come to Japan to try to work in those fields.\n\nAnimation work created by a student at Digital Hollywood University.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles they face is strong competition for entry-level jobs. Japanese companies typically hire their workers straight from university in a rigid process called shukatsu. Graduates are ranked by the quality of the university they attended and hired en masse without much consideration of individual skills or experience.\n\nSo, what should you do if you want to work in the creative industry here in Japan? One way would be to study at a Japanese university and put yourself on an equal footing with the locals.\n\nBut you may be thinking that you\u2019re not interested in spending four years studying STEM or general art courses that most universities offer. At the same time, studying anime or game design usually invokes an image of two-year vocational schools, which have their purpose but won\u2019t get you a proper university degree and will severely limit your career opportunities in Japan.\n\nA student mockup made in a class learning graphic design for mobile apps.\n\nFortunately, Digital Hollywood University (DHU) has managed to combine the fun and excitement of the Japanese media industry with a proper program that\u2019ll get you ready for a career after graduation.\n\nForget those images of university classes in old-fashioned buildings being taught by professors wearing tweed sweaters. If the name itself didn\u2019t give you a clue, Digital Hollywood University is no normal uni experience.\n\nForget those images of university classes in old-fashioned buildings being taught by professors wearing tweed sweaters. If the name itself didn\u2019t give you a clue, Digital Hollywood University is no normal uni experience.\n\nA visit to the DHU open campus\n\nDHU Summer Open Campus 2019.\n\nAs someone who helps run GaijinPot Study, I try to get a feel for all of the different schools in the country, from Japanese language schools to universities. We try to advise the students on what schools would be best for their ambitions, and I\u2019d be lying if I said we don\u2019t get a fair number of people interested in digital media like games and anime.\n\nI\u2019m aware of plenty of two-year trade schools with such courses, but universities are less common. I was very interested in seeing the school in person and attended the open campus. I\u2019m not ready to pull a Rodney Dangerfield and go \u201cBack to School,\u201d but hey, I\u2019m supposed to have my finger on the pulse of the Japanese higher education scene.\n\nMeeting DHU alumni\n\nA talk session with the principal and three alumni.\n\nI started out by attending a talk session with the principal and three alumni. The focus was on explaining how exactly the school helped prepare them for their careers and what they got out of their education.\n\nOne of the students studied graphic design at the school and is now a designer at BizReach, a fairly famous company here. Another learned English and Business, studied abroad in New York, and currently works in web marketing at LocalFolio, the Tokyo branch of the American company ReachLocal. The third studied video production and did a stint at an advertising agency. She\u2019s now working as a freelance video producer while studying a Master\u2019s degree at Digital Hollywood Graduate School (DHGS).\n\nProjection mapping at Tokyo Big Sight was part of a project produced by DHU students.\n\nAlthough this may seem obvious, it\u2019s actually pretty impressive that the students work in a field that they studied in. It is not uncommon for the Japanese companies which recruit you from university to ignore what you studied and just put you on a generic career track. Certainly, there\u2019s little motivation to go the extra mile in your graphic design classes if you end up as an accountant.\n\nThe students joked that Digital Hollywood University is a unique name to have on your resume, but that the name does have quite a good reputation in the industry. Even if you\u2019re looking outside of that field, it\u2019ll certainly make you stand out from other applicants.\n\nTurn your hobby into a career with a course at DHU.\n\nA DHU students\u2019 video game animation.\n\nThe students also talked about why they chose the school and why they liked it. One answer that kept coming up was that you can really study what you enjoy doing, and your hobby can become your career.\n\nThe teachers are all experienced in the industry and can explain the career opportunities to you, and there is a wide variety of classes available, from design to business. This kind of freedom is unusual in Japanese universities.\n\nAccording to the students, it gets to the point where you\u2019re having so much fun at school that you\u2019d rather be there than at home!\n\nTrying a class at DHU\n\nThe open campus 3D design class.\n\nSounds good, but can someone with a dream but no skills even have a shot at being a successful student? Part of the open campus allowed us to join a beginner class, and I decided to try my luck out in a Maya class. I\u2019m aware that the software is quite popular in the industry but have never used it myself. It\u2019s used to create 3D models which are then put into games, movies, and almost any kind of media with CG.\n\nThe class teacher definitely knew his stuff. He graduated from Digital Hollywood in 1999, and worked on some pretty major projects, from the Pretty Cure anime series to the Metal Gear video game series.\n\nLearn how to use 3D design software at DHU.\n\nBy the end of this class, we were supposed to be able to create \u201csomething\u201d in the software that\u2019s recognizable but I wasn\u2019t too confident in my skills; I\u2019d have enough of a challenge making something in Microsoft Paint.\n\nHe taught us how to use basic geometric shapes in the software and modify them with some basic menu functions. Everything seemed confusing at first but the teacher went slowly and explained what the functions could do. By the end of it, I was able to create a snowman and I got the feeling that with enough time and practice, I\u2019d be able to actually make something more ambitious.\n\nExploring the DHU campus\n\nThe DHU campus is modern and compact.\n\nSatisfied with the content of the class, I decided to walk around the school and get a feel for the campus.\n\nThe school is located in a modern building in the center of Tokyo, just a few kilometers from Akihabara, which as you probably already know is the district of anime, gaming, and digital media. It\u2019s not the biggest school, and the classrooms were all quite small; nothing like your huge university lecture halls.\n\nDHU is located in Akihabara, Tokyo\u2019s center of anime, manga and video games.\n\nThe hallways were colorful and designed to encourage creativity. The school cafeteria\u2019s tables can even be used as giant whiteboards, with markers on every table. The school knows that the best ideas can pop up when you least suspect them, so you can write them down without missing a beat.\n\nThe library at DHU.\n\nThe school also has a career guidance center, listing internships, part-time jobs and full-time jobs in the industry. The jobs are separated by industry, such as anime, gaming, web design, etc. Companies often come to the school for their recruiting since the school\u2019s name is well-known in the scene. After all, the teachers are most likely former colleagues.\n\nHow can foreigners study at DHU?\n\nAfter touring the school, I asked about the requirements for non-Japanese students. The school has 1,185 students in total, with 434 of them being foreigners.\n\nOf course, the first question any potential international student will ask is about the level of Japanese necessary to enroll. The classes are all in Japanese, but if you can muster around a JLPT N2 level, then you\u2019ll be fine and will meet the school\u2019s Japanese language requirement.\n\nAnother DHU student\u2019s mixed media artwork.\n\nI may not be in a place to return to university, but I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t start having second thoughts about pursuing a second degree after enjoying the open campus. It seems that the digital media world is more globalized than ever and there are plenty of opportunities for foreigners who have the skills, drive, and creativity to make it.\n\nDigital Hollywood University\n\nDigital Hollywood University is on Instagram where it regularly features students\u2019 works, in addition to useful information on their admissions, events and so on. You can even ask questions and arrange a campus visit by DM-ing their Insta page.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the admissions process, you can also check out this page on their website.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mike Kozlowski", "Amelie Marie Nishizawa", "Gaijinpot Blog"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/09/Study-graphic-design-and-anime-at-Digital-Hollywood-University-in-Tokyo-Japan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
