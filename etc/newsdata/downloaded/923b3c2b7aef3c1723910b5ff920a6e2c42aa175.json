Such a force would be larger than the standing armies of Portugal (35,000) or the Netherlands (43,000).\n\n\u201cWe should pull our national sovereignties together to multiply the power of individual member states. And I am convinced that if we don\u2019t act together, Europe will become irrelevant in the new coming world,\u201d he added.\n\nBrussels currently has \u201cbattlegroups\u201d of 3,000 soldiers from across militaries of EU Member States, according to The Telegraph. The battlegroups are on standby every six months but have not, to date, been used. To increase those forces by twenty-fold and make them permanent, Brussels would need the unanimous support of Member States.\n\nFarage: The EU Is \u2018Building an Empire. Why Deny It?\u2019 https://t.co/jkYs8I9SWQ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 17, 2019\n\nBrexit Party leader and MEP Nigel Farage raised the alarm over the calls for a permanent EU army. He said: \u201cThe EU is now aiming for an army of 60,000 and incoming foreign policy boss Josep Borrell says: \u2018the EU has to learn to use the language of power.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen will Remainers stop lying about the intentions of this dangerous, undemocratic state?\u201d\n\nIn 2015, then-leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg called the notion of an EU army a \u201cdangerous fantasy\u201d and ridiculed Mr Farage for saying that the force was the next step in EU empire-building.\n\nHowever, in November 2017, Eurosceptics were proven right when the majority of EU nations signed the Permanent Structured Cooperation process (PESCO). The document is instrumental to European Defence Union plans which were devised by outgoing President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, who supports the foundation of a \u201cfully-fledged\u201d EU army by 2025.\n\nLast year, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a \u201creal European army\u201d to \u201cprotect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America\u201d. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Commission enthusiastically backed the idea.\n\nPro-Brexit group Veterans for Britain has warned that even when the UK leaves the EU, it could still get pulled into defence projects with the bloc. Senior figures met with the European Research Group on Tuesday to brief the group of Eurosceptic Tories on the defence implications of the proposed withdrawal treaty.\n\nA Veterans for Britain source told the Express: \u201cThe Prime Minister may have got rid of the backstop but that was not the only thing that was wrong with the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\n\u201cThe defence element is a serious threat to our sovereignty but this issue has been completely overlooked.\u201d\n\nERG Chairman Steve Baker said the UK must \u201cescape commitments to the EU\u2019s Defence Union. Many of us are concerned but it\u2019s not too late to preserve the independence of our Armed Forces.\u201d", "description": "The EU's incoming security chief has said the bloc needs a standing army of 60,000 soldiers that Brussels can deploy around the world.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/EU-Army.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
