The Communist regime which then took power did little to uncover the killings of Jews.\n\nRomania was home to 750,000 Jews before the war, but only 8,000-10,000 remain today.", "description": "Romania's President Klaus Iohannis gave the green light on Tuesday for the creation of the country's first national Holocaust museum in Bucharest, more than seven decades after the end of World War Two.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438485969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9715U", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
