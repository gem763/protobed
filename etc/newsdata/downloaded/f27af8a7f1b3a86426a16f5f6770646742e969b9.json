After that, everything started to gradually fall apart - especially passing sequences.\n\nIt began with the defence, who couldn\u2019t seem to deal with the simplest of set-pieces, with that compounded by a mess of a midfield, and ended with England apparently unable to create any chances beyond slipping Raheem Sterling in.\n\nLittle wonder Southgate has said that Sterling and Harry Kane are pretty much the only certain starters, but it\u2019s not because so many players are performing so well.\n\nThe manager instead faced questions about the form of so many of his starters, and many of his picks.\n\nThat is most pressing, well\u2026 everywhere beyond the attack. It seemed like it was a night that was going to call into question who plays in the backline, but the midfield gradually become just as much of an issue, with the two obviously connected.\n\nEngland can\u2019t control games, and that brings more pressure on a defence that is suddenly starting to buckle much more.\n\nSome of that is related to individual form.\n\nFor one, perhaps England\u2019s best two centre-halves - Joe Gomez and John Stones - aren\u2019t currently starting for their club sides. That creates an immediate problem for Southgate beyond his control. His attempted solution, however, isn\u2019t working.\n\nMichael Keane has never looked more uncertain in an England shirt. He doesn\u2019t look like he should be starting. The same applies to Danny Rose, a 29-year-old who looks well past his best. Kieran Trippier is more deserving of a place given his recent resurgence at Atletico Madrid, but not if it means England\u2019s best defender - and one of the best players - in Trent Alexander-Arnold is left out.\n\nHarry Maguire meanwhile just doesn\u2019t look like what the most expensive defender in the world should, and it\u2019s impossible not to think that the manifold problems at Manchester United have started to drag him down too. That missed header against Newcastle United seemed to symbolise it.\n\nHere, some of the defenders could barely head the ball at all, especially at set-pieces. Keane at one point just headed it straight into the air at his own penalty spot, just bringing more danger.\n\nIn front, Declan Rice is supposed to offer protection, but could here barely offer sure footing and certainly didn\u2019t offer much by way of possession. And Jordan Henderson? His most prominent moments were giving the ball away in spectacular fashion.\n\nThat remains the team\u2019s biggest problem, but is now leading to even more and more issues elsewhere.\n\nSouthgate doesn\u2019t seem any closer to figuring it out. He doesn\u2019t seem to have an idea what his best midfield is.\n\nOne very invested Premier League manager has actually been on at him - and repeatedly telling the England manager - that he should go all technical; that he should put Phil Foden in behind James Maddison and Jack Grealish. There\u2019s also the case to be made for Harry Winks.\n\nThey would at least give England a greater control of the ball, and thereby games.\n\nEngland aren\u2019t creating much, either.\n\nAnd that is why this game genuinely feels so consequential.\n\nIt is not that it is the first defeat, and consequent overreaction.\n\nIt is that it has exposed a series of problems that better teams will just pick off.\n\nThat is after all the level England want to get to.\n\nThey suddenly look further off than they have done in some time. It in itself is stark.\n\n\u201cWe have to respond in the right way,\u201d Southgate said, as ever speaking in the right way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot more about ourselves in the next 72 hours.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been one bad night.", "description": "A night that started with expectation of qualifying for Euro 2020 ended with almost everything going wrong, and very sudden concern for the future.
