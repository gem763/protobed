Kevin Durant is now with the Brooklyn Nets, veteran Andre Iguodala was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies and the team waived Shaun Livingston this summer.\n\nAnd Klay Thompson, though staying with the Warriors, will miss a major chunk of the season while recovering from an ACL injury.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile being a leader isn\u2019t anything new for Curry, being called \u201cold\u201d is.\n\n\u201cJust hearing it is weird, but I\u2019m still young,\u201d Curry said, via USA Today. \u201cI wake up every day with a smile on my face, with the opportunity I have in front of me, being in my prime, being able to play basketball at the highest level and do it with this team in front of our fan base, and I know I have a lot, a lot of years left at this level.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything, but just makes me laugh, and for people to notice some gray hairs that might pop out every once in a while.\u201d\n\nWith a new Warriors team ready for the 2019-20 season, Steph Curry isn\u2019t changing his mindset one bit. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\n\nCurry won\u2019t ever leave the court\n\nNow that he\u2019s the oldest on the team and still in his \u201cprime,\u201d there\u2019s no reason for Curry to ever leave the court this season.\n\nRight?\n\n\u201c48 minutes a game for all 82,\u201d Curry joked, via USA Today. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much confirmed by Coach Kerr just a minute ago. Very excited about that.\u201d\n\nObviously, Curry\u2019s exaggerating. Playing that much \u2014 especially at his age \u2014 would almost certainly take a major toll on a player. He is already, though, used to playing a lot of minutes for the Warriors.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurry has averaged 33.22 minutes per game throughout Golden State\u2019s run over the past half-decade, in which they reached the NBA Finals in five consecutive years.\n\nSo unless something goes wrong, expect Curry to keep getting minutes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no plans to rest him unless something develops,\u201d Warriors general manager Bob Myers said, via USA Today. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s of that mind.\u201d\n\nThe only issue that could arise, Myers said, is the temptation to give him more minutes.\n\n\u201cSteve likes the minutes he had,\u201d Myers said, via USA Today. \u201cThe bigger discipline will be do you increase those, and I don't think Steve is of that mindset. But with potentially less margin for error, there may be opportunities where we say we've got to put Steph back in the game, that'll require discipline.\u201d\n\nEven though he\u2019s got a new supporting cast around him \u2014 and isn\u2019t a favorite to win the championship anymore \u2014 the Warriors\u2019 resident old man isn\u2019t changing his game one bit.\n\nHe\u2019s sticking to what he knows.\n\n\u201cI have the same mentality no matter who\u2019s out on the floor and working off those guys and how I can make an impact on the floor,\u201d Curry said, via USA Today. \u201cIt doesn't mean I\u2019m taking every shot. You try to make other players better. I\u2019ve been fortunate to play with some extremely talented guys, and we\u2019ve all made each other better. But coming into this year, it\u2019s the same mentality.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With a new Warriors team ready for the 2019-20 season, Steph Curry isn\u2019t changing his mindset one bit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qvAPR06GOp2uMrCPwrA_5A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/36hCEU19fa5pbBeGuUmAqA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/38b54760-e4c7-11e9-b7dd-4ab790641123"}
