Trump said he also planned to meet with Afghanistan's president.\n\nBut Trump said he immediately called the talks off when the insurgents said they were behind the attack.\n\n\"If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\nThe surprise announcement left in doubt the future of the draft accord worked out last week by Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy for peace in Afghanistan, for a drawdown of thousands of U.S. troops over the coming months.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the Taliban but the decision appeared to catch them by surprise.\n\nJust hours before Trump's tweet, a senior Taliban leader privy to talks in Doha with U.S. officials including Khalilzad and Taliban chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, said an agreement to sign the deal appeared close.\n\nTaliban fighters, who now control more territory than at any time since 2001, launched fresh assaults on the northern cities of Kunduz and Pul-e Khumri over the past week and carried out two major suicide bombings in the capital Kabul.\n\nOne of the blasts, a suicide attack in Kabul on Thursday, took the life of U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Puerto Rico, bringing the number of American troops killed in Afghanistan this year to 16.\n\nA spike in attacks by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan has been \"particularly unhelpful\" to peace efforts there, a senior U.S. military commander said on Saturday as he visited neighboring Pakistan, where many Taliban militants are based.\n\nU.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, who oversees American troops in the region, declined to comment on the diplomatic negotiations themselves but criticized a wave of Taliban violence that has cast a long shadow over the deal.\n\n\"It is particularly unhelpful at this moment in Afghanistan's history for the Taliban to ramp up violence,\" McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters traveling with him.\n\nMcKenzie said for the peace process to move forward, \"all parties should be committed to an eventual political settlement\" which, in turn, should result in reduced violence.\n\n\"If we can't get that going in, then it is difficult to see the parties are going to be able to carry out the terms of the agreement, whatever they might or might not be,\" McKenzie said.\n\nUnder the draft accord, some 5,000 U.S. troops would be withdrawn over the coming months in exchange for guarantees Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nHowever, a full peace agreement to end more than 18 years of war would depend on subsequent \"intra Afghan\" talks involving officials and civil society leaders as well as further agreement on issues including the remainder of the roughly 14,000-strong U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops.\n\nThe Taliban have rejected calls for a ceasefire and instead stepped up operations across the country and it remains unclear whether they will accept direct negotiations with the Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate \"puppet\" regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW CIVIL WAR?\n\nFor Afghans, the Taliban's recent escalation of attacks has underscored fears it may be impossible to reach a stable settlement following any complete U.S. withdrawal.\n\nGhani dismissed the talks as \"meaningless\" following Thursday's suicide bombing and his spokesman said an official reaction to Trump's announcement would come soon.\n\nThe Taliban's strategy appears to be based on the assumption that battlefield success would strengthen their hand in future negotiations with Afghan officials. Some of their field commanders have also said they are determined not to surrender gains when they are close to victory, suggesting the leadership is under internal pressure not to concede a ceasefire.", "description": "WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he canceled peace talks with Afghanistan's Taliban leaders after the insurgent group claimed responsibility last week for an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier and 11 other people.
