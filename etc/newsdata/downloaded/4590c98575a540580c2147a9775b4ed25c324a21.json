It isn\u2019t some luxury that we only get to when we have time on our hands. This is a core imperative for every human being in every society,\u201d Clinton writes in \u201cThe Shriver Report: A woman\u2019s nation pushes back from the brink,\u201d a report that features essays compiled by Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress.\n\nClinton warns that American women lag behind other first-world countries in a slew of important attributes, including life span, equal pay and employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cIn places throughout America large and small, the clock is turning back,\u201d says Clinton, noting that while women now hold approximately half of U.S. jobs, the country doesn\u2019t crack the top 10 rankings of countries where women thrive economically.\n\nWomen earned about 81 percent of males\u2019 median wages in full-time jobs in 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 annual report released in October. That\u2019s an increase from 62 percent in 1979, the first year comparable data was available. The BLS says women who never married earn nearly 96 percent of a man\u2019s wages; married women take home considerably less, at 77 percent.\n\nAnd while some numbers illustrate an improvement, women in poverty face dire prospects. According to a BLS studies released in 2013:\n\n* Families maintained by working women were much more likely, at 27.2 percent, to live below the federal poverty level than male-headed households, at 15.8 percent. This is true at all education levels and across all races and ethnicities.\n\n* In 2011, the percentage of working-poor women increased, while it fell for men.\n\n* Forty-six percent of women in single-parent households receive government assistance like Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income.\n\nSimilar figures give Clinton pause, and stir concern that the country is walking back some advancements in gender equality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my own daughter, and I look at all these young women I\u2019ve been privileged to work with or know through Chelsea, and it\u2019s hard to imagine turning the clock back on them,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cWe have work to do.\u201d\n\nKim Jacobs Walker, a 48-year-old entrepreneur and mother of two in Austin, Texas, suggests the clock metaphor isn\u2019t exactly accurate:\n\n\u201cPerhaps a better analogy would be a pendulum, where time moves forward but sentiments swing wildly from one extreme to another until the pendulum at last succumbs to gravity, coming to a stop on middle ground,\u201d Walker wrote in a first-person account for Yahoo News last week about gender equality. \u201cThe pendulum swung hard from the extreme conservatism of the '40s and '50s to the insistent demands of women's rights advocates during the '60s and '70s.\u201d\n\nWalker argues that when circumstances swing back \u2014 inevitably, for many women \u2014 to when they choose to re-enter the workforce, their years of experience in managing households, community groups and other difficult hands-on work should be impressed upon employers:\n\n\u201cFor women to achieve true economic equality, we have to start believing that an empathetic heart is worth as much as a strong arm; that it really is difficult to spend the day with a room full of toddlers; and that stay-at-home moms who run PTAs and booster clubs actually do have experience that translates meaningfully to administrative and management jobs when they're ready to re-enter the workforce.\u201d", "description": "Hillary Clinton cautions that opportunities for American women could vanish if the United States does not prioritize their economic advancement.", "authors": ["Tim Skillern"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZJHTFQb0hcBmynjeGSAasQ--~B/aD00NjA7dz03NTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/news/2014-01-18/0bd5a613-1b12-4db2-90ce-15192ce717e1_chart2.png", "published_at": "2014-01-19"}
