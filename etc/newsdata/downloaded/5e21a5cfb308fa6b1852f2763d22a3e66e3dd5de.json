I spent all this time absorbing, absorbing. Listening to their voices, until I understood.\n\nMs Miller echoes the words used against her by Turner\u2019s lawyers during the trial: \u201cChanel knows how you get in blackouts,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cChanel also knows how to write. And Chanel knows how to draw.\u201d\n\nThe film then shifts to show Ms Miller in real life, drawing illustrations on a wall.\n\n\u201cSurvivors will not be limited, labelled, boxed in, oppressed,\u201d she continues.\n\n\u201cWe will not be isolated \u2013 we\u2019ve had enough. Enough of the shame, diminishment, the disbelief, enough loneliness.\n\n\u201cNo one gets to define you. You do \u2013 you do. My name is Chanel \u2013 and I am with you.\u201d\n\nMs Miller described her experience of making the film as \u201cimmensely healing\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe should all be creating space for survivors to speak their truths and express themselves freely,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen society nourishes instead of blames, books are written, art is made, and the world is a little better for it.\n\n\"Nobody wants to be defined by the worst thing that\u2019s happened to them.\u201d", "description": "Chanel Miller, the woman who was sexually assaulted by Stanford student Brock Turner, has created a powerful short film to show her support and solidarity with\u00a0survivors of sexual abuse.", "authors": ["Joanna Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/10/chanel-miller-know-my-name-2-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
