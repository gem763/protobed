People at those locations could develop measles up to 21 days after being exposed. Those who develop symptoms are encouraged to stay at home, according to the release.\n\nThe department is urging people who may have been exposed to review their immunization records, saying those who have not had measles and have not had the vaccine should meet with the health professional to get the vaccine.\n\nThe county has experienced 19 measles cases among residents and an additional 11 non-resident cases of people that were in the county, excluding Long Beach and Pasadena, who report their own cases. Most of these cases were for people who did not get the vaccination or could not remember if they did.\n\n\u201cFor those who are not protected, measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that initially causes fever, cough, red, watery eyes, and, finally, a rash,\u201d Los Angeles County Health Officer Muntu Davis said in the release. \u201cMeasles is spread by air and by direct contact even before you know have it.\u201d\n\nThe Hill reached out to the county\u2019s Department of Public Health and Disneyland for comment.\n\nThis is not the first time the park's visitors have been at risk for measles. Two months ago, an infected teenager from New Zealand visited there, and in 2014, a measles outbreak occurred after an infected visitor attended the park, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nThe U.S. has experienced one of the worst outbreaks of measles in the past two decades as cases were reported in 31 states, a majority of which were in New York City and New York state. These outbreaks have threatened the country\u2019s elimination status that was announced in 2000.", "description": "Disneyland visitors are being warned that they could have contracted measles from a guest who visited the park last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/measles_vaccine_01122019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
