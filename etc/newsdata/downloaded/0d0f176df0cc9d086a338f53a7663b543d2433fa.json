For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal contain testimony from an ex-employee of New York City power couple Glenn Dubin and Eva Andersson-Dubin about a \u201cdistraught\u201d Swedish teen\u2019s claim that she was pressured to have sex on the pedophile financier\u2019s private island.\n\nRinaldo Rizzo, a former house manager for the Dubins, was in tears as he described his 2005 encounter with the 15-year-old girl in his employers\u2019 kitchen, according to excerpts of a 2016 deposition made public for the first time on Friday.\n\nThe butler said that as the girl sat on a stool at a long counter\u2014where she was brought by Andersson-Dubin, an ex-girlfriend of Epstein\u2014she reminded him of other girls he had seen at Epstein\u2019s home.\n\nHe said she was \u201cdistraught and shaking... literally quivering\u201d as she spoke about her dealings with Epstein\u2019s alleged madam, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n\u201cShe sat down and sat in the stool exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to you sat at Jeffrey\u2019s house, with no expression and with their head down,\u201d Rizzo testified.\n\nRizzo said that after Andersson-Dubin left the kitchen, he introduced himself and his wife to the teen.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really respond,\u201d Rizzo recalled. \u201cNothing verbal, no cues, her head is still down. I asked her if she would like some water, tissue, anything, and she basically doesn\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\nRizzo said he decided to try making small talk.\n\n\u201cOh, by the way, do you work for Jeffrey?\u201d he recalled asking.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the teen said, by his account.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jeffrey\u2019s executive assistant, personal assistant,\u201d she replied.\n\nShe looked much too young for that, and Rizzo said he asked her how she got the job, how old she was.\n\n\u201cAnd she says to me, point blank, \u2018I\u2019m 15,\u2019\u201d Rizzo testified. \u201cAnd I said to her. \u2018You\u2019re 15 years old and you have a position like that?\u2019 At that point she just breaks down hysterical, and I feel like I just said something wrong, and she will not stop crying.\u201d\n\n\u201c In a state of shock, she just lets it rip, and what she told me was unbelievable. \u201d \u2014 Rinaldo Rizzo, butler\n\nAccording to the deposition, Rizzo and his wife tried to console her with words and renewed offers of water and tissue. Nothing worked.\n\n\u201cAnd then in a state of shock, she just lets it rip, and what she told me was unbelievable,\u201d Rizzo testified. \u201cShe proceeded to tell my wife and I\u2026 'I was on the island and there was Ghislaine, and there was Sarah,\u2019 and she said, \u2018They asked me for sex. I said no.\u2019\u201d\n\nRizzo later clarified, \u201cShe didn\u2019t specify who asked for sex. She said they asked for sex.\u201d\n\nRizzo testified that when she refused to have sex, Kellen took her phone and passport and gave them to Maxwell.\n\n\u201cAnd at that point, she said she was threatened,\u201d Rizzo testified. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Threatened?\u2019 She says, \u2018Yes. I was threatened by Ghislaine, not to discuss this.\u2019\u201d\n\nRizzo asked the teen if she had contacted her parents.\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018I\u2019m not supposed to talk about this,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\n\nThe teen reported that Epstein had also threatened her to keep quiet about what had gone on.\n\n\u201cThe word she used was sex,\u201d Rizzo testified, adding that it was clear the girl was in fear\n\n\u201cShe was shaking uncontrollably,\u201d he testified.\n\nRizzo said the girl stopped answering questions when she heard someone approaching the kitchen.\n\n\u201cEva comes in and tells her that she will be working for Eva in the city,\u201d Rizzo testified. \u201cAs a nanny.\u201d\n\nHe said he saw the girl approximately a month later aboard a flight with the Dubin family to Sweden. She was dropped off at a Swedish airport.\n\nEpstein was arrested last month and charged with sex-trafficking, accusing of recruiting dozens of underage girls to his homes in New York and Miami.\n\nRizzo\u2019s testimony was submitted in a different case, a defamation suit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre against Maxwell. The case, which was settled in 2017 on confidential terms, contained a trove of documents the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered unsealed.\n\nThose documents also revealed that Giuffre\u2014who claims she was Epstein and Maxwell\u2019s \u201csex slave\u201d\u2014had accused Glenn Dubin of being part of Epstein\u2019s sex-trafficking ring, which he denies.\n\n\u201cGlenn and Eva Dubin are outraged by the allegations in the unsealed court records, which are demonstrably false and defamatory. The Dubins have flight records and other evidence that definitively disprove that any such events occurred,\u201d a spokesperson for the Dubin family told The Daily Beast on Friday.\n\n\u201c Glenn and Eva Dubin are outraged by the allegations in the unsealed court records, which are demonstrably false and defamatory. \u201d \u2014 Dubin family statement\n\nAndersson-Dubin, a former Miss Sweden and Ford model\u2014now a philanthropist and doctor\u2014told The New York Times right after Epstein's arrest that she was shocked by the sex trafficking allegations against her ex-boyfriend and they were \u201ccompletely counter to the person she is familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, the billionaire couple declared, \u201cThe Dubins are horrified by the new allegations against Jeffrey Epstein... Had they been aware of the vile and unspeakable conduct described in these new allegations, they would have cut off all ties and certainly never have allowed their children to be in his presence.\u201d\n\nEva and Glenn Dubin have been married since 1994. He is a founder of Highbridge Capital and also launched the philanthropic Robin Hood Foundation and the Dubin Breast Cancer Center at Mt. Sinai after Eva's own experience with breast cancer. They have also signed Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's Giving Pledge, to give away a portion of their wealth in their lifetime\u2014which is estimated by Forbes to be around $2 billion.\n\nBut before Glenn Dubin, Eva had another wealthy beau\u2014Epstein. One dancer told The Daily Beast that she flew to Palm Beach in 1983 to teach Epstein and his guests ballet barre lessons and stretching. Two of those guests were Andersson-Dubin and another Swedish model with the Ford agency, she said.\n\nAccording to the Times, Andersson-Dubin was in medical school when she met Epstein, and she remained close to him after she married Glenn Dubin\u2014who also counted himself as a friend of Epstein. Bloomberg reported that Epstein had invested in Dubin\u2019s hedge fund.\n\nAndersson-Dubin helped to reintroduce Epstein into Manhattan\u2019s society circles after he was released from a Palm Beach jail, followed by house arrest, in 2010. \u201cIf Mr. Epstein had Dr. Andersson-Dubin\u2019s friendship, it suggested to others that perhaps he should be given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d a Times article pointed out.\n\n\u201cShe's a very loyal friend and didn't abandon him after 2008, but the frequency of their contact was less,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nAs Business Insider revealed, the Dubins invited Epstein to their Palm Beach home for Thanksgiving dinner in 2009. In an email to Epstein\u2019s probation officer, Eva wrote, \u201cI am 100% comfortable with Jeffrey Epstein around my children,\u201d while acknowledging Epstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution. At the time, the couple\u2019s three kids were underage, Business Insider reported.\n\nEpstein appears to have funded Andersson-Dubin\u2019s projects\u2014particularly her passion for women\u2019s health.\n\nIn July 2012, Epstein issued a press release touting his charity\u2019s supposed donation to the Dubin Breast Center. \u201cThe Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, a provider of 3D mammography to test for breast cancer, announced it has received additional support from science philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein and his foundation, The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation,\u201d the bulletin read.\n\nThe press release included a quote only from Epstein: \u201cEarly diagnosis is clearly critical to survival. We are very excited that 3D mammography is playing a role in stopping breast cancer from developing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Andersson-Dubin established a nonprofit in her daughter\u2019s name, the Celina Dubin United Fund, in order to funnel Epstein\u2019s money to the Dubin Breast Center. The article stated that Epstein \u201cunderstood that a public donation from a registered sex offender might not be welcome.\u201d\n\nCelina Dubin United Fund\u2019s tax-exempt application\u2014reviewed by The Daily Beast\u2014shows that the group's accountant, George V. Delson, is the same bookkeeper for Epstein\u2019s former nonprofits, including the C.O.U.Q. Foundation and Epstein Interests.\n\nThe Celina Dubin United Fund was incorporated in October 2009, and listed Andersson-Dubin as the sole trustee, tax records show. A registration statement identified Brenda Ames, the CFO at Glenn Dubin's Highbridge Capital Management, as the group\u2019s treasurer.\n\nThe nonprofit\u2019s 2012 schedule of contributors, filed with the IRS, showed a single donor\u2014the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc., which donated $25,000. And a 2013 tax return listed a sole expense of $22,413, back to the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc.\n\nA statement attached to the 2013 tax form shows the Celina Dubin group terminated on Feb. 28, 2013, and that $22,413 would be returned to Epstein since it had not been used, per the agreement between Andersson-Dubin\u2019s and Epstein\u2019s charities. The March 2012 agreement was signed on Epstein\u2019s behalf by his longtime attorney, Darren Indyke.\n\nIn March of this year, The Daily Beast exposed Epstein\u2019s secret charity, Gratitude America Ltd., which was quietly created in 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Gratitude America Ltd. shelled out $50,000 to Harvard\u2019s historic theater troupe, the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770. After The Daily Beast\u2019s story, the institute removed Epstein\u2019s name from a roster of top donors on its website.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding website also lists \u201cEva & Glenn Dubin\u201d as donors who\u2019ve contributed $25,000 or more to the group. According to her LinkedIn page and photos of Hasty Pudding events, Celina Dubin was a member of the club.\n\nGratitude America also donated $10,000 to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, where Celina Dubin is a medical student.\n\nAside from the Dubins\u2019 connections to Epstein through philanthropy, Glenn had encouraged Epstein to invest $80 million in a hedge fund by onetime wunderkind Daniel Zwirn from 2002 to 2005, according to reports in New York and Business Insider.\n\nZwirn was a former senior portfolio manager at Dubin\u2019s Highbridge Capital. Epstein also invested in Highbridge in 1998, New York reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIn 2006, Epstein had tried to withdraw his investment, which blossomed to $140 million, after he learned of accounting irregularities, including $3 million spent on a Gulfstream jet, which Zwirn claimed was purchased for him by the fund\u2019s CFO without his knowledge.\n\nZwirn\u2019s fund collapsed in 2008 after the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its accounting. \u201cOne of the early investors that I introduced to Zwirn was Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d Dubin stated in a 2010 affidavit, as part of a later lawsuit over Epstein\u2019s lost millions. \u201cEpstein was both a personal friend of mine and a long-time investor in [Highbridge].\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Glenn Dubin\u2019s name was mentioned in two depositions relating to Epstein\u2019s abuse of underage girls, as part of the Jane Doe lawsuit against the government.\n\nDuring a 2010 deposition of Epstein\u2019s alleged co-conspirator and \u201csex slave\u201d Nadia Marcinkova, victims\u2019 lawyer Brad Edwards asked various questions, including \u201cDo you know Bill Clinton?\u201d and \u201cDo you know what Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s relationship is with Alan Dershowitz?\u201d\n\nMarcinkova pleaded the Fifth in response to each query.\n\n\u201cDo you know Glenn Dubin?\u201d he asked the young woman.\n\nShe pleaded the Fifth.\n\nSimilarly, in a 2010 deposition of another alleged co-conspirator Adriana Ross (also known as Adriana Mucinska), lawyers asked:\n\n\u201cCan you tell us any of the other folks that Jeffrey Epstein would supply underage minor girls to?\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to answer,\u201d Ross said.\n\n\u201cDo you know a man by the name of Glenn Dubin?\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis wife at some point in time was associated with Jeffrey Epstein; is that correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd her name\u2019s Eva Dubin; is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither way, isn\u2019t it true that Jeffrey Epstein then started supplying underage females to Glenn Dubin?\u201d\n\nShe refused to answer.", "description": "Rinaldo Rizzo testified about a girl he met at the home of his employers, Glenn and Eva Dubin.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Michael Daly", "Senior Reporter", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2559,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565379072/GettyImages-692816322_1_j3rhsy", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
