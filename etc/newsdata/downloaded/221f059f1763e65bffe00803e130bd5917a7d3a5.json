The fast-growing charter school system sold $357 million in unrated bonds last year.\n\nInvestors are flocking to riskier corners of the traditionally safe municipal bond market in a search for yield.\n\nThey are buying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt issues from unrated and below-investment-grade borrowers such as energy projects and upstart charter schools.\n\nIt is a shift within a part of the bond market commonly considered almost as safe as Treasurys. Municipal-bond payments are often backed by taxes or revenue from essential services. The bonds are known for low default rates and prized by investors for stable returns and interest payments that are typically tax-free.\n\nYet the return of superlow rates this year has driven investors to seek out less traditional versions of muni bonds that offer higher returns. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter-percentage point for the second time in recent months, to a range between 1.75% and 2%.\n\nThe sale of riskier new bonds, combined with the deterioration of some existing debt, has increased the amount of junk-rated and unrated debt outstanding by 20% since 2012, according to Municipal Market Analytics and the Federal Reserve.\n\nIt remains a small slice, about 9%, of the $4 trillion muni-bond market, according to MMA and Fed data. But high-yield municipal funds have attracted more money in the year to August than in any other year on record, drawing $14 billion, according to Refinitiv data going back to 1992.\n\nThe appetite for muni debt includes less traditional offerings in which governments extend their tax-exempt borrowing power to efforts to build or renovate hospitals, dormitories, energy plants, and even malls and stadiums.\n\nFor example, investors recently welcomed the largest unrated charter school deal ever, according to Equitable Facilities Fund, which tracks the market. Overall issuance in that sector has risen roughly fourfold over the past decade.\n\nThe International Leadership of Texas, Garland High School, one of 19 campuses in the charter school system.

As a result, they typically offer additional yield to compensate for that risk\u2014income that has proved tantalizing for investors after years of rock-bottom rates.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more speculative projects find their way into municipal bond financings today than we have over the last handful of years,\u201d said Robert Amodeo, head of municipals at Western Asset Management.\n\nAlready, though, there are some worrisome signs. Reports of problems filed by borrowers\u2014ranging from outright defaults to tapping cash reserves to make payments\u2014so far this year have reached the highest level since 2015, according to MMA. There were 101 such issues through August, compared with a five-year average of 90, MMA data show.\n\nWhile overall municipal defaults remain rare, the probability of a speculative-grade muni bond defaulting within 10 years has ticked up. It rose to 12% over the past decade, compared with 4% for the period from 1970 to 2008, according to data from Moody\u2019s Corp. on bonds rated by that firm.\n\nRecently issued debt\u2014both speculative and investment-grade\u2014also is going sour more quickly. Among bonds that have reported impairments since 2017, some 40% encountered that trouble within three years of being issued, MMA data shows. In the previous seven years, an average of 24% of impairments affected debt issued that recently.\n\n\u201cGod help us if there\u2019s a recession,\u201d said Tom Doe, president of MMA.\n\nSome investment-grade rated bonds are also deteriorating quickly.\n\nLast year, ratings firm S&P Global Inc. downgraded to junk roughly $250 million in bonds issued by nonprofit Provident Oklahoma Education Resources Inc. to build student housing and a parking garage on the University of Oklahoma campus in Norman, Okla. The project hadn\u2019t yet been completed, but it had become clear not enough students wanted to live there, weighing on the nonprofit\u2019s revenues, S&P said in a report.\n\nStudents at International Leadership of Texas, which joined a wave of charter schools issuing muni bonds over the past decade.

Rieger, author of the Rieger Report, a bond market newsletter. \u201cIf there was a fiscally weaker municipality that needed to raise funds, this is the time to do it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, charter school International Leadership of Texas fell afoul of its required debt-service coverage ratio, a measure of how much cash the school has on hand to make bond payments.\n\nAround that time, the fast-growing school system ended up laying off about 60 staff members to save millions in payroll annually to meet its required ratio again.\n\nBut investors snapped up a $357 million offering from the school system last year, the largest unrated charter school deal on record, according to the Equitable Facilities Fund, which helps charter schools secure financing.\n\nSuperintendent Eddie Conger founded the International Leadership of Texas charter school in 2013.

He said the school has made adjustments since 2017 and added that he is contemplating a return to the bond market next year.\n\nThe willingness of investors to look past prior problems is also allowing some issues to add debt yet cut borrowing costs. Palomar Health, a hospital system in Southern California has struggled with union contract negotiations and low levels of cash in the past, according to a Moody\u2019s report.\n\nBut it was able to borrow an additional $60 million while refinancing debt in 2017. And its interest costs fell by half a million dollars a year, said Carlos Bohorquez, the hospital\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\n\u201cIt was a win-win,\u201d said Mr. Bohorquez.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com and Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com", "description": "Investors are buying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt issues from unrated and below-investment-grade municipal borrowers, a shift in a corner of the bond market commonly considered almost as safe as Treasurys.", "authors": ["Gunjan Banerji", "Heather Gillers", "Gunjan.Banerji Wsj.Com", "Heather.Gillers Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107915/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
