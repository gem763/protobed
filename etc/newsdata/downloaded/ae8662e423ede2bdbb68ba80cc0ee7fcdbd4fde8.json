I just like an alliteration!).'\n\nMother, daughter time: Vicky's mother Caroll has flown to Bali with her for some quality time\n\nInstagram versus reality: Vicky shared many 'Instagram versus reality' snaps while in Bali\n\nSoaking it all in: The television personality bathed in a traditional Balinese bath\n\nThe Geordie Shore star then expressed her gratitude for her supportive followers, before begging others to be 'mindful.'\n\nShe concluded: 'I'm saying this here and honestly across the board I am very lucky to have mostly beautiful followers who practice support and kindness on the regular- for that I am so grateful and I love you all.\n\n'But for the few people who don't seem to grasp the gravity of their words I implore you to be mindful across all social media.\n\n'Kindness and compassion are much for fun to spread than hate and anger. Let those things go and start enjoying the parrrttttyyyyy Debbie downers!!\n\n'Namaste..
