Those that believe that don\u2019t live in the 21st century.\n\nPeriods can be uncomfortable for many but being trans adds many additional layers.\n\nI was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at 14. I\u2019d leave my house hoping nobody would call me \u2018she\u2019 as my heart would drop \u2013 every single time.\n\nI\u2019d catch a glance of myself in the mirror and I wouldn\u2019t recognise myself so I\u2019d try and convince myself that this body was temporary. Looking at it was a complete no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe physical fight wasn\u2019t enjoyable but the mental pain\u2026 the places in which my brain took me are indescribable.\n\nA year later I experienced my first period. I felt confused, like my own body had betrayed me, like my body was fighting my mind. My body dysphoria heightened severely to the point that I could no longer look in mirrors.\n\nFor me, having periods caused my mental health to spiral to a new low \u2013 a place where no 15-year-old should be. Being a transgender man having a bodily function that was solely associated with cis-gender women was torture.\n\nPhysically, my periods caused me to pass out and act out of character as I didn\u2019t feel like me. Each month I lost a little bit more of my dignity.\n\nI really struggled with buying period products \u2013 I felt embarrassed because I didn\u2019t believe I should have been buying them in the first place. I\u2019d ask my mum or sister to buy them for me and if they couldn\u2019t, I\u2019d order them online.\n\nFrom time to time I came on early and there was no other option but to buy them myself, from a shop, in public. I remember strolling down the female hygiene aisle, feeling distraught, walking slowly enough that no one would see the little boy buying sanitary pads.\n\nI know I could have been buying them for anybody \u2013 but I knew they were for me and that was the agonising part. I\u2019d keep my head down and pick out the first product I found that seemed remotely suitable.\n\nI remember strolling down the female hygiene aisle, feeling distraught, walking slowly enough that no one would see the little boy buying sanitary pads.\n\nI cannot understand why people are now so bothered about Always removing the Venus logo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not an attack on women, it\u2019s not denying the existence of women, nor is it an attempt to erase them. It\u2019s an opportunity to become inclusive, which in my opinion has no impact on women.\n\nWhat it will do is remove some of the discomfort and stigma associated around trans, non-binary and intersex individuals who have to buy and use these products.\n\nTaking the Venus sign off the packaging doesn\u2019t make the product defective and it doesn\u2019t affect its functionality.\n\nAnd let\u2019s think beyond the trans/non-binary/intersex communities for a moment \u2013 not every woman wants pretty pink packaging with gendered, hologram prints to remind them of their gender.\n\nMy biggest concern is that gendering products forces people to continue living up to the expectations of gender roles, which they may not feel are applicable to them.\n\nSome men are flamboyant, some women are masculine, and that\u2019s simply who they are. Not everyone who gets a period is a woman, and not every woman gets a period, so we need to stop hinging \u2018femininity\u2019 on menstruation.\n\nI\u2019m also bored of seeing my community being attacked. How I identify is not a choice and what body functions I should experience aren\u2019t up for debate.\n\nI don\u2019t imagine global companies make branding decisions overnight and responding to Metro.co.uk, Always said that they made the change \u2018after hearing from many people across genders and age groups.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt shows this must have been a calculated decision, based on the wants and needs of consumers \u2013 and I\u2019m happy that Always have committed to change. No form of labelling, speech or advertisement should come at the cost of making another human being feeling dysphoric.\n\nIn the future, gender neutral sanitary options could make all the difference for young people trying to come to terms with their identities, while simultaneously dealing with the added hardships brought on by puberty.\n\nFor me, it might have been the difference between feeling alone and dysphoric, and being able to accept that periods were a normal part of my existence. It would have made me feel seen, knowing that a brand had me and my community in mind. 15-year-old me would have really appreciated it.\n\nUntil then, this is still a massive step towards further inclusion and Always, I commend you. Although I believe inclusivity and diversity should be the standard, when a company sides with the minority it deserves recognition.\n\nTrans people won\u2019t be erased, non-binary people won\u2019t be erased, intersex people won\u2019t be erased.\n\nIn fact, the world is just starting to make space for us and everyone who opposes the attempt to invalidate our existence is bound to fail.\n\nMORE: Flora cuts ties with Mumsnet because of anti-trans rhetoric\n\nMORE: I urgently need the government to talk about trans rights\n\nMORE: Trans children to get sex education with gender they identify with", "description": "As a transgender man, Kenny Ethan Jones writes in support of Always removing the Venus logo from their sanitary pad wrappers.", "authors": ["Kenny Ethan Jones", "Model", "Activist"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90836022_1571754925.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
