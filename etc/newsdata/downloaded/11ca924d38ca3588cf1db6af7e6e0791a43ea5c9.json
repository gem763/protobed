The morning starts with prayers just before dawn. Meals in the barracks are prepared under the strictest kosher requirements. Training is halted twice more during the day for prayers; once again for a rabbi to teach soldiers about religious texts. Unlike the rest of the Israel Defense Forces, there are no women on duty.\n\nMany of the unit\u2019s deeply observant members were raised to be rabbis, which is seen as the highest calling and duty. But as Daniel Rosenberg, an ultra-Orthodox who operated a heavy machine-gun, explained, sometimes a \u201ckid doesn\u2019t want to be a rabbi; he wants to be a fighter\u201d.\n\nThese men, who number just a few thousand, are at the centre of a fierce debate in Israel that has driven rifts through society, peaking earlier this year when political differences over the issue shattered attempts to form a government. The unresolved dispute now hangs over Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nIsrael has mandatory army service but has always made an exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews, also known as Haredi, who are allowed to continue full-time Torah study.\n\nDuring the past two decades a small but growing number of Haredi have volunteered to join the military, often going against their parents\u2019 wishes, and in many cases being rejected by their families.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a lot of strength and power to detach from your family\u2019s beliefs and go do something extremely different,\u201d said Rosenberg, 21, who recently ended his time as a Haredi paratrooper. \u201cThey have no emotional help,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, when it comes to the field, they\u2019re beasts \u2026 Those kids are on their own, and that gives them a lot of strength, ironically.\u201d\n\nThe exemption policy dates back to just after the country\u2019s founding, when 400 yeshiva students were permitted to avoid conscription.. With Haredi populations increasing to about 12% of the country\u2019s nine million citizens, tens of thousands now avoid the military and live on government stipends.\n\nFor Avigdor Lieberman, a secular former defence minister, the issue was a deal-breaker. In May he refused to join a coalition government with ultra-Orthodox parties unless Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to force the Haredi into the army. The stalemate led to a second election being called.\n\nIt is not only in Israeli society that Haredi soldiers are controversial. The first ultra-Orthodox battalion, Netzah Yehuda, established in 1999, mainly operates in the occupied West Bank and has been embroiled in a series of abuse allegations over the years against Palestinians \u2013 including violent beatings of handcuffed detainees and even claims of electrocuting prisoners.\n\nIn March an Israeli military court convicted four soldiers from the brigade for aggravated abuse after they filmed themselves laughing and hitting two arrested Palestinians. \u201cWe\u2019re having a party here,\u201d one is filmed saying before slapping a blindfolded man.\n\nIn Israel, the Haredi call-up issue could paralyse the next attempt at government-building. At the very least, it has added vitriol into politics. Netanyahu\u2019s main rival, Benny Gantz, has hinted that he might also snub powerful religious politicians if elected.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Israeli soldiers and an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man pray at the Western Wall, in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City.

Some fringe sections of Haredi society even reject Zionism, arguing there should be no Jewish state, and certainly not a secular one, before the arrival of the Messiah. In parts of Jerusalem, protests against authorities are common.\n\nYehuda Meshi-Zahav used to lead those demonstrations and says he was arrested more than 30 times. But his opinions changed when in 1989 he came across the aftermath of a bloody attack by a Palestinian who seized control of a public bus and forced it off a cliff near the outskirts of Jerusalem. It killed 16 people.\n\n\u201cThat was something that shook me very deeply,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mind changes when you go to the scene of an attack. You understand that, in order to keep the possibility of having what we have here, everyone needs to volunteer and give what they can.\u201d\n\nHe was one of the first Haredi rabbis to promote the idea of serving in the army, and his son, Netanel Meshi-Zahav, has just left a Haredi paratrooper unit. The 22-year-old spent a lot of his time helping so-called \u201clone soldiers\u201d, men whose families had abandoned them. As his father had embraced mainstream Israeli society, he knew both sides, and also acted as an aide to non-religious officers who might not understand the Haredi background.\n\n\u201cSometimes secular officers do not understand that these guys have been sitting for 18 years on a chair learning and studying the Torah,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t run 100 metres in their lives.\u201d\n\nWith time, the soldiers caught up and, he boasts, Haredi units now often win many army sporting competitions. One secular officer he knows even became a foster carer for three lone soldiers.\n\nMeshi-Zahav\u2019s family supports him but he feels the pressure other Haredi soldiers feel in their communities, where they may be labelled traitors.\n\n\u201cWhen I used to leave the base, I would go through Tel Aviv. People were very kind; they would offer you something to drink. I felt really proud to have my paratrooper wings on my chest,\u201d he said. But when he took the bus to deeply religious neighbourhoods, \u201cthe change was very clear \u2026 I could feel the anger, the tut-tut-tut.\u201d\n\nHe understands the sentiment, but says it is frustrating: \u201cWhen you are lying on the ground in the rain, they don\u2019t understand you are protecting them.\u201d", "description": "For Haredi Jews exempt from military service, volunteering can mean a family break-up", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c2219f92131f92f32257c5cd836cdcf20da43a/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7f1a98807fe88b00ba3cd7837a0f0a16", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
