But as he seeks re-election in 2020, he is banking heavily on his ability to blend it into a coherent narrative with the version of his presidency in which he\u2019s been a commanding force, steamrolling adversaries to get things done\u2026\n\nThese two halves of Trump \u2014 victim and conqueror \u2014 fit together snugly for his campaign\u2026\n\nDemocrats say that the premise of Trump being uniquely under siege \u2014 despite long investigations into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice \u2014 is faulty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd argument,\u201d Joe Lockhart, who served as press secretary for President Bill Clinton, said in a direct message exchange. \u201cTrump has had no congressional oversight for the majority of his term.
