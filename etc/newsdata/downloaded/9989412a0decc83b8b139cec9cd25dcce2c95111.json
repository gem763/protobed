Their diplomats may enjoy world travel and nice salaries, but they also have to put up with the leaders of more powerful countries lying to their faces, humiliating them behind their backs, and moving their armies around the chessboard on a whim.\n\nFor the last century, no American political, military, or diplomatic leader has had to play this subordinate role. But President Trump seems determined to give his appointees and the career security establishment a decade\u2019s worth of experience in a week.\n\nOn Thursday, a delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held meetings in Ankara. They had been given contradictory messages about whether Turkish president Recep Erdogan would meet with them \u2013 not something that normally happens to the leaders of the world\u2019s largest economy, greatest military power, and biggest purveyor of weapons.\n\nIndeed, while Erdogan was letting the press know he might not meet with the Americans, his team was also making sure we knew how he had responded to President Trump\u2019s October 9 letter \u2013 a.k.a. the \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d missive. We already knew how Erdogan had responded, of course: he had gone right ahead and done the thing Trump told him not to do, sending troops over the border into Syria and unleashing extremist allies to attack and murder civilians and political leaders in Kurdish-held areas. But just in case we missed the point, Erdogan\u2019s team variously told journalists that he had ignored the letter, ripped it up, or thrown it in the trash.\n\nIn diplomacy weak states get ignored because there is no cost to ignoring them. And in diplomacy \u2013 somewhat like high school \u2013 one is usually advised not to respond to being humiliated from a distance by showing up to receive more punishment in person. But Pence, Pompeo, and their team went to Ankara anyway.\n\nFortunately for the U.S. delegation, Erdogan opted to play nice. He did meet with Pence, for much longer than planned. He let American journalists into a part of the presidential palace journalists never see (the Committee to Protect Journalists calls Turkey the world\u2019s \u201cworst jailer of journalists,\u201d but never mind that). And oh look, Pence and Pompeo said that the goal of their travel to Turkey was to arrange a cease-fire and an end to the Turkish military action, and the Turkish government let them announce just that.\n\nPresident Trump, who earlier this week disparaged the region as one with \u201ca lot of sand\u201d to be fought over, quickly took to the microphone to call the deal \u201camazing\u201d and say that it couldn\u2019t have been achieved without \u201ca little bit of rough love\u201d \u2013 which is an interesting euphemism for a military assault that the United Nations says has displaced more than 100,000 civilians.\n\nBut the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, had the real tough love. \u201cWe will suspend the Peace Spring operation for 120 hours for the PKK/YPG to withdraw,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a cease-fire.\u201d After the United States pressured Kurdish military officials to acquiesce, the head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces offered his own interpretation, saying that the cease-fire applied only to a limited area and not the full northeast Syrian region Turkey wants to wrest from Kurdish control. And by Friday, we had proof that the cease-fire was less than \u201camazing\u201d: while the rest of the border was calm, fighting continued in Ras al-Ayn, a Syrian town at the center of the fight between Turkey and Kurdish forces.\n\nSo, to summarize: the government of Turkey, a NATO ally, had no qualms about sending officials out to make fun of a letter from the president of the United States of America; contradicting the U.S. vice president and secretary of State before they had even left the country; and making clear that they had absolutely no intention of stopping their advance into Syria.\n\nAll of this \u2013 the precipitous American withdrawal, and the indifference with which Kurdish forces who fought alongside U.S. troops and civilians who had sought to build peace have been left to their deaths \u2013 has sparked a remarkable outcry inside the U.S. military. Officials seem to be steadily leaking the contents of conversations with angry and despairing Kurdish leaders. The former head of U.S. Special Operations, Admiral William McRaven, wrote an op-ed flatly calling for a new president.\n\nThis is a still far way off from the sort of military intervention into national politics that tends to happen in weak and unstable societies. But it\u2019s a troubling shift, especially when paired with Republican lawmakers\u2019 apparent disinterest in fully exercising their constitutional right to check the president. While the House passed a bipartisan resolution condemning Trump\u2019s decision pull troops out of Syria on Wednesday, Senate Republicans are still struggling to come up with a unified response. And of course, it remains unlikely that any Senate Republicans will vote to remove Trump if he is impeached.\n\nWhile some Republican leaders are publicly fuming over Trump\u2019s moves in Syria, the incident may ultimately have little effect on his political standing \u2013 which is another marker of a feeble, dysfunctional country. Embarrassments suffered abroad have less impact domestically when you\u2019re used to seeing your leader pushed around by foreign governments.", "description": "The U.S. delegation to Turkey, led by Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo, got to announce a Syria ceasefire \u2013 but only after Ankara gave them a taste of the humiliation and powerlessness that weak nations endure regularly.", "authors": ["Heather Hurlburt"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/17/17-erdogan-pence.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
