You are 22, you have the majority of your life ahead of you.\n\n\"Up to now you have been lacking self-discipline. In the reports I have read again and again you say you never felt you had the support you needed or requested.\n\n\"In the end there is only one person who can help you, and that is you.\"\n\nDrummond, of Worcester, bit the baby and left a bite mark on the infant's left cheek, causing bruising.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe court heard Drummond was \"frustrated\" that the baby would not stop crying while she was at a house in Evesham, Worcs., in May 18 last year.\n\nThere had been significant force in the bite, and Drummond had tried to blame another child for the bite, the court heard.\n\nJohn Brotherton, prosecuting, said: \"The baby's nursery raised concerns regarding the bite mark and the police were informed.\n\n\"On May 22 police had new information and arrive at her home. She broke down, and immediately admitted she had bitten (the child).\"\n\nAbigail Nixon, defending, said: \"There was no breaking of the skin. It faded, it needed no treatment.\n\n\"There is a little physical harm. There was no significant force.\n\n\"It was a momentary lapse in judgment, when she was tired.\n\n\"She is now realistic and knows she is receiving a custodial sentence, which will probably save her life.\"", "description": "Cara Drummond, 22, tried to blame another child for biting the baby in Worcester", "authors": ["Mark Cardwell", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "West Mercia Police", "Swns", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Untitled-design-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
