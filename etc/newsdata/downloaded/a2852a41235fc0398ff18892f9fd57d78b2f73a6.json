The full details of her allegations have not been made public until now.\n\nIn the book, obtained by Variety, Nevils alleges that at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room.\n\nA representative for Lauer did not immediately respond to Variety\u2019s request for comment. NBC News declined to comment.\n\nIn Sochi, Nevils was tasked with working with former \u201cToday\u201d co-anchor Meredith Vieira, who\u2019d been brought back to the show to do Olympics coverage. In her account, one night over drinks with Vieira at the hotel bar where the NBC News team was staying, they ran into Lauer, who joined them. At the end of the night, Nevils, who\u2019d had six shots of vodka, ended up going to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice \u2014 once to retrieve her press credential, which Lauer had taken as a joke, and the second time because he invited her back. Nevils, Farrow writes, \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d\n\nOnce she was in his hotel room, Nevils alleges, Lauer \u2014 who was wearing a T-shirt and boxers \u2014 pushed her against the door and kissed her. He then pushed her onto the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nevils, she \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days,\u201d Farrow writes.\n\nNevils tells Farrow: \u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nBack in New York City, Nevils had more sexual encounters with Lauer. \u201cSources close to Lauer emphasized that she sometimes initiated contact,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cWhat is not in dispute is that Nevils, like several of the women I\u2019d spoken to, had further sexual encounters with the man she said assaulted her. \u2018This is what I blame myself most for,\u2019\u201d she says to Farrow. \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nShe was terrified about the control Lauer had over her career. After her encounters with Lauer ended, Nevils said she told \u201clike a million people\u201d about her situation with Lauer.\n\n\u201cShe told colleagues and superiors at NBC,\u201d Farrow writes. She moved to NBC\u2019s Peacock Productions to be a producer, \u201cand reported it to one of her new bosses there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was no secret,\u201d Farrow writes.\n\nNothing happened until fall 2017, when the post-Harvey Weinstein reckoning led former \u201cToday\u201d colleagues to ask her about Lauer. Nevils told Farrow she then went to Vieira and told her what had happened. A distraught Vieira, according to the book, urged Nevils to go to NBC Universal human resources with a lawyer, which she did. After Lauer\u2019s firing, she learned that Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, and Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, \u201cwere emphasizing that the incident hadn\u2019t been \u2018criminal\u2019 or an \u2018assault\u2019\u201d \u2014 which she claims caused her to throw up, Farrow writes.\n\n\u201cNevils\u2019s work life became torture,\u201d according to Farrow. \u201cShe was made to sit in the same meetings as everyone else, discussing the news, and in all of them colleagues loyal to Lauer cast doubt on the claims, and judgment on her.\u201d\n\nAnd though Nevils had been promised anonymity by human resources, Lack saying internally that the encounter had happened at Sochi limited the possibilities of complainants \u2014 and soon, everyone knew it was Nevils. Though Nevils had not wanted money, she went on medical leave in 2018, and was eventually paid, Farrow writes, \u201cseven figures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe network proposed a script she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue other endeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive example of sexual harassment,\u201d Farrow writes.\n\nThe book also paints NBC News executives as obstructive. As Farrow amassed his reporting about Weinstein, Oppenheim asked him, \u201cLike, is this really worth it?\u201d and suggested no one knows who Weinstein is. Farrow was eventually told to stop reporting the story, because it was under review at NBC Universal. \u201cThis is a Steve Burke decision. It\u2019s an Andy decision,\u201d Farrow recalls Richard Greenberg, the head of NBC News\u2019 investigative unit, telling him. Since he didn\u2019t believe NBC would ever run his story, he took it to the New Yorker, where it was published in October 2017.\n\nSources at NBC News say they haven\u2019t read the book yet, but they plan to defend the company\u2019s decisions against any of Farrow\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d comes out on October 15.\n\nCynthia Littleton and Mackenzie Nichols contributed reporting.", "description": "In Ronan Farrow's new book \"Catch & Kill,\" former NBC News employee Brooke Nevils alleges that Matt Lauer anally raped her.", "authors": ["Kate Aurthur Ramin Setoodeh", "Kate Aurthur", "Ramin Setoodeh"], "top_image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/matt-lauer.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
