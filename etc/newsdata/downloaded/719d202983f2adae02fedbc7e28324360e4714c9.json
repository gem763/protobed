The benchmark palm oil contract for January delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange rose 0.9% to 2,342 ringgit ($559.95) per tonne by midday. \"Palm oil prices are going in the direction of a broader uptrend backed by lower production and expectations of higher biodiesel consumption by B20 in Malaysia and B30 in Indonesia next year,\" said Anilkumar Bagani, research head of Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil broker. Bagani is referring to plans by Malaysia to require fuel to have 20% bio-content in the form of palm oil and Indonesia to require 30%. Malaysia said earlier this week that implementation of the biofuels mandates in Malaysia and Indonesia will increase consumption up to 1.3 million tonnes and 10 million tonnes per year, respectively, adding that the two countries will challenge a European Union law that will limit palm oil use in biofuels. Dalian's January palm oil contract recovered losses to trade 0.2% higher on Thursday, while the January soyoil contract was 0.1% lower. Elsewhere, U.S. soyoil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade traded 0.3% higher on Thursday. Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for share in the global vegetable oils market. Also helping palm oil prices was a trade minister minister saying that Malaysia is in talks with India and other countries to urge them to continue buying Malaysian palm oil, after calls for a boycott of the commodity by Indian traders. But the talks provided little and unsustainable support to palm oil prices, a Kuala Lumpur-based trader told Reuters, \"It's all talk, nothing firm. The issue will phase off quietly unless we see a big drop in imports from India.\" However, capping gains was the ringgit trading 0.1% higher against the dollar on Thursday, making the edible oil more expensive for holders of foreign currencies.
