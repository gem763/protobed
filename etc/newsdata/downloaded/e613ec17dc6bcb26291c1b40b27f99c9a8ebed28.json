Flatiron Health founder Nat Turner and One Medical founder Tom Lee also participated in the round.\n\nParsley was founded in 2016 by Dr. Robin Berzin, who saw that the average American spends around 19 minutes/year with a physician. These visits are usually focused on symptoms, and resolving them, rather than understanding the core reasons why someone is struggling. After all, the CDC says that 70% of diseases in our country are chronic and lifestyle-driven.\n\nParsley Health offers a membership service that allows users to work with doctors to find the root of their issues and create lifestyle changes to resolve them.\n\nThe sign-up process includes a long survey that helps capture all kinds of information about the patient, from family health history to past procedures and lifestyle. The patient then schedules their first visit with a physician, which is meant to last 75 minutes to get the full scope of that patient\u2019s health.\n\nFrom there, users can see into their medical data and doctor\u2019s notes through a web portal. They\u2019re also given a health plan, which includes nutritional advice and access to their own health coach, and may be referred to a specialist, if needed.\n\nOne year of membership includes five annual visits with doctors (approximately 4 hours of doctor-patient time), along with five sessions with their health coach, which help patients stay on their plan with advice on how to get more sleep, eat better, or get more physical exercise.\n\nOn the heels of the new funding, Parsley Health is launching a new telemedicine product, which is meant to give people across the country the same access to Parsley\u2019s service as those who visit their brick-and-mortar locations. This includes diagnostic testing, personalized medical care from doctors who practice functional medicine, health coaching, and 365-days-a-year access to their care team.\n\nThe first diagnostics product is called Comprehensive Hormone Care and is meant to help women dealing with PCOS, PMG, fatigue, weight gain, insomnia and anxiety to learn the root issue and create a care plan. This product will offer the option to get a one-time analysis with a health plan or to join as a full Parsley Health member and get coaching, re-testing and progress tracking.\n\nTo start, the telemedicine products will only be available in New York and California, but the company has plans to expand this product to all fifty states in the next six months.", "description": "Parsley Health, the NY-based service that focuses on the source of a medical issue rather than the symptoms, has today announced the close of a $26 million Series B round of funding led by White Star Capital, with participation from FirstMark Capital, Amplo, Alpha Edison, Arkitekt Ventures and Galaxy Digital.
