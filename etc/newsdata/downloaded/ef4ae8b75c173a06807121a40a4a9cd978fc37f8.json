However, dealers so far appear to be hoarding the Fed\u2019s injections of liquidity to stay in line with their regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more repo market players that need to access that liquidity,\u201d said Aaron Stearns, co-head of AVM Solutions, a repo trader, in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nStearns said that during September\u2019s repo auctions he paid an additional 30 to 40 basis points to tap the market on behalf of his hedge fund clients above the rate that the Fed lent funds through its repo operations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that the reserves transmission mechanism isn\u2019t working,\u201d said Stearns.\n\nStill, Powell this week gave investors a shot of confidence when he outlined the Fed\u2019s short-term Treasury debt purchase plan and underscored that the central bank remains willing to act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to support economic growth.\n\nU.S. stocks also got a boost on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% adding 319.92 points to close at 26,816.59 after President Trump said the U.S. and China had agreed to the first phase of a trade deal. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +3.55% climbed to a three-week high of 1.748%.\n\nAnd while the Fed has been clear that it doesn\u2019t consider its new short-term Treasury purchase plan to be another round of \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d the program is designed to bolster lending in markets and is expected to grow the central bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line today is that the Fed doesn\u2019t want liquidity to be an issue,\u201d said Will Smith, a high-yield portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, in an interview.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, this isn\u2019t as impactful as if the Fed were buying 10-year or 30-year bonds as it previously had done. But it does keep liquidity in the system and shows the Fed wants credit conditions to remain pretty fluid.\u201d", "description": "Investors see the new Fed plan to resume short-dated Treasury debt purchases as a sign of the central bank\u2019s willingness to stand ready to prop up broader...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh", "Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT179_Dollar_ZG_20191011150158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
