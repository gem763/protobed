Congressional Democrats have also been investigating military stays at the property, but have yet to receive any information from the Pentagon.\n\nThe figure does not indicate how many of the stays have occurred since Trump became president. But the Air Force has significantly ramped up its overnight stops in Scotland under Trump after signing a contract with the Prestwick Airport \u2014 situated 20-plus miles from Turnberry \u2014 in the waning months of the Obama administration. Since 2015, the service has lodged crews in the area 659 times, meaning up to 6 percent of those stays were at Turnberry.\n\nThe figure also does not account for the total number of people the Air Force has put up at Trump Turnberry during those roughly 40 stays. POLITICO previously reported that Air Force crews of five to nearly 40 people have lodged at Trump's waterside property over at least four stays since September 2018.\n\nThe Air Force has said the refueling stops at Prestwick \u2014 and all related overnight stays \u2014 are well within Pentagon guidelines. Prestwick frequently books the Air Force crews\u2019 lodging at Turnberry, the airport acknowledged in a statement, and often arranges for their transportation to and from the resort. Officials have also said the Turnberry bookings fall within acceptable rates for military travel, as military members are charged a government rate as low as $130 per night.\n\nBut the Air Force did concede that the appearance of staying at the president\u2019s posh property might create a negative perception, and it has launched an internal review that will assess the \u201cguidance associated with the use of civil airports and lodging selection for aircrew at en route locations,\u201d according to a memo issued Monday.\n\nStill, the issue is the latest example of the intersection of Trump\u2019s business interests and what used to be unremarkable government policies.\n\nAir Force crews have been lodging at Turnberry because of the increasing importance of Prestwick Airport for refueling military aircraft. In 2015, the Air Force made 95 stops there, lodging in the area 40 times. But through August of this year, the Air Force had made 259 stops at Prestwick, staying overnight nearby 220 times.\n\nThe roughly 40 stays at Turnberry are likely to raise eyebrows among congressional Democrats, who have said the practice raises conflict-of-interest concerns and might violate the Constitution's domestic emoluments clause, which prohibits the president from receiving money from the federal government other than his salary.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has been investigating U.S. military expenditures at and around Turnberry since the spring, and has threatened to subpoena officials in an attempt to get more information from the Pentagon.\n\nStays at Turnberry have occurred as recently as late June of this year, when a bus carrying an air crew en route to Iraq arrived at Turnberry, according to a person who was there and an Instagram post by an Air Force crew member.\n\nRalph Porciani, the general manager at Trump Turnberry, declined to tell POLITICO on Wednesday how many service members have stayed at the resort in recent years, claiming that the staff doesn\u2019t ask its guests \u201cwhat they do for a living.\u201d The vast majority of the crews lodging at Turnberry show up in uniform, however, crew members told POLITICO. Porciani added that reporters should stop trying to \u201cdig up dirt\u201d on Turnberry, which was \u201con its knees\u201d before Trump and his family bought it in 2014.\n\nOn Monday, lawmakers resumed a push for the Senate to adopt an amendment that would bar the Pentagon from spending money at nearly five dozen Trump properties worldwide. The House passed the clause in July as part of the broader annual defense policy bill, but it has not yet been adopted into law.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has claimed no knowledge of the stays.\n\n\"I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!),\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cNOTHING TO DO WITH ME.\u201d", "description": "The tally represents the preliminary results of an Air Force review launched after POLITICO reported that an Air National Guard crew had stayed at Turnberry.", "authors": ["Bryan Bender", "Natasha Bertrand", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-998399874-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
