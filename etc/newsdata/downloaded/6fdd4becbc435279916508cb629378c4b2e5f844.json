If Republicans don\u2019t step up, they will be, too.", "language": "en", "text": "These are gross abuses of Mr. Trump\u2019s oath of office. If they are allowed to stand, they will open the way for more offenses in the coming year \u2014 including more appeals for foreign intervention in the 2020 election \u2014 and they will establish new baselines for future presidents. So congressional Republicans, as well as Democrats, have reason to act forcefully to check Mr. Trump.\n\nSo far, they are not stepping up to their responsibility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA handful of Republican senators have objected to Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden. Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has done so unequivocally. Sens. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Susan Collins (Maine) have criticized his public appeal to China but have said nothing about Ukraine, where the president\u2019s aides conducted a weeks-long effort to extract a commitment from the new president to investigate a gas company that employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son. Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio) called Mr. Trump\u2019s actions \u201cnot appropriate\u201d but criticized House Democrats for having \u201crushed\u201d to an impeachment investigation.\n\nAnd Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) has criticized Mr. Trump on Ukraine but offered shifting responses on China. First, he said he thought Trump\u2019s appeals weren\u2019t serious. Then he tweeted that \u201cPOTUS asking #China to investigate Biden is wrong, but it isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to explain what makes him so sure of that: After all, Mr. Trump has suggested he might raise his request directly with President Xi Jinping, who is seeking leverage over the White House in a trade war.\n\nWe\u2019d like to think congressional Republicans would want to learn what, exactly, Mr. Trump did to pressure the Ukrainian government \u2014 including whether he withheld vital U.S. military aid that those Republicans overwhelming voted for. The ambassador Mr. Trump appointed to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, likely knows the answer to that question, judging from texts with fellow diplomats that have already been disclosed. But the State Department, apparently acting on Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes, blocked the ambassador from appearing before three House committees on Tuesday. State is also holding on to texts and other documents delivered by Mr. Sondland.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Trump offered no explanation for squelching the ambassador\u2019s testimony, other than that the House investigation was a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d A White House letter to Congress cited the House\u2019s failure to hold a formal vote opening its impeachment inquiry. By that standard, any president could henceforth prevent his staff from cooperating with any congressional investigation. Is that the precedent Republicans would set?\n\nThe White House\u2019s stonewalling strongly suggests that Mr. Sondland possesses important information about the Ukraine affair. So do other State Department witnesses, including former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and the current U.S. charge d\u2019affaires in Kiev, William Taylor. Republicans ought to join with Democrats in insisting that the diplomats be allowed to testify to Congress \u2014 and Republicans should also make clear to Mr. Trump that his solicitations of foreign governments are unacceptable. Any other course is a betrayal of their own oaths.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Will congressional Republicans let the president vastly expand presidential powers?", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tPZ9-ZpH-0NT5YBavmPRcjHXfmk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S3GAGUXJLEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
