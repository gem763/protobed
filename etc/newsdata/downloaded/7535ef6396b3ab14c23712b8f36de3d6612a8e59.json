So wrote Charlotte Nokes while she was a prisoner at HMP Peterborough. She was originally sentenced to a minimum term of 15 months, but by the time she was found dead in her cell on 23 July 2016, she had served more than eight and a half years.\n\nCharlotte had been given an indefinite \u2013 and since abolished \u2013 imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence, one of the most controversial punishments in British justice history. She believed she would never be released, and told her family multiple times that the IPP was her death sentence. She was the first woman under an IPP sentence to die in prison.\n\nIn the months leading up to her death, Charlotte was receiving heavy doses of medication to treat her mental and physical health diagnoses of borderline personality disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (a severe form of premenstrual syndrome). She appeared heavily sedated and could barely talk. But the day before she died, her family say, she was thrilled to have been notified by the Home Office that she would be moved from prison to a therapeutic psychiatric unit as her parole board had recommended. She was still on suicide watch, and was supposed to be checked on twice an hour, but by the time she was pronounced dead at 8:55am the next morning, her body was cold. There was no evidence of suicide.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe inquest into her death began last Monday in Huntingdon Town Hall, and a jury conclusion was expected on Friday. The family hoped to finally have answers as to how Charlotte died, and had secured an expert psychiatric report that examined the impact of the medication Charlotte was prescribed. But the inquest was adjourned until February 2020, because the NHS Trust asked for this evidence to be excluded from the inquest \u2013 the coroner denied this request but gave it time to produce their own report. Charlotte\u2019s mother, Sue Anderson, tells The Independent that when the inquest was delayed, she couldn\u2019t stop crying.\n\n\u201cTo me, it feels more like a trial than an inquest,\u201d she says. Steve Nokes, Charlotte\u2019s father, says: \u201cIt almost seems like a little game of attrition on their behalf.\u201d\n\nCharlotte\u2019s legal team told The Independent the family received some legal aid for representation at the inquest, but were forced to crowdfund the preparation costs, including for the expert report. HMP Peterborough, a private prison run by multimillion-pound company Sodexo, and the Cambridge and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust can afford their own team of lawyers and expert medical reports, while the family will also struggle to pay for the additional work and expenses caused by adjourning the inquest. A major issue in the case is who had overall duty of care: the NHS trust was responsible for her mental health and wellbeing, while the prison and Sodexo were responsible for physical care. In Charlotte\u2019s case, her treatment fell under both remits.\n\nCharlotte Nokes, known as Charlie or Lottie to friends and family, grew up on Hayling Island, off the coast of Portsmouth. The middle child of three, she was clever, funny and creative. Her father describes her as an outgoing child, \u201cvery different in lots of ways, always joking around, laughing, a bit of a tomboy\u201d. They used to clean the car, fish, go cycling, and spend a lot of time together.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Charlotte Nokes artwork Show all 18 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Her parents split up when she was 14, around the time she gave up playing football and judo. As a gay girl in a small town, her mother says, she would get beaten up just walking down the road, and began to carry a knife. By the time she moved to Portsmouth at 18, she was addicted to alcohol, heroin and crack cocaine. She began stealing to fund her addiction and racked up more than 50 convictions for petty offences like drug possession and shoplifting. On 27 October 2007, she was begging for money to buy drugs, and when a woman refused, she threatened her with a knife. In January 2008 she was convicted of street robbery and given an IPP sentence, thanks to her spate of prior convictions, with a minimum tariff of 15 months. It was her 30th birthday.\n\nI don\u2019t think you realise how bad this sentence is. I could be in prison for the rest of my life. It\u2019s probably worse than life imprisonment, in the fact that I\u2019ve got no end to it. I could well die in here Charlotte Nokes\n\nIPPs are, in essence, prison sentences without a limit. Created by the Criminal Justice Act of 2003 and put into practice in April 2005 under then home secretary David Blunkett, they were designed to protect the public from dangerous criminals like sex offenders, even if their crimes had not earnt a life sentence. The intention was to use IPP sentences sparingly; the Home Office estimated that they would be used on 900 offenders. But the option was pushed politically, and judges ended up handing them down at a rate of more than 800 offenders per year, some for relatively minor offences.\n\nThe offender gets a minimum term, known as a tariff, which they must spend in prison. After that, they can apply to the Parole Board each year for release, but will be set free only if they can prove they are no longer a danger to the public. To do this, they must complete a range of courses or rehabilitative programmes, which are often difficult, or even impossible, to access. Failure to attend, however, could ruin a chance at parole, and prisoners would have to wait another year for a chance again. IPP prisoners also almost invariably serve more than their tariff \u2013 many, like in Charlotte\u2019s case, significantly more. The difference between tariffs and time served is often striking.\n\nNick Hardwick, who was chair of the Parole Board at the time, says that there is a fundamental problem with IPP sentences: they keep people in prison for something they might do in future, rather than what they have done in the past. \u201cThe onus falls on the IPP prisoner to demonstrate that they are not a risk, rather than on the state to demonstrate that they are,\u201d he says.\n\nThe situation leads to inconsistent sentencing, confusion on behalf of the families of offenders and hopelessness among the inmates. According to Prison Reform Trust figures from 2017, IPP prisoners are among those with the highest rates of suicide and self-harm, almost twice as high as those serving determined sentences. In 2017, David Blunkett told the New Statesman: \u201cI am to blame for IPP, and we would do it differently now.\u201d\n\nDeborah Coles, the executive director of Inquest, the charity that specialises in deaths in custody and is supporting the Nokes family, told The Independent: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about the cruelty and inhumanity of the IPP sentence in the sense of a complete lack of hope, despair, and being locked into a process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult to imagine just how much that impacts on your mental health.\u201d\n\n2,315 IPP prisoners are still in custody\n\nShe also describes the \u201cpsychological torture\u201d felt by families who don\u2019t know when, if ever, their loved ones will be released. \u201cThe detrimental harms of these sentences are well known, which is why it\u2019s so outrageous.\u201d\n\nCharlotte\u2019s father Steve says that he didn\u2019t understand the IPP sentence properly at first, and remembers Charlotte saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think you realise how bad this sentence is. I could be in prison for the rest of my life. It\u2019s probably worse than life imprisonment, in the fact that I\u2019ve got no end to it. I could well die in here.\u201d\n\nIf they are released, IPP prisoners are put on supervised licence for at least 10 years, often for the rest of their life. Which means that, unless they successfully navigate a labyrinth of bureaucratic procedure, administrative hoop-jumping and probation demands, they can be sent back to prison any time. Steve says that the knowledge of being on licence for the rest of her life was \u201cforever hanging over\u201d Charlotte. \u201cI don\u2019t think it ever went away,\u201d he says.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s mother calls it a vicious circle. \u201cIt was just hopeless for her, because she wasn\u2019t getting out, and because of her mental health problems she was misbehaving. There was no way in the situation she was in that she was ever going to get out, ever.\u201d\n\nHardwick, now professor of criminal justice at Royal Holloway, explains that while some IPP prisoners were recalled because of credible evidence that they posed a serious risk, others had broken only a minor licence condition that didn\u2019t have much to do with future offending. \u201cThe barrier to being recalled is too low,\u201d he says. In 2016-17, 760 IPP inmates were recalled, up 22 per cent from the year before.\n\nAndrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, a criminal justice charity that campaigns on prison probations, has campaigned on the \u201cinjustice\u201d of the IPP sentence for many years, and explains that the legislation and guidance around IPP sentences wasn\u2019t crafted sufficiently. \u201cThe courts were asked to judge whether the defendant was dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cA huge swathe of people fell within that definition.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about the cruelty and inhumanity of the IPP sentence in the sense of a complete lack of hope, despair, and being locked into a process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult to imagine just how much that impacts on your mental health Deborah Coles, executive director, Inquest\n\nIn 2007, the High Court ruled that the sentences amounted to a \u201cgeneral and systemic legal failure\u201d. Overcrowding and lack of funding were pushing prisons to crisis point, and by 2010, there were approximately 10,000 IPP prisoners in the system. When the European Court ruled that they were in violation of human rights, IPP sentences were abolished in 2012 by the coalition government \u2013 but not retrospectively. That meant that thousands of IPP prisoners, like Charlotte, were left in jail without a release date in sight.\n\nA joint HMPPS and Parole Board action plan is in place to try to help IPP prisoners to leave, and there are progression regimes at four state prisons across the country, but not for private prisons, like the one Charlotte died in.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson told The Independent that as of June this year, there are 2,315 IPP prisoners still in custody, and 1,114 who have been released and recalled. That makes a total of 3,429 inmates without a definite release date: 70 are women. The cost to the taxpayer is measurable; the cost to the mental wellbeing of the prisoners is not.\n\nNeilson describes a \u201cChris Grayling\u201d era of staff cuts that have pushed the prison system to breaking point in the past five years, leading to unprecedented levels of violence. He also reiterates that the Howard League is opposed to privately run prisons. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that punishing people should be something shareholders can make a profit out of.\u201d Although, he says, \u201cwomen die in both private and public prisons, I\u2019m sad to say\u201d.\n\nThe year Charlotte died, the number of deaths in women\u2019s prisons reached a record high. She was one of 22, and one of three whose cause of death is yet to be determined.\n\nAfter a similar spike in 2006, when six women died at Styal prison in a 13-month period, Baroness Jean Corston was asked to review the issue of women in the criminal justice system. The seminal Corston report, published in 2007, found that the vast majority of women sentenced to prison were there for non-violent offences, and were often among the most disadvantaged in society: poor, homeless, addicted, or victims of abuse and trauma.\n\nColes, who was on the review team, says the report showed how prison had become a kind of \u201cdumping ground for women who could, and should, have been better served in the community, because a lot of those deaths raised concerns about how women were self-medicating for traumatic life experiences, particularly abuse\u201d.\n\nIt recommended that the female prison population be dramatically reduced, and that inmates should be held in small, locally run units or therapeutic facilities. The report received widespread support across the political parties, but most of the recommendations have not been put into practice. Austerity measures, like cuts to legal aid and housing benefits, disproportionately impacted women, while more than half of female prisoners have dependent children and are incarcerated hundreds of miles from their families due to a dearth of women\u2019s prisons. According to Coles: \u201cThe shocking reality is that there\u2019s always a place for a woman in prison, but there are not enough places in a woman\u2019s refuge or drug and alcohol residential service \u2013 but we continue to lock women up.\u201d\n\nHolloway Prison in London, which once housed Myra Hindley and Rose West, was closed in 2016, but the money saved was not invested in the sort of community provision that the Corston report envisaged, such as women\u2019s centres and social housing. \u201cIt was an incredible opportunity to do something with that money,\u201d says Coles, \u201cbut all those women got shipped out to other prisons which has had serious consequences for the ones from London in terms of access to their families and support networks.\u201d\n\nInquest released a report on women\u2019s prisons in May 2018, called \u201cStill Dying on the Inside\u201d. From March 2007 to March 2018, 93 women died in female facilities, it concluded, and seven transgender women died in men\u2019s prisons. Thirty-seven deaths were self-inflicted. The front of the report is decorated with Charlotte\u2019s artwork \u201cPerception\u201d.\n\nIn prison, Charlotte had developed into a talented artist, supported by charities such as the Michael Varah Memorial Fund and Women in Prison, and painted murals on her cell walls. She was even allowed to decorate other women\u2019s cells. Her work was exhibited by the Koestler Trust, a charity that helps people in detention express themselves. She won several prizes, entering each year from the four different facilities where she was incarcerated. Charlotte had even been offered a scholarship to Central St Martins art school, to be taken up upon her release.\n\nFiona Curran, director of the arts at Koestler, says that Charlotte\u2019s work showed \u201can honesty and vulnerability that our awards judges and exhibition curators really responded to\u201d.\n\nIn Charlotte\u2019s notes accompanying her submissions, she wrote: \u201cI eat, breathe, live, consume art. I can\u2019t imagine my life without art in it. (I don\u2019t know how I have managed without it in my life previously) ... It has completely changed my life, and my perception of life, and given me something worth living for and working towards getting out (as I am an IPP).\u201d\n\nCharlotte suffered from significant mental illnesses and was on an ACCT care plan, the process in which prisons monitor inmates who they consider to be at risk of suicide or self-harm. She wrote: \u201cI draw within the confines of the cell, or my mind. My cell comforts and keeps me safe and when I am painting I am completely free. I would be a broken woman without this.\u201d\n\nBut 18 months before her death, the parole board recommended that she be moved to a secure psychiatric unit, which made her hopeful. Her mother says that the day before Charlotte died, she phoned to say that she was to be moved to a secure unit, and \u201csounded very cheerful about the whole thing. She would have received the right treatment in there, she wouldn\u2019t have been given medication to shut her up\u201d.\n\nBut Charlotte was never moved. When Sue got the phone call from the prison chaplain, her first instinct was that it must have been suicide. \u201cI never thought she would have just died of natural causes, just gone to sleep and died,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to die. She was more worried about us dying and not being there for us. It turned out to be the other way around.\u201d\n\nGender inequality in prison The Corston Report, published in 2007 to reform the ways women were looked after in prison, found: - 30 per cent of women lose their accommodation while in prison - Prison is disproportionately harsher for women because prisons and the practices within them have for the most part been designed for men - Self-harm in prison is a huge problem and is more prevalent in the women\u2019s estate - Women prisoners are far more likely than men to be primary carers of young children and this factor makes the prison experience significantly different for women than men - Women with histories of violence and abuse are over-represented in the criminal justice system and can be described as victims as well as offenders - Drug addiction plays a huge part in all offending and is disproportionately the case with women - Outside prison, men are more likely to commit suicide than women but this is reversed inside - There were 11 deaths in women\u2019s prisons in 2007, an increase from eight the previous year\n\nAccording to the Prison Reform Trust, more than twice as many women attempt suicide in prison as men, despite only making up 5 per cent of the prison population. Neilson says that, due to women\u2019s vulnerabilities and concerns around childcare, as well as higher rates of mental health problems and addiction, prison is a \u201cparticularly punitive setting to be placed into\u201d, which is why he suspects self-harm rates are as high as they are. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of how poorly women react to prison, which is something that, in the end, was really designed with men in mind,\u201d he says.\n\nAs of November 2018, there were 3,807 female prisoners in England and Wales. The Griffins Society published a report this year specifically about women serving IPP sentences, written by Sarah Smart, a fellow of the Women in Prison charity. Each of the nine women she spoke to had served at least twice her tariff, with one serving 11 times more. None of them had fully understood IPP sentences when they were first given them, and all were angry that despite the sentences being abolished, they were still incarcerated. Six out of nine of them had attempted suicide. The report was titled \u201cToo Many Bends in the Tunnel\u201d.\n\nClaire Cain, campaigns manager at Women in Prison and colleague of Smart, explains that the feelings of hopelessness specific to IPP sentences compound the issues that female prisoners already faced \u2013 mental ill-health, previous trauma and abuse \u2013 to create a situation where female IPP prisoners were doubly impacted. \u201cIt\u2019s a catch-22,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hopelessness adds to your mental ill-health, your behaviour declines, and you\u2019re moving further and further away from being paroled.\n\n\u201cThere is such a lack of trust of women in prison for everyone, through their experience of the state and the system, and recall is absolutely devastating; when you\u2019ve been in prison for a long time you might experience being institutionalised, and if the support is not there for people on release then they just breach their licence and end up back in prison not even for breaking the law.\u201d\n\nCharlotte\u2019s father says that he believes Charlotte did not trust the system to look after her, and that he thought she was beginning to become institutionalised. \u201cI think she thought, \u2018if I\u2019m never going to get anywhere, if there\u2019s no light at the end of the tunnel, what\u2019s the use of being good?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut worsening prison conditions mean that suicide and self-harm in the male prison population are now also dramatically on the rise, especially among the IPP population. Donna Mooney is the sister of Tommy Nicol, who was sentenced to an IPP in 2009. She campaigns with multiple families of prisoners serving IPP sentences, and voiced her concerns to The Independent about the lack of mental health resources specifically for IPP prisoners.\n\nTommy was given a minimum tariff of four years, and served six. During that time, Mooney says, he tried to access the therapeutic courses right from the start, but there was \u201cbarrier after barrier\u201d: a Kafkaesque nightmare in which Tommy put in applications that were shut down, or was moved prisons, or the system had an administrative error, or he was not told for more than a year that his application did not have enough information. \u201cHe was trying his best, he\u2019d not got into any trouble, he was well behaved, he tried to get the rehab, but when he got another knock from the parole board he was put into segregation and just couldn\u2019t cope.\u201d\n\nThere is such a lack of trust of women in prison for everyone, through their experience of the state and the system, and recall is absolutely devastating; when you\u2019ve been in prison for a long time you might experience being institutionalised, and if the support is not there for people on release then they just breach their licence and end up back in prison not even for breaking the law\n\nMooney describes how his mental health deteriorated, and when he was sent to The Mount prison in 2015, he had a psychotic episode. He was cutting himself, sitting in a circle of blood, chanting and talking to the walls. He was moved to an unfurnished cell, with just a mattress on a floor and a pot for a toilet. His mental health team tried to see him during this time, but they were denied access on a Friday and nobody was available on the weekend. On the Monday, the prison guards deemed him too dangerous for visitors, even through a screen. Tommy hanged himself a few hours later. He was 31.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to change IPP sentences retrospectively,\u201d Mooney says, \u201cyou need to ensure you\u2019re providing the mental health resources \u2013 particularly for people who are over tariff, and I know that still isn\u2019t happening despite what the MoJ says. The deaths are still happening, the suicides in the IPP population are increasing, a lot of the prison officers have left because of budget cuts or are less experienced than they used to be.\u201d\n\nShe says that, because of the possibility of an upcoming election, she does not believe anyone who wants to be re-elected will go on record and say that the IPP population should be released, given the Conservative \u201ctough on crime\u201d stance. Public awareness is low or perception is poor, and people \u201cmight not be aware of the injustice of it\u201d. She adds: \u201cThe referendum definitely diverted the government\u2019s attention away from this issue, and alongside many others it\u2019s gone to the bottom of the pile.\u201d\n\nCain, too, blames the \u201cchurn\u201d in ministers and secretaries of state since the 2016 referendum vote. \u201cWe go on a journey of educating and supporting ministers to find out what\u2019s going on on the ground, but that takes time, and then they resign over Brexit and we get a new one in.\u201d\n\nEven in the midst of negotiations, the government managed to publish the Female Offender Strategy last year, aiming to drastically reduce the women\u2019s prison population. But Hardwick agrees with Coles: \u201cThe distractions of Brexit have taken attention away from dealing with the recommendations I made. What\u2019s needed is legislative and policy changes, and at the moment it\u2019s very difficult to get politicians to focus on anything apart from Brexit.\u201d\n\nRobert Buckland, the justice secretary, Rory Stewart, the former prisons minister, and Lucy Frazer, the current prisons minister, were all approached for comment for this article.\n\nColes describes a \u201ckind of inertia\u201d, saying: \u201cYou get this well-worn mantra that lessons will be learned, but they\u2019re extremely empty words when you see the same issues being repeated time and time again at the inquests of deaths of other women in prison. Change requires political will, and in sentencing policy: that prison should absolutely be a place of last resort.\u201d\n\nCharlotte, she explains, is a clear example: \u201cPrison was the wrong kind of environment for a woman like her, who needed a therapeutic setting. That\u2019s where she should have been. She should never have been in there. The fact that her family are now having to crowdfund to find out how she was able to die in a place where she should have been safe \u2013 an extremely vulnerable woman who died where they owed her a duty of care \u2013 is absolutely outrageous.\u201d\n\nAn MoJ spokesperson explained that, while they cannot comment on individual cases or say anything that might prejudice an ongoing inquest, a joint action plan between HMPPS and the parole board was brought in after Charlotte\u2019s death to help prisoners progress towards release. Four prisons are dedicated to helping IPP prisoners prove themselves safe to the public \u2013 but these are state prisons, rather than private.\n\nThey added: \u201cLegal aid is available at inquests in exceptional circumstances with more than half of applications approved. We are reviewing the legal aid means testing thresholds to ensure that those who need legal aid are able to access it in the future.\u201d\n\nAs to what he hopes for from the inquest, Charlotte\u2019s father says: \u201cAll I want is an answer to how she died. On her death certificate \u2013 we\u2019ve got a temporary one so we were able to have a burial ceremony \u2013 it doesn\u2019t say. I\u2019d like to know if anybody was to blame.\u201d\n\nCharlotte is buried at the sustainability site at East Meon in the South Downs, looking towards Hayling Island. Sunflowers were laid on her grave. Her father said: \u201cI thought the sunflowers seemed very apt, because Lottie was a true artist.\u201d", "description": "Life is fleeting, life is precious, and I have wasted too much time in oblivion.\u00a0So wrote Charlotte Nokes while she was a prisoner at HMP Peterborough.
