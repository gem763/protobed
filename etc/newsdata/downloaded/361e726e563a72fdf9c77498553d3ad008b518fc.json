Giuliani took to Twitter Friday to explain his rationale for traveling to Ukraine to push for investigations that could benefit Trump politically. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nRudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official\u2019s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night.\n\nImmediately after anchor Chris Cuomo introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m on tonight because what you just said is totally erroneous,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cEvery single thing you just said is completely spun in the same direction you\u2019ve been doing for two years!\u201d\n\n.@ChrisCuomo: \"So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\"@RudyGiuliani: \"Of course I did\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's attorney says he had spoken with a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son. pic.twitter.com/FTaLGBV1zO \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 20, 2019\n\nGiuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was on the board. World leaders, including the United States, reportedly wanted the prosecutor gone because he was ineffective at rooting out corruption. Biden threatened to withhold loan money from the country over it. There\u2019s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.\n\nGiuliani then appeared to contradict himself over whether he asked Ukraine officials to specifically investigate the former vice president, who is a top-polling 2020 Democratic candidate for president.\n\n\u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t. I asked Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\n\u201cYour never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and the prosecutor?\u201d Cuomo asked again.\n\nGiuliani said the \u201conly thing\u201d he asked was how the prosecutor got dismissed.\n\n\u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\n\u201cYou just said you didn\u2019t!\u201d Cuomo said.\n\nGiuliani then tried to distinguish between asking Ukraine about Biden and asking about \u201callegations related to my client which tangentially are related to Joe Biden and a massive bribery scheme.\u201d\n\nAs the two men verbally sparred, Giuliani said, \u201cIt\u2019s sad to watch what happened to you. It\u2019s sad. You\u2019re a sellout.\u201d To which Cuomo asked incredulously, \u201cI\u2019m a sellout You are telling me that I\u2019m the sellout?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, for whom my whole lifetime stood up for one single ideal, character counts in leadership,\" Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cI am standing up for justice,\u201d Giuliani yelled over Cuomo. \u201cYou want to cover some ridiculous charge that I urged the Ukrainian government to investigate corruption. Well I did! And I\u2019m proud of it!\u201d\n\nLater, Cuomo told Giuliani: \u201cThis President got the benefit of something you built up for decades \u2014 your credibility.\u201d\n\nWhen Cuomo directed the conversation back to Trump, Giuliani tried to discredit the whistleblower, saying without any evidence, that the person \u201ccould be a Democrat holdover trying to destroy Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHe offered a line of defense if Trump did offer aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country investigating Clinton and Biden, claiming it would be \u201cperfectly appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality is the president of the United States has every right to say to another leader of a foreign country, \u2018you got to straighten up before we give you a lot of money\u2019,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt is perfectly appropriate for (Trump) to ask a foreign government to investigate this massive crime that was made by a former vice president.\u201d\n\nAfter the interview, Giuliani doubled down on that defense in a tweet.", "description": "", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Wt2aqlPmkom2slq7zcggEMwHCfU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PBVFD5DTUUI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
