However, there\u2019s widespread reporting that Trump made the move without consulting key stakeholders.\n\nThe Kurdish forces are guarding camps that hold thousands of suspected ISIS fighters and have warned that they\u2019ll have to move forces away from them to counter a Turkish military offensive.\n\n\"If Turkey does undertake this operation, it will be responsible for maintaining the captivity of those fighters,\" the official said, adding that Turkey will bear \"full responsibility\" if ISIS rebounds in the area.\n\nWhat to watch: The official said this was \u201cnot the beginning of a formal pullout of Syria,\u201d but added that both Trump and the American people \u201cwant our troops home as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nGo deeper: Top Kurdish commander says Trump's Syria move puts victories over ISIS at risk", "description": "A U.S. official also stressed that Turkey would bear all responsibility for an ISIS resurgence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/5Mql7Bi33pvH9I1QGQzPdl7w1SA=/0x593:5416x3640/1920x1080/2019/10/07/1570485548234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
