Trump has shown restraint in the crisis, holding back from military retaliation despite pressure from conservative hawks, at least for now.\n\nBut he promised to keep trying to squeeze Iran\u2019s economy with sanctions until Tehran agrees to give up what Washington says is a pursuit of nuclear weapons. Iran has said its nuclear program has always been for peaceful purposes only.\n\n\u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s blood lust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behaviour continues sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump had a stern message for China and its president, Xi Jinping, with whom he is locked in a trade war that is damaging both their economies. He said the world is watching how Beijing handles mass demonstrations in Hong Kong that have raised concerns about a potential Chinese crackdown.\n\n\u201cHow China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the word in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nTrump has sought to pressure China to agree to reduce trade barriers through a policy of increasing tariffs on Chinese products.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial to both countries. But as I have made clear I will not accept a bad deal for the American people,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump was tough on Iran and its leadership, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York for U.N. activities amid speculation about whether they might meet to discuss their differences.\n\nRouhani was at his New York hotel, not in the U.N. chamber, during Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nIn remarks to media on Tuesday Rouhani said he was open to discuss small changes, additions or amendments to a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers if the United States lifted sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, trying to create conditions for talks between the United States and Iran, said he hoped there could be progress on Iran on Tuesday after he held talks with Rouhani on Monday.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cWe have to get back around the table to have a frank and demanding discussion on the nuclear activity, Iran\u2019s regional activities, the ballistic missile program, but also to have a larger approach on what sanctions are,\u201d Macron told reporters, without elaborating. \u201cI hope we will be able to make progress in the coming hours.\u201d\n\nTehran has been widely blamed for the attacks in Saudi Arabia but it denies involvement. Over the past week, Trump has tightened economic sanctions on Iran and ordered more U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a show of support for those U.S. allies in the tense region.\n\n\u201cAfter four decades of failure it is time for Iran\u2019s leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries and focus on building up their own country,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cAmerica is ready to embrace friendship to all who genuinely seek peace and respect,\u201d he said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday denounced Iran's \"blood lust\" and called on other nations to join the United States to pressure Iran after attacks on Saudi oil facilities but said there is a path to peace.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433398066&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1JN", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
