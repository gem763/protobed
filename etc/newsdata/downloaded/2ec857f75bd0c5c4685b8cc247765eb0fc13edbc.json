By that unconventional research method, or her usual level of rigorous committee prep, the congresswoman grilled Zuckerberg on his platform\u2019s weak fact standards \u2014 specifically, allowing the Daily Caller, a site with ties to white nationalists, to serve as an independent fact-checker on the site.\n\n.@AOC asks Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg about the company's use of the Daily Caller as a fact checker, despite repeated, documented instances of the Daily Caller publishing the work of white nationalists. pic.twitter.com/3tjeRSf72n \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 23, 2019\n\nThe question \u2014 a subtle reminder that the gap between right-wing extremism and mainstream conservatism is not always that wide \u2014 led to a follow-up that put Zuckerberg further in a bind. Choosing an example for the inadequate political fact-checking standards, she asked if it would be possible for her to run primary ads against Republicans, claiming that they voted for the Green New Deal: \u201cIf you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here.\u201d\n\n.@AOC asks Mark Zuckerberg if he would allow her to run Facebook ads saying Republicans supported the Green New Deal. He says he doesn't know. Zuckerberg: \"I think lying is bad\" but then he claims that it's not Facebook's role to take down lies in political ads. pic.twitter.com/0enfceX14R \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 23, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez also criticized Zuckerberg \u2014 who appeared before the Financial Services Committee to answer questions related to the new cryptocurrency Libra \u2014 for Facebook\u2019s lack of political fact standards at Bernie Sanders\u2019s Queens rally on Saturday. Responding to Zuckerberg\u2019s October 17 speech at Georgetown University in which he defended Facebook\u2019s permissive political fact-checking, she said:\u201cThe future, and our future, is in public systems, and it\u2019s in publicly owned systems, because we need to take power over our lives again. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Mark Zuckerberg making decisions over my life.\u201d", "description": "Before the Financial Services Committee, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Mark Zuckerberg about Facebook\u2019s political fact-checking standards, asking if she could run an ad claiming a Republican supported the Green New Deal.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/23/23-aoc-zuckerberg.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
