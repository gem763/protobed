We know what to expect and we won\u2019t be surprised on Sunday.\u201d\n\nDespite his callow age and only 11 caps, Ntamack has already earned a reputation within the squad as a leader, according to teammate Yoann Huget. \u201cA kid who has such control of a group at that age is rare. His age belies his skills,\u201d said Huget.\n\nIn contrast, 30-year-old Biggar has already proved he can deliver on the biggest stage, scoring most of Wales\u2019s 28 points in the pool clash with England in 2015.\n\nBiggar, who has 73 caps, stands third behind Neil Jenkins and Stephen Jones in Wales\u2019 all-time scorers list but he has taken a battering in Japan, suffering two concussions in the space of a fortnight.\n\nHowever, he has recovered to take the field for Wales, already deprived of the services of Gareth Anscombe through injury and with stand-in Rhys Patchell showing his inexperience at times.\n\nAsked if Biggar had reduced his training, Jenkins \u2014 now a skills coach \u2014 said: \u201cGood luck on that one. Not really. He\u2019s a competitor, Bigs. Full stop. He\u2019s a winner.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Gareth Davies v Antoine Dupont \u2013\n\nYouth and experience also scrap it out at scrum-half as the 22-year-old Antoine Dupont takes on Gareth Davies, seven years his senior and with 40 more caps to his name.\n\nDavies has been instrumental in Wales\u2019s unblemished World Cup record, his kicking and distribution key to winning field position and releasing attacking options for the Six Nations champions.\n\nBut he has also proved a threat with his pace and eye for a scoring opportunity, dotting down twice already in Japan 2019 to add to his five in 2015, where he was third in the tournament\u2019s try-scoring list.\n\nDavies undoubtedly has the temperament for big games, his 60-metre interception try in Wales\u2019s 29-25 win over Australia earning him man of the match.\n\nMeanwhile, Dupont is poised to return to the French side after a back injury.\n\nThe diminutive scrum-half started playing at the age of three-and-a-half and has come up through the ranks of junior international rugby to become coach Jacques Brunel\u2019s first-choice number nine.\n\nDupont\u2019s speed of distribution was central to France\u2019s first half of champagne rugby against Argentina, where he also scored a try.\n\nHe appears to have shrugged off any ill-effects from his injury. \u201cHe\u2019s running like a rabbit,\u201d said teammate Sofiane Guitoune.\n\n\u2013 Alun Wyn Jones v Sebastien Vahaamahina \u2013\n\nAt the grand old age of 34, Alun Wyn Jones was rested for Wales\u2019s last pool match against Uruguay and the talismanic lock will be raring to go for what will be a record-extending 132nd cap.\n\nCentral to Wales\u2019s ball-winning operation, captain Jones has been characteristically dominant in the line-out in Japan and especially prominent in the loose against a powerful Georgia pack in the pool phase.\n\nHe will be desperate to reach the final \u2014 not least because he would draw level with the great All Black Richie McCaw and England prop Jason Leonard for the most Rugby World Cup appearances.\n\nStanding more than two metres (6ft 7in) tall, Sebastien Vahaamahina is a giant in every sense for Les Bleus. Born in Noumea in French New Caledonia, Vahaamahina took up rugby at 14 and possesses silky handling skills for someone his size, developed on the volleyball court.\n\nThe 27-year-old was told at 16: \u201cYou have potential, don\u2019t waste it\u201d, and he will be taking that to heart in the biggest game of his career on Sunday.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Three head-to-heads for the Rugby World Cup quarter-final between England and Australia in Oita on Saturday: \u2013 Dan Biggar v", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/388c8b_youth-experience-set-battle-it-out-fly-rugby-world-cup-wales-france-quarter-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
