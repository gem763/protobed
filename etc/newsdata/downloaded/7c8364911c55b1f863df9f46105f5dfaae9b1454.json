But it has also brought a drawback we have to live with: plenty of idle time and available resources to feed foolish and too-often destructive activities.\n\nWhen overcoming economic struggles is a family\u2019s and an individual\u2019s primary, and sometimes sole, focus of life, there\u2019s not enough time and money left over to engage in ill-natured behavior, such as ignorantly and maliciously protesting, and harassing customers, at a Chick-fil-A grand opening in Toronto. All energy is directed toward daily survival. Putting food on the table and maintaining a roof above don\u2019t leave many hours to participate in futile and stupid gestures, to borrow a phrase from one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest movies. Productive adults, especially those who are depended upon by others, and even responsible teens, have far better things to do than to act like spoiled children, and worse.\n\nBut today, most in the West live in a society whose members are not only the richest in history, they have a bounty of leisure time that no other has even been able to comprehend.\n\nWilliam Ayers was among the first to exploit these conditions. His father Thomas G. Ayers was a president, chairman, and CEO of Commonwealth Edison in the 1960s and 1970s. The elder Ayers also served on a number of corporate and nonprofit boards, was a Northwest University trustee, and was known for his civic leadership and generosity.\n\nWilliam Ayers chose an alternate route. He leveraged the circumstances of fortune to destroy. Rather than contribute to the economy and our civilization, this scion of wealth, a founding member of the Weather Underground, considered a domestic terrorist organization by the FBI, chose to try to tear them down.\n\nThe Weather Underground\u2019s manifesto said its \u201cintention is to disrupt the empire \u2026 to incapacitate it, to put pressure on the cracks.\u201d Ayers, who inexplicably became an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, as well as a friend of a president, said his objective was to \u201ckill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that\u2019s where it\u2019s really at.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FBI, at one time \u201cthe group had claimed credit for 25 bombings \u2014 including the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California Attorney General\u2019s office, and a New York City police station.\u201d In 1978, the FBI \u201carrested five members who were plotting to bomb a politician\u2019s office.\u201d Three years later, \u201cothers were captured after two policemen and a Brinks\u2019 driver were murdered in a botched armored car robbery in Nanuet, New York.\u201d Ayers eventually went into hiding, dodging authorities for a decade. He couldn\u2019t have done it without financial resources and a network of affluent social assets to lean on.\n\nHad Ayers been the son of a struggling wage worker instead of a son of privilege, it\u2019s much less likely that he would have chosen the path he did. He just might have been too busy with existential concerns.\n\nAyers\u2019 spiritual grandchildren can be found today among the Antifa terrorists, militant, without decency, and lacking in remorse. Its \u201cmembers,\u201d implicitly and sometimes explicitly endorsed by Democrats, tend to be young and white, and have been enabled to destroy property and unleash violence because family wealth ensures they have time and resources to do so. With no dedication to work or school, no attachment to responsibility, they\u2019re free to roam the streets looking for someone to hurt and something to wreck.\n\nLess violent, but nevertheless menacing, are social justice warriors who spitefully interrupt students peacefully studying in their college library, raging \u201cwoke\u201d activists who shut down speech that offends them, mobs of global warming hysterics who block the free movement of others, the Occupy Wall Street crowd that took over public spaces, and the screamers and criers who publicly mourned the outcome of the 2016 election. Free of the concerns that most humans have had throughout our time on Earth, they\u2019re able to surrender to the lesser angels of their nature.\n\nProsperity has also given us a generation of coddled and useless Pajama Boys. The original Pajama Boy has been variously described as \u201can insufferable man-child,\u201d a \u201cspecial snowflake\u201d whose mother tells him he \u201ccan live at home forever,\u201d and a formal notice that we are moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cThe route from \u2018Beowulf\u2019 to Pajama Boy has been a very long downhill slide,\u201d strength training coach Mark Rippetoe wrote a few years back in PJ Media.\n\nBeowulf, of course, was of hearty temperate. The Pajama Boys of our day are the \u201cmen without chests\u201d C.S. Lewis warned us about, more bread-takers than breadwinners, cosseted brats who can huff and incite only when a prosperous society underwrites their effete indulgences.\n\nNone of this is to say we shouldn\u2019t promote prosperity. We are made wealthy only to the degree we are free. Purposely curbing or slowing prosperity to restrain the shameful and sometimes criminal behavior of a few would restrain the liberty of all.\n\nBut a civilized people cannot tolerate domestic terrorists, \u201cblack bloc\u201d rioters, street brawlers, and violent agitators To let this behavior go on, and in Ayers\u2019 case reward it with a teaching pulpit, is to invite cultural and societal decline.\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
