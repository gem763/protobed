The death of the sweaty, crumpled work suit should make men more creative", "language": "en", "text": "According to a recent M&S retail report, the suit has had its day. Well good riddance to it, and while you\u2019re bunging them all in a skip you can chuck the stupid tie in as well.\n\nReally, I\u2019m surprised men didn\u2019t knock suits on the head years ago. They\u2019re so boring and unless you\u2019ve got a polyester mix one you can machine wash at home, they\u2019re smelly.\n\nHow many men take their suits to the dry cleaners after a week\u2019s worth of wear? Not enough according to the whiff coming from some gentlemen on the underground.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSorry guys, but crotches get sweaty, as do armpits. Suits are hard work, especially if they\u2019re worn with that matching fiend of the laundry basket, the cotton shirt, which not only has to be washed, but demands proper ironing too. Yawn.\n\nOk, before you all get in a lather, the Savile Row suit is no doubt still going strong. Men with money who have a suit physique will continue to enjoy having their inside leg measured, and chaps who so desire can suit it and boot it for special occasions (though any invitation that states \u201clounge suits for gentlemen\u201d would personally have me running for the hills).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I also have a soft spot for corduroy jackets and a bit of Harris tweed, oh and velvet. I once saw that dishy James Norton at the National Portrait Gallery in a midnight blue velvet jacket and came over a bit silly.\n\nBut the sad fact is that most men don\u2019t look great in suits, possibly because they can\u2019t afford to have them hand made and/or they don\u2019t have a Bond physique. So it\u2019s great they\u2019ll be offered more chino and bomber jacket choice on the rails and a chance to be more comfortable and experimental at the same time.\n\nMy partner (still dapper at 71) has been freelance for almost two decades now. Once upon a time, when he worked on a magazine, he wore a suit and tie every day, and in the mid-Eighties I inherited his black silk Paul Smith number which I wore dripping with diamante brooches hanging off the lapels. Fact, sometimes women look better in suits than men. Not anymore mind: these days if you put me in a suit, I\u2019d look like something out of Toad Hall.\n\nThe last thing I want however is the demise of the suit to give men an excuse to resort to jogging bottoms. Honestly I\u2019d rather a badly fitting Jacob Rees- Mogg of a suit than a grown man in a pull up pant. Because unless you\u2019re an international sportsman or skinny fashionista there is nothing more infantilising on a chap than a massive version of the same trousers his mother sent him to nursery school in, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want any wee-wee accidents darling\u201d.\n\nJogging bottoms on male adults, who have no intention of ever going to the gym, is really worrying and I\u2019m noticing it more and more.\n\nThe worst of all these are the grey marl versions which show up every stain, guys. I\u2019m all for comfort and I\u2019m a fan of the jegging myself, but unless there are medical reasons for such apparel, I don\u2019t think you can look properly dressed without some kind of structured fly arrangement.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see who is left flying the middle-market suit flag? News readers possibly, especially the ones behind the desks who have to tell us terrible things, but I reckon the sofa chaps could mix it up a bit without frightening the horses.\n\nAs for those strange schools who force their sixth formers (even the ones doing art) into suited corporate office drones, put a sock in it. The only potential future they look like they\u2019re being geared up for is a spell on The Apprentice and, really, is that anything to aspire to?\n\nDress free chaps, wear your shirts floral or T, mix your checks with your spots, have as much fashion fun as the girls do and as far as I\u2019m concerned, if you\u2019ve got the legs for it, the more kilts the better.", "description": "According to a recent M&S retail report, the suit has had its day.
