Gen. Keith Kellogg, listened to the Zelensky call.\n\nHouse Democrats on Wednesday threatened to subpoena the White House if it doesn't turn over by Friday a host of documents that include any communication Pence's office had about the July call with Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats also want information on Trump's decision not to send Pence to Zelensky's May inauguration and information on Pence's meeting with Zelensky during a trip to Poland in September.\n\nMore: Democrats threaten to subpoena White House for documents in impeachment inquiry\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Vice President Mike Pence at a United Nations event on Religious Freedom on Sept. 23, 2019. More\n\nThe document requests are part of the House's impeachment inquiry launched last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nThe inquiry was prompted by a whistleblower complaint detailing efforts by senior White House officials to \"lock down\" access to records of the July call in which Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden.\n\nAt the time Trump and Zelensky spoke, the Trump administration was holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid approved by Congress.\n\nMore: Poll: Only 4 in 10 Republicans think Trump mentioned Biden on Ukraine call even though he acknowledged doing so\n\nAlthough Pence did not participate in the call, Kellogg was among those who monitored it, according to the Washington Post. The paper reported that Kellogg didn't hear anything he felt should be relayed to the vice president and Pence and his staff weren't aware afterward that the call had provoked alarm.\n\nAn unidentified Pence aide told the paper that his office wasn't told by the White House Counsel's Office about the whistleblower's complaint until the day before it became public.\n\nThe whistleblower's report alleged that Trump instructed Pence to cancel plans to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, a detail given in the context of Trump wanting to wait to see how the new leader \u201cchose to act\u201d in office.\n\nThis handout picture taken and released by the Ukrainian presidential press-service on September 1, 2019, shows US Vice-President Mike Pence (C) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) walking prior to their talks in Warsaw.

During a news conference the next day, Pence was asked whether he discussed Biden with Zelensky.", "description": "An aide to Vice President Mike Pence listened in on the phone call between Donald Trump and Ukraine's president, according to the Washington Post.", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MW0rriNB7kM.Gg3fKgmfXQ--~B/aD0yNDc2O3c9MzgxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/5e5b30ba88e3273d55dd28682a5fb853"}
