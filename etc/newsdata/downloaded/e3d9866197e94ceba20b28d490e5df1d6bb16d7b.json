It's compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nImage copyright Chester Zoo Image caption Joshua Styles (left) with a great sundew seedling\n\nWhat is the plant and where does it live?\n\nOnce commonly found in England, the plant has suffered a dramatic decline over the last century.\n\nChanges in land use have led to the drying of the wetlands and peat bogs it needs to survive.\n\nThe great sundew is found more widely in Scotland and Wales.\n\nHow is the plant being reintroduced?\n\nJoshua Styles was able to cultivate the plant from leaf cuttings taken from a few small populations, which have clung on to survival in Cumbria.\n\nHe reintroduced 10 of the plants at Risley Moss near Warrington, working with Chester Zoo and the Lancashire Wildlife Trust.\n\nThe meat-eating plant should thrive in this habitat and start multiplying.\n\n\"Every year when it flowers, it produces tens of thousands of tiny seeds that look a bit like dust,\" he said.\n\n\"Planting out 10, it might not sound a lot, but the number of seeds they produce, I'm hoping for a healthy number of seedlings next year - hopefully numbering hundreds.\"\n\nImage copyright Chester Zoo Image caption Sundews were one of the first carnivorous plants to be studied, attracting the attention of Charles Darwin\n\nThe great sundew (Drosera anglica)\n\nPlants usually draw nutrients up from the soil through their roots; carnivorous plants have evolved to feed on animal protein\n\nThe great, or English, sundew has many tiny \"tentacles\" on its leaves, which excrete droplets of a sticky, sweet-smelling liquid, which attracts passing insects\n\nThe sundew's tentacles then tighten around its prey, drowning the insect in the sticky fluid\n\nDigestive enzymes are slowly secreted, breaking the insect down into a nutrient-rich meal.\n\nImage copyright Chester Zoo Image caption Insects are attracted to the plants by the glistening leaves\n\nThe young conservationist was hooked by botany at the age of seven, and has been studying plants ever since.\n\nHe says it's important to conserve meat-eating plants for their benefits to the environment and biodiversity, and for their potential future benefits for us, such as as a potential source of new medicines.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "description": "Endangered carnivorous plants are being reintroduced in an attempt to reverse their decline.", "authors": ["Helen", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mb9sj.jpg"}
