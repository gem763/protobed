Details of the plan, according the the company, include a comprehensive internal training program and a strengthened governance and operations framework.\n\n\u201cWe will also take steps to recover all cannabis from distributors and retailers that has not already been sold to end consumers or returned to CannTrust,\u201d the company said. In mid-October, CannTrust destroyed all its remaining inventory that was grown in unlicensed spaces, that amounted to roughly $77-million worth of cannabis.\n\nThe company also noted that the special committee found no evidence that any of CannTrust\u2019s remaining board members \u201cwere aware of or engaged in any non-compliance issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very appreciative of the Special Committee\u2019s determined efforts to complete the investigative phase of its mandate. Leveraging the Special Committee\u2019s findings, CannTrust has taken swift action to begin addressing the factors that led to its non-compliance, including several involuntary departures from the Company\u2019s leadership team,\u201d Marcovitch said.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the scandal, CannTrust fired its former CEO Peter Aceto, and demanded the resignation of co-founder and chairman Eric Paul \u2014 media reports alleged that both Aceto and Paul had been aware of the unlicensed growing.\n\nThursday\u2019s statement also clarified that CannTrust will refile its restated 2018 and first quarter 2019 filings, as well as submit its second quarter and third quarter earnings within the next 60 days.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the company has taken important first steps towards achieving compliance with Health Canada, opening the door for potential licence reinstatement in the future,\u201d said Canaccord Genuity analyst Derek Dley in a note to clients. \u201cHaving said that, there is still significant uncertainty whether CannTrust will eventually achieve full compliance in the near term. As a result, we continue to remain on the sidelines,\u201d he added.\n\nHealth Canada recently reinstated cannabis company Bonify Inc.\u2019s licence, after it was suspended in February for selling 200 kilograms worth of illegal cannabis in legal retail stores across Saskatchewan.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: vsubramaniam@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VanmalaS", "description": "CannTrust said it submitted a 'remediation plan' to Health Canada that details how the company plans to regain compliance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canntrust-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
