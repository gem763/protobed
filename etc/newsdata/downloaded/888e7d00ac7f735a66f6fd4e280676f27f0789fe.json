Katie Hill announced she would resign from Congress, the California Democrat released a video vowing that she will \u201ctake up a new fight\u201d against the thing that drove her out of it: revenge porn.\n\n\u201cI have to take my personal fight outside the halls of Congress,\u201d Hill said, at times choking back tears, in the nearly four-minute video. \u201cI will also take up a new fight: I will fight to ensure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation. Others call it revenge porn,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs a victim of it, I call it one of the worst things we can do to our sisters and our daughters.\u201d\n\nWhen she announced her resignation Sunday evening, Hill cited fear that a revenge porn scheme, allegedly perpetrated by her soon-to-be-ex husband, would cast a shadow over her Congressional duties.\n\n\n\nA wave of graphic and sexual images of Hill, 32, were published in conservative outlets earlier this month, along with allegations that she had a sexual relationship with both a member of her campaign staff and her current legislative director, Graham Kelly.\n\nHill admitted to engaging in a sexual relationship with the campaign staffer, who is not affiliated with her Congressional office, but she denies any improper behavior with Kelly. Last week, the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into the allegations involving Kelly; the relationship would violate House ethics rules if proven true.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, Hill has heavily implied that her husband, who she is in the process of divorcing, leaked the photos.\n\n\"I know that as long as I'm in Congress, we'll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt,\" Hill said Sunday in a letter explaining her decision to resign.\n\n\u201cThis is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\u201d Hill continued in her letter.\n\nHill\u2019s legal team swiftly condemned the Daily Mail\u2019s article, and suggested in a cease and desist letter submitted to the outlet last week that it violated California\u2019s revenge porn laws by publishing the photos.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy,\u201d Hill said in the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a perfect person and never pretended to be,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that made my race so special.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning downfall for Hill, who just weeks ago was considered one of the party\u2019s most valuable new members. Hill won her seat during the so-called \u201cblue wave\u201d of voting in the 2018 midterm elections, flipping her solidly red Southern California district that year.\n\nShe saw her star rise when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped her to serve as the vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, which has led much of the body\u2019s work in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday, Pelosi acknowledged the \u201cgreat contribution\u201d Hill made to the slate of freshmen elected to Congress last year, but accepted her resignation.\n\n\u201cShe has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a member untenable,\u201d Pelosi said, alluding to Hill\u2019s relationship with the campaign staffer. \u201cWe must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u201d\n\nCover: Katie Hill on stage at day 2 of TheWrap's Power Women's Summit at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, California on November 2, 2018.
