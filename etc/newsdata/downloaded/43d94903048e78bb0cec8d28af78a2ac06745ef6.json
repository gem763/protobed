A decision on whether or not to play the match will be made on Sunday.\n\nWorld Rugby has already cancelled two matches scheduled for Yokohama on Saturday, and Dodson has suggested they would show more flexibility if it was the All Blacks needing a win to progress. Gregor Townsend's team are third in Pool A and need a bonus-point win to go through, unless Ireland lose to Samoa on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIn the court of public opinion we have already won,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not being strident, we\u2019re not being difficult, we want to compromise. We\u2019re asking for a 24-hour delay so the game can be played in perfect safety.\n\n\u201cThis is important to us as a nation, and I think the rugby-following public around the globe believe the same way ... We\u2019ve had two different opinions, one from a QC, that challenges that rigidity over scheduling,\u201d Dodson added.", "description": "Dodson suggested Rugby World Cup organisers would show more flexibility if it was the All Blacks needing a win to progress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7717b7aebc8dfbe01b3fb21388f23d7b36a979a/47_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c9c5d63dc2c8c38f88928acac7a94706", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
