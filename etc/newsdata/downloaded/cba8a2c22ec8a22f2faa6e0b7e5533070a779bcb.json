It was just smart for me to not train this week and I love that Joe trusts me and still played me and I think I paid him back today.\u201d\n\nMontemurro said: \u201cViv\u2019s a player for the 94 minutes on a Sunday and if we need to do certain things in the week to get her ready for Sunday then we will.\u201d\n\nQuick guide WSL round-up: Chelsea go top Show Hide Chelsea came from a goal down after Adriana Leon struck for West Ham to leapfrog City at the top of the WSL table. Goals from Sophie Ingle and Ji So Yun within two minutes of each other and a injury-time effort from Drew Spence ensured Emma Hayes' side took full advantage of Manchester City's defeat.\n\nKirsty Hanson and Jess Sigsworth scored either side of the break as Manchester United saw off Reading to keep them within three points of Man City and Arsenal. Everton earned their third win of their league campaign (matching last year's tally), Chloe Kelly scored for the fourth time in five WSL games before City loanee Esme Morgan headed in a second against Brighton. Tottenham stayed level on points with both United and Everton after two goal in as many minutes from Kit Graham overturned Abi Harrison's first half strike for Bristol City. Birmingham picked up their first points of the season with a 2-0 defeat of Liverpool. An early goal from Kerys Harrop was added to by England midfielder Lucy Staniforth late on to leave Liverpool rooted to the bottom of the table with a single point. Suzanne Wrack\n\nThough City were top of the league with four wins from four, it could be argued there was no better time for the champions to face them. The defender Aoife Mannion ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this month, Keira Walsh was suspended, and Ellen White\u2019s slow return from injury had meant she could only be on the bench.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a massive loss,\u201d said Jill Scott of Walsh. \u201cI do think she is one player in this team that is irreplaceable. We all bring different strengths as a midfield but I don\u2019t think anybody can do what Keira does.\u201d\n\nArsenal dominated possession and passed the ball crisply, but City\u2019s strategy of cutting off the Gunners\u2019 attack at its roots, forcing them to play out from the back through former City defender Jen Beattie by sitting Janine Beckie on Leah Williamson, was very smart. With Williamson unable to pick out the between-the-lines passes at which she is normally so adept, Arsenal struggled to find a way through the two banks of four to which City frequently reverted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beth Mead lays off a pass under pressure from Mathilde Hidalgo.

But Arsenal continued to dominate, pressing high and testing the composure of Roebuck at every opportunity, looking more likely to get a second than concede.\n\nCushing was left ruing a lack of chances. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a shot against Man United and we didn\u2019t have a shot against Arsenal today.\n\n\u201cHaving Ellen back will give us hopefully more firepower but we\u2019ve got to get on the training pitch as a group and improve.\u201d\n\nChelsea go top of WSL\n\nChelsea came from a goal down after Adriana Leon struck for West Ham to leapfrog Manchester City at the top of the table.\n\nGoals from Sophie Ingle and Ji So-yun within two minutes of each other and an injury-time effort from Drew Spence ensured Emma Hayes\u2019s side took full advantage of Manchester City\u2019s dropped points.\n\nKirsty Hanson and Jess Sigsworth scored either side of the break as Manchester United saw off Reading to keep them within three points of City and Arsenal.
