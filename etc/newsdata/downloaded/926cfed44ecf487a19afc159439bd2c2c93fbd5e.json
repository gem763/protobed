The base currently houses the forward headquarters of U.S. Air Forces Central Command.\n\nThere was little immediate reaction to Friday\u2019s announcement that thousands of U.S. personnel will now be heading to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has faced sharp criticism throughout this week over his announcement last Sunday to pull a small contingent of U.S. special forces back from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have warned the pullback essentially invited Turkey to invade northeastern Syria and target Kurdish forces there that the U.S. had supported in the ground war against Islamic State terrorists.\n\nMr. Trump has responded to the criticism by asserting that he is following through on his campaign promise to pull America back from quagmire deployments to the region.\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We\u2019ve now been there for 10 years,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Minneapolis on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re now going to be there for close to 19 years. It\u2019s time to bring them home. It\u2019s time to bring them home. We\u2019ve done our job, we\u2019ve defeated everyone that we\u2019re supposed to defeat.\n\n\u201cNow we are, we are policing, we are now policing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting, we\u2019re policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re slowly getting out of the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it carefully.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Trump made no mention during his remarks of the impending Pentagon announcement of a new troop deployment to Saudi Arabia, he lamented that the U.S. has \u201cspent $8 trillion in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThese wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it\u2019s less safe, it\u2019s less stable, and it\u2019s less secure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say it all the time,\u201d the president added. \u201cThe single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going into the quicksand of the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Dave Boyer and Ben Wolfgang contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
