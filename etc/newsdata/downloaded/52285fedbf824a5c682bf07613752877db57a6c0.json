But obviously, the material here is highly relevant to impeachment. The Democrats\u2019 goal is to understand what the White House and DOJ did to block Congress from getting the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and IG report, and why. Was there a cover-up? Who ordered what, when, why and through what channels? The committee will also be pushing for the DNI to make more information about the complaint public \u2014 although there\u2019s skepticism they\u2019ll be able to do that.\n\nNEW: THE ADVISERS \u2026 WHO HAS THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMITTEE\u2019S EAR? The Democratic leadership and committee staff are relying on significant outside counsel as they try to keep the impeachment and oversight process on the tracks.\n\nPHIL SCHILIRO, who ran leg affairs for President BARACK OBAMA and was a top Oversight staffer for Rep. HENRY WAXMAN (D-Calif.), is informally advising the Democratic leadership and key committees about the oversight process. He recently started Co-Equal, an organization dedicated to legislating. (The organization has compiled Oversight Committee precedent. So if someone says \u201cNo staff member has ever been able to question a witness!\u201d Co-Equal can tell you when it\u2019s happened.) Also advising the Democrats: FRED WERTHEIMER and LAURENCE TRIBE.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Newsletters Playbook"], "top_image": ""}
