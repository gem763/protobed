REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nThe long-awaited Rule 6c-11 - or the ETF rule as it is more commonly called - is aimed at simplifying rules governing ETFs and seeks to speed up the process of launching new ETFs while reducing associated costs.\n\nNotably, the new rule does away with the exemptive-relief requirement in which would-be ETF issuers had to file with the regulator to get special permission to go around rules outlined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, which did not allow for ETFs.\n\n\u201cAs the ETF industry continues to grow in size and importance, particularly to Main Street investors, it is important to have a consistent, transparent and efficient regulatory framework that eliminates regulatory hurdles while maintaining appropriate investor protections,\u201d SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.\n\nSince 1992, the SEC has issued over 300 exemptive orders that allowed more than 2,000 ETFs to exist with more than $3.3 trillion in total net assets, according to data from the commission.\n\nThe new ETF rule will replace hundreds of those individual exemptive orders with a single rule.\n\n\u201cThe ETF rule will level the playing field for ETF providers, allowing new participants to enter via a streamlined process,\u201d said Elisabeth Kashner, FactSet\u2019s director of ETF research.\n\nBlackRock Inc, Vanguard, and State Street Corp currently dominate the ETF space.\n\n\u201cBlackRock has long supported ETF regulation that enhances transparency, market quality and choice for investors,\u201d BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s largest issuer of ETFs, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to reviewing the final rule in detail and sharing our thoughts in due course,\u201d BlackRock said.\n\nThe new rule will allow all ETFs to use custom baskets, containing securities that do not match their ETF\u2019s index, in the creation and redemption process instead of a basket that exactly replicates the index or cash in lieu of certain basket of securities.\n\nThe use of custom baskets, commonly allowed in the early days of ETFs, but not in recent years, has allowed older ETF firms like BlackRock and State Street to adjust their portfolio\u2019s holdings efficiently and minimize capital gains from higher-turnover, active strategies.\n\n\u201cThe custom basket provision, now extended to virtually all players, will increase access to the \u201cheartbeat\u201d trade, allowing newer entrants to re-balance portfolios without passing along capital gains,\u201d said Kashner.\n\n\u201cHeartbeat trades\u201d refer to transactions in which an investor puts money into an ETF only to make a quick withdrawal that is paid out in shares of the stocks held by the ETF, thereby avoiding significant capital gains for the fund.", "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday said it would adopt a new rule to modernize how exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are brought to the market and their regulation.", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434253692&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1R0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
