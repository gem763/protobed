A Takata airbag misdeployment can result in death or serious injury, even in a minor collision,\u201d ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard said.\n\nThe critical airbags are part of a sub-category of faulty Takata airbags that have been identified as posing an increased risk.\n\nmedia_camera More than 3.3 million Takata airbags have been replaced so far.\n\nThe terms of the recall mean drivers are entitled to have their car towed to the dealer for replacement, and may be entitled to a loan vehicle as well.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all drivers to check if their vehicle is affected, even if they have checked before, and to act immediately to have their airbag replaced,\u201d Ms Rickard said.\n\nDON\u2019T DRIVE THESE CARS UNTIL THEY\u2019RE FIXED\n\nBMW (7909 vehicles affected)\n\n\u2022 E39 5-Series (2002-2003)\n\n\u2022 E46 3-Series (2001-2006)\n\n\u2022 E53 X5 (2003)\n\nHONDA (6043 vehicles affected)\n\n\u2022 City (2012)\n\n\u2022 CR-V (2011)\n\n\u2022 Insight (2012-2013)\n\n\u2022 Jazz (2012-2014)\n\n\u2022 Jazz Hybrid (2012-2013)\n\n\u2022 Civic (2006-2011)\n\n\u2022 Legend (2007-2012)\n\n\u2022 Accord (2001-2007)\n\n\u2022 MDX (2003-2006)\n\nMITSUBISHI (3254 vehicles)\n\n\u2022 Triton (2007-2014)\n\nHOLDEN\n\n\u2022 Cruze (2010)\n\nTOYOTA\n\n\u2022 Echo (2003-2005)\n\n\u2022 Rav4 (2003-2005)\n\nMany of the vehicles on the list are fitted with Takata\u2019s even more problematic \u201cAlpha\u201d airbags, which left the factory with a range of defects.\n\nProperly manufactured airbags have a roughly 0.27 per cent chance of rupturing when deployed, but with Takata\u2019s Alpha airbags that number can be as high as 50 per cent.\n\nConsumers can check whether their car is affected by contacting their carmaker or entering their vehicle identification number on their website, by visiting ProductSafety.gov.au, or the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) website IsMyAirbagSafe.com.au.\n\nYou can also text 0487 AIRBAG for more information.\n\nThe FCAI revealed last month more than eight million people have used the website to check their vehicle so far, and 1.3 million have identified a vehicle with faulty airbags.\n\nThe Takata airbag recall has been the world\u2019s largest automotive recall, affecting millions of motorists.\n\nA Victorian Department of Transport spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority is to ensure everyone is safe on the road which is why, in line with the ACCC\u2019s strict advice, we\u2019re urging affected vehicle owners not to drive their cars and to contact their local dealer immediately to get the dangerous airbags replaced.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the ACCC confirms manufacturers have exhausted all options to contact affected owners the Department will begin implementing registration sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis will inconvenience some drivers but the Department will take this urgent action as soon as possible to protect motorists from the deadly airbags.\u201d\n\nRELATED: VicRoads lashed over Takata airbag safety\n\nRELATED: Takata knew about defects as early as 2000\n\nMore than 3 million airbags have already been replaced, but there are still another 483,071 that need fixing urgently.\n\nThe government issued a compulsory recall last year after an investigation by the ACCC.\n\nBefore that, Takata had issued recalls that eventually bankrupted the company in 2017.\n\nTwenty-nine reported deaths and 320 injuies around the world have been linked to Takata airbags, including one death in Australia.\n\nA NSW Coroner\u2019s Court inquest into the death of Huy Neng Ngo, 58, has heard the fatal injuries he suffered when his Honda CR-V\u2019s faulty Takata airbag deployed were comparable to being shot.\n\nMr Ngo died after a relatively minor crash at Cabramatta in Sydney\u2019s west on July 13, 2017.\n\nHe had reportedly been scheduled to have the airbags replaced two days earlier but his appointment was postponed.\n\nRELATED: Drastic action on deadly airbags\n\nNews Corp Australia\u2019s national motoring editor Richard Blackburn said motorists who had deliberately avoided getting their airbags replaced needed to stop being stubborn.\n\n\u201cThese things are just ticking time bombs and anyone who hasn\u2019t had theirs fixed by now needs to. You shouldn\u2019t be driving a car with one of these airbags,\u201d Mr Blackburn said.\n\nAll states and territories with the exception of Victoria, now have the power to cancel or deny registration for recalled vehicles that haven\u2019t had their airbags replaced.\n\nThe automotive industry has been steadily completing the recall, but has faced difficulty from reluctant customers.\n\nRELATED: Deadly airbags remain a danger on our roads\n\nOne of the problems manufacturers face is tracking them down, according to Mr Blackburn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal for a dealer to sell the cars on without having the airbags fixed but there\u2019s nothing stopping private sellers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting down to the last of the lost, but the problem is the cars have changed hands multiple times and each time it gets harder to track the owner down.\u201d\n\nDo you think people should have their registration denied for not fixing their airbags?
