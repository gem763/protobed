But it has driven inequalities within nations in the hollowing out of old industrial heartlands. It is not just diehard Trumpers who fear that China has imposed an unsustainable mercantilist model of debt-driven and subsidised over-capacity on the rest of the world that can no longer be absorbed.\n\nOther critics say that China will fall by itself into a middle-income trap. The sheer mobilisation of low-cost labour will become exhausted, and a one-party state cannot develop the dynamism and innovation to break out to a new stage. Because of its size and military might, China will always be very powerful, but its workforce may grow old before it ever gets rich. And as early as the 1980s, the ruling Chinese Communist Party was lapsing into corruption and loss of purpose as rising affluence made a party of struggle seem redundant.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s response to all of these multiplying problems has been to double down on the familiar command economy. It works by suppressing China\u2019s savers to provide cheap credit to party-controlled companies and industries to invest in industrial and infrastructure capacity. Beijing is even trying to export it as the Belt and Road concept. The communists know that economic instability did as much to destroy their Nationalist rivals 70 years ago as Mao\u2019s armies, and they watch such trends carefully. Now Mr Xi\u2019s China must grapple with excessive debt and overinvestment. Debt is soaring beyond Japanese levels, to 300 per cent of GDP by 2030 from 235 per cent in 2016. And its effectiveness is rapidly diminishing, with one-third of it, on one estimate, squandered in badly managed project cost overruns. Others point out that China\u2019s urbanisation and catch-up growth still has far to run, and the stock of capital per worker is still very low. Yet the main attraction of this investment model is not more efficient growth, it is an economy that the party can more easily control.\n\nMr Xi\u2019s China is still not behaving as a big country should. It does not consume anything like enough of its own GDP.\n\nBut it is no longer China\u2019s workers that the world needs, it\u2019s China\u2019s shoppers.\n\nMr Xi\u2019s China is still not behaving as a big country should. It does not consume anything like enough of its own GDP. Others have to make room for its output, and trade wars now result. And its hoarding of savings adds to deflationary pressure and ineffective monetary policy around the world. China's consumption has not had the same impact on the world that its production has, and that is now holding the rest of the world back. Mr Xi came to office in 2013 looking like he understood the need for bottom up liberalisation of financial markets to free savings and consumers. If there was more competition for Mr and Mrs China\u2019s savings, then Chinese companies would have to be more efficient, savers would be better off, and production and consumption would get a lift. That reform impulse may have died in the chaotic interventions during the 2015 stock market panic. But Mr Xi needs to find that boldness again.\n\nIn Washington last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison rightly referred to China as a \u201cnewly developed economy\u201d. This backs the US position over China\u2019s pretence of being a developing country, with the trade concessions this brings. Mr Morrison was paying Beijing the compliment of speaking frankly, but not provocatively, about these things. Nobody could call China\u2019s global effect that of an emerging economy. Australia will always want a more prosperous China. We do not believe China can be contained, and we do not want the world splitting into two blocs as a result. But the South China Sea, the Pacific islands, Huawei and our need for foreign interference laws are all signs of China\u2019s assertiveness. And as China turns 70, how to handle Beijing has become a domestic political battleground too. Mr Morrison on page one today asks what Labor would say differently. It is hard to see what is better than honesty.", "description": "China's consumption now needs to have the same impact on the world that its production did.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1868%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/87021495d60cfc9f5b15d8e1598d7f1a52c49ced", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
