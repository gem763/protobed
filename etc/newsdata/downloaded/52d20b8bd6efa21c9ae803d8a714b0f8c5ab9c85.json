This is my lucky shirt so far.\"\n\nIn 2019 Erasmus has won 9 out of his 11 matches in charge (81%).", "description": "Rugby is not often a sport associated with superstitions, but Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus believes he has a lucky matchday shirt!", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7721/be2c159c31674c82b301ceb87cbe67ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
