It\u2019s definitely not for peace,\u201d said former Afghan Ambassador to Washington Hamdullah Mohib, speaking of U.S. reconciliation envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, in an extraordinary breakfast with national security reporters in Washington, D.C. \u201cHe is not reconciling, he\u2019s alienating.\u201d\n\nMohib, who is now Afghan President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s national security adviser, said he\u2019d come to Washington specifically to complain that rather than using U.S. influence to force the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government, Khalilzad had sidelined them, giving the Taliban no reason to talk peace as it prepares \u201cfor a full-on spring offensive\u201d against Afghan troops.\n\n\u201cEven if there\u2019s a deal, it\u2019s a bad deal,\u201d he said, because it would undermine his government, whereas Mohib said the Taliban is publicly bragging that the world\u2019s foreign ministers are clamoring to meet with them, the new U.S-backed power in town.\n\nAmong Mohib's complaints: that when Khalilzad wrapped up 16 days of talks with the Taliban last week in Qatar last week, he didn\u2019t share much more than his tweets about the talks which said they\u2019d made progress on a \u201cwithdrawal timeline and effective counter-terrorism measures.\u201d Khalilzad added that after that was finalized, \u201cthe Taliban and other Afghans, including the government, will begin intra-Afghan negotiations on a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire.\u201d\n\nMohib said the information void is leading the Afghan government to some conspiratorial conclusions, including the suspicion that Khalilzad, an Afghan-American, is intentionally weakening the current administration of and lining up his old allies like former Afghan President Hamid Karzai to make a future bid to run the country himself.\n\n\u201cWe think either the ambassador doesn\u2019t know what he is doing, or he has something else in mind,\u201d Mohib said, adding that Khalilzad had considered running for president of Afghanistan twice before.\n\n\u201cPeople in government think perhaps all this talk is to create a caretaker government of which he will then become the viceroy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Mohib\u2019s comments are inaccurate and unhelpful, and we will be responding to them privately,\u201d a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the now-public disagreement. By day\u2019s end, the State Department\u2019s deputy spokesperson, Robert Palladino, said Mohib had been dressed down by Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale, who told him \u201cattacks on Ambassador Khalilzad are attacks on the Department.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official also emailed a rebuke of Mohib\u2019s complaints, saying Khalilzad is \u201cworking to bring together various stakeholders, including the Afghan government\u2026and the Taliban, so they can reach a political settlement.\u201d The official was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nKhalilzad was born in Afghanistan and grew up in Kabul before attending high school in the United States and eventually getting a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. He was an assistant professor at Columbia University in New York before joining the State Department to work on the Afghan war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s.\n\nKhalilzad served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, as well as to Iraq, and as U.N. ambassador under the George W. Bush administration, before being appointed as Trump\u2019s Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation last fall. He has been rumored to consider running for president of Afghanistan in the past.\n\nThe State Department and NSC pushback aren\u2019t likely to satisfy Mohib or his government. He said he\u2019d taken his complaints to U.S. officials before, but that had done nothing to get U.S. envoy Khalilzad to let them into the process, and that on this trip, he was being snubbed by his counterpart, National Security Adviser John Bolton, who was \u201ctoo busy\u201d to meet him, but would instead be \u201cdropping by\u201d while the Afghan was shuffled off to meet a lower-level National Security Council official. It wasn\u2019t clear by Thursday\u2019s end if even that meeting would be taking place.\n\nMohib had listed a number of other humiliations large and small, including his claim that Khalilzad has dictated to the Afghan government who they could include in future delegations to talk with the Taliban, once the U.S. allows them in. He said his own Taliban contacts told him they\u2019d made no such demands.\n\nHe also carefully tried to split his attacks on Khalilzad from any attack on the U.S. president.\n\n\u201cThe United States is not a colonial power,\u201d said Mohib. \u201cPresident [Donald] Trump said in his inauguration speech that \u2026 countries will not be told how to live their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who he has hired are in fact doing the opposite.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note: This story was updated with comment from the State Department and NSC.", "description": "The Afghan president\u2019s national security adviser is in Washington warning that Khalilzad is selling out the Kabul government and may have personal ambitions.", "authors": ["Kimberly Dozier"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1552582169/190314-dozier-zalmay-khalilzad-hero_desvz0"}
