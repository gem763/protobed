His work ethic is insane. I see him everywhere practising and I couldn't have asked for a better partner.\n\n\"Thank you so much for all your time and your effort. This boy has so much talent, I'm really sad he won't be able to show you guys any more of it.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nLast night's show placed Saffron Barker and AJ Prichard at the top of the leaderboard with a score of 38 out of 40 after their foxtrot.\n\nThey pipped Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden to the post, who took home a combined score of 36.\n\nHowever, David James and Nadiya Bychkova are languishing at the bottom of the leaderboard having picked up just 16 points for their jive to Michael Buble's Such A Night.\n\nMike Bushell and Katya Jones are in second to the bottom having scraped 21 for their samba to Jump On It by The Sugarhill Gang.\n\nNext week's Strictly sees the return of the hotly anticipated Halloween Week, which will feature spooktacular performances from the remaining couples.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing: The Results returns tonight at 7.15pm on BBC1", "description": "The two couples who entered the dance-off have been leaked on Twitter - with a mole revealing who has been voted off", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19598432.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_STRICTLY-COME-DANCING-LOGO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
