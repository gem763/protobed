However, outrage sparked by Nazi slogans, death threats and the recent deadly attack on a synagogue may have dampened expectations of the party seizing control from the embattled left.\n\nIn what has been billed as a fight for the political heart of Germany, the anti-immigration, anti-establishment AfD, which made strong gains in the states of Saxony and Brandenburg last month, was expected to take around 23%, according to final polling, more than double its previous result of 10.6% in the east-central state.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators hold up a banner reading \u2018Who votes for H\u00f6cke votes for fascism\u2019 referring to AfD candidate Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke.

It has accused those in power of failing to deliver on the promises made since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago to citizens of the former communist east, including 2 million Thuringians.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bodo Ramelow is the current governor of Thuringia.

Nineteen out of 20 eastern Germans had to find new jobs after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Some left and succeeded, some stayed and succeeded, but some got left behind and the insecurities have remained. There is a considerable amount of frustration.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The AfD\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke is a former history teacher.

But much of that was closed by the Treuhand, the agency tasked with restructuring and selling state-owned businesses in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) before unification in October 1990. Often that involved buying up the competition, making use of the know-how before liquidating the companies.\n\n\u201cResentment about that sits deep to this day,\u201d Br\u00fcns said. Resentment which, he added, was only reinforced by issues such as pensions being lower than those in the west and more recently, the refugee crisis.\n\n\u201cThe most frequent comment I hear from the 50-plus is: \u2018There\u2019s little recognition for what we\u2019ve achieved in our lives, but the government doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to helping refugees.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe AfD\u2019s success \u2013 polls repeatedly show it has the support of around a quarter of voters in Thuringia \u2013 was the direct consequence of such neglect, he believed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The AfD has gained much support from people who felt they were left behind by East Germany\u2019s transition from communism after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters\n\nTorben Braga, an AfD candidate, made no bones about the fact his party was busy tapping into that emotion with its election slogan, \u201cVollende die Wende\u201d (Complete the transition), a reference to the switch from communism to liberal democracy, which is widely interpreted as an invitation by the party to overturn the status quo, just as protesters who brought down the East German regime did.\n\n\u201cThis is an election and elections are all about speaking to people\u2019s emotions,\u201d said Braga. \u201cThirty years after the peaceful revolution of 1989, there are still serious differences between east and west, including the level of wages, the infrastructure, and employment figures. There are still no Dax-registered companies from eastern Germany; there is huge emigration from east to west. This bothers people a great deal and the AfD has managed to effectively instrumentalise these emotions for its own gain.\u201d\n\nSteffen Thormann, 25, a political science student and a candidate for Die Linke in his native M\u00fchlhausen, said he had grown up surrounded by people harbouring such frustrations. \u201cThe Berlin Wall still exists in many people\u2019s heads, even those of my age who weren\u2019t born when it fell,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people are disappointed that, for them, life didn\u2019t improve after reunification in the way they had hoped. The AfD has been very successful at fuelling the envy, but Die Linke has constantly tried to win people\u2019s trust with its solid social policy, including putting more money into schools and kindergartens.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The AfD\u2019s election slogan: \u2018Complete the transition\u2019. Photograph: Andreas Gebert/Reuters\n\nAstrid, who was walking her dog on the main square waiting for an AfD election rally to start, said she had been \u201can excited 29-year-old\u201d when the wall came down.\n\n\u201cWhen the factory I worked in was closed down, I retrained as a care worker,\u201d she said. \u201cI got to know west Germans, I was open to everything.\u201d Now, she said, she struggled to pay her rent, and worried how she would make ends meet on her pension.\n\nThe arrival of hundreds of refugees in M\u00fchlhausen in 2015 had felt like a further threat to her existence, she said. \u201cThose in power cut the numbers of police and said they didn\u2019t have the funds to fix the holes in the road, but suddenly money was found to house the newcomers.\u201d\n\nAstrid was waiting to hear Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the AfD\u2019s leading candidate and head of its extremist wing who many say is radicalising the party.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest CDU candidate Mike M\u00f6hring has refused to enter into a coalition with the AfD. Photograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images\n\nH\u00f6cke condemned an attack earlier this month on a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle carried out by a lone gunman, but was accused of helping stoke the hatred with his anti-Jewish rhetoric. He has called for a \u201c180-degree shift\u201d in Germany\u2019s remembrance culture of its Nazi past and has labelled the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d. When a state broadcaster suggested to him recently it was hard to decipher between some of his statements and those of Adolf Hitler, H\u00f6cke angrily walked out and said he was being portrayed as \u201cthe nation\u2019s devil\u201d.\n\nMike M\u00f6hring, the CDU\u2019s main candidate who has received death threats from neo-Nazis during the campaign, has called H\u00f6cke \u201ca Nazi\u201d and his and the other parties have refused to enter a coalition with the AfD.\n\nThe result in Sunday\u2019s election is unlikely to cause any major upsets in Berlin, but it is being watched closely, not least as a gauge of the AfD\u2019s standing.\n\n\u201cI am undecided,\u201d said Astrid. \u201cI am angry, but I have no desire to be associated with Nazis.\u201d", "description": "Party whose leader is labelled a Nazi is on par with CDU going into Thuringia poll on Sunday", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a63c616b83b0b3fdab29b5660c84f85a89a9495/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=431557307dfb4f3b6a230872565cc41a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
