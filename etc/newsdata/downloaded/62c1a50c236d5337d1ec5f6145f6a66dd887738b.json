They told the Daily Mail they noticed the girl seemed to have an advanced vocabulary for a child that was supposedly 6, and that she had already exhibited signs of puberty, including a menstrual cycle and \"full pubic hair.\"\n\nPhotos of the family:\n\nThings took a turn for the worse when Natalia began exhibiting violent behavior, primarily towards her adoptive mother, the Barnetts told Inside Edition.\n\nNatalia allegedly told her new parents she wanted to stab the entire family to death in their sleep and tried to kill Kristine Barnett twice, once by shoving her into an electric fence and again by pouring cleaning fluid into her coffee.\n\n\"She had poured the Pine-Sol in her coffee and just said blatantly, plainly, no emotion, \"I'm trying to kill you, I want you dead,\" Michael Barnett claims.\n\nThe couple eventually sought a medical professional's opinion on Natalia's age and were told in 2012 by their primary care physician, Dr. Andrew McLaren that the girl's 2003 birth date was clearly inaccurate, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nTwo years after adopting the child, the couple applied to have Natalia's age legally changed so she could receive \"appropriate psychiatric treatment for an adult\" and were granted the appeal by Marion County Superior Court Judge Gerald S. Zore. The supposed 8-year-old girl's birthday was then changed to September 4, 1989, making her legally 22 years old.\n\nThe Barnetts left Natalia behind in Indiana shortly after, prepaying a year's worth of rent on her apartment and signing her up for social welfare programs.\n\nHowever, according to an arrest affidavit, a bone density test carried out on Natalia in June 2010 concluded she was approximately 8 years old, just 2 years older than her supposed age when she was adopted. A skeletal exam carried out in 2012 at the same hospital concluded she was about 11, the affidavit says. Her adoptive parents vehemently deny the claims.\n\nBoth Kristine and Michael Barnett surrendered to arrest warrants served in late September 2019 and have since been released on bail.\n\nThe case has drawn widespread comparisons to the 2009 film \"Orphan,\" in which a couple adopts a 9-year-old Russian girl and later discovers she is, in fact, a 33-year-old woman who has killed at least seven people, including the last family who adopted her.", "description": "An American\u00a0couple who adopted their daughter in 2010 believing she\u00a0was 6 years old now believes she's actually an adult\u00a0woman posing as a child.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wYKSbAp8DENg0PJGjQgVeA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2460x1612+143+94/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f98caee0-eb6d-11e9-bff1-2f9dc389a160", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
