Silver\u2019s office has reached out and he hopes a meeting can be set up, perhaps in Shanghai Wednesday.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are scheduled to play an exhibition game in Shanghai Thursday and then another game in Shenzhen on Saturday. Shenzhen is a southern city that neighbors Hong Kong. China state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) is refusing to broadcast both games. The decision to not broadcast the games came after Silver voiced support of Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey\u2019s right of free speech.\n\n\u201cWe voice our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Adam Silver offering as an excuse the right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in its statement announcing the cancellation of the N.B.A. broadcasts. \u201cWe believe that no comments challenging national sovereignty and social stability fall within the scope of freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nThe NBA Commissioner expressed disappointment but also acknowledged that this is a tough issue that won\u2019t be settled any time soon.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important we adhere to those values.\u201d Silver said that he would still travel to Shanghai on Wednesday and that it was his hope to meet with Chinese government officials to try to defuse the conflict. \u201cBut I\u2019m a realist as well, and I recognize that this issue may not die down so quickly,\u201d Silver said.\n\nI suppose that it is a better response to the whole situation between the money-grubbing NBA and the brutal communist government of China \u2013 the NBA landing on the side of free speech \u2013 than the original response by the commissioner, which was to express regret that Chinese bureaucrats were offended by an innocent tweet. How about the freedom of the Hong Kong people? You know, the ones who even carry American flags during their protests.\n\nWill Yao Ming be able to step in and act as a mediator in this situation?\n\nSilver said he and Yao \u201chave been close friends since the joined the league.\u201d He talked of finding \u201cmutual respect for each other\u2019s political systems and beliefs.\u201d\n\nYao Ming is Chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) now, a government-directed body. Technically speaking, Yao\u2019s stamp of approval would be on the decision to not broadcast the pre-season games. He played for the Shanghai Sharks in the CBA before being drafted by the Houston Rockets in 2002. He is punishing his former team and many Houstonians are deeply disappointed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Daryl\u2019s tweet has hit what I would describe as a third-rail issue in China,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI think Yao is extremely unsettled. I\u2019m not quite sure he accepts how we are operating our business right now.\u201d\n\nHow we are operating our business right now? What is Silver talking about? He came out and groveled to the Chinese right away and Morey deleted his tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters right away. Seven words. \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Would Silver even be half-way supportive of Morey now if the outcry from Americans \u2013 Houston Rockets fans, politicians, and basketball fans across the country \u2013 hadn\u2019t been so swift and strong?\n\nBasketball is huge in China. The Rockets are big in Houston. When Yao Ming came to Houston, he was welcomed with open arms and made the toast of the city. I remember my husband and son coming home on Saturday after running into him in an electronics store, not long after Yao came here. They said how quiet and reserved he was and had a translator in tow. Houston made him a very wealthy man. He brought his parents over and they opened a restaurant. His daughter was born in Houston. The ties between Yao and the Rockets are deep, even today. He is a legend.\n\nIn other words, Yao Ming was given the opportunity to live the American Dream in Houston. When he retired he returned to China. He owns the Shanghai Sharks. He is also under the control of the Communist Chinese. The NBA makes millions of dollars from Chinese fans. Rockets players secure lucrative endorsement deals, too. It\u2019s all fun and games until the Communist government reminds you of who they are. Freedom is a bad word.\n\nChinese fans also are fanatic about the Rockets and the NBA. Basketball shoes have become increasingly popular in China while sales have declined in the U.S. for the past four years. NBA players frequently make promotional appearances in China for their affiliated shoe companies. Warriors star Klay Thompson, who has a 10-year contract with the Chinese company Anta, has been labeled \u201cChina Klay\u201d during some of his outings. Former Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade has a lifetime deal with Li-Ning. Rockets star guard James Harden has made many trips to China to promote adidas products. \u201cKobe Bryant never sold a lot of shoes in the U.S. (but) he was wildly popular in China,\u201d said Matt Powell, a senior adviser for NPD Group, a global market research company. \u201c(NBA players) draw crowds like rock stars.\u201d\n\nPolitics is commonplace these days in sports. Sports stars are looked to for woke hot takes on everything. Is this a watershed moment? The American people are sick and tired of America kowtowing to China in order to not upset the status quo and affect the bottom line. This mess with the NBA is more of the same.\n\nYao has to decide where his loyalty is now. Can he smooth everything over and keep his position intact? Some damage has already been done in Houston. The only good thing happening right now is the fact that Morey is still employed by the Houston Rockets. If he is fired, it will be further proof of the weakness of the NBA.", "description": "Watershed moment?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/09d49a6c-a3fb-409c-8c8b-ea3475810bf7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
