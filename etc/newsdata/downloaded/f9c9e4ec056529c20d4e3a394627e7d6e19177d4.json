Either Labour wants to leave the EU, or it wants to stay. And if the party wants to stay, it has to argue for a new referendum as the only credible way to reverse the original mandate.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor a year now, Labour has argued for part of this case \u2013 a referendum \u2013 but has refused to say what it wants it for. Yesterday, Corbyn repeated to the TUC the same formula: that a Labour government would put \u201cRemain\u201d versus \u201ca credible Leave option\u201d to the people in a referendum. But he refused to say, either in his speech, or when confronted by Cathy Newman of Channel 4 News on the back stairs afterwards, which side he would back.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Richard Morgan/The Independent\n\nWe know what he is doing. He is trying to hold together two Labour coalitions. There is the leadership coalition, in which some trade union leaders led by Len McCluskey of Unite, and a minority in the shadow cabinet led by Ian Lavery, the party chair, want to leave the EU. And there is the coalition of the electorate, in which a minority of Labour voters want to leave.\n\nThose coalitions would be hard to sustain in an election. Corbyn couldn\u2019t dodge the question for the whole campaign. He would have to say that he, as a Labour prime minister, would argue for his Brexit deal, or against it, or that he would be neutral. This last option cannot be done in practice: Harold Wilson tried to stay above the fray in the 1975 referendum campaign, but everyone knew which side he was on. Hence Watson\u2019s clarity: a referendum ought to be held before an election. He also echoed Tony Blair\u2019s argument from yesterday \u2013 further cementing the Blairite-Brownite rapprochement \u2013 that a Brexit decision should be made on its own, uncluttered by the NHS and (as neither of them said out loud) Corbyn\u2019s personal unpopularity.\n\nAs Blair put it, Boris Johnson \u201cwants an election because he thinks he can mix up the Brexit question with other issues to his advantage\u201d.\n\nHowever, there is one big problem with a new referendum: parliament won\u2019t legislate for it. When the indicative votes were held in April, only 280 MPs voted for a \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d \u2013 40 short of a majority.\n\nYet there is now a problem with an election too. Labour MPs voted against an election \u201con Johnson\u2019s terms\u201d (that is, as soon as possible) but really because they fear he would win it. While Johnson is still popular and the Conservatives have a seven-point average poll lead, they will continue to vote against it. But then, if Johnson looks as if he will lose an election, he is unlikely to propose one again, and even if he did his MPs would be unlikely to vote for it.\n\nThere is a possible scenario in which an unpopular Johnson, forced to postpone Brexit and unable to fight an election, eventually proposes a referendum as his way out of the box.\n\nCorbyn, I think, would have to campaign for Remain in such a contest. Watson has already put his marker down. In two weeks\u2019 time, Labour\u2019s conference is likely to adjust the party\u2019s Brexit policy in his direction. After that, he may be vindicated and get a referendum before an election after all.", "description": "Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has finally come out and said he no longer respects the result of the 2016 referendum. \u201cThere eventually comes a point,\u201d he said in his speech today, \u201cwhen circumstances are so changed \u2026 you have to say, actually, no, that years-old plebiscite is no longer a valid basis on which to take such a momentous decision.\u201d Full marks for", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/17/00/Tom-Watson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
