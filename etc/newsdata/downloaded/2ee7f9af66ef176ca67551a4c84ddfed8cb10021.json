Some argue that the US withdrawal gave Turkey the green light to launch a cross-border assault.\n\nThe Turkish Defence Ministry says it wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d running for 480km (300 miles) on the Syrian side of the border, which would be free of Kurdish militias and create a place for Syrian refugees to live.\n\nIn a Tweet the ministry said troops were advancing east of the Euphrates river, and claimed that \u201cdesignated targets were seized\u201d.\n\nThe attacks have faced condemnation from the international community, and human rights groups have said that up to 100,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting.\n\nThere are also concerns that thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, are being guarded by Kurdish-led forces and could be released as a result of the offensive.\n\nIn response to international criticism, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to send \u201cmillions\u201d of Syrian refugees to Europe if the EU called the operation an \u201cinvasion\u201d.\n\nIs it safe to travel to Turkey?\n\nFor the large part, yes. But there are areas where the Foreign Office warns against all travel, and some areas where they warn against all but essential travel.\n\nThe Foreign Office states: \u201cIf you\u2019re in provinces bordering Syria, you should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice.\u201d\n\nThe FCO advises against all travel to areas within 10km (six miles) of the Syrian border, except the city of Kilis. They also advise against all but essential travel to all other areas of Sirnak, Kilis (including the city of Kilisy) and Hatay provinces, plus the provinces of Diyarbakir, Tunceli and Hakkari.\n\nThe FCO advises that those working in humanitarian aid work or journalism are particular targets for kidnappings around the border areas.\n\n\u201cTerrorist groups operating in Syria, including Daesh and AQ-linked groups, routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. They\u2019re present in the Syrian border areas and you should be particularly vigilant if you are in these locations.\u201d\n\nThe FCO map (as of October 2019) Credit: Foreign and Commonwealth Office (gov.uk) More", "description": "Turkey has launched a cross-border offensive on Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria, prompting the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to update its advice for British travellers.", "authors": ["Greg Dickinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AX7k43.cNWmRINKilFp3MA--~B/aD0xMjI2O3c9MTk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/30d23d5da7f5d7ca3b601d3a7d337228", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
