Monday\u2019s settlement does not resolve all of the thousands of lawsuits against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen, but it could spur further settlement talks.\n\n\"While this morning's trial will not begin as scheduled, the federal opioid MDL continues to move forward, as thousands of American communities still have claims against opioid industry defendants,\u201d the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee in the National Prescription Opiate Litigation said in a statement after the settlement deal was reported.\n\nOpening arguments were scheduled to begin in Cleveland Monday with the six remaining defendants \u2014 Teva, McKesson, Cardinal, AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens and Henry Schein \u2014 facing the two Cleveland-area counties over a crisis that killed hundreds of thousands of people nationwide. All of the defendants, with the exception of Walgreens, have now agreed to compensate the counties rather than face a jury trial. Walgreens\u2019 case is postponed, according to the Washington Post. (Henry Schein separately reached a $1.25 million agreement to end the counties\u2019 lawsuits against them Monday.)\n\nThe Cuyahoga and Summit county cases were the first of more than 2,000 lawsuits to reach Cleveland\u2019s courtroom, and were considered reliable bellwethers for how the rest of the lawsuits would play out. While the judge overseeing those cases has repeatedly called for a global settlement \u2014 the kind of deal that would end all of the lawsuits at once \u2014 talks to reach a larger deal fell apart Friday night. Combined, the opioid-related lawsuits make up one of the most complicated legal cases in U.S. history.\n\nMeanwhile, OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma, perhaps the biggest name in the opioid trials, agreed to settle the lawsuits against it through bankruptcy proceedings last month. Other drugmakers have opted to settle with the two bellwether counties, instead.\n\nThe lawsuits argue the companies knowingly or recklessly pushed opioid drugs that resulted in hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the last two decades. The companies have widely denied any involvement in the overdose crisis.\n\nCover: Summit County executive Ilene Shapiro speaks to the media outside the U.S. Federal courthouse, Monday, Oct. 21, 2019, in Cleveland.
