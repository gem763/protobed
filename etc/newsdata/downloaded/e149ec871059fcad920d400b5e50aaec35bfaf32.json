Naturgy said that expenses from depreciation, amortization and impairments totaled EUR1.19 billion in the period, down sharply from EUR5.54 billion.\n\nNet sales slid 3.2% to EUR17.11 billion, a result it attributed to lower energy prices and volumes in its liberalized businesses, which weren't offset by growth in the infrastructure businesses.\n\nWrite to Carlo Martuscelli at carlo.martuscelli@dowjones.com; @carlomartu\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 04:17 ET (08:17 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
