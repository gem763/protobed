He's a huge talent.'\n\nBridges declined comment on Luxon's announcement, saying he wouldn't discuss it 'until the process is complete and candidates have been announced'.\n\nPerhaps the strangest reaction to Luxon's announcement came from John Edwards, New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner.\n\nEdwards wrote on Twitter that Luxon corresponded in all of his emails with 'blue, comic sans font', leading others to declare him 'not fit' for parliament based on his use of the child-like typeface.", "description": "The outgoing chief of Air New Zealand has confirmed a richly-anticipated shift into New Zealand politics, adding weight to the opposition's bid to tilt Jacinda Ardern from power.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19564444-0-image-a-24_1570751613081.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
