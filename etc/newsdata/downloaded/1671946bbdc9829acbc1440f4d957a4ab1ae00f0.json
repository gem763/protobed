Why can't I?'", "language": "en", "text": "UNCASVILLE, Conn. \u2013 Jessy Miele picked up a big win over a former title challenger, which she believes should warrant a title shot.\n\nMiele (9-3 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) edged Talita Nogueira by split decision at Bellator 231 on Friday, making good in her promotional debut.\n\nAnd she believes if Nogueira fought for the featherweight title in 2018, then a win over her is definitely big.\n\n\u201cShe fought for the title, why can\u2019t I?\u201d Miele said after her win at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. \u201cI just beat somebody that fought (for the title). She did lose, but hey, I should have a shot, too. I know first (champion) Julia Budd has to fight (Cris) Cyborg, and someone has to have that title again. So we\u2019ll go from there. But I\u2019m definitely, I\u2019ll open my mind to that.\u201d\n\nMiele has been in there with some established names in women\u2019s MMA such as Peggy Morgan, Charmaine Tweet and Elizabeth Phillips, and is currently riding a four-fight winning streak.\n\nA win over jiu-jitsu champ Nogueira is certainly a feather in her cap, and may perhaps mean that she has entered title contention already. All she knows is that she has what it takes to compete with the division\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cI would hope that people see me and see me perform and accept that I have what it takes to be that next level,\u201d Miele said. \u201cJust by beating her and beating other people, it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about me putting on a show and just do my thing, and having the confidence of being \u2013 I\u2019m not going to go down quickly, I\u2019m not going to go down easy. So I hope that they see that and they will be accepting of that.\u201d", "description": "Jessy Miele believes win over former title challenger Talita Nogueira should warrant a title shot.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jessy-miele-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
