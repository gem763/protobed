It won\u2019t be economically viable for her to get there and keep the job.'\n\nSentencing Deputy District Judge Alexandra Simmonds told Leadbeater: ''You pleaded guilty to driving having consumed too much alcohol on the day in question.\n\n\"Police where made aware of your presence by an operator of CCTV who said something they had seen made them concerned.\n\n''Police arrived and you got out and were entirely cooperative but you had had too much to drink and were over the limit.\n\n\"Nobody has provided any evidence to show your driving was impaired and you have no previous convictions for driving or anything else.''\n\nLeadbeater was also fined \u00a3360 and was ordered to pay \u00a3436 in costs and surcharges.", "description": "Katie Leadbeater, 25, changed into her sliders, a style of beach shoe, from a pair of expensive heels to drive home after a night out in Manchester", "authors": ["Sophie Wheeler", "Image", "Katie Leadbeater", "Cavendish Pres", "Cavendish Press", "Manchester", "Ltd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647675.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
