It doesn\u2019t matter if the coaching staff is ripped apart, or if the greatest tight end to ever play the game walks away before he even turns 30, or if big-time contributors from last year\u2019s championship team leave during free agency, or if the quarterback is 42 bleeping years old. If it weren\u2019t so thrilling, it would be exhausting.\n\nSometimes the Patriots start slowly. They can be sluggish through the early months of the season. Bill Belichick likes to experiment, always with an eye towards December and January: he\u2019s not playing for October. But sometimes everything slots perfectly into place. His teams coalesce into a juggernaut from the get go. After their 33-3 thumping of the Steelers on the opening Sunday of the 2019 season, it looks like it will be the latter.\n\nPittsburgh are expected to be one of the top contenders in the AFC. The Patriots dispatched them with the kind of brutal efficiency that signaled to the league that they are as good as ever. The Steelers couldn\u2019t move the ball on offense. The Patriots revamped offensive line effortlessly pushed the Steelers front seven backward. Receivers ran wide open. Tom Brady threw for 341 yards. It could have easily been 500. And he did so without Antonio Brown, the team\u2019s latest addition and one of the best receivers in football.\n\n(Brown is currently under investigation from the league after a civil suit that claims he raped his former trainer. Whether or not he ever sees the field for the Patriots remains an open question. Brown\u2019s attorney says his client denies the allegations.)\n\nThe results are the same. But the style, as ever, is evolving in real time. Belichick is a shapeshifter. It\u2019s the key to his unprecedented success. Losing Rob Gronkowski \u2013 the greatest to ever play tight end \u2013 was an incalculable blow. Most teams would dip into the draft to find their next star or scotch-tape their way through a season with a grizzly veteran and a talented yet unrefined rookie.\n\nNot Belichick. He overhauled the team\u2019s offensive design, subbing in a wide receiver for a tight end. During their win over the Steelers, the Patriots ran 25 plays without a tight end on the field. During the entire 2018 season, New England ran only 24 offensive plays with zero tight ends on the field. Belichick redefined the geography of the Patriots offense.\n\nIf there is one thing that distinguishes the coaches who have had sustained periods of success \u2013 Belichick, Bill Walsh, Chuck Noll \u2013 it is that they have always been able to evolve. They are crazed self-evaluators: great is never good enough. They figure out when it\u2019s time to bin a winning formula and implement a new one. Nobody has consistently adapted as much as Belichick, this is just his latest volume. And this may be his most devastating team since the Patriots went 16-0 in the 2007 season.\n\nThe Dolphins are built to lose. And it looks like their players hate it Read more\n\nYet dig deep enough and you find the question marks. Offensive lines and pass rush win Super Bowls. The right line can elevate an average quarterback into a championship-caliber one. Consistent pressure can vaporize the skills of even the very best.\n\nCreating pressure on the opposing quarterback is the Patriots\u2019 biggest weakness. They pressured the Steelers on just 6% of dropbacks in week one, dead stinking last in the NFL (the league average last season was 23%). No team during the 2018 season had a single game where they pressured the quarterback on fewer than 8% of snaps and won.\n\nHaving a $25m star pass-rusher is not part of the Patriot Way. They\u2019ve had a pair on their roster in recent years, but they let Chandler Jones and Trey Flowers walk. Instead, the Patriots scheme pressures. They have the best secondary in the league. The Patriots look to contain and confuse quarterbacks on the back end, buying the team\u2019s pass rush a couple of extra beats to get home. It was enough against the Steelers, but pressuring on fewer than 15-20% per game is an unsustainable model.\n\nThe Patriots pressured opponents on 33% of dropbacks in 2018, the sixth-best mark in the league. But when Flowers walked out the door he took his 42.5 pressures with him. Rather than pen Flowers to a big deal, the Patriots are looking to recreate his figure by committee. Michael Bennett joined in the offseason, fresh of a 34-pressure season in Philadelphia, a number good for 23rd in the league. Deatrich Wise and rookie Chase Winovich, both young, talented players, will look to make up the difference.\n\nThere are also potential problems among the men employed to protect Brady. Tackle Trent Brown left in the offseason; center David Andrews, one of the league\u2019s best, is out for the season with blood clots; right tackle Marcus Cannon went down in week one with an injury. He will miss time, but not the whole season.\n\nThat group was dominant last season. They conceded pass pressure on just 22% of snaps, the best in the league. For the uninitiated, that\u2019s a bonkers number. Some of that was thanks to Brady getting rid of the ball quickly, but mostly it was due to the big guys up front. Can their replacements maintain that level? Week one suggests it\u2019s possible. But the offensive line\u2019s margin for error is slim to none. If the team suffers even more attrition over the course of the season, it could derail everything they\u2019re trying to do on offense.\n\nWhich brings us to Brady. He will turn 43 this season, but he looked 23 on Sunday. He remains homicidally competitive. Never has he been surrounded by such receiving talent: Julian Edelman, a Super Bowl MVP and Brady\u2019s best buddy; Josh Gordon, revitalized, sober, a Hall of Fame talent who was downright unstoppable on Sunday night; N\u2019Keal Harry, the only wide receiver selected with a first-round draft pick in the Brady-Belichick era; Phillip Dorsett, one of the quickest players in the league. And if Brown\u2019s legal issues don\u2019t stop him playing, they will have one of the finest receivers of his generation.\n\nHow do you stop that? You probably don\u2019t.\n\nThe most fearsome franchise in US sports won it all again and still improved. They\u2019re deep, multi-faceted and laden with star power on both sides of the ball, as well as facing the easiest schedule of any team in the league by DVOA. Issues in the trenches may doom them, as it has many sides dubbed a \u201cdream team\u201d. But there\u2019s something different about this because everything is always different with the Patriots.
