For the past few years, the concept of a \u201claptop\u201d has been constant. There are the traditional, clamshell designs, which are largely derivative of Apple\u2019s MacBook Air design. There are the 360-style convertibles with screens that flip all the way around for tablet functions, like Lenovo\u2019s Yoga line. And then there are those convertible laptops with fully detachable screens that can be used as standalone tablets, such as Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro or Surface Book.\n\nThe $1,299 and up Spectre Folio fits into\u2026 none of those descriptions. It doesn\u2019t look like a MacBook Air, it doesn\u2019t have a 360-degree hinge, and it doesn\u2019t have a detachable display. Yet, it\u2019s still a 2-in-1 with the ability to switch between a standard clamshell laptop and a tablet-style device. We haven\u2019t seen a laptop with a hardware design this different since the heady days of Windows 8\u2019s craziness.\n\nOn top of that, the Spectre Folio is wrapped in leather, making it visually and tactilely different from any computer I\u2019ve ever used before. It is truly one of the most interesting laptops released in years.\n\nInteresting and unique do not mean good, however, and the Spectre Folio is not a perfect device. But the problems it has can\u2019t be blamed on the clever hinge or the leather finish.\n\nOur review of HP Spectre Folio 13 Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Unique design and leather finish\n\nFlexible hinge\n\nGreat battery life and solid performance Bad Stuff 16:9 screen is dated and cramped for productivity work\n\nSpeakers are tinny\n\nTrackpad is horrible Buy for $1,299.99 from HP Buy for $1,399.99 from Best Buy\n\nThe most obvious thing that separates the Spectre Folio from, well, every other laptop you can buy is that it is wrapped in actual leather. It\u2019s not a case \u2014 the leather cannot be removed because it\u2019s integrated into the computer\u2019s metal frame. And it\u2019s not plasticky, fake leather, either \u2014 it is genuine leather that HP says is harvested from the scraps produced during the manufacturing of other leather goods. It looks, smells, and feels like the real thing because it is real.\n\nThe leather, which comes in brown or burgundy, not only gives the Folio a distinct look, but also gives it a different feel compared to other laptops. The finish wraps around the top deck, so your palms are always resting on soft cowhide instead of cold metal. The borders of the leather wrapping extend beyond the metal frame, so there are no real exposed edges or sharp corners. In those respects, it behaves a lot like a case you might put on a standard laptop, but since it\u2019s integrated into the Folio and not removable, it\u2019s far less bulky than a case might be.\n\nLeather is used in a variety of applications because it\u2019s durable and actually looks better the more you use it. The leather finish on the Folio should prove to be more hardy than the Alcantara fabric Microsoft uses on the Surface Laptop, though I haven\u2019t used the Folio long enough to fully put that to the test. In the month or so I\u2019ve been testing the device, including using it on road trips and at demanding press events like CES, it has maintained its appearance and still basically looks brand-new.\n\nThe leather finish makes the Folio heavier than expected\n\nLeather is not a light material, however, and the Folio is a heavier computer than many other laptops in its class. At 3.26 lbs, it\u2019s more than half a pound heavier than the Surface Laptop 2 and a quarter pound more than even a 13-inch MacBook Pro. That doesn\u2019t sound like a lot on paper, but it is something I immediately noticed when picking up the computer. The Folio\u2019s very thin design doesn\u2019t help here, either \u2014 it weighs more than you\u2019d expect when looking at it.\n\nEven with that compromise, I still really like the finish of the Folio and hope it\u2019s something that HP uses more in the future.\n\nThe other defining characteristic of the Folio is its hinge, which allows the computer to quickly transition from standard laptop mode to tent and tablet modes. The frame has a flex point right in the middle of the screen, and you have to snap the bottom of the screen off the frame (it uses magnets) and pull it forward to switch positions. It almost feels like you are breaking the screen in half in the process, but the action is easy to perform quickly.\n\nPull the screen forward and place the bottom of it between the keyboard and the trackpad and the Folio is in its \u201ctent\u201d mode, which is ideal for watching movies or Netflix on a plane. Interestingly, you still have full access to the trackpad in this mode, so if you don\u2019t want to make use of the touchscreen, you don\u2019t have to. But annoyingly, there are no physical volume controls when you move the screen to this position, so the only way to adjust the volume is by using Windows 10\u2019s on-screen controls.\n\nYou can also continue to push the screen until it rests entirely on top of the lower deck, forming a large tablet surface to work on. HP includes an active pen in the box with the Folio, housed in a goofy-but-functional loop on the right side of the screen. You can write or draw on the screen when in tablet mode, and the hinge is strong enough to hold the screen at a variety of positions between tent mode and fully flat.\n\nThe Folio\u2019s internal components aren\u2019t as interesting as its external design, but there are more than a few points to highlight. The Folio uses either an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 Y-series processor, which has no fan and is paired with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Y-series chips are not the most powerful processors available, and can easily get bogged down and overloaded, but I\u2019ve been impressed with the Folio\u2019s performance for day-to-day productivity work. I\u2019m able to run as many tabs as I want in either Edge or Chrome, along with Slack, mail, Word, Twitter, and many other apps without hitting frustrating slowdowns or bottlenecks. I even used the Folio for photo editing in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, all without pulling any of my hair out. My $1,800 review unit has the Core i7 chip and 16GB of RAM, so it\u2019s basically maxed out in terms of specs, but the performance delta between the Core i5 and Core i7 isn\u2019t huge and I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if most people are just fine with the lower-end model.\n\nNo fan means the Folio operates silently, and it surprisingly stays cool, too. I\u2019m not sure if the leather helps insulate the heat from reaching my legs or if HP\u2019s temperature management just works better here than in other laptops, but the Folio remains cool the entire time I use it.\n\nThe fanless, Y-series processor is surprisingly competent and enables excellent battery life\n\nThe best part of the Folio\u2019s Y-Series chip is that it enables incredible battery life. I\u2019m able to easily use the Folio for more than a full workday without plugging in, even when I\u2019m using battery-hogging apps like Slack. That\u2019s more than I\u2019m accustomed to from other premium Windows or Mac laptops.\n\nFor I/O, the Folio has three USB-C ports, two of which are Thunderbolt 3, but no USB-A ports. HP includes a dongle in the box for your old USB-A devices, and the USB-C charger works with any of the Folio\u2019s ports. There\u2019s also a 3.5mm headphone jack, which will be important later on.\n\nThe Folio\u2019s keyboard is also excellent: it has comfortably sized keys, good key travel, and backlighting. But the component that has me most excited is the optional integrated LTE, which works on AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. The SIM card is cleverly hidden inside the display hinge, and it admittedly took me quite a few minutes to locate it when I was setting up the computer. LTE on the Folio is just as good as LTE on the Surface Pro: it allows me to connect to the internet from basically anywhere without having to worry about Wi-Fi availability or hassle with tethering my phone. It\u2019s something every computer should have an option for at this point, but it\u2019s still very rare to see.\n\nMost of the Folio experience is excellent, but there are three areas that could either use improvement or are just downright bad.\n\nThe 13-inch display is mostly fine. I\u2019ve been testing the 1080p version (a 4K option is available, but at this size is completely unnecessary) and it\u2019s bright, with good colors and viewing angles, and only consumes 1W of power, which helps with that long battery life. But it\u2019s stuck with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which feels horribly cramped compared to the 3:2 screens available on Surface computers. There\u2019s also a giant, unsightly \u201cchin\u201d at the bottom that would all but disappear if the Folio had a 3:2 screen. At least there\u2019s a Windows Hello-enabled webcam at the top, where it belongs.\n\nThe Folio\u2019s positive experience is wrecked by lousy trackpad drivers\n\nRemember how I said it would be important that the Folio has a headphone jack? That\u2019s because the Folio\u2019s speakers are horrible. They are sharp and sibilant with virtually zero bass reproduction. They do get loud, and are quite functional for video calls, but the audio is miserable for music or movies. And when the Folio is in the tent mode, the sound echoes around in the cavity that\u2019s formed behind the screen, making it even worse.\n\nBut the worst part of the Folio is its trackpad. Not because of the hardware \u2014 it\u2019s glass and smooth to the touch \u2014 but because HP is still using horrible Synaptics drivers instead of the far superior Windows Precision drivers from Microsoft. There is support for multitouch gestures and scrolling, but the response is laggy and it\u2019s just frustrating to use. The entire time I was using this computer at CES I was cursing myself for not bringing a mouse along with me \u2014 it\u2019s that bad. HP is the last major laptop manufacturer that hasn\u2019t switched its premium line of computers over to Precision drivers and the Folio experience suffers because of it.\n\nThose faults are enough to give me pause when recommending the Spectre Folio, which is disappointing, because it does so many other things so well. And it\u2019s a unique fish in a sea of look-alike laptops, which is refreshing and exciting. But I\u2019ll wait until the next version, when HP hopefully fixes the display, speakers, and especially the trackpad.", "description": "HP\u2019s Spectre Folio is unlike any other laptop: it has a entirely unique hinge design and is wrapped in actual leather.
