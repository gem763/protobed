It wouldn\u2019t matter who the Democrats nominated for 2020. They could run Bernie Sanders on a ticket with Elizabeth Warren and promise to make Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez secretary of the Treasury and Ilhan Omar secretary of defense, and they\u2019d still win.\n\nA significant portion of the Republican Party would consider a Senate conviction of Trump a dastardly betrayal. Perhaps most would get over it, as partisan feelings kicked in around a national election, but not all. And so a party that has won the popular vote in a presidential election only once since 1988 would hurtle toward November 2020 divided. How does anyone think that would turn out?\n\nsee also Lindsey Graham slams House impeachment probe, demands transparency Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday lashed out at the Democrat-led...\n\nA lot of Trump supporters are going to want to blame the Republican establishment even if Trump loses in 2020 with the backing of the united party apparatus. Imagine what they will think if a couple of dozen Republican senators decide to deny him the opportunity to run for \u00adre-election, without a single voter having a say on his ultimate fate. It\u2019s hard to come up with any scenario better designed to stoke the populist furies of Trump\u2019s most devoted voters.\n\nTrump himself isn\u2019t going to get convicted by the Senate and say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a little disappointed to be honest. But it was a close call, and Mike Pence is a great guy, and I\u2019m just grateful I had the opportunity to serve in the White House for more than three years.\u201d\n\nHe won\u2019t go away quietly to lick his wounds. He won\u2019t delete his Twitter \u00adaccount. He won\u2019t make it easy on anyone. He will vent his anger and resentment at every opportunity. It will be \u201chuman scum\u201d every single day.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t as though the media is going to lose its interest in the most luridly telegenic politician that we have ever seen. The mainstream press would be \u00addelighted to see Trump \u00addestroyed yet sad to bid him farewell. The obvious way to square the circle would be to continue to give Trump lavish coverage in his post-presidency. He\u2019d be out of the White House but still driving screaming CNN chyrons every other hour.\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s removal wouldn\u2019t be a fresh start for Pence and the GOP; it would be more like getting stuck in the poisonous epilogue of the Trump era, awaiting the inevitable advent of the Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg era.\n\nAll of this is why the \u201ccracks-in-the-Republican-Senate\u201d coverage is so ridiculous and overwrought. It depends on the idea that GOP senators \u2014 who, it is true, are continually frustrated by Trump\u2019s controversies \u2014 are on the verge of engineering their party\u2019s own destruction.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to come up with a scenario in which Ukraine developments are much worse than imaginable right now, and Trump\u2019s support craters, even among Republicans. Then, you might have GOP senators voting to convict. This is just \u00adanother path to the immolation of the party in 2020, though; there is no way it would snap back from a Nixonian meltdown at the top in less than a year.\n\nIn short, Mike Pence might be elected president one day, but it isn\u2019t going to be while presiding over a party that has just jettisoned Trump.\n\nRich Lowry is the editor of National Review and author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United and Free.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry", "description": "It\u2019s a trope of pro-impeachment commentary that it should be simple for Republican senators to swap out President Trump, who puts them in awkward positions every day, for Vice President Mike Pence, an upstanding Reagan conservative who could start with a fresh slate in the runup to the 2020 election \u2014 the only flaw is that is entirely removed from reality.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trump.11.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
