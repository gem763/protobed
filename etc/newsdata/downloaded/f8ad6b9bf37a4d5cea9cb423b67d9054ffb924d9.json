If soldiers have broken the law and if there is evidence to back up charges against them, then of course they must face the rigours of the law and take the consequences.\n\n\"But in the vast majority of cases, British soldiers, particularly in the campaign in Northern Ireland, got up in the morning to do their duty to keep the peace according to the rules of engagement we had, in sharp contrast to terrorists who got up in the morning whose aim was to maim and kill.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are facing prosecution\n\nThe government source told the BBC: \"We are determined to make progress and legislate on the issue of legacy prosecutions.\n\n\"Our clear and overriding objective remains to provide a better way to address the past for all those affected by the Troubles.\"\n\nThe source said the Northern Ireland Office has consulted on the question of legacy prosecutions and the government is engaging with the main parties in Northern Ireland, MPs in Westminster and wider society across Northern Ireland to reach a broad consensus.\n\nSix former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are facing prosecution.\n\nThe cases relate to the killings of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972; as well as the deaths in separate incidents of Daniel Hegarty, John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann and Aidan McAnespie.\n\nNot all of the charges are for murder.", "description": "An ex-Army chief is 'disappointed' over reports a proposed law will be left out of the monarch's address.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0672/production/_109205610_hi056946039.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
