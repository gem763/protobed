I'm out tonight for a simple reason. You don't shoot a teenager at point blank range,\" said Alex Chan, an interior designer at a protest in the shopping district of Causeway Bay.\n\n\"These protests will continue and we won't give up.\"\n\nThe demonstrations have stretched the police force and transport networks to their limits.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp closed stations in districts including Po Lam, Hang Hau and Tseung Kwan O just before midnight on Wednesday as the violence picked up. All affected stations reopened on Thursday.\n\nA pro-democracy protester prepares to throw a Molotov cocktail at a police station in Tuen Wan district on Wednesday in Hong Kong.

When facing such a series of massive rioting incidents, we cannot work alone \u2014 clapping only with one hand \u2014 without appropriate measures and support from top level,\" Lam said.\n\nThe public has become increasingly hostile toward police amid accusations of heavy-handed tactics. Police say they have shown restraint.\n\nThe lawyer for an Indonesian journalist injured when police fired a projectile during protests on Sunday said she had been blinded in one eye.\n\nThe European Union said in a statement it was deeply troubled by the escalation of violence and the only way forward was through \"restraint, de-escalation and dialog.\"\n\nThe city's tourism board announced the cancellation of a major cycling tournament, the Hong Kong Cyclothon, and the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, citing \"unforeseen circumstances in the coming weeks.\"\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.", "description": "The lawyer for an 18-year-old Hong Kong student protester shot in the chest by police was due to appear in court on his behalf on Thursday, after the teenager was charged over his role in violent demonstrations.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5307028.1570089708!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1173143562.jpg"}
