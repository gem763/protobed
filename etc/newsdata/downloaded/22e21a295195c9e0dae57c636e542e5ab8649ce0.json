It Doesn\u2019t Work.", "language": "en", "text": "Daniella Da Silva made her first attempt last year at the trendy cake that is sweeping Instagram: a confection dubbed the \u201crainbow explosion cake,\u201d whose sprinkle-filled center is supposed to unleash a cascade of colorful tiny candies when sliced open. She was eager to see her friends\u2019 reaction. But the big moment underwhelmed: The sprinkles merely trickled down. \u201cIt was a little bit of a letdown,\u201d says Ms. Da Silva.\n\nSince then she has learned to cut a larger hole to create a more dramatic sprinkle outflow. She is careful with the terminology too. Calling it an explosion cake creates confusion: \u201cI have to reassure everyone that their cake will not actually explode,\u201d she says. Instead she calls it a pi\u00f1ata cake to \u201cmanage expectations,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Da Silva is one of many bakers grappling with the challenges of today\u2019s social media It cake, whose TV and internet stardom has inspired home chefs. The cake been featured on the \u201cToday\u201d show, Rachael Ray and made several appearances on Kim Kardashian\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nThe cake\u2019s signature feature is a hollowed out center filled with sprinkles. When it\u2019s sliced open, the stack of sprinkles pours out. But for some home chefs, it can seem like less of an explosion and more of a gentle trickle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty dull from a flair perspective. It really doesn\u2019t have that big of a wow factor when you think about it,\u201d says Sean Coary, assistant professor of food marketing at St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia.\n\nStill, many home bakers are eager to give it a try. This May, Williams Sonoma started selling the Flour Shop Rainbow Explosion Cake Kit. The mix has become Williams Sonoma\u2019s best-selling cake kit, the company says. Components include food coloring, cake mix, sprinkles and instructions for baking a rainbow-colored six-tiered cake; the kit is sold in a nontoxic paint can. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know about this cake and you bring this thing out, people\u2019s jaws just drop\u2014it\u2019s been exciting,\u201d says Neil Lick, the store\u2019s vice president of food, books and the test kitchen in San Francisco. Some stores sold out of the kit completely and are hosting baking workshops for customers. A Christmas-themed version and more branded accessories are launching later this year, adds Mr. Lick.\n\nThe company developed the product after working for more than a year with Amirah Kassem, owner of Flour Shop bakery in New York. Ms. Kassem helped popularize the cake on social media and is credited with inventing the term \u201crainbow explosion.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an explosion of fun\u2014no one thinks the cakes explode,\u201d she says.\n\nWilliams Sonoma sells a Flour Shop Rainbow Explosion Cake Kit, which includes food coloring, sprinkles and frosting mix. Photo: Williams Sonoma\n\n\u201cAmirah\u2019s cake was an established, trademarked, highly coveted product and an internet sensation by the time we started producing the kit for it so there was no need to change the name and no customer has ever complained about it,\u201d Williams Sonoma said in an emailed statement.\n\nAfter Aideen Turner spent nearly three hours baking the cake from the Williams Sonoma kit in her Sea Isle City, N.J., vacation home for 16 children and their parents over Labor Day weekend, she asked family members to gather around for a surprise as she cut the cake. The guest who was least impressed? Her husband: \u201cHe said, \u2018I thought something was actually going to jump out of it,\u2019 \u201d says Ms. Turner, 49, who adds that it took three rounds of vacuuming to get rid of the fallen sprinkles.\n\nThe Flour Shop\u2019s Ms. Kassem recommends several techniques to avoid an underwhelming sprinkle-trickle. She says the cascading effect increases when bakers build up a taller 6-inch round cake with a 1.5-inch hole in the center for the sprinkles\u2014she suggests stacking four or more cake layers to maximize the outpour. \u201cTo get the insides to come out more, height is one of the big differentiators,\u201d she says.\n\nChefs often experiment with different types of candy fillings in addition to sprinkles, but Ms. Kassem says not all of them work well. Gumballs can be a choking hazard for younger children and larger candies won\u2019t pour out. \u201cI can tell you from experience that cereal is not good and marshmallows are not good, because they get stuck together,\u201d adds Ms. Kassem.\n\nAt General Mills , a Betty Crocker recipe for a \u201crainbow-surprise-inside cake\u201d deliberately avoids the word explosion. \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d says Cathy Swanson Wheaton, executive editor for Betty Crocker and Pillsbury Cookbooks at General Mills Inc. The company \u201ctakes a cautious approach, so we chose to focus on the surprise element instead of explosions,\u201d she adds. Page views for its 2014 recipe, which calls for sprinkles and M&Ms, increased 38% last year.\n\nBakers must guard against setting off the big moment prematurely. After using a Betty Crocker recipe to bake a sprinkles cake at her granddaughter Ella\u2019s request last year, university professor Carol Simon hopped into a taxi to hand deliver the cake to the science-themed birthday party. When the driver hit the brakes, her rainbow-colored masterpiece \u201chad the explosion,\u201d said Ms. Simon. Having spent hours on research and baking, Ms. Simon decided to bring the smashed cake anyway. \u201cIt looked disastrous and the 4-year-olds had a meltdown,\u201d she says.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is social media ruining cake? Join the conversation below.\n\nSome bakers manage to achieve success. When Melanie Berg\u2019s best friend asked her to create a wedding cake in a pinch two years ago, she obliged. Inspired by an online video, the 29-year-old carved out the circular center of a tiered white cake. She poured rainbow sprinkles into the center and sealed it with a layer of cake and frosting.\n\nThe wedding cake Melanie Berg made for her best friend featured sprinkles that poured out.

The Chattanooga-based adolescent addiction counselor has since launched a baking side gig.\n\nFor those tired of dealing with tiny sprinkles, Mr. Coary, the food marketing professor, says not to worry. He predicts the rainbow explosion cake will soon be supplanted by other social-media fueled trends. There\u2019s the \u201cgeode,\u201d a cake that looks like it\u2019s filled with sparkling crystals, and the \u201cfault line,\u201d which is designed with a crack to reveal the interior of the cake, may soon dominate social-media baking trends. As for the rainbow explosion, he says, \u201cit will go away just like the cronut did.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alina Dizik at alina.dizik@wsj.com", "description": "It\u2019s designed to unleash a cascade of candies, and yet...", "authors": ["Alina Dizik"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103976/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
