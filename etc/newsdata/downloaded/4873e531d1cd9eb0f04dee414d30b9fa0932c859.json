According to an attendee at the breakfast, Trump brandished a printed copy of the memo of his now-infamous Ukraine phone call, flaunting it as he blasted Democratic lawmakers for being mean to him. After waving the document around and receiving cheers from the gathering of Republican donors and supporters, the president boasted about how much money\u2014$13 million in 24 hours\u2014he had raised for his reelection effort, the attendee noted.\n\nIt was yet another illustration of how Trump\u2019s big week in New York has been overshadowed and bedeviled by revelations that he and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani had urged Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice president who remains likely to be Trump\u2019s 2020 election opponent.\n\nOver the past few days, the president has helped raise millions for the 2020 fight and has been lavished with praise by world leaders. And yet he\u2019s remained, through it all, obsessed over the scandal unfolding back in Washington, D.C., as Democratic members of Congress inched closer to impeachment proceedings. According to three people with knowledge of the situation, Trump has compulsively monitored TV and cable-news coverage of the Ukraine-related scandal and has repeatedly asked those around him about the whistleblower and rumors that the complainant is hostile to or biased against him.\n\nThrough it all, the president\u2019s demeanor and approach to the rapidly unfolding scandal has vacillated between spoiling for a fight and hoping for a d\u00e9tente. Often, it depended on who he was talking to or what setting he found himself in. According to those in attendance at his Thursday breakfast fundraiser, the president was upbeat and fired up, telling donors that he and his political team were ready to punch back hard. In private, however, there was genuine consternation regarding how a brutal impeachment process would affect his legacy and his White House, with much of his staff sharing those same anxieties. Those close to Trump say the president never expected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to back any major impeachment moves\u2014at least not until this week.\n\nAlthough one senior White House aide said the mood there \u201cis fine,\u201d others said Trump has taken the past week personally, as if Democrats and what his allies call the \u201cdeep state\u201d had just crashed his party.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president took to Twitter to accuse liberals of deliberately ruining and degrading his \u201cimportant day\u201d at the UN. And according to a Los Angeles Times report, Trump also used his time at a private event for U.S. officials at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York on Thursday morning to rage about the whistleblower and whoever supplied that individual with information.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person\u2014who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason\u2014we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what punishments the president has envisioned and the White House did not provide clarification on it when asked. Hours before Trump spoke, the whistleblower complaint detailing allegations that the president pressured the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2020 election and that White House officials attempted to cover up records of that call had been made public. And shortly thereafter, Joseph Maguire, Trump's acting director of national intelligence, began his congressional testimony, during which he affirmed the complaint as credible.\n\nAlready roiled by the publication of a call memorandum the day before detailing the pressure he had placed on the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, Trump now watched as Maguire fended off accusations that the White House had illegally tried to withhold records of that call and the complaint as well.\n\nAnd yet, despite having compared the whistleblower and his or her sources to spies who had committed treason, when Trump returned to the White House on Thursday, the senior White House official said, he told his lieutenants that there was no current need to start a \u201cwar room\u201d or any special initiative to combat impeachment fever.\n\nA report that Trump was bringing back his former 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to spearhead such an effort, the official said, was an attempt at \u201cself-aggrandizement\u201d by those officials on the outside. And the White House, indeed, subsequently denied the reports. In the president\u2019s inner circle, some continued to believe that the rush to embrace impeachment by Democratic leadership amounted to a politically tinged bluff.\n\n\u201cThis is all theater,\u201d Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers who worked with Giuliani to defend the president during the Mueller probe, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. \u201cNancy Pelosi didn\u2019t announce anything that hasn\u2019t been going on already,\u201d he added, referring to how House Democrats had weeks ago declared they were launching proceedings simply to decide if they should impeach Trump.\n\nWhile the White House was attempting to project an all-is-calm demeanor, outside groups were preparing for war. According to a senior Republican National Committee official, the RNC\u2019s in house research team has begun putting together materials to counter-attack House Democrats and a \u201cwar room\u201d of its own to deal with Trump impeachment.\n\nAs Trumpworld\u2019s strategy for how to handle growing impeachment woes comes together, the president and his staff will have to adjust to a reality in which even less progress is made on his agenda than was before.\n\nEarlier in the week, a senior administration official bemoaned how much of a gigantic pain impeachment proceedings would be for the White House staff to manage. The official said that is, in part, because being impeached would inevitably devastate Trump\u2019s focus, mood, actions, and agenda for the remainder of his first term. And White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has said that \u201cHouse Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus\u201d on impeachment.", "description": "The president\u2019s mood has swung between hope for a resolution and desire for vengeance.
