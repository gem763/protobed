Only one week. In some other years, the Browns would have gladly taken one positive week.\n\nNot this season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe weight of expectations can be heavy. A good finish to last season, a strong rookie year by Baker Mayfield, an offseason trade for Odell Beckham Jr. and a roster that looked great on paper made the Browns darlings heading into this season. There probably aren\u2019t any more grand expectations after a 31-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe Browns looked mostly flat for the first three weeks. But a 40-point, 530-yard explosion at the Ravens in Week 4 made it look like the Browns might have been worthy of all those positive preseason predictions after all.\n\nThen on Monday night, the Browns were absolutely embarrassed. They\u2019re 2-3 and one of the NFL\u2019s bigger disappointments to this point.\n\n49ers overwhelm Browns\n\nThe 49ers are 4-0 and look pretty good. Kyle Shanahan has turned a corner in his third 49ers season. His team looks like it should be in playoff contention all year. They might even be the best team in the NFC. The 49ers and the Patriots are the last two undefeated teams in the NFL.\n\nStill, it was a disheartening performance by Cleveland. It didn\u2019t take long for it to turn sour. On the 49ers\u2019 first offensive play of the game, running back Matt Breida sprinted past the defense for an 83-yard touchdown. It never got better after that.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn every Browns game except the Ravens win \u2014 even a Week 2 win over the Jets, who are terrible, wasn\u2019t sharp \u2014 the same issues have shown up. The offensive line is not good. Left tackle Greg Robinson was a turnstile as defensive end Nick Bosa blew past him play after play. Cleveland didn\u2019t do enough to address the line in the offseason, and should regret trading away top guard Kevin Zeitler to the Giants. Pressure has affected Mayfield, who has not replicated a record-setting rookie season. He might have had the worst game of his life on Monday. The former No. 1 overall pick was 8-of-22 for 100 yards, with two interceptions. That\u2019s a 13.4 passer rating. The Browns didn\u2019t score a touchdown. Cleveland sat down Mayfield with about five minutes left, letting Garrett Gilbert play out the rest of the game. It was shockingly bad for a player who set an NFL record for touchdown passes by a rookie last season.\n\nThe defense got worked over too. Breida\u2019s early touchdown run was a sign. The 49ers were more physical up front and ran the ball at will. Jimmy Garoppolo was fine, but he didn\u2019t need to do much. When a defense can\u2019t stop the run at all there\u2019s not much reason to pass it too often, and that\u2019s what happened to the Browns on Monday night.\n\nFor some reason, coach Freddie Kitchens had Beckham back to field a punt with about seven minutes left and the Browns trailing 28-3. Beckham ran around with nowhere to go, then lost a fumble. That summed up the night.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns gets up after being hit by the San Francisco 49ers defense. (Getty Images)\n\nFreddie Kitchens not having a good debut\n\nHue Jackson was fired on Oct. 29 last year. So at this time a year ago, Kitchens was still a mostly anonymous running backs coach.\n\nKitchens got the interim offensive coordinator job after Jackson and Todd Haley were fired, had a good half-season calling plays, and parlayed that into the permanent head-coaching job. It was a meteoric rise. It was also a gamble by the Browns on a good two-month stretch running the offense. The season is still young, the Browns are only a game out of first place in a soft AFC North, but it\u2019s hard to say the gamble to hire Kitchens is paying off. It looks like he\u2019s struggling with the double-duty of calling plays and being head coach.\n\nKitchens is under the spotlight, but nothing is really working. He\u2019s not the one failing to block for Mayfield. He\u2019s not missing on the throws. It\u2019s not Kitchens\u2019 fault Antonio Callaway dropped an inaccurate but catchable pass near the goal line and it turned into a 49ers interception. Kitchens is not responsible for the Browns\u2019 front seven getting pushed around all night by the 49ers\u2019 offensive line. Everything was bad on Monday night.\n\nThe Browns are used to getting blown out. Their poor history is well known. That wasn\u2019t supposed to continue this season. This was supposed to be the start of a new Browns era.\n\nCleveland still has 11 games to make that happen, but aside from one good game, it just looks like the same old Browns.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
