Stalemate in 8th day; Trump arrives", "language": "en", "text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Negotiators have met for 22 straight days. Students have missed eight days of school and counting. And still the Chicago teachers' strike presses on.\n\nPublic school teachers and city officials started the week at loggerheads over money for classrooms, as families in the nation's third-largest city again had to find options for around 350,000 kids who are still missing class.\n\nThe main issue: The Chicago Teachers Union says it can eke out more concessions from the city, especially related to teachers' prep time. City officials say they've made plenty of concessions and can't flex the budget anymore.\n\nOne bright spot: The city has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing 7,500 school support staff, who have been striking alongside some 25,000 CPS teachers. But that won't restart classes.\n\nAmid the strike, President Donald Trump came to town: A fundraiser, and a tenuous meeting with Chicago police\n\nWhat's the hangup between the city and the teachers' union?\n\nA strike lasting eight school days \u2014 headed to nine on Tuesday \u2014 is long even by recent standards, as teacher walkouts have gained momentum around the country. (A strike in January in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, lasted six school days.) It's reportedly the longest teacher strike Chicago has seen since 1987, when teachers demonstrated for 19 days.\n\nEducators, students, and union laborers rally at Union Park during the Chicago Teachers Union strike Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in Chicago. More\n\nThe major hangup in Chicago: City officials say they've offered the union more money \u2014 at least $500 million more than what's being spent now, by the time the contract would reach its fifth year. That would go toward reducing class sizes and teacher raises. City officials also say in 22 straight days of negotiations, they put many of the union's other requests into the contract language \u2014 a major talking point for the union before the strike.\n\nBut the union says the offer doesn't go far enough to address the deep needs of Chicago Public Schools children.\n\n\"We are enormously disappointed that CTU simply cannot take yes for an answer,\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a news conference Sunday night.\n\nIn a tweet Sunday night, CPS said the offer includes $110 million to provide a nurse and social worker in every school. The district said it also has offered $25 million to lower class sizes. City officials say they have offered to prioritize lowering class sizes in the most high-poverty schools.\n\nEarlier tonight, CTU rejected a nearly half-billion dollar offer. In addition to double-digit raises for all staff, our offer included another 110M to provide a nurse and social worker for every school, and prioritized support for high-need schools. #PutItInWriting pic.twitter.com/aIhWhqTPGq \u2014 ChicagoPublicSchools (@ChiPubSchools) October 28, 2019\n\nThe union, however, says the class size remedy only addresses one-third of Chicago's public schools.\n\nCPS will finally remedy class size for 1/3 of CPS schools. That's great. That's equity. But as VP @stacydavisgates said last night, \"I don't go into a classroom and decide to teach 1/3 [of the students]. I go into a classroom and I have to educate everyone who sits there.\" \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019\n\nUnion officials also want elementary teachers to have a 30-minute period in the morning for collaborative preparation time. They say that's a huge sticking point in the current negotiations.\n\n\"The district continues to refuse to restore morning preps,\" the Chicago Teachers Union posted on its Facebook page Monday.\n\nSupport for unions? Even when teachers strike, Americans give them high grades, poll shows. Unions fare worse\n\nHow might the strike end?\n\nCity officials say there's a cost associated with that prep time \u2014 for example, they'd have to pay teachers for a longer school day if they didn't want to cut out instructional time. And if the prep time is the top priority, the union has to accept less money for some of its other requests.", "description": "Negotiators have met for 22 straight days.
