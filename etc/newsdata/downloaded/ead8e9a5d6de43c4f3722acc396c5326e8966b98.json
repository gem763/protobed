And the opportunity to stay at the Trump National in Doonbeg, to accommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel, made it logical,\u201d Mr. Pence told reporters said. \u201cWe checked it with the State Department. They approved us staying there.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence was responding to critics who said it was unseemly and illogical for him to stay at the Trump-owned golf property on the west coast of Ireland and commute by plane Tuesday to meetings in Dublin, about 180 miles away.\n\nA California Democrat accused Mr. Pence of \u201cfunneling\u201d money to Mr. Trump, while the Democratic National Committee\u2019s \u201cwar room\u201d said it added insult to injury after the president made weekend golf jaunts to his club in Virginia, even as Hurricane Dorian threatened the Atlantic coast.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s staff said Mr. Trump\u2019s last-minute decision to send his No. 2 to Poland for World War II ceremonies sparked a logistical domino effect that forced them to shuttle to Dublin, instead of stopping through in one day between London and Doonbeg.\n\nThey said they didn\u2019t have time to vet overnight properties closer to Dublin, due to the shakeup.\n\nMr. Trump and family members stayed at their Doonbeg residence on official business recently, so the property had been fully vetted.\n\n\u201cWe took the Ireland component that was at the back end of the trip and moved it to the front, because it had already been secured by Secret Service. They had done all the advance work. And the facility, we knew, was safe and protected,\u201d Mr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, said.\n\nMr. Short said the president did not order Mr. Pence to stay at his property.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a request, like a command,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think that it was a suggestion \u2026 It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you should stay at my place.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump isn\u2019t waiving the bill, however. Taxpayers are still on the hook, while Mr. Pence agreed to pay for his mother and sister, who are tagging along.\n\nThe Pence family spent the night in Doonbeg late Monday and plan to visit Morrisey\u2019s Pub \u2014 owned by a distant cousin of the vice president \u2014 back in town late Tuesday.\n\nWhile in Dublin, the vice president urged Irish officials to work constructively with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on maintaining an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, as the British attempt to executive a \u201cBrexit\u201d from the European Union.\n\nMr. Pence said he was pleased to shore up economic and diplomatic ties, but to \u201chave an opportunity to connect to the roots of my family, I think, supports the relationship between the United States and Ireland.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was pleased to have the opportunity return to that family hometown and to be able to stay there and not just on a personal level, but also to do it in a way that helps me celebrate with the people of Ireland the connection that so many tens of millions of Americans feel to the Emerald Isle,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Democrats weren\u2019t having any of it.\n\n\u201cYou took an oath to the Constitution, not to @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Rep. Ted Lieu, California Democrat, tweeted. \u201cFunneling taxpayer money to @POTUS by staying at this Trump resort is sooooooo corrupt.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump insists he is losing money as president because he can\u2019t explore blockbuster deals, though Democrats worry he hasn\u2019t properly insulated himself from foreign influence through spending at his resort properties or hotel in downtown D.C.\n\nCritics find it unseemly that Mr. Trump spends so much time at his golf clubs while president, and reports that Attorney General Willam Barr scheduled a family Christmas party at Mr. Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel have compounded the awkward optics.\n\nHouse Democrats last week said they will investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s pitch to hold next year\u2019s G-7 summit at his Florida club, Trump National Doral Miami.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
