Can pilots be afraid of heights?", "language": "en", "text": "Do any other airports have wraparound taxiways like Victor in Atlanta? It seems like a brilliant design solution.\n\nWraparound, or end-around taxiways (EATs), as they're known in the USA, allow aircraft to taxi around the end of a runway instead of crossing it. They're both safer, reducing the risk of runway incursions, and more efficient, letting the runways be actual runways instead of traffic intersections.\n\nIn addition to Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta (ATL), you can also find them at Detroit Metro (DTW) and Dallas-Fort Worth. DFW also has two more under construction, with the first targeted for completion by 2021 and the second to follow in 2023. (New end-around taxiways must be preapproved by the Federal Aviation Administration.)\n\nAtlanta was one of the first U.S. airports to build an end-around taxiway, a design that improves runway safety and efficiency.

It would certainly be an issue for a pilot. That said, there is a difference between truly being afraid of heights and being fearful of falling, from say, the edge of a skyscraper.\n\nI know many pilots who say they don't like \"heights\" but their concern is more about feeling uncomfortable looking down from a building or other edges. However, they are comfortable when enclosed in an airplane cockpit.\n\nYou could take a flight to see how you feel and help determine if being a pilot is right for you. I wish you success.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\n\nLoading...\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2019/10/11/ask-the-captain-fear-of-heights-end-around-taxiways/3927994002/", "description": "Capt.
