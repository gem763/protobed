I suggest that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Pence open to releasing transcripts of call with Ukraine Democrats plow ahead as Trump seeks to hobble impeachment effort MORE (D-Calif.) consider looking to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) as an organizing principle, and way to articulate why impeachment is moving forward, and how it can be framed.\n\nThere is impassioned discussion (at least among Democrats) about what the focus of impeachment should be: a sharp focus on Ukraine, or a wider approach which encompasses the myriad potential \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d which the president may have committed: Ukraine extortion or bribery, Moscow building projects, contacts with Russian diplomats, the various wrongdoings of Trump foundation, accepting funds in the context of hotels throughout the world in exchange for policy change; funds spent on the inauguration, the use of undocumented workers at Trump properties\u2026 the list goes on and on.\n\nBut perhaps the Congress (and the public), like the fabled blind men touching an elephant, are actually looking at various parts of a single whole. We have a set of laws for such a situation, and we should be thinking about them now: RICO.\n\nRICO provides powerful criminal penalties for persons who engage in a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d and who have a specified relationship to an \u201centerprise\u201d that affects interstate or foreign commerce. Under the RICO statute, \u201cracketeering activity\u201d includes state offenses such as murder, robbery, extortion, and several other serious offenses, punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, and more than 100 serious federal offenses including extortion, interstate theft, narcotics violations, mail fraud fraud, securities fraud, currency reporting violations, certain immigration offenses, and terrorism related offenses. A \u201cpattern\u201d may be comprised of any combination of two or more of these state or federal crimes committed within a statutorily prescribed time period.\n\nThe basic thrust of RICO is to address situations where the enterprise takes on a criminal life of its own. Although usually associated with organized crime (what the FBI used to call \u201cLa Cosa Nostra\u201d), it has been used, with great success in a variety of situations. Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team Trump asked Tillerson to interfere in DOJ case against Giuliani client: report Barr to speak at Notre Dame law school on Friday MORE, of course, the the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York was the great pioneer of the use of RICO.\n\nWhy is RICO a good framework to think about Trump? RICO was originally conceived to recognize (in the economic sphere) that organization crime was particularly significant. Congress said: \u201cWhat is needed here . . . are new approaches that will deal not only with individuals, but also with the economic base through which those individuals constitute such a serious threat to the economic well-being of the Nation. In short, an attack must be made on their source of economic power itself, and the attack must take place on all available fronts.\u201d\n\nTrump (and his organizations) fits the bill, although the harm is not primarily economic, but national security. And RICO has been used outside the pure economic (or traditional \u201cCosa Nostra\u201d) setting, including to attack terrorism, corrupt businesses and the like. The touchstones are an enterprise and the pattern of racketeering activity.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Enterprise,\u201d including the president, family members, enablers (Giuliani, Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortGiuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info: report 9 conspiracy theories impeachment will expose and debunk House Democrats suggest Trump may have lied to Mueller about WikiLeaks contacts MORE, Michael Flynn, and a cast of hundreds) seems to fit the bill. Courts have held that an \u201centerprise\u201d can be a \u201clegal enterprise,\u201d e.g., a corporation, or even a state governmental office, or an \u201cassociation in fact,\u201d (e.g., the Genovese Crime Family). The definition is wide, and basically encompasses an organization that exists over time, has some sort of hierarchy, and acts as an organization. \u201cThe Trump Enterprise,\u201d would would include the Office of the President, as well as the Trump Foundation and the Trump Organization, as well as others.\n\nOnce you have an \u201cEnterprise,\u201d you need to show a \u201cpattern\u201d of activity, and that the pattern includes criminal offenses (all of which are either misdemeanors or felonies, and certainly fit the definition of \u201chigh crimes,\u201d as does RICO itself). These include things like extortion, bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, etc.\n\nIn short, the best way to think about the president as we head towards impeachment is using the framework of RICO. Of course, an impeachment inquiry is different that a criminal RICO prosecution. But RICO offers a well-established conceptual framework to think about the president. It can help us all organize our facts, outline an approach. It can serve as the blueprint for Articles of Impeachment, which are led by an accusation of conducting a Racketeering Enterprise, with the multitude of individual wrongdoing (which can include lying to the public, obstructing Congress, violating campaign finance law, paying off porn stars) as \u201cpredicate acts\u201d (even if they do not fall into the list of offenses, since this is an impeachment, not a prosecution).\n\nSteven Cash is Counsel at Day Pitney LLP in its Washington, D.C. and New York offices; former Chief Counsel to Sen.
