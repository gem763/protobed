House race", "language": "en", "text": "North Carolina voters are casting their final ballots Tuesday in a long-disputed House race that was upended last year by fraud allegations, prompting a redo in a district that President Trump won easily in 2016 but has since proved to be a fierce battleground.\n\nThe battle for the 9th Congressional District pits Democrat Dan McCready, a 36-year-old former Marine Corps officer and solar-energy investor who has been running for more than two years on a centrist platform, against Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop, 55, a Trump loyalist who came to prominence in 2016 after writing a controversial bill, enacted and then repealed, that would have dictated which bathrooms transgender people could use.\n\nThe stakes for the special election are substantial \u2014 for one, measuring whether Trump has been able to recover any support in affluent suburbs such as the leafy districts south and east of downtown Charlotte where McCready has found surprisingly strong support.\n\nBishop got a late personal boost from the president, who won the district by 12 percentage points and held a campaign rally in Fayetteville on Monday to get out the vote. The president told the crowd, \u201cto stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow\u2019s special election.\u201d\n\nIn Monroe, N.C., voter Carolyn Slover, 27, said Tuesday that Trump\u2019s visit \u201cmade me want to vote for Dan Bishop. It shows who he\u2019s for and how they are a partnership.\u201d\n\nThe election could indicate to what degree Republicans are in danger of losing the race next year for North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes or for Sen. Thom Tillis\u2019s reelection. A McCready win would not only raise those alarms but also send a signal to GOP lawmakers that the House majority may remain out of reach in 2020, accelerating a string of retirements.\n\nFor Democrats, a decisive Bishop win would send signals that 2018\u2019s \u201cblue wave\u201d could be ebbing in a presidential cycle, with Trump driving higher turnout among Republicans, offsetting the suburban erosion. It would also spark a round of second-guessing about national party strategy after Democratic groups spent millions of dollars in the final week to get McCready over the finish line.\n\nBy all accounts, the race was tight going into its final days, according to published polls and interviews with the candidates and party officials.\n\nIn a sign of the toss-up nature, leaders of both parties in Washington sought to downplay the implications of the race before polls closed Tuesday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who flew to the district Monday with Trump, suggested that the outcome of the race wouldn\u2019t necessarily offer clues about 2020. \u201cI can sit back, and I can tell you about all the special elections we lost in 2009 and that we won 63 seats\u201d in the 2010 midterms, he said. \u201cSpecial elections are just what they are: They\u2019re special.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) called the district \u201ca very tough swing district,\u201d even though Trump won by double digits in 2016 and Republicans have had a lock on the seat for decades.\n\n\n\nDemocrat Dan McCready talks to volunteers at his campaign office Saturday in Waxhaw, N.C. (Alan Fram/AP)\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which poured millions into the race, also declined to discuss what a McCready win would mean. \u201cIt\u2019s neck and neck,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can tell you we left everything, and I do mean everything, on the field.\u201d\n\nSeveral voters in Cumberland County who backed Bishop said Tuesday morning that Trump didn\u2019t influence their choice, but rather the Democratic Party did.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much about voting for him as it was voting against the Democrats,\u201d said Tom Driggers, 76. \u201cI simply don\u2019t believe in most of their policies. I\u2019m like George Bush, I\u2019m a conservative with common sense.\u201d\n\nWayne Canady, 71, said he didn\u2019t share any values with Democrats.\n\n\u201cYou name an issue and I\u2019m against their stance. All the troubles in the world stem from communism or socialism, look at the Democrats\u2019 policies,\u201d Canady said.\n\nIn Monroe, N.C., John Kirkpatrick, 36, said he backed McCready.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily vote for a party, I vote for an individual,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t agree with all that candidates represent, but I try to choose the best candidate to serve my community.\u201d\n\nN.C. House race boils down to Trump after two years of drama and fraud allegations\n\nThe 9th District stretches from the affluent Charlotte suburbs east to poor rural counties and north to the military stronghold of Fayetteville. The race has revolved largely around support for Trump and, to a lesser degree, by the fallout from the fraud scandal.\n\nThe state elections board found evidence that Leslie McCrae Dowless \u2014 a contractor for Mark Harris, McCready\u2019s initial Republican opponent \u2014 illegally collected and in some cases filled out absentee ballots for voters in rural Bladen County, many of them elderly and African American. The board ordered a new election in January, and Harris, who had led in unofficial returns by 905 votes, opted not to run again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dressed in blue today and voted for Dan McCready because he was robbed last time,\u201d said Jill Salas, 51, a voter in Monroe, N.C.\n\n[N.C. board declares a new election in contested House race after the GOP candidate admitted he was mistaken in his testimony]\n\nAccording to statistics issued Monday by the state elections board, 81,548 voters cast early or absentee ballots before early voting closed this weekend. Just over 39 percent of those voters are registered Democrats, compared with about 33 percent of voters who are registered Republicans.\n\nThat subset of voters, the elections board said, trended slightly whiter and more female than the party registration of the district.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic operatives acknowledged that McCready probably held a lead among the ballots cast before Tuesday, given the makeup of the electorate. But Republicans said they were confident that GOP voters, with Trump\u2019s help, would push Bishop over the finish line on Election Day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected that they would vote on Election Day,\u201d Union County GOP Chairman Allison Powers said last week. \u201cWe have a lot of traditionalists. We are trying to convince them that it\u2019s okay to vote early \u2014 especially in a race like this where they already know who they\u2019re voting for.\u201d\n\nSpending on the race is approaching $20 million, making it one of the most expensive special elections in U.S. history. McCready\u2019s campaign has spent nearly $5 million, while Bishop\u2019s is approaching $2 million. Outside Republican-aligned groups have added $6.8 million, while Democratic groups have spent about $3.5 million, according to federal records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nMuch of that spending has been funneled into TV attack ads. Republicans have targeted McCready\u2019s business record, suggesting that he prospered at taxpayers\u2019 expense by lobbying state officials for tax breaks. Democrats, meanwhile, are accusing Bishop of doing the bidding of health insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nVoters in North Carolina\u2019s heavily Republican 3rd Congressional District also are going to the polls on Tuesday to elect a successor to the late congressman Walter B. Jones (R), choosing between Republican Greg Murphy and Democrat Allen Thomas.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Voters cast their final ballots Tuesday in a long-disputed race that has proved surprisingly competitive despite Trump easily winning the district in 2016.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Laura Hughes", "Laurence Stern Fellow", "September At Pm", "Mike Debonis Covers Congress", "With A Focus On The House", "For The Washington Post.
