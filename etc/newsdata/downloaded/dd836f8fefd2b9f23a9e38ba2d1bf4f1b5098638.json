However, investigators have reportedly been examining the former New York mayor\u2019s financial ties to Parnas and Fruman.\n\nIn addition, at least one witness has publicly said he was interviewed by the FBI earlier this year as part of what appeared to be a counterintelligence probe of potential efforts by foreign actors to influence U.S. policy.\n\nGiuliani insisted that efforts he made in cooperation with the two men to urge the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and to jump start a long-dormant investigation that could impact Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden were not lobbying on behalf of the businessmen, but advocacy on behalf of Trump.\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman\u2019s aggressive drive to oust the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was mounted on behalf of at least one unnamed Ukrainian government official. The indictment also alleges that some of the donations the two men made were at the behest of an unnamed Russian businessman who wanted to start a U.S. marijuana business.\n\nThe two men rebuffed a request from the House Intelligence Committee for records sought in connection with the ongoing impeachment probe.\n\nThere have been no signs yet that Parnas and Fruman are seeking to cooperate with prosecutors, although lawyers tracking the case say prosecutors are likely to pressure the men to detail what Giuliani knew about the alleged foreign donation scheme, their ties to officials in Ukraine and their foreign funding.\n\nWhile many photos of Parnas and Fruman show them clad in golf shirts, both men were in suits for Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Each stood briefly as U.S. District Court Judge Paul Oetken asked them how they wished to plead.\n\n\u201cNot guilty, your Honor,\u201d Parnas said forcefully, speaking with a heavy accent.\n\n\u201cNot guilty,\u201d Fruman said a bit more quietly when the judge turned to him.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski told Oetken that evidence in the case that will need to be turned over to the defense was \u201cquite voluminous.\u201d She mentioned about 50 bank accounts and more than a dozen cell phones that were monitored in some fashion, as well as search warrants and subpoenas.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is ongoing. We\u2019re continuing to obtain materials and discovery,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter scheduling and bail matters were squared away, Parnas\u2019 attorney Ed MacMahon Jr. rose to tell the judge that there may be problems in the case involving prosecutors\u2019 right to see some of the materials they\u2019ve seized.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege issues that are raised by the evidence,\u201d MacMahon said. \u201cThe president was using Rudy Giuliani as his lawyer.\u201d\n\nOetken asked if Parnas has worked for Giuliani or was a client of the former New York mayor.\n\n\u201cI believe maybe in both\u201d capacities, MacMahon replied. \u201cHe was working for Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Giuliani was working for the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nMacMahon urged that prosecutors used a so-called \u201ctaint team\u201d to filter out privileged information. He also said the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel or the White House counsel\u2019s office may have to get involved.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t know who\u2019s looking at all of these emails and all of this info,\u201d the defense attorney said. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you I know how to resolve this.\u201d\n\nDonaleski said it was the first time Parnas\u2019 lawyers raised the privilege question with them, but she also seemed prepared for it. She said a \u201cfilter team\u201d has been set up to handle such problems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the issue,\u201d she said, asking the defense to provide more details on what information they might consider privileged. \u201cWe are attuned to those concerns.\u201d\n\nOetken said he wasn\u2019t going to wade into that question Wednesday but would get involved if needed. \u201cIf there\u2019s a particular application you want to make, I\u2019m all ears,\u201d the judge said.\n\nFollowing the hearing, a defense lawyer for Parnas complained to a phalanx of reporters and TV cameras about a flurry of leaks about the case.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to defending Mr. Parnas in the court based upon the evidence and not a smear campaign driven by misleading and self-serving leaks apparently from the highest level of government,\u201d defense attorney Joseph Bondy said.\n\nParnas also spoke to journalists briefly outside the courthouse, asserting his innocence.\n\n\u201cMany false things have been said about me and my family in the press,\u201d Parnas said, reading from a written statement as his wife stood by. \u201cI look forward to defending myself vigorously in court. I am certain that in time the truth will be revealed and I will be vindicated. In the end, I put my faith in God.\u201d\n\nReporters peppered Parnas and his attorneys with questions about his role working with Giuliani, but the lawyers brushed those aside. MacMahon repeatedly told reporters to look at a letter attorney John Dowd sent to the House earlier this month explaining why Parnas and Fruman could not comply with a document request on the timeline lawmakers sought. The Virginia-based defense attorney declined to elaborate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already said enough,\u201d MacMahon said.\n\nFruman left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. His attorney, Todd Blanche, did not weigh in publicly on the privilege issue raised by MacMahon.\n\nIn addition to Parnas and Fruman, the indictment charges two other men, Andrey Kukushkin and David Correia, with involvement in the scheme to use foreign money to gain approval for the marijuana business. All four defendants are American citizens. Parnas and Kukushkin were born in Ukraine. Fruman was born in Belarus. Correia was born in the U.S.\n\nKukushkin and Correia entered not guilty pleas at a hearing before Judge Paul Oetken last week. All four defendants are free on bail pending trial.\n\nParnas and Fruman face a maximum possible sentence of 35 years, while Kukushkin and Correia face up to five years in prison. Defendants are typically sentenced under federal guidelines that usually result in sentences well short of the maximum.\n\nOetken has scheduled another hearing in the case for Dec. 2 and said he\u2019d like to set a trial date at that session, if possible.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/01/e3/0a95738a4aa0956688df6e62e92a/191023-lev-parnas-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
