HKEX countered with a charm offensive, bringing in UBS Group and HSBC Holdings to try to persuade shareholders of the merits of its proposal, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cThe whole offer was a farce,\u201d Christopher Cheung, a Hong Kong lawmaker and HKEX shareholder, said in phone interview. \u201cWhen HKEX announced the offer, I thought they\u2019ve already had discussions with London Stock Exchange and their regulators. It turns out they have not. HKEX now must address the danger of stagnant business growth.\u201d\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nLSE investors were due to vote on the acquisition of data provider Refinitiv before the end of the year. HKEX\u2019s pursuit depended on LSE walking away from that deal. Under UK takeover rules, HKEX has until Oct 9 to make a formal offer or walk away for at least six months.\n\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s about-face, Asia\u2019s largest exchange by revenue has been attempting to regain momentum after last month\u2019s stinging rebuke from LSE\u2019s board. HKEX executives met LSE shareholders in London and New York to try to gain their backing for the takeover plan. The bourse also was in talks to borrow as much as \u00a38 billion to fund the purchase.\n\nShareholders, though, expressed support for the LSE board\u2019s preferred strategy of spending US$27 billion to buy Refinitiv.\n\nAt a London conference last month, HKEX chief executive officer Charles Li envisioned London at the centre of trading between East and West with the help of Hong Kong. His LSE counterpart, David Schwimmer, said he preferred direct access to China and didn\u2019t need the former British colony as a conduit.\n\n\u201cThe complicated regulatory, technical and technological landscape in which we operate means we are resolutely focused on our ambitions, whilst also maintaining flexibility in our approach,\u201d Mr Li said in a blog post Tuesday. \u201cWe are honest with ourselves too - as we know some things we try will not develop at the speed which we would like, or in some cases, at all. Our goal is to keep moving forward, reinforcing HKEX\u2019s role and building Hong Kong\u2019s strength as a financial market.\u201d\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [SHANGHAI] Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) said it won\u2019t proceed with its US$39 billion unsolicited takeover bid for London Stock Exchange Group (LSE). .
