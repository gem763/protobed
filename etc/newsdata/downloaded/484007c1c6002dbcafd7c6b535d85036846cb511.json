The NBA \u2013 particularly Houston \u2013 was losing money. Even players were complaining about Morey.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEventually, NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a second statement that included:\n\nHowever, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\n\nApparently, Silver issued that edict while facing even more pressure than we realized.\n\nSilver, via Sean Gregory of TIME:\n\n\u201cWe made clear that we were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nSilver said the league is \u201cnot only willing\u201d to cope with losses of millions in revenues, \u201cbut we are. The losses have already been substantial. Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know where we go from here,\u201d said Silver in his first U.S. interview about the league\u2019s emerging conflict with China since he returned home from the country. \u201cThe financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we go from here\u201d are scary words. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made in China, and the NBA is a business.\n\nThat\u2019s why the decision not to fire or discipline Morey \u2013 while commendable \u2013 goes only so far.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany around the NBA fear the ongoing Chinese response. Nobody wants to further harm that economic relationship. Even Morey deleted and walked back his tweet.\n\nThis is a consequence of dealing with China. The NBA is still figuring out how to compromise its stated values with its clear financial interests.\n\nAt least the answer stopped short of punishing Morey.", "description": "For a while, it was unclear whether Rockets general manager Daryl Morey would keep his job after tweeting support for Hong Kong protesters, who are trying to maintain and expand their freedom.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e92mwJ9qxsIIyICrsuQGBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjMuMzk2Nzc4OTE2NTQ0Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CUKu9dbGPSewPRvz31L4Jw--~B/aD0zODY7dz02ODM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/7df0c4bfec812d5afab9d1f2a12b51ed", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
