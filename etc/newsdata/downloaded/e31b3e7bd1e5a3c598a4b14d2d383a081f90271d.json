While the latest Reuters poll suggests the BOJ will keep its policy on hold, 28 of 41 economists expect it will ease its policy this year and 13 believe it may surprise by taking action at the Thursday meeting.\n\nIn the currency market, the euro stood flat at $1.1064 after a 0.6% gain the previous day on better-than-expected readings in Germany's ZEW survey on investor confidence.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2483, down 0.1% so far on the day, having hit a two-month high of $1.2528 as investors reversed their bets against the currency on fear of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month.\n\nThe yen eased slightly to 108.21 yen, near a 1-1/2-month low of 108.37 touched on Tuesday.", "description": "Oil retreats on Saudi supply reassurance, Fed in limelight", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H04B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
