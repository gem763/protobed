(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nMedia critic\n\nIn mid-July, Fox News host Tucker Carlson gave a speech at the National Conservatism Conference. Near the end of his presentation, the host known for his dishonesty produced a moment of searing self-awareness: \u201cThe temptation in my politics \u2014 and my politics are evolving, although I don\u2019t even have politics, I just have reactions to things, as you can tell,\u201d said Carlson.\n\nYes, we can tell. Those \u201creactions to things\" have made Carlson a star of cable news. Though viewers know exactly what fellow Fox News prime-timer Sean Hannity will say every night \u2014 and still his fans never miss him \u2014 Carlson zigs and zags just enough to sidestep characterization as a party-line dogmatist. One moment, he\u2019ll shock the Fox News crowd with a rebuke of President Trump for going soft on immigration; the next, he\u2019ll praise the economic message of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); he\u2019ll attack every elite in the country, as he did to cheers at the December 2018 Turning Point USA Student Action Summit:\n\nLast Thursday night, Carlson was again exerting his attention-getting muscles. In a Daily Caller opinion piece, Carlson and Neil Patel \u2014 co-founders of the Daily Caller \u2014 ripped the idea of impeaching Trump. \u201cThe president did not, as was first reported, offer a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians,\u201d wrote the duo. \u201cHe did not condition any U.S. support on a Biden investigation. The Justice Department has already looked at the totality of the call and determined that Trump did not break the law.\u201d\n\nSuch sentiments wouldn\u2019t surprise viewers of \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d who\u2019ve heard the host diminish the movement toward impeachment.\n\nYet Carlson and Patel opened their op-ed with this admission: \u201cDonald Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden,\u201d wrote the authors. \u201cSome Republicans are trying, but there\u2019s no way to spin this as a good idea. Like a lot of things Trump does, it was pretty over-the-top.\u201d\n\nNews!\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty transparent effort to provide a roadmap for Republicans looking for a way to publicly condemn Trump\u2019s actions but still oppose impeachment,\u201d noted CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip. \u201cTheir argument is: what Trump did is bad and corrupt but we are so close to the election that voters should decide.\u201d Other outlets picked up on the break from Trumpian orthodoxy.\n\nNot to mention the break from \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d orthodoxy.\n\nThe very night that the Daily Caller published the op-ed, for example, Carlson on Fox News described the Ukraine affair as the work of disaffected operatives in the intelligence community:\n\nDay after day, [Trump] gave the finger to the permanent Washington establishment, often on Twitter, sometimes at press conferences, but always with unmistakable relish. Trump acted like a man who\u2019d won an election in a democratic country. He seemed to feel free to say exactly what he really thought. He didn\u2019t appear to believe that the intelligence agencies had veto power over his agenda. In a thousand different ways, the new president refused to bow, and for that crime, more than any other crime, he was punished, most recently by the manufactured Ukraine scandal.\n\nPlease try to square these two thoughts: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to spin\u201d the Ukraine scandal; the Ukraine scandal is \u201cmanufactured.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Carlson opened his program with these remarks: \u201cWe\u2019re nearing the end of our second full week of total saturation Ukraine coverage \u2014 that means every channel, every hour of the day,\u201d said the host. \u201cSo at this point, you\u2019d think it would be obvious what exactly the fuss is about. After this much talking, you would assume every person in America would understand what crimes Donald Trump is being accused of committing. But no, even now, the story still feels obscure and strangely light.\u201d\n\nPlease try to square these two thoughts: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to spin\u201d the Ukraine scandal; the Ukraine scandal \u201cfeels obscure and strangely light.\u201d\n\nScrolling back a bit, on the Sept. 30 edition of his show, Carlson blasted Democrats for citing national security concerns stemming from Trump\u2019s handling of the Ukraine situation. Carlson appeared miffed that the information about Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had even reached the public realm: \u201cAnother thing that puts our national security at risk for real is when you make it impossible for the president, any president, to have private conversations with his counterparts in other countries, with other foreign leaders,\u201d said Carlson. The host pursued a similar line of argument in February 2017, when he complained that the intelligence community was listening to the conversations of fired national security adviser Michael Flynn with the Russians. \u201cIf you do not have any privacy from the U.S. government spying on you, like, things fall apart,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the complaint of the CIA whistleblower surfaced, Carlson deflected and minimized the president\u2019s actions: \u201cYou think the next time a Democrat is elected president \u2014 and it will happen \u2014 the Democrats will be comfortable with the standard they have set? That if some unelected intel agency guy doesn\u2019t like their foreign policy, he can destroy their administration,\u201d said Carlson on Sept. 26. Later in that program, he did an entire segment dissing the whistleblower himself.\n\nOn Sept. 24, Carlson listed all the real problems facing the country, including debt, the scourge of all-powerful tech companies, \u201cbasically an open border\u201d with Mexico and so on. \u201cBut instead of trying to fix any of that, Democrats want to spend the next year explaining \u2014 and they plan to \u2014 explaining why it was perfectly fair for Joe Biden\u2019s ne\u2019er-do-well son to get 600 grand a year from Ukrainian oligarchs. That\u2019s totally fine. But it\u2019s somehow criminal for Donald Trump to ask about that. That\u2019s the message,\u201d said Carlson.\n\nSeen enough?\n\nThe contradictions suggest the low esteem in which Carlson holds his own television audience. \u201cThe things that he\u2019s saying on the Daily Caller and the things that he\u2019s saying on television are mutually exclusive \u2014 there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d says Madeline Peltz, a close watcher of Carlson at Media Matters for America. In segment after segment, Carlson has told his viewers that the Ukraine crisis is \u201cmanufactured,\u201d impugned the integrity of those who brought it to light, and attacked those who are taking it seriously. Then, on another platform, he professes that there\u2019s no way to \u201cspin\u201d it. He should know; he has given it his best shot.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Von Drehle: Trump\u2019s fate is in the hands of Fox News\n\nErik Wemple: The stupendously dishonest Tucker Carlson\n\nJennifer Rubin: A guide to Republicans\u2019 lame excuses\n\nJames Downie: The new GOP strategy: Don\u2019t believe the president\n\nEd Rogers: Democrats commit to impeachment, then start searching for a valid reason", "description": "What does this fellow actually believe?
