Even when Berlin was divided by a solid wall, local administrators had to have arrangements for utilities and services that crossed between east and west.\n\nIf we leave the EU without any arrangements in place, ferries would not be able to leave Dover, flights to Europe could not take off, and the thousands of other connections \u2013 personal, governmental, academic, commercial, security, legal and financial \u2013 that have developed over nearly half a century would be severed.

The law is there for our protection. As a wise playwright (Robert Bolt) once said: \u201cThe law is a causeway upon which, so long as he keeps to it, a citizen may walk safely.\u201d Undermining the rule of law ought not to be acceptable.\n\nWhat is equally egregious is the hatred pervading politics today, bashing each other\u2019s views, upbringing and education. An MP lost her life some three years ago \u2013 the vitriol spouted by both sides of benches in the Commons should have no place in modern Britain.\n\nOur society is injured and polarised enough over the issue of Brexit. Must the hatred that entire generations fought against win? We cannot and should not live in fear and disdain. Must more lives be lost and people be hurt before we realise that we have lost our basic decency? The personal must be separated from the political.\n\nTammy G\n\nAddress supplied\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

What is Boris Johnson waiting for? It would be interesting for him, as our prime minister, to explain, in the absence of a Brexit deal, how he intends to leave the EU on 31 October, as he has pledged to do so, without breaking the law. None of cabinet members have been able to answer this seemingly unanswerable question.\n\nChristopher Learmont-Hughes\n\nCaldy\n\nNo surrender\n\nThe prime minister calls the Benn Act a \u201csurrender act\u201d, claiming it leaves the UK at the mercy of the EU. Once again Mr Johnson is misrepresenting the position. Section 3(2) of the act acknowledges that the EU may decide on a shorter or longer extension. However before such an extension is agreed by the prime minister the House of Commons must agree to such an extension, as is laid out in Section 3(3). How can that be described as surrendering sovereignty?\n\nMaurizio Moore\n\nBrentwood\n\nI wanted to leave sensibly \u2013 the ERG scuppered that\n\nMay I say how much I support the view expressed in Thursday\u2019s letter from Jane Mogford. I too voted Remain, and though disappointed by the referendum result assumed we had to leave the EU. Another assumption I made was as the victory was narrow, the views of 16 million people would be taken into account and a close relationship with the EU would be maintained.\n\nThe 2016 vote was only the start of the story, the difficult and complicated bit was still to come.\n\nI believe the reason we haven\u2019t left yet is because the ERG and others, insist on a \u201cclean break\u201d, and there is no majority for this extreme version of leaving.\n\nAs I say, I am assuming we will leave, but I will oppose a no deal or clean break, unless there is a second referendum to see if that is actually the will of the people.\n\nDerek Thornhill\n\nGloucester\n\nThoughts on the Supreme Court decision\n\nMary Dejevsky\u2019s column sparked a memory of my first days as a civil servant, of a booklet called \u201dJudge Over Your Shoulder\u201d, alerting me to the situations when I, and all who work for the government, could have our decisions challenged under the judicial review process. Looking up the current version of this document I wanted to see what it had to say about challenging political decisions.\n\nThere on page 59 it stated (and forgive me for boring readers!): \u201cpolitical judgements should be left to the decision maker, who understands the policy and has the experience of its operation to inform his decision. In this kind of area, the court should defer to the decision maker, or recognise the demarcation of functions between the executive and the judiciary; the court should allow the decision maker a \u2018margin of discretion\u2019 or \u2018discretionary area of judgement\u2019.\u201d\n\nSo if I, or even Gina Miller, were to challenge a prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament, the court would be reluctant to interfere with the political decision, as indeed happened in the Court of Appeal. But if a group of parliamentary politicians were to challenge such a decision, the court would feel obliged to intervene because it becomes a question of politicians against politicians, as was the case in the Scottish Court. In such circumstances the court was compelled to intervene, allowing the PM\u2019s transparently tactical prorogation decision to be overturned.\n\nWhen the two cases came together in the Supreme Court, it seems obvious to me that the court would similarly decide that the executive cannot prorogue parliament as it desires against the wishes of parliament without good reason, as the Scottish Court judgement would inevitably weigh more than the English, since the former involved politicians on both sides. Hence the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Boris Johnson had lost his head in making such a rash decision, following a precedent set by the unfortunate King Charles I.\n\nI\u2019m certainly no lawyer but I draw three conclusions from this, that the judiciary are clearly important in supporting parliamentary sovereignty against an over mighty Executive, that Mary Dejevsky was probably never a civil servant and, finally, that next time Gina Miller takes the government to court, she might consider working closely with current Members of Parliament like Joanna Cherry QC MP.\n\nSarah Wood\n\nAddress supplied", "description": "I suggest that in the Brexit argument we stop referring to a \u201cdeal\u201d and instead talk about \u201carrangements\u201d?
