REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko\n\nThis year\u2019s 31st edition of the tournament, unique in that it is the only top-level mixed team event, saw Roger Federer lead Switzerland to the title in Perth against Germany in what fans and players feared would be a golden swansong.\n\nNext year\u2019s inaugural ATP Cup, a new men\u2019s team competition based in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, and offering $20 million in prize money together with ranking points, has taken the Hopman Cup\u2019s popular pre-Australian Open warm-up slot, but Haggerty insists it will return.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the American, re-elected last month for a second four-year term as ITF president, told Reuters in a phone interview when asked if one of the organisation\u2019s flagship events still had a future.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to re-introduce it for 2021. We don\u2019t have plans for the Hopman Cup in 2020 but we are going out to the market for expressions of interest and we have already had quite a few enquiries.\u201d\n\nHaggerty said there was flexibility about where and at what time of year the Hopman Cup would re-surface and did not rule out it continuing in Australia.\n\nLast year\u2019s edition of the event, named in honour of Australian great Harry Hopman and started in 1989, was a vintage one with the highlight being a first-ever match featuring Federer and Serena Williams on opposite sides of the net.\n\n\u201cIt could really be anywhere in the world and any time in the calendar,\u201d American Haggerty, who has overseen a revamp of the men\u2019s Davis Cup and women\u2019s Fed Cup, said.\n\n\u201cThe reason to do the expressions of interest is really to get the feedback from the nations and cities that have an interest and see what their proposal would be,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI can confirm we have interest from every continent.\u201d\n\nFederer voiced his hope that the Hopman Cup could be revived after winning last year\u2019s title while Williams said it would be \u201cheartbreaking\u201d if it vanished.\n\nHaggerty said the Hopman Cup format, which features men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles and a mixed doubles rubber, was an important part of the ITF\u2019s drive for equality in the sport.\n\n\u201cWe know how successful the Hopman Cup was last year with Serena playing for the United States and Roger representing Switzerland,\u201d Haggerty said.\n\n\u201cWhen they played the mixed doubles it filled the stadium with over 15,000 fans. Any tournament would love to have that even for their singles final.\n\n\u201cWe know that when men and women come together it\u2019s one of the great things for our sport.\u201d\n\nThe Hopman Cup, played in the Perth Arena from 2013-19 having moved from the Burswood Dome, was the first elite-level tennis tournament to introduced the Hawkeye Challenge system in 2006.", "description": "The mixed-gender Hopman Cup team event is set to return in 2021 after losing its traditional New Year slot on the tennis calendar, International Tennis Federation (ITF) President David Haggerty said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438916557&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981LW", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
