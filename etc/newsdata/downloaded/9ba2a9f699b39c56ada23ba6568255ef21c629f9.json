Lyft will also add an option to call 911 or the company directly from the app during a ride and will require all Lyft drivers to complete additional safety training beginning in the fall.\n\nAny driver who is reported for violating company guidelines will either be removed from the platform or required to have more training, according to Lyft.\n\n\u201cBottom line: Safety must be an ongoing focus for everyone in transportation, and it\u2019s our responsibility to continue raising the bar,\u201d Zimmer, the app\u2019s co-founder, said in a statement.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to your safety. Today, we\u2019re partnering with @RAINN on Community Safety Education \u2014 and sharing additional initiatives toward our goal of making Lyft the safest form of transportation for everyone.

The women called for the company to require in-car cameras, better GPS tracking to automatically alert the company if a driver goes off-course and an in-app panic button.\n\nGladys Arce, who said she was kidnapped by her driver and raped at a beach, believes her assault could have been avoided if the company vetted their drivers better and recorded drives on camera.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: There are serious crimes that must be stopped,\u201d she said last week. \u201cWhat happened to me must never happen again.\u201d\n\nBomberger said that over 20 women have contacted his law firm with more allegations of rape and assault in the last five days.\n\n\u201cLyft has been aware of the staggering number of assaults and rapes that occur in their vehicles for years,\u201d Bomberger said. He accused the company of concealing the true numbers of reports from the public.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE 14 Women File Lawsuit Against Lyft After Reporting Drivers' Sexual Assaults", "description": "An attorney representing 14 women who say they were assaulted by Lyft drivers called the company's updated policies a \"cheap public relations stunt.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7812483b0000c49fd0c602.jpeg?cache=36z8amfhnd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
