He was re-elected in 2009, after the adoption of a constitution renforcing state control of the economy, and again in 2013.\n\nIn 2012 he granted asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London.\n\nCorrea was succeed in 2017 by his deputy Lenin Moreno, who is wheelchair-bound after being shot during a robbery in 1998.\n\nHe and Correa clashed in 2018 when Moreno held a referendum that backed the imposing of presidential term limits, thus preventing Correa\u2019s return.\n\nWanted in his homeland on suspicion of kidnapping, Correa has lived in exile in Belgium since 2017.\n\nIn July 2019 Moreno withdrew the asylum granted to Assange.\n\n\u2013 Dwindling oil revenue \u2013\n\nEcuador is the world\u2019s largest banana exporter and a major producer of coffee and cocoa.\n\nIt also holds four billion barrels of oil reserves and in August 2019 produced more than 500,000 barrels per day.\n\nOn October 1 it announced it would leave the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the start of 2020 due to financial difficulties.\n\nIt already left 1992 \u2014 saying the group\u2019s refusal to raise the its production quota was economically damaging \u2014 but returned in 2007.\n\nThe exploitation of crude oil has boosted Ecuador\u2019s growth, reducing poverty and inequality.\n\nBut the drop in crude prices, the rise of the dollar \u2014 Ecuador\u2019s economy has been dollarized since 2000 \u2014 and the devaluation of currencies in neighbouring countries has caused revenues to plummet.\n\nIn March heavily indebted Ecuador concluded an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to borrow $4.2 billion in exchange for economic reforms over a three-year period.\n\nAs part of the deal, the government announced the end of fuel subsidies, raising prices by up to 123 percent \u2014 a catalyst for widespread protests that led Moreno to declare a state of emergency on October 3.\n\n\u2013 Volcanoes, forest \u2013\n\nThe Pacific Ocean country includes the marine-rich Galapagos archipelago, listed as a world heritage site by UNESCO.\n\nIt is in a zone of high seismic activity, with about 100 volcanoes in an \u201cavenue\u201d along the Andes mountain chain.\n\nIn 2016 a 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed 673 people. The capital Quito, with a population of 2.2 million, is wrapped around the slopes of the Pichincha volcano.\n\nThe Amazon forest covers part of Ecuador and is the habitat of indigenous people including the Waorani Indians, who are threatened by the exploitation of oil resources.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 Catholic-majority Ecuador, oil-rich but saddled with debt, is embarking on reforms that have led to fuel price hikes and sparked the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/869571_economic-reforms-sparked-biggest-protests-in-decades-in-ecuador-ecuador-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
