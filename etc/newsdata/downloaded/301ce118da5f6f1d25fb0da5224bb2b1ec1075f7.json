Why the NYPD police commissioner would be in a position to know anything about police activity in Aurora is beyond me.\n\nThe New York Times compounded the error in the initial reports by saying \u201cwitnesses told the police that Mr. Holmes said something to the effect of \u2018I am the Joker,\u2019 according to a federal law enforcement official.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not true,\u201d said George Brauchler, the 18th Judicial District attorney, who prosecuted the case.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cCompletely unfounded. Some of this stuff. \u2026 It gets repeated by so many sources by people doing their research that it just becomes real.\u201d\n\nInvestigators heard no witness talking about the Joker, he said. And no police officer claimed Holmes called himself the Joker.\n\nBrauchler said his team decided \u201cnot to push the issue\u201d in trial because \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel we needed to.\u201d Their job was to convict Holmes and seek the death penalty, not to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d was simply a blockbuster opening at the time that Holmes had determined that he wanted to commit the crime, Brauchler said.\n\n\u201cIf it had been \u2018The Avengers,\u2019 he would have been there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were \u2018Jurassic World,\u2019 he would have been there. It had nothing to do that we can find with Batman.\u201d\n\nNo evidence suggests Holmes had a Batman obsession.\n\nHolmes told a psychiatrist he dyed his hair red because \u201cred suggests bravery.\u201d\n\nThe Joker, by the way, has green hair.\n\nHolmes did have a Batman mask in his apartment, but Brauchler believes that was purchased after picking the movie to attack.\n\nHe also wrote the movie\u2019s title in his infamous notebook, but Brauchler also believes that was after he bought the ticket.\n\nAlso, Brauchler says Holmes probably seized on the movie because it was being marketed around the time he was buying a gas mask \u2014 indicating Holmes had intended to carry out his assault in a closed-in space.\n\nHolmes later told a court-appointed psychiatrist he was surprised inmates were calling him the Joker.\n\n\u201cThey kind of turned me into a super villain,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I\u2019m remembered for doing something.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an idea. Let\u2019s not remember James Holmes. Let\u2019s stop telling the lie that he called himself the Joker in a delusional attempt to bring a comic strip to life as some sort of demented Batman fan.\n\nThat is trying to make sense of the senseless. What Holmes did that night was a horrible tragedy, not a masquerade.\n\nMay James Holmes never be called the Joker again and may he rot in prison.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
