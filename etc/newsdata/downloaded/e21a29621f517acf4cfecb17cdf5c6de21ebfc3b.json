Because those primitive drugs are even produced by individual families in North Korea.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cThey call it ice in North Korea, cold ice, because when you produce it it looks like a small piece of ice... The drug is really, really, really a problem.\u201d\n\nThae, who was North Korea\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom, defected to South Korea in 2016. He is one of the highest-ranking officials to defect from the so-called Hermit Kingdom.\n\nThae Yong Ho, North Korea\u00a1\u00afs former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Seoul, South Korea, February 3, 2017.
