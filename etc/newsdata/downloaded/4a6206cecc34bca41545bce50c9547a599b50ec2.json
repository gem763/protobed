Taxpayers foot the bill for accommodations.\n\n\"I don't think it was a request, like a command,\u201d Marc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters. \u201cI think that it was a suggestion.\"\n\nPence has been the subject of criticism from Democratic lawmakers for his decision to stay Monday night at Trump International Golf Links & Hotel in Doonbeg during his time in Ireland. But Short said the decision to overnight on the opposite side of Ireland from Dublin was made based on Pence's ancestral connections to the region, as well as the logistical ease for the Secret Service of protecting a property it is familiar with.\n\nFrom Trump Doonbeg, Pence embarked on a roughly hourlong flight Tuesday morning to Dublin to meet Irish President Michael Higgins and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\n\"It's like when we went through the trip, it's like, well, he's going to Doonbeg because that's where the Pence family is from.
