Or Was the 2019 Rally Just a Dead Cat Bounce?\n\nIf that low is reached, a bottom of the current correction may finally be put in, and Bitcoin could return on its parabolic rally and bull run, leading up to the halving in May 2020. Many analysts believe that the leading crypto asset by market cap could reach as much as $55,000 per BTC before its upcoming halving, according to the highly-cited Bitcoin stock-to-flow model.\n\nHowever, that number would be nearly a 1000% gain from the lows currently being targeted. Such gains would be highly unlikely in most asset classes, however, Bitcoin can rise and fall substantially in a very short amount of time, and has already risen from $3,100 to $14,000 this year, showing that anything is possible for the first-ever crypto asset.\n\nRelated Reading | Wyckoff Logic Suggests Bitcoin Markdown Has Only Just Begun\n\nBut if there truly aren\u2019t any bullish arguments to be made for Bitcoin, the crypto asset could be at risk of setting a new low, deeper than the current bear market bottom it set back in December 2018 at $3,100. This would mean that the bear market never actually ended, and the entire rally from $3,100 to $14,000 was nothing more than an extremely lucrative dead cat bounce.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock", "description": "As the 2019 parabolic rally came to a close, Bitcoin began to trade within a large, multi-month descending triangle pattern that only just recently broke", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-bear-market-crypto-winter-shutterstock_1038215065-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
