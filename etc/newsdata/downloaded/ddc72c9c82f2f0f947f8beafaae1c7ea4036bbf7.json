So he's reiterating his recent call for a recession.\n\nThe jobs data included slightly disappointing hiring and slowing wage growth as trade tensions and general uncertainty continued to grow. Rosenberg is focused on something he considers an important indicator: job losses in a couple of critical parts of the economy.\n\nHe specifically noted that about 4,000 jobs were lost in both durable goods manufacturing and truck transportation in September.\n\n\"Payrolls failed the Dow Theory test in September,\" Rosenberg wrote in a tweet. \"Both industrials and transports posted job declines of 4k. Recession hasn't arrived but is right around the corner.\"\n\nIn its simplest form, Dow theory says that for a market rally to last, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average need to be rising because their gains suggest that two critical parts of the economy are flourishing.\n\nRosenberg is extending that idea by arguing that job losses in those sectors mean the economy is getting worse. The manufacturing sector is already in a recession, and in a recent Business Insider interview, Rosenberg added that a number of parts of the US economy, such as construction, capital spending, and housing, were faring just as badly.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley says WeWork's failed IPO marks the end of an era for unprofitable unicorns \u2014 and explains why it leaves the market's tech kingpins vulnerable\n\nWhile the economy and market have held up in the past few years despite Rosenberg's forecasts, his track record is worth noting: He was one of the first experts to warn about the downturn that came to pass as the Great Recession.\n\nIn Rosenberg's telling, the only thing that's kept the economy and the market going is continued spending by consumers \u2014 the largest part of the US economy. But if hiring and wages are starting to slow down, and demand for manufacturing and shipping of goods is fading, that's a sign that strength might not last much longer.", "description": "\"Payrolls failed the Dow Theory test in September,\" Rosenberg wrote in a tweet. \"Both industrials and transports posted job declines of 4k.\"", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9777f9591bb70e47266ff6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
