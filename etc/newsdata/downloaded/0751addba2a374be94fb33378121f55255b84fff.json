Part of my choice also means allowing myself to heal, to forgive and grow stronger. Thank you everyone for your support over the last two weeks.\"\n\nNeither side moving forward with charges\n\nESPN and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said Newman was facing a misdemeanour charge from the incident.\n\n\"The two individuals involved have indicated that they obviously do not want to go forward, that they wish the best for each other,\" Fayetteville County District Attorney Richard Bower told reporters outside a Uniontown courtroom. \"Additionally, they've indicated to me that they have both forgiven each other for what has happened.\"\n\nPolice said the pair got into an argument over table games at Lady Luck Casino that later became physical in their hotel room.\n\nNewman, 25, from London, Ont., is coming off a Diamond League season that saw her set a new Canadian record of 4.82 metres en route to a gold medal at an Aug. 24 meet in Paris.\n\nChickillo, a 26-year-old Tampa, Fla., resident, has been with the Steelers for five years. He has one tackle and half a sack in three games this season, playing primarily on special teams.", "description": "Misdemeanour charges have been dropped against a Pittsburgh Steelers backup linebacker who had been accused of injuring his girlfriend, Canadian Olympic pole vaulter Alysha Newman, during a fight in their western Pennsylvania hotel room this month.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341845.1572471829!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/945700364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
