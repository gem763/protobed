Why Isn\u2019t 2020 The Same?", "language": "en", "text": "Illustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Getty Images There are more candidates of color running for president than ever before. But they\u2019re all stuck in the single digits in public polling. Why?\n\nA year after candidates of color flourished in Democratic primaries around the country during the midterm elections, the three leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are all white, while Asian American, Black and Latino candidates are trapped in single digits in public polling.\n\nHeading into the fourth presidential debate in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday evening, three of the leading candidates of color find their campaigns in varying degrees of peril. Former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro has suggested he may drop out of the race if he fails to qualify for the fifth debate in Georgia next month. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) just threatened to quit the contest unless he raised $1.7 million in 10 days. (He succeeded.) And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who briefly ascended to the race\u2019s top tier during the summer, is rejiggering her campaign with a focus on Iowa and a reworked stump speech.\n\nIn 2018, the picture was much different, with Democratic voters across the country eager to cast history-making ballots. Black candidates won gubernatorial primaries in Florida, Georgia and Maryland, and Arizona Democrats nominated a Latino. Democrats elected the first two Native American women to Congress, the first two Muslim women, the first Latina to ever represent Texas, and sent Rep. Lauren Underwood, an African American, to Congress from a district that is 86% white. Overall, 216 candidates for House, Senate or governor were people of color in 2018, which included a 42% spike in the number of women of color running for those major offices. (The field for down-ballot contests in 2020 is still developing, but candidates of color could make similar gains this cycle.)\n\nInterviews with voters, campaigns, candidates and operatives nationally and in the early primary states indicate there is no single cause for the struggles of the candidates of color. Many of the factors keeping them behind the three leading candidates in polling also affect white candidates who have failed to break into the race\u2019s top tier. But the race\u2019s focus on electability, the structure of the early nominating contests and differences in how the media treat candidates of color compared with white candidates are making things even more difficult.\n\nThe Electability Conversation\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images A poster advertises a Kamala Harris campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa. Harris has reworked her stump speech, which now includes a section asking voters to believe she can win the state\u2019s crucial caucuses.\n\nDemocratic voters, in poll after poll and conversation after conversation, have indicated their priority when selecting a nominee in 2020 is someone who can beat Donald Trump. There\u2019s plenty of reasons to think voters and pundits are bad at evaluating which candidates stand the best chance of defeating Trump, but that isn\u2019t stopping the conversation.\n\n\u201cThe conversation has been \u2018Hmm, I don\u2019t know if America is ready to elect a Black woman president of the United States,\u2019\u201d Harris told a crowd of about 50 at a block party in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a conversation, \u2019Oh, I can see it, but I don\u2019t know if my neighbors are ready. Maybe it\u2019s not her turn, maybe it\u2019s not her time, maybe it might be too hard. We got to play it safe. \u2026 Maybe we can\u2019t take that bet.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe riff is a new one for Harris \u2015 she also mentions her undefeated record in elections and her work to persuade an Iowa caucus-goer about Barack Obama\u2019s electability in 2008 \u2015 and it shows how she still needs to convince a broad swath of the electorate that she can win.\n\nBooker, similarly, has argued that turning out younger and African American voters is as important as winning over the much-ballyhooed white working class when it comes to defeating Trump.\n\nNot everyone is convinced electability is what\u2019s holding back Booker, Harris and Castro. Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, which works to turn out Black voters, said Obama\u2019s wins in 2008 and 2012 had largely quieted concerns about whether race was a barrier to winning the country. And Warren, who faced more concerns than any other candidate about her ability to beat Trump in the first half of the year, has managed to persuade voters.\n\nBut Ross Wilburn, an Iowa state representative who has endorsed Harris, said the constant barrage of news from Trump\u2019s White House and the president\u2019s willingness to engage in out-and-out racist rhetoric have made voters more cautious.\n\n\u201cBecause of what President Trump is doing, and the hate he spews, and the chaos that he\u2019s creating to divert our attention from illegal acts, people get cautious,\u201d he said after Harris\u2019 block party. \u201cThey want to go with the familiar. Part of her message is: \u2018We can believe. We\u2019ve believed before.\u2019\u201d\n\nMedia Dynamics\n\nMike Blake / Reuters Joe Biden and Julian Castro talk after the Democratic debate on Sept. 12 in Houston, where the pair clashed over health care.\n\nThe campaigns have also occasionally found themselves trapped in unfriendly media dynamics and dealing with a political press corps that still has a long way to go on the diversity front. Several operatives pointed to Castro\u2019s showdown with former Vice President Joe Biden at the most recent debate. The first person voters heard from after the debate ended? It was former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served with Biden in the Obama administration and criticized Castro for challenging Biden.\n\nThe post-debate pundits \u201coverwhelmingly tend to be older, white and more moderate or conservative voices, which is absolutely crazy in a primary with this many diverse candidates, where the diversity of our base is going to be what propels us to victory,\u201d said one operative working for a candidate of color, who requested anonymity to freely critique media coverage of the race.\n\nIndeed, a post-debate Univision poll found that 64% of Latino voters thought Castro\u2019s attack on Biden was fair.\n\nAll the candidates of color have also faced another trap: They\u2019re expected to be both representatives of their race on the national stage while also appealing to the broader electorate. No small amount of coverage of businessman Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign has focused on how Asian American voters are reacting to his candidacy. Coverage of Castro has focused on his bold immigration policy. But if his campaign had released a more by-the-numbers plan, the media likely would\u2019ve zeroed in on that and questioned why he wasn\u2019t more aggressive. Similarly, much of the coverage of Harris and Booker has focused on their criminal justice reform plans and records.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s \u2018why aren\u2019t you talking about this when it impacts people who look like you?\u2019 But if they do talk about it, it\u2019s \u2018She\u2019s just going to be the president of Black people,\u2019\u201d Shropshire noted, while praising the candidates for unveiling expansive platforms regardless. \u201cBut they\u2019ve done a good job managing it. None of these people are single-issue candidates.\u201d\n\nHarris and Booker have faced another problem. Both are running as candidates trying to find a sweet spot between progressives and moderates, neither embracing policies as liberal as those of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), nor bashing those policies and tacking to the center in the style of Biden. That means they\u2019re occasionally minimized or left out of stories about the race\u2019s central ongoing narrative: the ideological clash within the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThey just really haven\u2019t defined their base yet,\u201d Yvette Simpson, the president of the left-leaning group Democracy for America, said of Booker and Harris. \u201cBiden is sucking all the air out of the room for anyone who\u2019s not a pure progressive, while Sanders and Warren are winning over the votes of progressives.\u201d\n\nAnd generally the candidates\u2019 lower standings in the polls mean they get less media attention. Another operative working for the campaign of a candidate of color complained about struggling to get coverage of major policy rollouts and campaign speeches, \u201cwhile CNN and MSNBC cover Joe Biden eating an ice cream cone.\u201d\n\nThe Inevitability Of Biden And Sanders\n\nMike Blake / Reuters Former Vice President Joe Biden participates in a televised Los Angeles town hall Thursday on CNN dedicated to LGBTQ issues.\n\nSome of the challenges for Harris, Booker and Castro aren\u2019t totally dissimilar from those facing white candidates like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) or Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Biden and Sanders, the 2016 runner-up who changed the Democratic Party, were always going to dominate media attention, early polling and fundraising. Warren\u2019s steady rise has ensured she\u2019s joined that group.\n\nNow the three top candidates are in a self-fulfilling cycle of sorts: They get more media coverage, money and strong poll results than anyone else, helping them get even more money and media attention, which helps them keep their strong position in the polls. Breaking into this virtuous cycle has proved difficult for most of the candidates, except for Warren, Buttigieg and \u2015 for a time over the summer \u2015 Harris.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the idea of electability, and there\u2019s the idea of anoint-ability,\u201d said the second operative working for a candidate of color. \u201cThe media, the [Democratic National Committee], the benchmarks they set, the white candidates were always going to be able to meet them. It\u2019s been a lot harder for candidates of color.\u201d\n\nBut the early-state voting order \u2015 Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s fifth-whitest state, votes first; and New Hampshire, the nation\u2019s third-whitest state, votes second \u2015 is part of the problem. Much of the public polling, which influences donors, voters and who makes the debate stage, is focused on these two states. During the time period to qualify via polling for the third debate, only one public poll of Nevada, the most diverse of the four early-voting states, was released.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not unprecedented for Black candidates to triumph in either state. Obama won the 2008 Iowa caucus, and Deidre DeJear \u2015 now Harris\u2019 Iowa campaign chair \u2015 won an upset victory to become the Democratic nominee for secretary of state in 2018.\n\nHow Things Could Turn Around\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign has succeeded in raising his profile and introducing voters to his signature campaign plan: a universal basic income of $1,000 a month.\n\nSo far, the lack of a candidate of the color in the top tier has bewildered some Democratic operatives and left some worried about generating sufficient Black and Latino turnout in order to win the nomination. But there is still time for the candidates of color to sprint to the nomination race\u2019s upper ranks. More voters may tune into the race as voting nears, and Tuesday night\u2019s debate stage provides them with another high-profile opportunity.\n\nAnd if Harris or Booker, in particular, manage to break through, there could be immense political rewards. Black voters in South Carolina and in delegate-rich Super Tuesday states, several operatives noted, may flock to support a viable Black candidate.\n\n\u201cAfrican Americans and voters of color tend to wait until they\u2019re sure you can win,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a Catch-22 for these candidates.\u201d\n\nAnd even if the candidates fail to win, they can still point to personal and historical progress. Castro, little-known nationally before this race, has emerged as a favorite of progressives for his willingness to push the envelope on policy and sharply challenge more moderate Democrats. Few Democratic operatives give the unorthodox campaign of Yang much chance of success, but he\u2019s managed to popularize the idea of a universal basic income and created a mini-movement at his back.\n\n\u201cWhen I began my career a decade ago, it was unimaginable we might one day have two Black candidates for president,\u201d said Rosy Gonzalez Speers, the executive director of Forward Florida. \u201cI\u2019m excited for our party. It\u2019s only October, and there\u2019s a lot of race left to run, so I wouldn\u2019t count any candidates out yet.\u201d\n\nAmanda Terkel contributed reporting.", "description": "Three white candidates are dominating the Democratic presidential primary while Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro struggle.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0969a210000e7063443c5.jpeg?cache=qmwfxexjny&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
