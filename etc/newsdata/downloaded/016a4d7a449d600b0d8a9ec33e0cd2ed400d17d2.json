They were meant to give the economy a little bit of extra padding in case risks on the horizon \u2014 from uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war to economic weakening in Asia and Europe that threatened to spill over \u2014 turned into realities.\n\nData increasingly suggest that a slowdown is, in fact, materializing. Both of the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s closely watched surveys, one that tracks manufacturing and another that monitors services, posted declines for September, reports this week showed. Consumer confidence has shown signs of weakening, and while spending is still growing, it has slowed from a robust pace earlier this year.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, investors have ramped up their expectations for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s Oct 29-30 meeting. In the past week, they have gone from seeing a 50-50 chance that the Fed will cut rates this month to pricing in a move almost entirely.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\u201cClearly the data have shifted the narrative for the market,\u201d said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe data in July and September were more mixed \u2014 it is now clear that a slowdown has taken hold.\u201d\n\nFed officials, including the chair, Jerome Powell, and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John Williams, have been hesitant to clearly signal what comes next for monetary policy.\n\nBut their comments came before the latest round of data. On Thursday evening (Oct 3), Richard Clarida, vice chair of the Fed, left the door open to coming rate cuts rather than trying to convince markets that they had gone too far in expecting an October move.\n\nThe central bank takes its decisions \u201cone meeting at a time,\u201d Mr Clarida said at a Wall Street Journal event when asked about the potential for a coming cut.\n\n\u201cBut we will act as appropriate to sustain a low unemployment rate, solid growth and stable inflation. We said that in June, July and September, and I\u2019m saying it to you tonight.\u201d\n\nFed officials have had reasons to keep their options open. The end of October is far away, with many fresh data points between now and then. And until lately, incoming data had been mixed: Bad factory numbers came alongside strong consumer and service-sector figures.\n\nAs signs of a broader deterioration surface, Friday\u2019s jobs report will be in the spotlight. Officials have taken comfort in the fact that the labour market has remained strong, and will be looking for confirmation of that. Employers added 130,000 jobs in August, and economists expect them to hire a similar number this month.\n\nEven a great report may not shift expectations away from an October rate cut, said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research. Fed officials and most economists anticipate decent hiring and low unemployment, so a strong job market would amount to reaffirmation.\n\nIf the labour market shows signs of cracking, though, \u201cthe odds for a cut in December will probably look like October does now,\u201d Mr Dutta said.\n\nShould economic data weaken further, economists said, it is possible the Fed would move from its current mode \u2014 one in which it\u2019s playing a protective offense \u2014 to all-out defense. They could signal that more aggressive rate cuts are coming, rather than the gentle midbusiness cycle adjustments underway.\n\nThe data have yet to call for that change in stance, because there are many signs that economic activity is holding up. Wages are growing, though the pace has stopped accelerating. Unemployment is near a half-century low. Consumers continue to spend, and housing starts have headed higher.\n\nBut the bright spots are getting fewer and farther between. Tiffany Wilding, chief US economist at Pimco, pointed out in a research note that the current level of manufacturing and service indexes has historically come alongside 1 per cent overall growth.\n\nIf the economy heads in that direction, it will be a major change from the 2.2 per cent gross domestic product gains Fed officials expect in 2019.\n\nCharles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said on Bloomberg Television on Thursday that he had yet to decide whether the central bank should cut rates this month. But asked whether investors overreacted to weak manufacturing data by ramping up bets for a rate cut, he said, \u201cIt was an important piece of data \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was an overreaction.\u201d\n\nMr Evans, who spoke before weak service industry data had been released, said the Fed was monitoring incoming information as it headed toward its Oct. 30 decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll learn more before the meeting at the end of this month,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not one more rate cut at this point is the right decision or not, I think we\u2019re just going to have to go into the meeting and see.\u201d\n\nNYTIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [NEW YORK] Top Federal Reserve officials have said they are open-minded about whether additional interest rate cuts will be necessary in 2019, but recent economic data are putting that equanimity to the test. .
