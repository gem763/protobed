She was fantastic.\u201d\n\nMarkle, 38, and Harry, 35, met in 2016 through mutual friends. The couple said \u201cI do\u201d in 2018 and welcomed their son Archie in May of this year.\n\nHurley admitted she hasn\u2019t spoken to the American actress in years, but stressed she\u2019s a big fan of her royal work.\n\nELIZABETH HURLEY WISHES A 'HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL AMERICANS'\n\n\u201cFor me, she\u2019s doing a great job and looks wonderful,\u201d said Hurley. \u201cSo I wish her nothing but luck. To be honest, I haven\u2019t met her since. I don\u2019t really know her very well. She knows that she\u2019s doing a great job in Africa.\u201d\n\nBut Hurley does have one relationship with another star \u2014 ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant. The pair dated from 1987 until 2000. The British actor went on to marry producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein in 2018. The couple shares a 7-year-old son named John. Grant, 59, also has a son named Felix, 6, and a daughter named Tabitha with his ex Tinlan Hong.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of my best friends,\u201d Hurley gushed. \u201cHe\u2019s a great dad\u2026 He\u2019s happily married. And everything\u2019s good. His career\u2019s great. Family life\u2019s great. He\u2019s a lucky man.\u201d\n\nAs for her own love life, Hurley remained mum.\n\nELIZABETH HURLEY RECREATES ICONIC 1994 VERSACE PIN DRESS\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell you if I were [dating someone],\u201d Hurley told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019m trying very hard to keep my private life a little more private than it perhaps has been in the past.\u201d\n\nHurley shares a son named Damien, 17, with ex Steve Bing. Grant is her child\u2019s godfather.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S DAD REVEALS WHY HE DISCLOSED HER PRIVATE AND 'HURTFUL' LETTER\n\nIn 2007, she married Indian textile heir Arun Nayar but the couple divorced in 2011. Three months later, Hurley was engaged to Australian cricketer Shane Warne. However, the couple called it quits in 2013.\n\n\u201cAll of my boyfriends, husbands and fianc\u00e9s have been my best friends, so it\u2019s a terrible gap they leave,\u201d she told Red magazine in May of this year. \u201cI think that\u2019s when you learn the importance of having other sources of comfort, fun and intimacy. You feel cozy with people that have been your best friends for 30 years, but occasionally you\u2019ll meet someone who you click with \u2014 it\u2019s important to keep yourself open to that.\u201d\n\nELIZABETH HURLEY, 54, MODELS THE LATEST BIKINIS FROM HER SWIMWEAR LINE\n\nYet Hurley said she isn\u2019t in a rush to get involved with anyone. In fact, the star said she\u2019s at her happiest from the comfort of home in the English countryside.\n\n\u201cI spend half the day on my laptop and then I attempt to have a life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m there I have a ponytail, wear UGG boots, put on some Nike track pants and I\u2019m happy. When I\u2019m home I cook or make jam \u2013 I\u2019ve just started making marmalade \u2013 I love all that. I get so much joy from gardening. I\u2019ve become obsessed with it. It\u2019s the only time I switch off.\u201d\n\nHurley also said she keeps busy by staying active, which has helped her not to stress over getting older.\n\n\u201cI really believe in being active, but I don't do much set exercise,\u201d said Hurley. \u201cIn the country, I walk a lot, run around a lot and do a lot of manual labor \u2014 I also love getting out with my chainsaw. I still have a contract with Estee Lauder, which is in its 24th year. Hats off to them for not disposing of women as they get older.\u201d", "description": "Before Elizabeth Hurley played the Queen of England, she mingled with the future Duchess of Sussex.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/02/694940094001_6021685826001_6021685732001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
