Its shares are more than 35% below their mid-2018 level.\n\nBabcock\u2019s Arrowhead 140 design beat rival bids from BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Atlas Elektronik UK, and a formal contract award is expected later this year, Babcock said.\n\n\u201cArrowhead 140 is a modern warship that will meet the maritime threats of today and tomorrow,\u201d Babcock Chief Executive Archie Bethel said.\n\n\u201cIt provides a flexible, adaptable platform that delivers value for money and supports the UK\u2019s National Shipbuilding Strategy.\u201d\n\nThe government will buy at least five of the frigates and has said the first ship is set to be in the water by 2023.\n\nBabcock said detailed design work would start immediately, with manufacturing beginning in 2021 and finishing in 2027. The ships will have an average production cost of 250 million pounds a ship.\n\nThe government has committed to keeping up a fleet of at least 19 frigates and destroyers with the aim of growing the fleet in the 2030s. Type 31 frigates will replace Type 23 ships.\n\n\u201c(The) UK is an outward-looking island nation, and we need a shipbuilding industry and Royal Navy that reflect the importance of the seas to our security and prosperity,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that by working together we will see a renaissance in this industry which is so much part of our island story \u2013 so let\u2019s bring shipbuilding home.\u201d\n\nBritain is building patrol vessels and new Type 26 frigates at BAE Systems\u2019 Govan shipyard on the Clyde river in Glasgow.\n\nBut the country\u2019s shipbuilding industry has suffered a catastrophic decline in the last 40 years, with shipyards in places from Sunderland to Portsmouth closing.\n\nBelfast\u2019s Harland and Wolff shipyard, where the Titanic was built, went into administration last month.", "description": "Babcock International won a contract to design new Type 31 frigates on Thursday as Britain seeks to revive its once-mighty shipbuilding industry.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428977904&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0ER", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
