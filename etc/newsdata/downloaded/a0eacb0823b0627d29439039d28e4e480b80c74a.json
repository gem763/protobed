The farther you keep yourselves from our region and our nations, the more security there will be.\n\nThe Iran crisis was created in Washington. The US must be talked down | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\n\u201cWe are even ready to ignore their past mistakes... since today the situation is such that the enemies of Islam and the region \u2013 meaning America and Zionism \u2013 want to abuse the rift between us,\u201d said Rouhani.\n\nThe annual military parade marks the start of the week commemorating Iran\u2019s 1980-1988 war with Iraq known as the \u201csacred defence\u201d.\n\nRouhani is expected to travel to New York on Monday, a day before general debate kicks off at the UN general assembly.\n\nForeign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is subject to US sanctions, has already arrived in New York.\n\nTensions have flared in the Gulf since May, when Iran began reducing its commitments to the nuclear deal and the US said it was sending forces to nearby waters in response to what it called \u201cindications of a credible threat\u201d from Tehran\u2019s forces.\n\nThe US deployed an aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the sensitive waterways, before sending B-52 bombers, an amphibious assault ship and a Patriot missile battery.\n\nFollowing the deployments, commercial ships were mysteriously attacked, drones downed and oil tankers seized in Gulf waters.\n\nIn June Trump authorised a military strike after Iran shot down a US drone, only to call off the retaliation at the last moment.\n\nThe regional crisis deepened with the 14 September attacks on Saudi energy giant Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oilfield, which halved the kingdom\u2019s oil output.\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility, but the US said it had concluded the attacks involved cruise missiles from Iran and denounced them as \u201can act of war\u201d.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has been bogged down in a five-year war in Yemen, has warned of \u201cappropriate measures\u201d once the source of the strikes is confirmed by a UN investigation.\n\nA Houthi plan for a cessation of hostilities announced on Friday has been welcomed by the UN, but Saudi Arabia was sceptical, saying it would \u201cjudge other parties by their deeds\u201d.", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani says international forces should \u2018stay away\u2019 to de-escalate regional crisis", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01157afbb36560e57448277307a0d7f01b7c0b1/0_88_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6f6bea33aa38af53da78ad18f703def", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
