These beads indicate that the child belonged to a noble family.'\n\nHailing the skeleton an 'important find', she added: 'The delegation stated that the child is six or seven years old, but they need to work on it further.\n\n'The child may have died as a result of trauma. Such results will be determined as a result of analysis.\n\n'This is a very important find. As a result of the analysis of the skeleton, we will reach more detailed information.'\n\nThe remains were found in what is believed to be an ancient house during an excavation of the Arslantepe Mound outside Malatya, eastern Turkey\n\nThe skeleton was found in the Arslantepe Ruins in Turkey, which lie on the bank of the Euphrates River and were once home to a Copper Age population\n\nDr Frangipane also said that they are waiting for the results of the examination to discover the gender, genetic structure, age and cause of death of the child as well as the diet of era.\n\nThe position of the skeleton suggests the child was frightened and had curled itself into the foetal position, wrapping its arms around its body.\n\nRemarkably, the position which this infant died in has been almost perfectly preserved in the ground, although its skull has been caved in.\n\nOver the past 50 years, since serious excavations of the Arslantepe Mound began, archaeologists are slowly unearthing what they believe to be a fourth millennium BC palace.\n\nInterconnected mud brick architecture sprawling over 2,000 square metres is suggestive of the first 'public palace', according to UNESCO.\n\nThe organisation says this ancient structure was 'composed by two temples, a storeroom complex, administrative areas with thousands of clay-ceilings bearing the impressions of more than 220 beautiful seals, entertainment halls, a monumental gate, corridors and courtyards'.", "description": "The remains were found in what is believed to be an ancient house during an excavation of the\u00a0Arslantepe Mound outside Malatya, eastern Turkey.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19293634-0-image-a-4_1570186175382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
