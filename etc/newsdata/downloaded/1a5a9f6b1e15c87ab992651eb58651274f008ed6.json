Right now, we're in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made.\"\n\nOn Thursday Trump publicly urged Beijing to investigate Biden, a Democrat, again raising concerns that he has invited foreign interference in the U.S. presidential election. Last week Trump released a transcript of a call where he asked Ukraine's president to also look into Biden, a request that has triggered an impeachment inquiry by House of Representatives Democrats.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES HOPES\n\nKudlow, in television interviews, held out hope for progress in opening China's financial services markets to American companies in next week's talks, adding the U.S. team was heading into them \"open-minded.\"\n\n\"Everything's on the table, we'd love to go back to where we were in May when we were a lot closer,\" Kudlow told Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe Trump trade team hoped to revisit a mostly agreed text from which China had backtracked in May, causing talks to break down, he said.\n\nThe text at that time included an agreement negotiated by Mnuchin that involved the lifting of foreign ownership caps on financial services firms in China.\n\n\"I'm not giving you news. I'm just saying we had some pretty good things last spring, like financial services opening - that could be extended,\" Kudlow said in a subsequent interview on Fox Business Network. \"I say 'could' and the president would have to sign off on it, but don't rule out the possibility of good news.\"\n\nKudlow declined to make any predictions about the talks but said there had been a \"softening of the psychology on both sides\" over the past month, with the United States delaying some tariff increases and China making some modest purchases of American farm products.\n\nKudlow also said the impeachment inquiry was unlikely to affect the trade talks with China.\n\n\"I don't think that's an impact right now. I think maybe it has only the tiniest, tiniest effect, maybe occasionally on stock market psychology,\" Kudlow said.\n\nHowever, he said the Trump administration continued to monitor freedom and democracy protests, which he said could have an impact on the talks, without specifying how. China-backed Hong Kong authorities have struggled to curb anti-government protests that have continued for four months.", "description": "Trump sees 'very good chance' of China trade deal, says no link to Biden probe request", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9313R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
