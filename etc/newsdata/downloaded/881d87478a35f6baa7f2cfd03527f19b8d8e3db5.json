Pence was just getting warmed up for a busy day in the life of the vice president.\n\nSo how exactly would these two fellas on the beach fit into the narrative?\n\n\u201cOne of them stopped and turned to me and he said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re Vice President Mike Pence.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, I am.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt this point, Pence had the audience chuckling and wondering what he might say next. It turns out these two fellas, like so many other Americans, are beneficiaries of the Trump administration\u2019s economic policies.\n\n\u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Well, listen, you got to tell the president that he\u2019s got to keep doing what he\u2019s doing, because I made twice as much money last year as I did the year before.\u2019 And I told him I\u2019d tell the president word for word. And I did it. It\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nNow for the punchline.\n\n\u201cThen he took three steps away, and he turned back and looked at me, and he said, \u2018Now, I don\u2019t know what you do, but keep doing what you\u2019re doing, too.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him I would.\u201d\n\nJohn Adams, our nation\u2019s first vice president, once called the job \u201cthe most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his imagination conceived.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing insignificant about how Pence approaches his role, though.\n\nJust as he told those beachgoers he would keep doing what he\u2019s doing, Tuesday was a typically active day for Pence\u2014a microcosm of his role in the Trump administration.\n\nVice President Mike Pence at The Heritage Foundation.

The speech generated significant media attention across the globe. But that wasn\u2019t its sole purpose.\n\nPence has made several important stops at conservative organizations in recent months, as the Washington Examiner\u2019s Paul Bedard documented. In effect, he\u2019s become the Trump administration\u2019s top liaison to the conservative movement.\n\n\u201cSince his time in Congress, Vice President Pence has been a trusted friend of conservatives,\u201d Tommy Binion, Heritage\u2019s vice president of government relations, told the Examiner. \u201cHis latest efforts aren\u2019t new, but a continuation of a lifetime of work together in the trenches of politics and public policy. Pence\u2019s actions as vice president to protect life, rebuild the military, and preserve our founding values speak louder than any politician\u2019s words.\u201d\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Pence made sure to recognize Heritage\u2019s contributions while personally thanking Heritage President Kay Coles James, former Attorney General Ed Meese, and Heritage founder Ed Feulner.\n\nAlthough most politicians pay homage, it\u2019s authentic with Pence. He\u2019s known and had relationships with conservative leaders for decades.\n\nPence reminded the audience that one of his first stops after Trump\u2019s 2016 election was Heritage\u2019s biggest annual event in Washington, D.C. At the time, Pence was helping Trump during the critical transition period before the inauguration. The incoming administration was filling jobs and mapping out a policy agenda.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, I\u2019ll never forget \u2026 election night,\u201d Pence recalled. \u201cIt was about 4:30 in the morning. And as we were leaving the hotel, I\u2019ll never forget the president-elect looked at me and he said, \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014it\u2019s been a long night. Let\u2019s not get started until 8:30 tomorrow morning.\u2019 And when I got to the office, he was already at his desk.\u201d\n\nPence continued, \u201cWe went right to work, taking the policies that the president-elect had campaigned on\u2014the policies that The Heritage Foundation had advanced for decades\u2014and worked to build a team to put them into practice.\u201d\n\nThat work continues\u2014and was on display after his morning visit to Heritage.\n\nFollowing his speech at Heritage\u2019s Capitol Hill headquarters, Pence headed across the street to brief Senate Republicans on the Saudi attack. Then it was back to the White House for a naturalization ceremony for 28 new American citizens. Pence also made a surprise stop at Hillsdale\u2019s Kirby Center to congratulate the college on its new master\u2019s program in Washington. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to fit into one day, Pence traveled to Camp David in Maryland for a workforce development dinner organized by Ivanka Trump with CEOs, government leaders, and educators.\n\nDon\u2019t expect Pence to slow down anytime soon.\n\nWith so many policy debates brewing in Washington and big promises to keep for the American people, Pence is putting to use the communications skills he developed as a conservative radio and TV host and refined in Congress. As the former president of a state-based think tank and lifelong conservative, he\u2019s also making sure movement leaders are the focus of his attention.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Pence\u2019s approach serves as a model for other conservatives. His ability to mix serious policy ideas with compelling stories is an effective way to make the case that conservative solutions are leading to a better life for all Americans.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence recounted a story Tuesday that illustrates life as President Donald Trump\u2019s right-hand man.\n\nThe vice president had escaped to Florida earlier this year with wife Karen for \u201ca couple of days on the beach,\u201d according to Pence, when two fellow beachgoers spotted him.\n\n\u201cWe were sitting there in our ball caps and our sunglasses taking in a few enjoyable hours of rest there on the beach, and these two fellas came walking by wearing big Budweiser T-shirts,\u201d Pence told a standing-room-only crowd at The Heritage Foundation.", "authors": ["Robert B.
