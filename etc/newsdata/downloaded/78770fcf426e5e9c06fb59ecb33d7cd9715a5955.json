He just thinks we are his possessions.'\n\nThe court heard Ms Fraser feared her husband had secretly set up surveillance cameras around her house and bugged her phone.\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "The Latrobe Valley Magistrates' Court on Wednesday heard Ms Fraser grew up in Two by Two - a small religious cult.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/19985550-0-image-a-5_1571825597806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
