Wei Fenghe vowed at the Xiangshan security forum in Beijing on Monday that \u201cthe momentum of China\u2019s reunification cannot be stopped by any individuals or forces.\u201d\n\nWei\u2019s remarks included specific rebukes to pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\n\u201cWe will not relinquish a single inch of territory passed down from our forefathers,\u201d Wei declared, a sentiment widely interpreted as a reference to China\u2019s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cNational reunification is the only rightful path, and pursuing secession is a dead end,\u201d he said, warning \u201csecessionists\u201d in Taiwan that China\u2019s patience with them is limited.\n\nHe also stressed that foreign countries will not be allowed to interfere with China\u2019s claims on Taiwan, stating that Beijing will never accept \u201cbig stick diplomacy\u201d or \u201clong-arm jurisdiction\u201d from other powers and deriding economic sanctions as \u201cnever effective to achieve any results.\u201d\n\nWei accused the United States of provoking regime change \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d in other countries \u2013 a term used because the first such political upheavals in eastern Europe were branded names like the \u201cRose Revolution\u201d in Georgia and \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d in Ukraine \u2013 and implied the Hong Kong uprising is such an American scheme.\n\n\u201cWanton interference in other countries\u2019 affairs will never win,\u201d he said. \u201cInterfering in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs, instigating a color revolution or even attempts to subvert the legitimate governments of other countries are the real causes of wars and unrest in different regions.\u201d\n\nThe South China Morning Post thought Wei\u2019s speech to the Xiangshan forum was generally \u201cless hawkish\u201d than his address in 2018, possibly because Beijing is interested in repairing relations with the U.S. and presenting itself as a force for \u201cwin-win\u201d regional cooperation.\n\nStars and Stripes, on the other hand, took Wei\u2019s belligerent language as a harbinger of worsening relations with the U.S. and quoted the State Department\u2019s top Asia diplomat, David R. Stillwell, dismissing China\u2019s \u201cpreposterous nine-dashed line\u201d in the South China Sea as a grab for territory unsupported by \u201clegal, historic, or geographic merit.\u201d\n\nStillwell also noted that for all its talk about international respect and rejection of \u201cbig stick diplomacy,\u201d China has no qualms about bullying smaller nations like Vietnam into recognizing its claims and aggressively developing islands whose ownership is disputed.", "description": "Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe asserts China will not budge on its territorial claims over Taiwan, Hong Kong, or the South China Sea.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/wi/afp/02/4d7d0c_chinese-government-measures-stop-turbulence-is-correct-policy-defence-e1571774070148-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
