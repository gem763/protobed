(UBER) is the Stock of the Day at Real Money Monday as the stock traded firmer in pre-market action Monday after Citigroup upgraded Uber shares to buy from neutral. We do not have a lot of trading history to work with on UBER, but let's check our app and the charts to see if the stock can reverse its recent decline.\n\nIn this first daily bar chart of UBER, below, we can see that prices made a peak in early July not long after the company went public. Prices have been making lower lows and lower highs into early October. UBER is trading below the bearish 20-day and the bearish 50-day moving average lines (we used shorter time frames because of the lack of trading history).\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been in a decline from the middle of May and suggests that sellers of UBER have been more aggressive. There is a minor bullish divergence between the OBV line and the price action as prices have made a new low for the move down but the OBV line has not. This is a small divergence and may not produce much of an upside move. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has been below the zero line line since August, but the two moving averages that make up this indicator have been narrowing and this may become a cover shorts buy signal in the days ahead.\n\nIn this second daily bar chart of UBER, below, we have changed out the MACD oscillator for the 12-day price momentum study. Here we see another bullish divergence as prices made lower lows but the momentum study made a higher low from August to October. This tells us that the rate of decline slowed and that may due to scale-down buying by foresighted investors.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of UBER, below, we can see a nearby downside price target of $28.\n\nBottom line strategy: Maybe UBER has declined enough from its highs to attract a new group of buyers. Some small bullish divergences and a fundamental upgrade may be enough to generate a recovery into the $32-$34 area in the days and weeks ahead.", "description": "Uber Technologies (UBER) shares may ride a bit higher in the next few weeks as Citigroup's upgrade of Uber to buy from neutral could be enough to generate some positive momentum for the ride-sharing company....UBER", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Uber Shares May Ride A Bit Higher In The Short Run", "Citigroup'S Upgrade Of Uber To Buy Neutral Could Be Enough To Generate Some Positive Momentum For The Ride-Sharing Company.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass", "Jim", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/edeed54b-7324-11e9-9035-dd2d80f5b48f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
