REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nNike on Thursday shuttered the famed programme, with its stable of elite competitors who added to the company\u2019s authority in the world of distance running, calling it a \u201cdistraction\u201d for its athletes.\n\nSalazar was given a four-year doping ban by USADA on Sept. 30 but has denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal.\n\nUSADA CEO Travis Tygart said shutting down the NOP programme was \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do.\n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s hope they accept that mistakes were made and truly commit to clean sport and the health, well-being of athletes,\u201d he said.\n\nNike declined to comment on the USADA statement but reiterated that the decision to fold the NOP was done \u201cto allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs.\n\n\u201cThis situation including uninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions has become an unfair burden for current OP athletes,\u201d a Nike spokesperson said. \u201cWe will continue to support Alberto in his appeal.\u201d\n\nThe decision to close the programme came two days before the Chicago Marathon, with NOP athletes Galen Rupp, the race\u2019s 2017 champion, and women\u2019s contender Jordan Hasay among the favourites.\n\nHasay, who was coached by Salazar, said she found out about the shutdown on Thursday but was staying \u201claser-focused\u201d on Sunday\u2019s marathon.\n\n\u201cThat was unfortunate news,\u201d said Hasay. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was to be expected but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nNeither Rupp nor Hasay have been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nDespite the void left by the closure of the Nike programme, analysts said the company should be able to weather the controversy with its brand relatively intact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d call this a minor sprain for Nike,\u201d said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising.\n\nRegarding the company\u2019s competitors, he said that while the controversy \u201cmay help Adidas continue to close the wide earnings gap,\u201d Nike still reigns supreme.\n\n\u201cNike still dominates the running category, sponsors the large majority of top track and field athletes, and makes shoes that people want.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has praised the decision to shut down the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), saying on Friday it was a necessary step after the elite distance running programme's leader, Alberto Salazar, was suspended for doping violations.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439872026&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A28Y", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
