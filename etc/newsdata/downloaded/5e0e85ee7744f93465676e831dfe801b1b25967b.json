Outrageous,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCastro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama, told NBC News that he would repeal the policy immediately through an executive order if elected president.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of migrants who are suffering because of Trump\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy. They are being kidnapped extorted and subjected to violence. I want to speak out particularly for the most vulnerable, migrants with disabilities and migrants who are LGBTQ. They\u2019ve been particularly hurt by this policy,\u201d he said.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro escorted a group of asylum seekers from Mexico to Texas, seeking to have their cases", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
