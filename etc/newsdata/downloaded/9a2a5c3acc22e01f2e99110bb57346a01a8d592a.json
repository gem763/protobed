They were told that they have either the high-risk variations or protective variations in their genome, irrespective of their actual risk.\n\nThey researchers also told participants what to expect for their risk profile, and found that being told you're more likely to develop a condition, in some cases, can result in physiological changes that actually trump the actual risk for a condition, suggesting that sometimes our mindset might be more important than our biology when it comes to our health.\n\n\"A lot of people may find the results surprising,\" said Bradley Turnwald, the study's lead author, \"but it's been shown that many types of information can lead to placebo effects in our body system, immune system and nervous system.\"\n\nWith more and more people taking genetic tests to gain insights into their health, Turnwald wanted to know if placebo and nocebo effects \u2014 where negative expectations leads to a negative outcome \u2014 were also present when people learn about their genetic risks.\n\nA delicate deception\n\nThe research team created two experiments to test their hypothesis, and hid the true purpose of the study from participants by telling them it was to understand genetics' effect on diet instead.\n\nAll 223 participants provided DNA samples before they were assigned to either the exercise test or the eating test.\n\nThe exercise test looked at genetic variations that are linked to exercise capacity. Some genetic variations have been linked to poorer performance and reduced cardiovascular improvements.\n\nExperiment showed that simply being told that you have a genetic propensity for lower exercise capacity can cause poorer performance on a treadmill test.

While participants who were told that they were prone to obesity saw little change in the second test.\n\n\"The results show that being told you had the good version of a gene has a placebo effect, while nocebo effect was similar to, and in some cases greater than the risk version of the gene,\" Turnwald said. \"The fact that they're on the same scale is very surprising and important.\"\n\nThe researchers revealed the real goals of their research immediately after the follow-up test to make sure that the nocebo effects were minimized.\n\nBody and mind\n\nThe link between the mind and body is has been investigated in previous placebo research.\n\n\"Placebo studies shows that our body systems are heavily connected to our brain, and genetic risk information provides really strong expectations to people because people tend to think that their genes are very fixed and it feels like there's not much that you can do,\" Turnwald explained.\n\n\"Those expectations that you mind has about what's going to happen when you go exercise or when you eat are intimately linked to our body systems and the brain adapts and prepares to feel less full because you expect to feel less full.\"\n\nThis means we need to think about how to deliver test results in a way that's most beneficial to the client and that doesn't lead to a negative mindset.\n\nAccording to Turnwald's findings, genes only play a part of the role in determining our health outcome. Behaviour, environment, and mindset are the other pieces of the puzzle and all these factors can affect our health.\n\n\"[For people who are told they're genetically predisposed to certain diseases], I think it's important to communicate [that your genetic risk isn't fixed].\" he said. \"There's all these other things that might influence your health outcome and that could have a more beneficial mindset for people who learn that.\"", "description": "Receiving genetic risk information can alter your physiology in ways that could change your actual risk profile for a health condition, according to researchers", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5011286.1549641418!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/afp-1bp91y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-08"}
