Sanders Auctions have since issued statements regarding the legitimacy of the sale after rumours began to circulate that the dress may have be stolen.\n\nA spokesperson for the auction house said that it believes Corea is the rightful owner of the gown, saying: \u201cWe have been made aware of a question concerning the provenance of the Lady Gaga dress being auctioned on October 31.\n\n\u201cOur research confirms the dress was given to the Beverly Hilton lost and found department, where it stayed for almost nine months.\n\n\u201cThe hotel, in accordance with its longstanding policy, released the dress when no one claimed the item. The consignor has a receipt from the Beverly Hilton lost and found department and documentation, which accompanies the dress for auction.\u201d\n\nThe Beverly Hilton reiterated the auction house's statement regarding reports the dress was stolen.\n\nHowever it added that it is in the process of conducting an investigation to determine the gown's \u201crightful owner\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile we are still conducting an internal investigation to understand all the facts, we have no reason to believe the item was stolen,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are working with all parties to retrieve the item and have it returned to its rightful owner as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by The Independent, Valentino declined to comment.\n\nIn January, the \"Bad Romance\" singer accepted the award for Best Original Song for A Star Is Born at the Golden Globes wearing the custom periwinkle blue dress which featured off-the-shoulder sleeves and a billowing train.\n\nAt the time, fans speculated that the dress was a tribute to Judy Garland who wore a similar outfit in the 1954 version of A Star is Born.\n\nHowever, when presented with the image of Garland wearing the dress, Gaga revealed that the resemblance was unintentional.\n\n\u201cWe didn't see that. No, but it looks an awful lot like that, doesn't it?\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\u201cShe looks beautiful. This is Valentino Couture custom creation for me. That's special, except I'm missing the gloves. Thank you for showing me that. It made my night.\"", "description": "The Valentino Couture gown worn by Lady Gaga to the 2019 Golden Globes is being auctioned after it was found by a hotel housekeeper.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/07/00/lady-gaga-golden-globes-lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
