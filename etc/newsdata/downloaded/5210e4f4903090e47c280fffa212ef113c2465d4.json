Our forces are working there with the coalition forces,\u201d he said.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 The commander of Kurdish forces in Syria accused Turkey of sabotaging a US-brokered truce Saturday by blocking the withdrawal of his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/e59981_commander-kurdish-forces-in-syria-mazloum-abdi-in-2019-photo-tells-afp-turkey-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
