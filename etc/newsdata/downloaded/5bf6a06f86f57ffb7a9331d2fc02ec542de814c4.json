U.S officials told the Wall Street Journal (link)they were cautiously optimistic, but taking a wait-and-see approach. But investors cheered the development, which comes after the latest round of tit-for-tat tariff hikes went into effect Sept. 1.\n\nU.S. stock futures shot up after the announcement, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures , S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq Composite futures all up around 1%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei surged 2.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.3%, as investors there wondered if new government concessions (link)would put an end to months of protests. The Shanghai Composite gained 1.5% and the smaller-cap Shenzhen Composite advanced 1.4%. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.2%, while benchmark indexes in Taiwan , Singapore and Indonesia all advanced. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Japan Steel (5631.TO) soared in Tokyo trading, while SoftBank (9984.TO) , Sony (6758.TO) and Fast Retailing (9983.TO) posted solid gains. In Hong Kong, Apple component makers AAC (2018.HK) and Sunny Optical (2382.HK) rose, while property developers such as New World (0017.HK) and Link Real Estate (0823.HK) fell. Samsung (005930.SE) jumped in South Korea, after announcing the long-delayed launch of its new foldable smartphone (link), and Taiwan Semiconductor (2330.TW) advanced in Taiwan. Rio Tinto (RIO.LN) and ANZ Banking (ANZ.AU) gained in Australia.\n\nShares rallied on Wall Street on Wednesday, reversing Tuesday's losses, when disappointing U.S. manufacturing data and an escalation in the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China led to a sell-off that ended a three-day winning streak for the market.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 31.51 points, or 1.1%, to 2,937.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 237.45 points, or 0.9%, to 26,355.47. The Nasdaq , which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, climbed 102.72 points, or 1.3%, to 7,976.88.\n\nInvestors have been worried that the trade war and a slowing global economy could tip the U.S. into a recession. But traders set aside those concerns Wednesday, focusing instead on geopolitical developments.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the government withdrew an extradition bill that had set off three months of protests.\n\nIn Europe, Britain's parliament took a big step toward passing a law that could stop Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to pull out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a withdrawal agreement. Leaving the EU without a deal that covers trade and other issues could result in economic chaos for Britain and complicate trade with member nations in the EU.\n\nThe lingering trade conflict between Washington and Beijing has roiled markets this summer. The economic uncertainty has also become a drag on companies.\n\nOn Sunday, the conflict escalated as the U.S. imposed a 15% tariff on about $112 billion of Chinese products. China responded by charging tariffs of 10% and 5% on a list of American goods.\n\nThe escalation had been expected since early August when the U.S. announced plans for the new tariff measures, prompting China to retaliate.\n\nAfter Thursday's news of renewed trade talks, some analysts warned against too much optimism.\n\n\"While a drop in geopolitical risk premium comes as a welcome relief, but with the omnipresent trade war clouds looming ominously over the market threatening to come thundering down at any time, the air remains thick with caution,\" said Stephen Innes, Asian Pacific market strategist with AxiTrader.\n\nBenchmark crude oil edged up 12 cents to $56.38 a barrel. It rose $2.32 to settle at $56.26 a barrel Wednesday. Brent crude oil , the international standard, gained 17 cents to $60.87 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar rose to 106.63 Japanese yen from 106.21 yen on Wednesday.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 04, 2019 23:40 ET (03:40 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
