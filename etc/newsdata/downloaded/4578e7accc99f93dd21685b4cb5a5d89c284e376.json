Two men remain in a critical condition and are receiving treatment at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and Ruttonjee Hospital. Another 71 people have already been discharged.\n\n\"This is not a protest anymore.

Deputy Police Commissioner Tang Ping-Keung confirmed at a press briefing on Wednesday that 30 police officers were among the injured, blaming protesters for allegedly attacking them.\n\nIn a separate press briefing, Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said that the suspects were arrested on charges including rioting, unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons, and assaulting police officers. He added that it was \u201cone of the most violent, chaotic days in the history of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nLo also confirmed that police shot six live rounds of ammunition on Tuesday, with one high school student being shot in the chest from close range, an action he described as \u201creasonable and legal,\u201d as the officer responsible had legitimately feared for his life.\n\nVideo shows a protester in Hong Kong being shot at close range.

Many on the streets shouted slogans such as, \u201cThere is no National Day celebration, only a national tragedy.\u201d\n\nOne of the protester\u2019s principal aims was the disruption of the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China, a period during which tens of millions have been killed, imprisoned, persecuted, and denied fundamental human rights.\n\nHong Kong has been subject to widespread political and civil unrest since early June, when pro-democracy demonstrators took to the streets in opposition to an extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial.\n\nThe bill has since been shelved by Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam, although the demonstrations have since evolved into a campaign against police brutality, with participants demanding the release of over 1,000 detainees.\n\nThe demonstrations also form part of a wider pushback against Beijing\u2019s increasing interference in the city\u2019s internal affairs, undermining the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d that was agreed on after the handover from the British Empire in 1997.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Over 100 people were injured and nearly 200 were arrested during demonstrations in Hong Kong against communist China.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/01/207fb6_running-battles-raged-hours-city-police-shoot-hong-kong-protester-as-china-e1570056876870-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
