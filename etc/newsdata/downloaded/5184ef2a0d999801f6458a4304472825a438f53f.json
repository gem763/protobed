But the markets continue to show resilience.\n\nU.S.-stock funds declined by an average of 3.0% for August, and are still up 16.6% for the year so far, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data. International-stock funds eased 2.0%, to trim their year-to-date advance to 10.3%.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely volatile\u2026. A lot of it was about tweets,\u201d says Sal Bruno, chief investment officer of IndexIQ, a subsidiary of New York Life Investments. But the larger issue is the conflicting views about the economy. Consumer confidence and employment look good, but other variables point to an economic slowdown. \u201cWhich is going to win out? It\u2019s complete uncertainty,\u201d says Mr. Bruno.\n\nSome of the old rules about the economy and markets don\u2019t seem to be working now. \u201cPeople have been assuming that for yields to go down, you need an economic slowdown,\u201d says Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist and head of global bonds at PGIM Fixed Income. But U.S. interest rates have fallen, driven more in recent years by secular trends like aging demographics and other trends\u2014including the negative interest rates infecting the rest of the world.\n\nThose actions by non-U.S. central banks to cut rates to the bone, says Mr. Tipp, feels \u201ca little like a medieval visit to the doctor, where they want to help but they\u2019re basically killing the patient, taxing their savings and investments with negative rates, and then hoping it will stimulate the economy. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nA surge in bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, helped bond funds rise in August. Funds focusing on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt, the most common type of bond fund, were up 2.3% for the month and are showing a 9.0% total return so far this year.\n\nMany investors are focusing now on the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making meeting next week, when it could cut rates again. But Mr. Tipp says the Fed \u201cis a bit of a sideshow\u201d these days. \u201cWhatever the Fed does will be overwhelmed by the secular forces like demographics, and what is going on in the rest of the world\u2014especially subzero yields taking hold in the other major bond markets.\"\n\nAdds Mr. Bruno: \u201cPeople love rate cuts\u2014up to a point. No one wants to see negative rates here like the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nMr. Power is a Wall Street Journal news editor in South Brunswick, N.J.
