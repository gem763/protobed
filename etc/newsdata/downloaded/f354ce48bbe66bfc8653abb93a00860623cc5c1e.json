But by his own measure of success, which is actual work done, his career has been a qualified failure. He was appointed to his seat in 2009, then elected the next year and reelected in 2016 (both terrible years for Democrats). During his decade in office, the U.S. Congress has been about the least productive legislature in the world. For eight years the Freedom Caucus held the Republican House majority in a death grip of legislative nihilism; Mitch McConnell used Senate rules and power politics to block the Democratic majority and president, then neuter the Democratic minority. All the while, dark money from wealthy interests has flooded the institution, stopping action on problems that large majorities of Americans want solved, including gun violence and climate change.\n\nBennet\u2019s book describes five episodes from this dark decade. He avoids extreme partisan terminology and describes at length his effort to compromise with the other side on immigration reform in 2013. But his book is an implied argument for the impossibility of working with the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m for winning races. You have to take a climate policy to Colorado, to Iowa, and you have to win an argument.\u201d It\u2019s still possible, he said, to work with Republicans in Colorado, though it\u2019s becoming much harder\u2014but not Republicans in Washington, D.C. \u201cI don\u2019t relish it. Barack Obama used to say after his election the fever would break. Now we know the fever didn\u2019t break. I believe that if we are going to continue to live in a democracy, which I think is up for grabs, this is the big question for America right now: It is, can we build a coalition of Americans to make Washington do its job? And what issues we pick, what issues we decide to lead with and the way we design those issues, has a lot to do with whether we\u2019ll succeed in that or not.\u201d\n\nRead: When the culture war comes for the kids\n\nBennet\u2019s analysis of Washington leads him not to a vision of progressive realignment, but to a wariness of Democrats who push for too much. In June, he was the only Democrat among 10 on a debate stage not to raise his hand in favor of decriminalizing illegal border crossings. He was surprised to see all the others with their hand up and thought that the pressure of the televised moment had driven them into an unnecessary and potentially destructive position. Bennet believes that a loud and small core of activists, greatly amplified by social media, is driving the party to potential defeat next November by demanding unpopular maximalist stands. \u201cThe Twitter universe has decided that Medicare for All is what we are about, and the Green New Deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Twitter base of the Democratic Party decides what\u2019s important, not the actual base. The actual base of the Democratic Party are a bunch of people that have never, ever, ever engaged with a politician on Twitter. They are the people we met with today who are teaching school. Those women are invisible to cable television. The children that are in that school are invisible to cable television, and invisible to the Twitter universe.\u201d", "description": "What does it say about American politics that the Colorado senator hasn\u2019t managed to stand out in the presidential race?", "authors": ["George Packer", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTXXZZ2/facebook.jpg?1568409881", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
