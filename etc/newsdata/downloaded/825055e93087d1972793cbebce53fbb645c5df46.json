The afternoon singles matches were split at the noisy, 17,000-seat Palexpo arena.\n\nThe six-man Europe team has a big advantage in ATP rankings, and No. 5 Dominic Thiem started the day by beating the 33rd-ranked Shapovalov 6-4, 5-7, 13-11. Decisive third sets are played as super-tiebreakers.\n\nSock, whose rankings fell into the 200s in an injury-hit season, then levelled the three-day event by winning 6-1, 7-6 (3) against No. 11 Fabio Fognini.\n\nEurope, captained courtside by Bjorn Borg, regained the lead when No. 7 Stefanos Tsitsipas won 6-2, 1-6, 10-7 against 30th-ranked Taylor Fritz for the world team led by John McEnroe.\n\nFederer is back on court before another sold-out crowd Saturday, when Rafael Nadal will also play singles for Europe.\n\nVictories Saturday in the three singles matches and one doubles are worth two points each. Sunday's matches are worth three points each and 13 points are needed to lift the title.\n\nEurope seeks a third straight win in the Laver Cup, which is co-owned by Federer. It was launched two years ago in Prague, then moved to Chicago last year.", "description": "Roger Federer teamed up with Alexander Zverev in doubles to lift Europe into a commanding 3-1 lead over the world team on the first day of the Laver Cup on Friday.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292281.1569015165!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/roger-federer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
