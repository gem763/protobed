When the baby is born, we give them an $800 welcome gift and $3,000 as an education fee,\u201d Sun explained in an interview on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\n\u201cWhen they come back to the company we offer flexible working hours,\u201d Sun added. \u201cAnd recently, we noticed a lot of female employees are getting their Masters and PhD degrees overseas and when they came back, they struggled on whether to have families first or work first. So as a company we have a policy that if they decided to have their eggs frozen, Ctrip would pay for it.\u201d\n\nCtrip is the only company in China that offers fully paid egg freezing for females, according to Sun.\n\nTo be sure, many U.S. companies could learn a lesson or two (or twenty) from Sun\u2019s actions to promote female leaders. That most notably extends to many tech companies in Silicon Valley, which have become synonymous with less than ideal working conditions for men and women with families.\n\nTravel services company CEO of Ctrip Jane Jie Sun Jie speaks during an interview with AFP in the facilities of Ctrip in Shanghai on April 26, 2019.

The China-based company is profitable and has guided to 10% to 15% sales growth in the third quarter. Ctrip has made a series of strategic investments under Sun that has seen the company expand into new markets in India and the U.K.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has gotten into the ride-hailing business to help offer more services to travelers \u2014 it now has ride-hailing deals with Lyft, Grab, Careem and others. In total, Ctrip\u2019s ride-hailing services now touch 785 cities in 47 countries.\n\nCtrip\u2019s stock has dropped by 6% in the past year, however, amid concerns on slowing China growth. The Nasdaq Composite \u2014 which Ctrip is a member \u2014 has gained 8% in the last year.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
