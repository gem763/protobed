Kate Geraghty\n\nFew people doubt that global poverty remains one of humanity\u2019s most pressing problems. Ten percent of the world\u2019s population\u2014more than 700 million people\u2014live on less than US$1.90 a day according to the World Bank. More than 5 million children under the age of 5 die of preventable diseases every year. And half the children on the planet finish their schooling without basic numeracy and literacy.\n\nThe question, of course, is what to do about it. There is often no shortage of seemingly plausible ideas about what might help alleviate poverty. More educational inputs, cleaner water, bed nets to prevent Malaria, subsidised preventative healthcare, access to finance, and information about HIV status are all potential interventions that come to mind. But which ones work, and which ones don\u2019t? And which provide the greatest \u201cbang for the buck\u201d in terms improving outcomes?\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, Kremer, Banerjee and Duflo began using randomised controlled trials\u2014experiments\u2014to understand the causal impact of different interventions. This method quickly came to dominate development economics and provide deep insights about how to best alleviate poverty. As Duflo put it after the prize announcement: \u201cour goal is to make sure that the fight against poverty is based on scientific evidence.\u201d\n\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are familiar in other fields. To understand whether a heart medication is effective one would conduct a pharmaceutical trial. Out of, say, 200 people, half would be randomly selected to receive the heart medication and half to receive a sugar pill (a placebo). Because there is a large number of people in both the \u201ctreatment\u201d group and \u201ccontrol\u201d group, individual differences tend to wash out statistically. One can estimate the causal effect of how effective the heart medication is by looking at the average difference in health outcomes (e.g. the incidence of cardiac events) between the treatment and control groups.", "description": "Randomised testing can dive into the micro-economics of why some groups and nations are worse off than others", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_158%2C$y_568/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b3877b4249f723199552fe0f9790e10f982d8c06", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
