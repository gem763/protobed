Distraught at the attention his wife pays a younger man, the miller uses a spoon to gauge out the man's eyeballs, which he then feeds to the cats.\n\nAnother walkout occurred when the boy is seduced by a nymphomaniac, who then takes out her sexual frustrations by having sex with a goat.\n\nAnd the final exit was spurred by a scene of Russian Cossacks brutally invading and massacring an entire village, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nAn article from the Guardian described the apparent pandemonium in the theater during the screening.\n\nA critic for the Guardian wrote about the audience's reactions to the Venice screening. One man \"fell full-length on the steps in his effort to escape\" while another woman \"became so frantic to get out that she hit the stranger in the next seat,\" critic Xan Brooks wrote.\n\nThe \"centerpiece\" of the audience walkouts was \"the moment [when] 12 viewers broke for the doors only to discover that the exit had been locked,\" Brooks said.\n\nHe went on to give the film an overall positive review.\n\nCritics shared reactions to the film on Twitter.\n\nPretty much everyone agreed that the film wasn't for the faint-hearted, but many thought that the film was overall worth a watch, due to its powerful message about tolerance and violence.\n\n\u2014International Film Critique (@IntFilmCritique) September 3, 2019\n\nSome, however, didn't feel the movie's excessive violence was worthwhile.\n\n\u2014David Opie @ Venice Film Festival (@DavidOpie) September 3, 2019\n\nOverall, most critics seemed to think that the movie was worth a watch, despite the excessive amounts of violence.\n\nOn Twitter and in reviews, most critics concluded that the film was violent but also relevant, given its political overtones and message.\n\nDeborah Young of the Hollywood Reporter called the film \"heart-wrenching\" and said it was an \"ideal film treatment\" of the original novel.\n\n\"I can state without hesitation that this is a monumental piece of work and one I'm deeply glad to have seen,\" the Guardian's Xan Brooks wrote in his review. He added that the film ends \"with the smallest glimmer of hope\" that's ultimately satisfying.\n\n\"After three hours in hell a lone crumb of comfort can fill us up like a banquet,\" Brooks concluded.", "description": "\"The Painted Bird\" is based on a 1965 novel and tells the story of a young Jewish boy who's tortured and abused while fleeing the Holocaust.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d703398f4fc2472cd084f7f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
