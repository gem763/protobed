It is understood that Mr Freer had permission to miss the vote because he was \u201cpaired\u201d with Labour\u2019s Andrew Gwynne.\n\nMr Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, had tweeted earlier in the day to say he was missing the crucial Brexit votes because his 7-week-old grandson was seriously ill in hospital.\n\nSo rather than failing to vote because he felt he could not support the government's position, he did so intentionally to ensure that Mr Gwynne's absence did not affect the outcome of the vote.\n\nThe pairing convention allows MPs who are unable to take part in a vote to do so knowing that it will not have an impact on the result. If they are unable to vote, party whips assign a member of the opposing party who agrees to also miss the vote, ensuring the outcome is not affected.\n\nConservative whips are likely to be particularly careful to ensure the convention around pairing is respected following a major row last year in which Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave, was assured she was paired with Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis for a key vote. But with the Tories facing a major defeat, Mr Lewis went ahead and took part in the vote, prompting accusations that Tory chief whip Julian Lewis had broken the trust involved in pairing arrangements in order to try to win the vote. The Conservatives, however, insisted it had been an honest mistake.\n\n3 What is 'pairing'?\n\nThe pairing convention allows MPs who are unable to take part in a vote to do so knowing that it will not have an impact on the result.
