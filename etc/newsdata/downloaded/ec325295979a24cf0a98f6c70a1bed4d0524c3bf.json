Two of those posts featured commentary on the health care reform debate between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Another post criticized the blogger Markos Moulitsas for pushing an anti-Bush strategy for the 2008 general election. Only two of the blog\u2019s members, K. Sabeel Rahman and John Pappas, published under their own names. The site\u2019s other users went by pseudonyms\u2014EHT, NDM, Ramazzini, Tacitus, Traveler, calvinball, and nickrod. It\u2019s not clear which, if any of these, might have been Buttigieg.\n\nThe members of the Democratic Renaissance Project have taken divergent paths in the intervening years. Ganesh Sitaraman, one of Buttigieg\u2019s Harvard classmates, is now a law professor at Vanderbilt with extensive writings on monopoly power and the need for more robust antitrust policy. In 2011, he became Elizabeth Warren\u2019s policy director and has been among her top advisers ever since. Rahman, who went to both Harvard and Oxford with Buttigieg, is now president of the liberal think Demos and also writes frequently about antitrust policy.\n\nBoth Sitaraman and Rahman have also been proponents of institutional reforms. Buttigieg\u2019s proposal to overhaul the Supreme Court\u2014creating a bench of 15 justices with five Democrats, five Republicans, and five others selected by the first ten\u2014is an idea first proposed by Sitaraman.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s donors have discouraged him from promoting institutional reforms.\n\nIdeas like these were central to Buttigieg\u2019s early campaign. Then, he railed against the Electoral College, voter suppression, and gerrymandering. He talked up Sitaraman\u2019s court proposal and expressed an openness to eliminating the Senate filibuster. But as the Times recently reported, Buttigieg\u2019s donors have discouraged him from promoting institutional reforms. \u201cMultiple financial bundlers told the campaign that the Supreme Court and Electoral College proposals were not popular, according to people familiar with the discussions,\u201d the Times\u2019 Reid Epstein wrote. \u201cMr. Buttigieg has since quietly dropped them from his stump speech.\u201d\n\nButtigieg did discuss his court reform proposal, cautiously, in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan\u2014while also praising conservative justice Anthony Kennedy, who ruled in favor of Trump\u2019s Muslim ban as well as the Janus decision that weakened public sector unions from the bench. On antitrust, Buttigieg has spoken about the failures of the existing enforcement regimes and said that his administration would fight anti-competitive mergers and consider the break-up of overly large firms. But he has also criticized Warren\u2019s open declarations of her intent to break up tech companies like Facebook and Amazon. \u201dI don\u2019t think that that should be declared in advance by a politician,\u201d he said at a New Hampshire event this week.\n\nAnother group Buttigieg was involved with after graduation and the Kerry campaign was the Truman National Security Project, a think tank where he would become a fellow. Founded in 2005, Truman describes itself today as a \u201cnationwide membership of diverse leaders inspired to serve in the aftermath of 9/11 and committed to shaping and advocating for tough, smart national security solutions. In a 2005 piece, the Jewish Daily Forward\u2019s E.J. Kessler referred to the Project as \u201ca new generation of hawkish Democrats rethinking security questions in a post-9/11 world.\u201d\n\nThis part of Buttigieg\u2019s background seemed to inform his opening remarks at September\u2019s debate, in which he invoked 9/11. \u201c[F]or a moment,\u201d he said, \u201cwe came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people. That\u2019s what presidential leadership can do.\u201d\n\nThe unity that followed 9/11, of course, brought us into wars that spread death and chaos abroad and eventually deepened our paranoia and political divisions at home. Buttigieg served in one of those wars and has been keen on reminding us about it. One of his odder invocations of his experience in Afghanistan came in the following debate, where he took an uncharacteristically sharp and discordant jab at Beto O\u2019Rourke, who had praised his military service, during a back and forth about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory buyback proposal, which O\u2019Rourke insisted Democrats should support regardless of polling and the advice of political consultants.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d\n\nWhat does Buttigieg want to get done? He explained his brand of progressivism to Vox in March. \u201cI think of myself as progressive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also believe in capitalism, but it has to be democratic capitalism.\u201d He went on to argue that capitalism can become unmoored from democratic values: \u201cWhen you have capitalism without democracy, you get crony capitalism and eventually oligarchy.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cdemocratic capitalism\u201d seems particularly important to Buttigieg.\n\nThe phrase \u201cdemocratic capitalism\u201d seems particularly important to Buttigieg. He repeated it the following month in an appearance on Meet the Press\u2014\u201cLook, America is a capitalist society. But it\u2019s got to be democratic capitalism\u201d\u2014and in another interview on CNN. Burgin thinks the phrase might reference the Progressive Era commitments Warren and her backers like Sitaraman share. \u201cMy guess is that that it\u2019s his attempt to say, \u2018Okay. I embraced many of the beneficial aspects of the market economy, but I want to emphasize that it should be subject to democracy rather than have democracy, subject to capitalism,\u201d he says. But Burgin also notes that the phrase \u201cdemocratic capitalism\u201d was also briefly popularized in the 1980s by the 1982 book The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism by philosopher and theologian Michael Novak. Novak revisited the topic in a 2015 article for the conservative Catholic magazine First Things. \u201cDemocratic capitalism means a system of natural liberty, incorporating both political liberty and economic liberty,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPrior to those two is a particular moral and cultural system, constituted by civic institutions and well-ordered personal habits.\u201d\n\nNovak was also the author of the 2013 book Writing from Left to Right: My Journey from Liberal to Conservative, a memoir of his political conversion in the 1970s, which he summarized for Crisis Magazine in 2007. \u201cMany of us once thought that socialism was basically a good idea, but socialists had not found a practical way to implement it successfully,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we actually started to examine the many different national experiments in socialism\u2014almost 70. None of them worked. So, socialism cannot be a good idea. Now, if you are on the Left and you cease being a socialist, what are you? If you do not take the state as the main engine of progress, where do you turn?\u201d\n\nThis question, which vexed left-liberals throughout the Cold War, was asked more urgently following the defeat of progressive George McGovern in 1972\u2019s presidential election, a result most read as backlash to left-wing radicalism. Some, like Novak, answered it by leaving left-wing politics behind. Others would go on to advance those ideas within the Democratic Party. In the immediate wake of McGovern\u2019s defeat, some in both camps were briefly united by the group Coalition for a Democratic Majority, on whose board Novak served. The Coalition\u2019s 1972 manifesto charted a path forward for Democrats\u2014recommitting to American global leadership, rejecting identity politics, and, in words that recall Buttigieg\u2019s announcement speech, returning the party \u201cto its rightful place as the party of progress, freedom, and security for all.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, neoconservative Irving Kristol described the supply-side economics that would come to define the Reagan administration as \u201cthe last best hope of democratic capitalism in America.\u201d The term was also a pet phrase of Republican congressman, 1988 presidential candidate Jack Kemp, who invoked it in a 1990 column, among other occasions. \u201cThe ideas of democratic capitalism have triumphed the world over,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut the struggle to turn those ideas into political reality everywhere has not been completed.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, rising stars like Bill Bradley and Al Gore used the phrase to describe a kind of shareholder capitalism that would give workers more of a role in economic decision making. But by mid-decade, the more conservative rendering of the phrase had won out both within both the Republican establishment and the Democratic Party\u2019s insurgent reformers, who took up the cause with new centrist organizations like the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). The DLC, the Christian Science Monitor reported in 1986, was \u201cdeveloping a new \u2018democratic capitalism\u2019 to address such ills as the nation\u2019s declining productivity. Theirs is an approach, they say, that no party\u2014Democratic or Republican\u2014has attempted.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, the DLC sent a few of its leading figures on a multi-state speaking tour titled \u201cDemocratic Capitalism: A New Path to Economic Strength.\u201d Its chairman at the time was then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, who would bring the group\u2019s ideas to the White House after his victory in the following year\u2019s election. A 1992 Washington Post profile of a triumphant DLC founder Al From, noted that the group\u2019s funding came \u201clargely from corporate lobbyists and the financial community who appreciate the DLC\u2019s pragmatic approach of \u2018democratic capitalism.\u2019\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg is almost Bill Clinton; their personal careers parallel each other eerily. Both Clinton and Buttigieg earned Ivy League degrees\u2014from Yale and Harvard, respectively. Both were Rhodes Scholars. Clinton and his boosters in the late 1980s and early 1990s pitched him as a Democrat whose background and politics could shore up the party in the South. Buttigieg has made the same pitch, but for the Midwest and the Rust Belt.\n\nThe central irony of the Buttigieg candidacy is that his array of meritocratic credentials have set him on his way towards becoming one of the least formally qualified presidents in American history.\n\nHowever, by the time he ran for president in 1992, Bill Clinton had been governor of Arkansas for a decade\u2014having previously served as the state\u2019s attorney general\u2014and the head of the National Governors Association, a perch from which he influenced the national policy conversation. Buttigieg became mayor of South Bend\u2014a town of just over 100,000 residents\u2014less than a decade ago, after losing a race for Indiana treasurer that saw him reportedly describe himself as a \u201cconservative\u201d on financial issues. The central irony of the Buttigieg candidacy is that his array of meritocratic credentials have set him on his way towards becoming one of the least formally qualified presidents in American history.\n\nLike Clinton, Buttigieg has spent much of his young life figuring out how to master language and rhetoric. But his fixation on political language reflects more than just his political ambitions. With his presidential run, he has committed himself more urgently to the task that Democrats who invoke the idea of democratic capitalism have generally had first in mind: slowing the party\u2019s leftward progress. He has run to the right not only of Bernie Sanders, but also Elizabeth Warren, who he has criticized sharply for supporting Medicare for All in recent weeks. On foreign policy, Buttigieg\u2019s background suggests a preoccupation with strength and a confidence that American military power can be wielded responsibly and unashamedly with the right person in charge, that person preferably being Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThis is among the many things about Buttigieg\u2014next to the talk about freedom and security, the educational credentials, the military service, and his invocations of religion\u2014that make it seem as though he\u2019s been engineered as a response to Republican Party of 2004. He offers the kind of rhetoric one imagines the Democratic Party might have leaned into if Obama\u2019s rise had never occurred\u2014less soaring and more concerned with countering Republican suggestions of weakness. This is perhaps what made his early talk about not caring what Republicans say about Democrats so short-lived and personally untenable. Buttigieg has spent much of his life caring very deeply about what Republicans say\u2014so deeply, in fact, that he is still doggedly fighting the rhetorical battles of the Bush presidency, a marooned soldier who hasn\u2019t been told the war is over.\n\nHad Buttigieg won his bid to become chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, his war might have become our war again. There\u2019s still a chance it will. The Buttigieg project has been to align the trajectory of the Democratic Party with his own personal trajectory. In lieu of the philosophical underpinnings he and his college friends were searching for, Buttigieg is offering Democrats himself and the scaffolding of a dated rhetorical framework.\n\nThe task ahead of the Democratic Party is not just the redefining of certain political terms and debates but the remaking of our country and economy. The realization of this has finally brought about a Democratic renaissance\u2014but not the one Buttigieg imagined back in college. As such, it is not clear that he understands the grand and terrifying possibilities before us now\u2014whether the existential questions facing this country and planet are truly appreciable to a man convinced the mayorship of South Bend, Indiana, has prepared him for the presidency of the United States. What is certain is that Pete Buttigieg\u2014the millennial candidate, the candidate of generational change\u2014is a man stuck out of time, a Rip Van Winkle who\u2019s somehow managed to keep both his boyish looks and sense of mission.\n\nSomewhere at this very moment\u2014in Cambridge or Oxford, or New Haven, or Princeton\u2014an undergraduate is furrowing his brow about what the Democratic Party should do in 2020. We will hear from him eventually. He will leave with the right degree and maybe get another. He will do the right nonprofit work and maybe move on to the right consulting job. The necessary introductions will be made. The necessary recommendations will be written. He will then feel something missing\u2014he will hear, suddenly and loudly, a call to something nobler than employment in the private sector. A call to public service. This, at any rate, is what his memoir will say. He will win something. And then he will be everywhere. On television. On NPR. He will appear in newspapers if there are still newspapers to appear in. He will win awards no one has heard of. He will be one of 30 under 30, or 40 under 40, or Someone to Watch. And, dutifully, we will. We will listen to ideas that would have been dubiously useful 15, 20, or 25 years earlier. We will be asked to vote for them. And, if we know what\u2019s good for us, we will not.", "description": "A lifelong obsession with reforming the Democratic Party's rhetoric has trapped the South Bend mayor in the politics of the past.", "authors": ["Osita Nwanevu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/a8c55600e164c9f6fbd52c22b269a90d9cb45ff5.png?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
