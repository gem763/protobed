T 2.15% agreed to buy Time Warner nearly three years ago, it promised to create an entertainment and advertising behemoth that could take on Silicon Valley giants like Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google and Netflix Inc.\n\nNow, the telecom giant is under pressure to deliver.\n\nElliott Management Corp., the activist investor that disclosed a stake in AT&T on Monday, said in a letter to the company that it has \u201cfailed to articulate a clear strategic rationale\u201d for the $80 billion-plus Time Warner acquisition.\n\nAT&T had told Wall Street and regulators that Time Warner\u2014which was re-christened WarnerMedia\u2014would help it launch into the streaming-video wars, boost its traditional wireless and pay-TV services and build up an advertising-analytics business that could benefit the TV industry broadly.\n\nBut Elliott said that when it comes to direct-to-consumer streaming, there is a \u201cgrowing sense that AT&T doesn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d given recent shifts in strategy. And it said the departure of top Time Warner executives leaves the company without necessary media expertise at a critical moment in the industry.\n\n\u201cWhile it is too soon to tell whether AT&T can create value with Time Warner, we remain cautious on the benefits of this combination,\u201d Elliott said. The investment firm called for AT&T to focus more on execution, rather than acquisitions, and divest itself of any noncore assets across its business.\n\nA lengthy antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which only came to a close in February, significantly slowed AT&T\u2019s ability to integrate Time Warner. In a statement, AT&T said Monday that it is already executing many of the actions outlined by Elliott.\n\nOne of the biggest priorities for AT&T is launching a new direct-to-consumer streaming service to compete with Netflix and other rivals. The company initially laid out plans to offer a three-tiered platform, with an entry-level option focused on movies and additional tiers with the premium HBO Now and Warner Bros. programming. AT&T initially said the service would launch in late 2019.\n\nBy this summer, the company had shifted to focus on a single offering, HBO Max. \u201cThis quick reversal has intensified the skepticism around WarnerMedia, its OTT strategy and the management of the business itself,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nAT&T now says there will be a limited or \u201cbeta\u201d launch late this year, with a broad commercial launch next spring, after rival offerings from Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc. have already hit the market.\n\nWarnerMedia executives counter that while there have been tweaks to the strategy, it isn\u2019t fair to say there is \u201cconfusion\u201d and a \u201clack of plan,\u201d as Elliott claimed. The long antitrust battle against the government slowed the company down, the executives said, and AT&T plans to lay out its strategy at an investor meeting at the end of October.\n\nWarnerMedia has unveiled a large number of original TV shows and movies for HBO Max as well as reacquiring key library content including reruns of the hit comedy \u201cFriends.\u201d It hasn\u2019t yet announced a price for the service, but it is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 average price for HBO Now, a person familiar with the matter has said.\n\nDisney earlier this year said its streaming service, Disney+, would launch in November and cost $6.99 a month. Apple TV+ will cost $4.99 a month starting Nov.1, the company said Tuesday.\n\nWarnerMedia has reacquired key library content including reruns of the hit comedy \u2018Friends.\u2019 Photo: Warner Bros./Everett Collection\n\nAfter prevailing in the antitrust fight, AT&T moved to break down the corporate walls and fiefs at WarnerMedia, leading to the exits of the top executives at the HBO and Turner divisions this spring. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson had earlier said he wasn\u2019t looking to change the culture of WarnerMedia nor the leadership at key units.\n\nThe executive AT&T picked to lead WarnerMedia, John Stankey, has since emerged as the likely successor to Mr. Stephenson.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which of the upcoming streaming services are you considering signing up for? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cFor a content business now owned by a telecommunications company and under the direct supervision of a lifelong telecom executive, this lack of continuity in leadership presents a real concern for investors,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nWhile some senior executives such as HBO head Richard Plepler have left the company, WarnerMedia has also brought in new management including Robert Greenblatt, former NBC and Showtime programming chief as chairman of WarnerMedia entertainment.\n\nOn Tuesday, WarnerMedia unveiled a new distribution unit for its cable channels\u2014a continuation of the combining of the HBO and Turner units under one umbrella.\n\nAT&T also said it would upend the $70 billion traditional television-advertising market, using its reams of data\u2014on everything from its DirecTV subscribers to where its customers take their phones\u2014to help advertisers target consumers with ads across their TVs and digital devices.\n\nThe company\u2019s plans put the spotlight on Xandr, the targeted advertising division created when AT&T acquired ad tech marketplace AppNexus for about $1.6 billion in 2018. Cable and satellite TV operators have long promised marketers would be able to target TV commercials to individual homes, but the offering has been slow to catch on. AT&T\u2019s plan has faced hurdles, including privacy and regulatory concerns around how telecommunications and broadband providers may leverage customer data.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing how AT&T and other internet-service providers use consumer data for advertising. The agency ordered AT&T\u2019s advertising subsidiary and other companies to provide information on their privacy practices for user data last month. AT&T said at the time that it would respond appropriately.\n\nWarnerMedia started making significant cuts to its ad-sales division in July.\n\nElliott\u2019s letter called for a full review of AT&T\u2019s portfolio, including its advertising assets.\n\n\u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Patience Haggin at patience.haggin@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nWarnerMedia started making significant cuts to its ad-sales division in July.
