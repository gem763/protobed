Funds which spread the investment across many stocks and other assets are a good way to start.\n\nBut even then, investors should ensure their money is split across different managers and areas.\n\nTake care of your debts before you invest\n\nDon't start chasing gains on the stock market before paying off debts. Investments can go down as well as up. So hoping to turn a small pot of cash into a large pot of cash to pay off looming debts could backfire spectacularly.\n\nKeep cash for emergencies\n\nHolding cash in the bank, even at low interest rates, is useful to cover emergencies such as car repairs, or for looming expenses such as a wedding or holiday.\n\nDo some research and keep watching\n\nFind out what the fund manager invests in. Only hand over your money if that's what you want to invest in. Just checking at the beginning isn't enough.\n\nJason Hollands, of wealth manager Tilney, says: 'A big concern is when a manager deviates from their previous approach and recipe for past success.\n\n'They are effectively experimenting with investors' money. This can be a sign of either loss of faith in their process or over confidence in their abilities.'\n\nMany have criticised Woodford for his deviation, as he began to plough more of the Equity Income fund into smaller, riskier stocks.\n\nBeware best-buy lists\n\nMost investment platforms will publish a list of recommended funds. Andy Bell, founder of AJ Bell, says they are 'really important for investors who can't afford a wealth manager or independent advice'.\n\nBut Hargreaves Lansdown came under fire for keeping Woodford Equity Income on its Wealth 50 list right until it was suspended in June.\n\nInvestors should check how platforms research the funds on their lists, and ensure that the recommendations aren't linked to any economic incentives for the firm.\n\nCheck out the fund manager\n\nAlthough past performance is never an indication of future reliability, checking a manager's track record can give an idea of how successful they have been.\n\nTheir performance will always fluctuate as their strategy falls in and out of favour, but websites like FE Trustnet and Morningstar will show their performance against the industry benchmark over time.\n\nWoodford's track record was stellar before he set up his own firm in 2014, which proves past performance isn't everything. So keep up with news about the fund manager.\n\nRather than trusting one big name, Haig Bathgate, of 7IM, says: 'We favour investing in funds where there is a strong team approach with different talents working together to make investment decisions.\n\nMultiple points of view can provide multiple ways to solve problems that one person would not have been able to.'\n\nConsider tracker funds for part of your portfolio\n\nAs the name suggests, they track an index such as the FTSE 100 or FTSE 350. This means they will go down when the market does, but you won't run the risk of significantly underperforming.\n\nThey are generally cheaper than funds run by a big-name stockpicker. Firms such as Vanguard and Fidelity offer a range of different trackers.\n\nDon't get caught up in the hype of a new launch\n\nIt's easy to get carried away when a well-known manager sets up a fund.\n\nIn the run-up to the launch of Woodford Equity Income fund, Hargreaves Lansdown sent customers four emails persuading them to invest.\n\nBut platforms and wealth advisers may get economic incentives from a fund manager for pulling in more of their customers' money, so be wary.\n\nConsider regular investment\n\nIf you're worried about investing a lump of money and then immediately seeing the market fall, invest a little at a time. This reduces the risk of piling in at a bad time.\n\n...and Keep investing\n\nOne of the biggest downsides of the Woodford debacle is that it will deter many from investing.\n\nYes, it's a risk, but if you just keep your money in a deposit account you are certain to lose in real terms after inflation because returns are so low.", "description": "Neil Woodford's fall from grace has seen his empire crumble and his customers suffer heavy losses.
