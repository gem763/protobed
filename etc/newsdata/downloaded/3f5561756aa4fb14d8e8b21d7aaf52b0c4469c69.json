But only last week he ardently denied our report that he\u2019s preparing to resign and cause a by-election next year, with the Andrews government preparing to appoint him to the Victorian Court of Appeal.\n\nWe\u2019ll see about that. A multitude of spots on the bench will become available for a Justice Dreyfus before the next state election in 2022 \u2013 including if the next High Court justice is drawn from the Garden State\u2019s bench.\n\nHigh Court vacancies are customarily filled by jurists from the same state and Justice Geoffrey Nettle, a Victorian, reaches mandatory retirement age in December next year.", "description": "Mark Dreyfus lunched in Canberra on Tuesday with his preferred successor, even though he's not leaving.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1751%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c07193b464301da7a29029c79d0babee8d3056b5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
