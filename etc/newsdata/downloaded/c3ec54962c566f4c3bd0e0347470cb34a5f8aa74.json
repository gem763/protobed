PRECIOUS-Gold eases on Brexit deal, global growth concerns limit losses\n\n* Palladium eyes strongest week since Sept. 13\n\n* China's Q3 economic growth weakest in near 3 decades\n\n* Brexit parliament vote on Saturday\n\n* GRAPHIC-Gold vs currencies: http://tmsnrt.rs/1JxbO6Y\n\n(Updates prices, adds comments and details)\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nOct 18 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Friday after the Brexit deal\n\nstruck by Britain and the European Union, although losses were\n\nlimited by weak economic data from the United States and China.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.2% to $1,488.78 an ounce at 1009\n\nGMT. U.S. gold futures GCv1 fell 0.4% to $1,492.20.\n\nThe European Union backed a new Brexit deal with Britain on\n\nThursday, more than three years after Britons voted in a\n\nreferendum to leave the bloc.\n\n\"The focus is on Brexit. The risk of a no deal Brexit has\n\ndropped and overall the sentiment on the Brexit front has\n\nimproved a lot, but now it's just the uncertainty of the vote,\"\n\nABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson now faces a Brexit showdown\n\nwith parliament on Saturday. \"If the Brexit deal goes through, there will be a bit of\n\npressure on gold, because there are a few investors who bought\n\ngold on the Brexit story,\" Boele said.\n\nGold denominated in sterling hovered close to a\n\nnear three-month low it hit on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, China's third-quarter economic growth slowed more\n\nthan expected and to its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nThis came after data from the U.S. showed retail sales\n\nfalling for the first time in seven months in September,\n\nsuggesting that manufacturing-led weakness could be spreading to\n\nthe broader economy, while industrial output for last month also\n\ndipped. \"Economic data out of U.S. and China are in favour of\n\nfurther (monetary policy) easing that will be supportive for\n\ngold,\" said SP Angel analyst Sergey Raevskiy.\n\nThe underlying momentum in gold is still positive as \"the\n\nstimulus from the central banks will still be in agenda, the\n\neconomy struggles to pick up in the face of trade war, and there\n\nare geopolitical risks in (the) Middle East, Turkey, Syria and\n\nBrexit is not out of the way completely,\" he added.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet at the end of the\n\nmonth to decide on further interest rate cuts this year. FED/\n\nANZ Bank said it expects gold to be supported by elevated\n\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical risks, with prices for\n\nunder-supplied platinum group metals likely to push higher.\n\n\"The palladium market is still structurally tight, keeping\n\nprices resilient, with intermittent volatility.\"\n\nPalladium XPD= rose 0.1% to $1,760.14 an ounce, a day\n\nafter hitting a record high of $1,783.21.
