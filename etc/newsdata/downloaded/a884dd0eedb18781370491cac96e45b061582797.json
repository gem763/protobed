It keeps athletes from getting robbed.", "language": "en", "text": "Yet that\u2019s what NCAA schools do and have done to their athletes for decades. They are the real cheats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cColleges reap billions from these student-athletes\u2019 sacrifices and success but, in the same breath, block them from earning a single dollar,\u201d Newsom said on signing the bill. \u201cThat\u2019s a bankrupt model.\u201d\n\nLeBron James continues fight against NCAA, announcing support of Fair Pay to Play Act\n\nYou can hear this bankruptcy in the chronically vacuous excuses the so-called \u201cleaders\u201d of the NCAA continually make for their indefensible abuses. The NCAA Board of Governors lobbied Newsom to veto the bill by warning sonorously that it \u201cwould erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletes.\u201d Now that\u2019s a new record for cosseted, luxury-suite-sealed, above-the-law tone-deafness. The NCAA puts athletes up for sale to ESPN for $6 billion in College Football Playoff TV contracts, and to CBS and Turner for $10 billion in NCAA basketball tournament contracts. Yet they have the nerve to say that if a kid monetizes a YouTube channel, it will blur the lines of amateurism. What do they take us for?\n\nJust listen to the stunning double-talk and purposeful misdirection of Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott, who makes $5 million a year off the sweating backs of kids, yet acts like this law somehow will come at their expense, and take from non-revenue athletes. His conference issued a statement that the law will have a \u201cnegative disparate impact\u201d on small sports, and threatens that it will \u201creduce resources\u201d for women and Olympians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The only thing this law reduces is the ability to steal from powerless kids. It doesn\u2019t require schools to pay athletes one dime, or to take resources from one set to give to another. It doesn\u2019t even touch campuses. It doesn\u2019t take anything from anyone.\n\nIt only gives things back.\n\nAll it does is restore an athlete\u2019s natural god-given right to his or her name and image, to do with as they please \u2014 a right every other student on campus has. Natalie Portman made movies and profited from her image while she was at Harvard. Somehow the women\u2019s crew team survived it.\n\nThe only thing the law removes or takes away is the jelly-sticky, overgrasping hands of the NCAA and people such as Scott. It prevents them from appropriating things they had no right to in the first place, such as likenesses used on t-shirts and video games. It just gives Scott fewer things he can sell. If schools fear a constriction in revenue, they do so the way a pickpocket fears the disappearance of a crowd.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe California governor signed a law to let NCAA athletes get paid. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s next.\n\nAll the NCAA ever does is deny and delay when it comes to the rights of athletes, so it can prolong its game of misappropriating their bodies. On Monday after Newsom signed the bill, the NCAA issued a statement decrying the supposed \u201cconfusion\u201d it will cause \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t even take effect until 2023 \u2014 and suggesting any reform should be uniform nationwide changes through its own \u201crules-making process.\u201d\n\nNow look. They had their chance. The NCAA has had a century to modernize its musty, spidery, Victorian amateur rules, and the only reason it hasn\u2019t is because the members don\u2019t want to. They prefer to keep athletes in an artificially impoverished, rights-less, separate, bonded class.\n\nThe NCAA leaders clearly haven\u2019t heard, in their bubble of self-satisfied luxury, the growing clamor for athlete justice. They don\u2019t hear themselves, and their arrogant tone when they argue that if you let a kid earn an independent dollar, the whole \u201ccollegiate model\u201d will come crashing down. They sound like the archdukes who think the peasants should be grateful for thin gruel, and place on the floor of the castle. They don\u2019t hear the mob at the gate baying for their heads, who don\u2019t think the castle is worth saving.\n\nAD", "description": "College officials object to profiting off players\u2019 images only when someone else gets to do it.", "authors": ["Sally Jenkins", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x0-ny6zN-9j82a9x1r6Yfnufvpg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SXAF5HEJII6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
