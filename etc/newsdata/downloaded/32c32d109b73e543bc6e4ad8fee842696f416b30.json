In it, Taylor outlined what he saw as a possible \"nightmare scenario\" resulting from ongoing negotiations to set up a meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nOver the summer, the other two diplomats \u2014 Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerMulvaney helped organize controversial Ukraine meeting State Dept. official told to 'lay low' after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker Top State Department official arrives for testimony in impeachment probe MORE, then Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union \u2014 had worked with Giuliani to win a statement from Zelensky addressing both Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Biden's son, and Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.\n\n\n\nIn a Sept. 8 text to Volker and Sondland, Taylor worried that Ukraine would make good on providing an unspecified \"interview\" but that Trump would renege on the military aid.\n\n\n\n\"The nightmare is they give the interview and don't get the security assistance,\" Taylor texted to Volker and Sondland, according to the transcripts released by Democrats. \"The Russians love it. (And I quit).\"\n\n\n\nThe next day, Taylor warned Sondland that Trump's previous decision to withhold almost $400 million in assistance to Ukraine had already strained relations between the two allies to the benefit of Russia, which launched an incursion into Ukraine in 2014 and still supports rebel forces in eastern parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\"The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key,\" Taylor wrote. \"With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. This is my nightmare scenario.\"\n\n\n\nSondland, a Trump megadonor, responded with confidence that \"we have identified the best pathway forward.\"\n\n\n\nTaylor, however, was skeptical, saying, \"It's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\" \u2014 a reference to the potential harm to Biden's presidential chances if he became enmeshed in a scandal surrounding the foreign business interests of his son.\n\n\n\nSondland pushed back hard, saying Taylor was \"incorrect\" about Trump's reasons for withholding the funding.\n\n\n\n\"The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind,\" Sondland wrote. \"The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign.\"", "description": "William Taylor, a top U.S.\u00a0diplomat to Ukraine, is\u00a0scheduled to testify\u00a0next week\u00a0as part of House Democrats' ongoing impeachment\u00a0inquiry examining President Trump's contacts with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/taylorwilliam_100419getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
