Specifically, the kind of gob-smacking lucre the NRA thought they could make in building up an arms market in Russia. It didn\u2019t matter who their partners were, nor did it concern the organization that they would be yukking it up with Russian officials specifically sanctioned by Washington\u2014that is, men specifically cited by the U.S. government for their role in upending the post-Cold War order. Those who the NRA palled around with were the authors of invasion, war, and thousands of deaths in Ukraine, and those chiefly responsible for expanding the kleptocratic networks which have consistently undermined American interests. Who needs patriotism when you can have profits?\n\nBrownell, as the report lays out, is a perfect case study in just how easily the NRA leadership could be bought off by those aiming to corrode American power\u2014and how shallow the NRA\u2019s supposed patriotism truly was. As Butina and Torshin worked to put together the NRA\u2019s infamous December 2015 trip to Moscow, Brownell was an obvious name to add to the itinerary. Brownell, however, had one stipulation. As the report notes, \u201cBrownell made clear that he would not have participated in the trip but for the opportunity to advance his personal business interests.\u201d Brownell didn\u2019t even bother to cloak his efforts; as he phrased it in one of the emails attached, \u201cI am not interested in attending if just an [NRA] trip,\u201d adding later that he wouldn\u2019t make the trip if there was no \u201cimport or export opportunity\u201d in it for him.\n\nButina was all too eager to play up this line for her marks. Meetings with Russian arms manufacturers\u2014and sanctioned Russian officials\u2014soon followed. With promises of riches flowing, Brownell and his colleagues were steered directly into the arms of an operation whose real aim was to create a backchannel to the GOP, and eventually lift the sanctions that had been placed on the folks hobnobbing with NRA leadership.\n\nThe benefits of these arrangements didn\u2019t just flow to those with official positions in the NRA. As the report outlines, some of the mega-donors bankrolling the NRA wanted in on the action, as well. Joe Gregory\u2014a burly Tennessee multi-millionaire who served as the face of the NRA\u2019s ultra-elite \u201cRing of Freedom\u201d donor program\u2014decided that the NRA\u2019s 2015 trip to Moscow would be the perfect occasion to make his first trip to Russia, and to schmooze with those sanctioned by the U.S. An appreciative Gregory returned the favor in 2016 by bringing Butina to the 2016 National Prayer Breakfast, where she mingled with the upper crust of America\u2019s Christian conservative community. Butina\u2019s preferred method of transportation to the National Prayer Breakfast, according to the report? Gregory\u2019s private plane.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to overstate just how blinded Brownell, Keene and their colleagues were when it came to Butina\u2019s and Torshin\u2019s real designs. All they had to do was, say, visit Butina\u2019s YouTube page, where they would have seen\u2014and where you can still watch\u2014Butina exhort an audience to back the Russian-supported separatists tearing apart eastern Ukraine. Minimal vetting of Butina\u2019s social media presence would have revealed her boasting of visiting Crimea in the immediate aftermath of Russia\u2019s illegal annexation, calling to arm separatists, and, as Mother Jones reported, \u201cpledging support to a leader of a militia group that violently seized a Crimean news outlet it deemed \u2018pro-American.\u2019\u201d Had they wanted to, they could have dropped the FBI a line to see if they had any information on Torshin\u2014and they likely would have received details of Torshin\u2019s alleged central role in a Russian organized crime ring in Spain, where one of the gangsters referred to Torshin as \u201cthe godfather.\u201d", "description": "A new report details the limits of the gun lobby's patriotism when there's Russian moolah on the line.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2ae05fb4087eb7a83f496de63635f485959cece6.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
