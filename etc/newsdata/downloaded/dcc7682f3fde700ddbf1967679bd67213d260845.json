The 18-year-old, who is not identified in court papers, accused the school system of inadequately investigating accusations leveled against him by a female student.\n\nSchool system officials said in a statement they were pleased with the outcome. \u201cWe are grateful that the Court has ruled in favor of the School Board and believe that the decision is legally sound,\u201d the statement read.\n\nJesse R. Binnall, an attorney representing the male student, said he and his client are evaluating the possibility of an appeal.\n\nThe teenager said the school system treats male students facing sexual misconduct accusations more harshly than female students, violating federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools. The student also said the system violated his due-process rights.\n\n[A Fairfax County student was accused of sexual harassment. He says the school system discriminated against him.]\n\nBut Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia determined there was little evidence to back those claims. Trenga said in his decision that the student \u201cwas afforded the notice and opportunity to be heard\u201d and that the student failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the argument that Fairfax schools acted in an unfair or biased way.\n\nThe Robinson case stems from a December incident in which the 18-year-old student who filed the lawsuit was near another male student who allegedly slapped a female student\u2019s buttocks.\n\nThe female student filed a complaint with a school administrator, accusing both male students of sexually harassing her for about a month before the incident, court papers say.\n\nThe male student said he and the young woman flirted with each other but said those encounters were consensual, according to the lawsuit. The male student described those interactions as \u201cplayfully\u201d poking the female student in class and putting his arm around her. He denied sexually harassing the young woman.\n\nAdministrators suspended the male student, and school system administrators held a hearing on the female student\u2019s complaint Dec. 21, according to court documents. The male student and his parents were not allowed to question his accuser or witnesses, but presented their case and submitted statements from two character witnesses.\n\nA hearing officer found the male student had violated the school system\u2019s sexual harassment policy and reassigned him to Mountain View High, an alternative school.\n\nBinnall, the male student\u2019s attorney, described the process used by Fairfax schools to adjudicate sexual misconduct complaints as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d where \u201cstudents don\u2019t have a real opportunity to be heard.\u201d\n\nThe student, who wanted the federal court to clear his record, graduated from the alternative school in June, court papers say.\n\n[Fairfax student accused of sexual misconduct loses discrimination case]\n\nFairfax schools won in a similar case in June. A male student at Lake Braddock Secondary School sued the school system, alleging three female students \u201ccolluded\u201d to accuse the teen of unwanted touching and making inappropriate comments.\n\nThe Lake Braddock student sued amid a national reckoning over sexual misconduct, arguing the school system\u2019s treatment of him was influenced by media reports that \u201csuggest the pervasive nature of sexual assault committed by male students.\u201d\n\nA federal jury sided with Fairfax schools in a case brought by a student who said she was sexually assaulted during an Oakton High band trip. She argued the school\u2019s investigation was inadequate. The jury concluded the teen was sexually harassed and that the experience was so severe it deprived her of educational access. But it found the Fairfax County School Board was not liable because it did not have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the encounter.\n\n[Fairfax system rejects former student\u2019s assault claim, calls it \u2018sexual encounter\u2019]\n\nThe Oakton student\u2019s attorneys have filed a motion seeking a new trial.\n\nRead more:\n\nSexual violence isn\u2019t just a college problem.
