The judges are getting involved in politics.\n\n\"I think that they are impartial, but I'm saying that many people, many Leave voters, many people up and down the country, are beginning to question the partiality of judges.

This is not how government ministers should speak about the judiciary.\"\n\nHe later added on the BBC that questioning the impartiality of judiciary was \"not acceptable\" and \"not responsible\".\n\nDavid Lidington, another former justice secretary, who was most recently Theresa May's deputy, also responded to the cabinet ministers comments.\n\nHe said: \"I've seen no evidence of the courts getting involved in politics but rather English & Scottish courts grappling with important legal/constitutional questions referred to them by UK citizens - and coming to different reasoned judgements.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
