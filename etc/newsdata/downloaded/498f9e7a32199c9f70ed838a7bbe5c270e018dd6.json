United plays with style, beats Seattle for third straight shutout victory", "language": "en", "text": "Performing with refreshing style in the first half and typical resolve and efficiency in the second, United gave a well-rounded performance and defeated the Seattle Sounders, 2-0, before a rowdy audience of 18,489.\n\nThe third consecutive shutout victory lifted United (13-10-9, 48 points) into fourth place, which, if the season were to end now, would come with home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nWith two weeks left, United is a step ahead of the New York Red Bulls (14-13-5, 47 points) and Toronto FC (12-10-10, 46). New York City FC (16-5-10, 58), Atlanta (17-11-3, 54) and Philadelphia (15-9-7, 52) sit atop the table.\n\nUnited will visit the Red Bulls next Sunday before closing against league-worst Cincinnati on Oct. 6 in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about [home field] all day \u2014 it\u2019s where we need to be and where we want to go,\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said. \u201cThe only way to do that is through New York and [Cincinnati]. If we get the right points here, we put ourselves in a good spot.\u201d\n\nLucas Rodr\u00edguez scored early in the match and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brillant added a goal early in the second half as United ended a string of six consecutive defeats and an eight-game winless rut against the Sounders. The previous victory came in 2011 at RFK Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe have to do more, to want more for the club and for yourself,\u201d Brillant said. \u201cRight now, we are good but we have nothing. We have to keep going.\u201d\n\nBrillant and his fellow defenders were organized and compact, blocking shots and limiting Seattle\u2019s clear opportunities. And after conceding ball possession and numerous shots in the previous two matches, United was crisp and dangerous in the attack.\n\n\u201cThat has been difficult for us to put together, that full performance,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThe last couple weeks we\u2019ve put together good halves. \u2026 To sustain that is going to be critical if we are going to become a team that can raise silverware.\u201d\n\nThe Sounders (14-10-8) showed fatigue in their third game in a week. They were also shorthanded: Playmaker Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro (seven goals, 12 assists) was scratched with a back injury, and starting center back Xavier Arreaga served a red-card suspension.\n\nUnited forward Ola Kamara (three goals in four matches) continued recovering from a hamstring ailment and was not in uniform.\n\nOlsen did not make any changes to the lineup: With the playoffs approaching, he has settled on his first-choice personnel and formation. Injuries and suspensions will alter those plans, of course.\n\nWayne Rooney, Paul Arriola, Felipe Martins and Russell Canouse entered at the yellow-card threshold, and by avoiding a caution Sunday, they remain eligible next Sunday.\n\nUnited buzzed with activity from the start, a promising sign from a unit that has prioritized defense.\n\nThe Sounders lacked a hub without Lodeiro, but they did threaten first as Brad Smith cruised in alone on the left side and smashed a bid off the crossbar. Moments later, Rooney did the same from 18 yards.\n\nIn the 14th minute, United went ahead. Ulises Segura\u2019s deflected cross floated to Rodr\u00edguez at the top of the penalty area. The Argentine chested it down and lashed a right-footed shot past diving goalkeeper Stefan Frei and into the lower left corner for his sixth goal of the year.\n\nFrei prevented further damage, making a fine reflex save on Arriola\u2019s rasping drive. United brimmed with confidence in the attack, moving the ball quickly through one-touch passes and stretching Seattle\u2019s defense by switching the point of attack.\n\nIt was as snappy as United had performed in quite some time.\n\nJust before intermission, Rooney rattled the crossbar again, this time on a free kick from several yards beyond the side of the penalty area.\n\nThe second goal came on a set piece nine minutes after the break. Instead of shooting high, Rooney went low, thumping a free kick into the mix. Partially screening Frei, Segura raised his right foot and let the ball race past him. The on-rushing Brillant met it for an easy tap-in and his fourth goal in 113 MLS matches.\n\nRooney sets it up, Brillant puts it away! #DCvSEA pic.twitter.com/i5L1I8hT4R \u2014 Major League Soccer (@MLS) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cI just tried to put the ball into a dangerous position and make it difficult for the keeper,\u201d Rooney said. Segura \"had a great dummy, and then it was either going to go straight in or Fred was going to knock it in.\"\n\nBrillant said he did not expect Rooney to deliver the ball low, but he added, \u201cWe knew we have to put the presence very close to the goal.\u201d\n\nSegura\u2019s effort to end any lingering suspense clanged off the far post in the 83rd minute.\n\nWith United playing keep-away in the dying moments, the crowd chanted \u201cOle!\u201d with each pass.\n\n\u201cIt gives us a little confidence that offensively we are a better team than people give us credit for,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cAnd to continue with not giving up a goal is still the foundation of success for us.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFor D.C.
