They charge their franchisees anything from 15 to 30 per cent, higher than what OTAs charge,\" Mr Pal said.\n\nHe noted Expedia took no fees for listings, meaning consumers could do all their research via OTAs - the survey found 7 out of 10 did so - but still book direct, with no benefit to Expedia.\n\nMr Pal said some of the hotel industry reaction was because the sector felt it was losing control of their customers and was using OTAs as scapegoats for failed business models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The large global chains with dozens of brands are acquiring hotels left and right. But what is important to realise is they don't own any of the assets.\n\n\"All the risk is being taken by the owners, who put up the capital.\n\n\"What chains do offer is distribution to their franchisees. Their primary value is the business they provide direct.\n\n\"So when an owner gets billed twice - by the chain and then the OTA - their business model is being debunked. Owners don't want to be charged twice for the same booking.\"", "description": "Expedia global research boss Abhijit Lal says big hotel chains are trying to blame online travel agents for their failing business model, and that he has research to prove it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8448da96e0b2ffe8696f73e8a2a0484dd1751f10", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
