We are in a position to offer businesses that benefit, in terms of our graduates.\"\n\nThe program is open to students who are coming towards the end of their studies at the university, regardless of whether they have a clear career goal or aim to work towards developing their goals through their involvement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they progress, students can start to clarify their initial career direction through discussions with their mentor about skills: what skills are important in the mentor's history of work, and whether these align with the student's skill set. The aim is to identify the student's interests, and what that identification tells them about the type of work they might like to do.\n\n\"I don't think you can overestimate the value of one-on-one relationships in mentoring to help students answer really big questions about the transition to work,\" Dawkins says. \"We need as many ways as possible to make sure that the education system aligns with the world of work; particularly for those students who come from diverse backgrounds, and who might be the first in their family to go to university.\"\n\nDawkins was speaking in the wake of a recent joint research study undertaken by Fairfax Media, publisher of The Australian Financial Review, in partnership with the Commonwealth Bank that examined ways in which innovation can underpin the nation's economic future.\n\nThe survey of Financial Review readers found in terms of education, 62 per cent want greater integration between the private sector and education providers through programs such as these, 55 per cent want an increased emphasis on practical, vocational and technical training and 47 per cent want more initiatives encouraging women and girls in STEM careers.", "description": "Australian universities need to provide students with more of a balance between theory and practice to better integrate graduates with industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.6645%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1204%2C$x_412%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4ef74d601adc53f21e4413150ae12baa15504717", "published_at": "2018-07-30"}
