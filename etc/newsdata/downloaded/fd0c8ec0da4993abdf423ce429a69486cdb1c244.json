How much alleged superiority, transformed into oppression and exploitation, exists even today!\" he said.\n\n\"The mistakes of the past were not enough to stop the plundering of other persons and the inflicting of wounds on our brothers and sisters and on our sister Earth: we have seen it in the scarred face of the Amazon region,\" he said.\n\nThe synod's final document warned of the risks to the Amazon basin from mining and deforestation, which scientists say increases the threat of global warming.\n\nThe bishops proposed that the Church define what would constitute the \"ecological sin\" of harming the environment and also introduce specific ministries for the care of nature.\n\nThe pope will consider the proposals, including an expanded role for women, in writing his own document, known as an Apostolic Exhortation. He said he hopes to have it ready by the end of the year.\n\nAt the Mass, attended by indigenous people from the Amazon, Francis also appeared to take a swipe at conservatives who have attacked parts of the synod's working document as heretical.\n\nOpponents of Francis, inspired by the writings of two cardinals, held several side events during the synod. They took particular umbrage at the use of an indigenous statue of a pregnant woman at an opening event, saying that was pagan.\n\nThe pope asked forgiveness for what he considered an insult to the indigenous after ultra-conservative Catholic militants stole replicas of the statue and dumped them into the Tiber River.\n\nIn his sermon, Francis spoke of \"those masters of the art of self-justification\" and those seeking \"self-canonisation.\" (Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "Pope Francis on Sunday called for an end to the plundering of the Amazon basin, as he closed an assembly of Roman Catholic bishops who discussed the challenges the Church faces in the region.
