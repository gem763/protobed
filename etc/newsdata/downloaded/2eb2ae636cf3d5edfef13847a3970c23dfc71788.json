Comey also misled both the FBI and Congress about his handling of these documents,\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton released in a statement. \"On top of all of that, in violation of law, he kept and disclosed classified information. It is beyond belief the Justice Department refused to prosecute Comey for his series of crimes, to include a seditious conspiracy targeting President Trump. It is going to be up to, frankly, Judicial Watch to try to obtain full justice and full accountability for this terrible misconduct that goes to the heart of our justice system.\"\n\nFitton further discussed Comey's lack of prosecution on WMAL in Washington D.C.\n\nOver the past two years, Judicial Watch has played a key role in exposing FBI corruption and the attempted coup against President Trump. They've issued a number of lawsuits that have produced documentation showing details about the \"insurance policy\" fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe worked on with FBI Intelligence Agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page. Further they've found a number of FBI employees have been referred for criminal prosecution after improperly leaking confidential FBI documents and information.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:03:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/105/0b4970ac-a0e9-48e7-a8fa-f87ad8b2dee6.jpg"}
