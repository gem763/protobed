So that would crush them,\" said the former employee on condition of anonymity, explaining that changing a product's chips could halt production and give rivals a chance to take market share.\n\nAmbarella did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours.\n\nLast year it said the bulk of its products were made domestically and in Vietnam, and that none of its products for North American markets came from China.\n\nHanwha Techwin's U.S. sales rose 24% to 66 billion won ($55 million) in the April-June quarter from a year ago, according to its parent's earnings statement.\n\n\"Hanwha's performance has been better since U.S. stepped up regulations on Chinese firms,\" said Lee Dong-heon, a Daishin Securities analyst. \"Mainly it supplies to U.S. government and public institutions, but a wider door is open now to sell to private customers as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLAYOFFS\n\nHonovich said other likely beneficiaries of the blacklisting were Motorola Solutions Inc unit Avigilon and Sweden's Axis, owned by Japan's Canon Inc.\n\nNeither Avigilon nor Axis responded to requests for comment.\n\nMotorola Solutions in its second-quarter earnings call with analysts in August said it saw upside from the earlier federal contracting ban.\n\nThe former Hikvision employee said the Chinese firm laid off dozens of staff in the United States because of slumping sales in the country, with several going to Hanwha Techwin.\n\nHikvision did not comment on the layoffs or confirm the use of Ambarella chips. Hanwha also declined to comment on staffing moves.\n\nHikvision, which has a market value of about $42 billion, receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7.02 billion) in revenue from overseas, Reuters reported in August.
