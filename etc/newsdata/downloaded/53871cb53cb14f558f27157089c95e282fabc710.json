That in turn dragged the neighbouring Kiwi dollar to a 4-year low.\n\n\"On we go with the dollar,\" said Societe Generale (PA: ) strategist Kit Juckes. \"It is the pick of the major economies and I don't think anything is going to change (for the dollar) until the economy slows.\"\n\n\"If you are very sensitive to global trade and sensitive to manufacturing you are having a very tough time of it at the moment, there is no doubt about it.\"\n\nThe against a basket of major currencies rose 0.2% to 99.585, its highest level since May 2017.\n\nBond markets were also grumbling after a weak auction of Japanese government debt underscored the lack of enthusiasm for the negative interest rates that more and more countries will be heading towards if economies and inflation stay weak.\n\nThat worry fed across to higher bond yields across major markets, with 10-year German, French and Spanish and U.S Treasury yields all up 2 to 4 basis points.
