REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo\n\nThe move was the latest in a running dispute over the rates cap, which the government and banking officials say is debilitating to the economy because it stalls lending.\n\nIn 2016, the government limited rates banks can charge customers to four percentage points above the central bank\u2019s benchmark - currently 9% - saying they were concerned about high rates.\n\nLast month, lawmakers rejected a June request by the Treasury to remove the cap, saying lenders had not proven they could be trusted to lower rates without pressure.\n\nThe move was the second attempt by the government to repeal the cap after a similar try last year was blocked by lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe capping of interest rates has not addressed the intended objective particularly in expanding credit access,\u201d Kenyatta said in the note to parliament.\n\nKenyan bank shares surged on the Nairobi bourse after the news.\n\nThe cap has cut private sector credit growth as commercial banks cut off millions of low-income customers deemed too risky to lend to, government officials and bank executives say.\n\nIt has also had a knock-on effect on the real economy as credit-starved businesses lay off workers and real estate developers find it hard to sell homes to a credit-short market.\n\n\u201cInvestors will react positively to this news, in light of the harmful effects of the loan rate cap on Kenya\u2019s growth prospects, and the unnecessary complication that it creates for policy,\u201d said Razia Khan, head of research for Africa at Standard Chartered in London.\n\nThe central bank, which found in a study last year that the cap had probably cut 0.4% from 2017\u2019s economic growth, has complained that the cap has also made it hard it to transmit its monetary policy signals.\n\nIt takes an average of 3-5 months longer for policy decisions to be transmitted under the capping regime compared with a free interest rate regime, Kenyatta said, citing research by the central bank.\n\nLoansharks and other unregulated lenders have seized advantage of the gap created by the cap, charging desperate borrowers exorbitant rates, he said.\n\nLawmakers have the option of removing the cap from the bill or overruling the president if two thirds of the 349 members vote to override his position, said Aden Duale, parliament\u2019s majority leader.\n\n\u201cThe house will deal with the matter in the next two weeks and will make a decision,\u201d Duale told Reuters.\n\nLegislators who spoke to Reuters said it was too early to tell how the house will vote but some agreed with the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of repealing the cap. This cap is a just a decoration, just a feel-good thing because we cannot get credit from banks. I\u2019m also a businessman,\u201d said Moses Kuria, a lawmaker from Kenyatta\u2019s ruling Jubilee party.", "description": "Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has demanded that lawmakers remove a cap on commercial lending rates, refusing to approve the 2019/20 (July-June) budget unless the limit is lifted, a document sent to parliament from the presidency showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["George Obulutsa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441864235&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G14A", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
