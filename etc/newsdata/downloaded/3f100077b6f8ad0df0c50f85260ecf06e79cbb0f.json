On Thursday, Shelina Begum and Mohammed Raqeeb won a historic legal victory which now allows them to take their little girl to Italy for treatment. Until that moment, it looked as though Tafida\u2019s short life was going to end in this soulless room in the children\u2019s intensive care unit at Royal London Hospital.\n\nInstead, Judge Mr Justice MacDonald stunned the medical establishment by blocking the hospital\u2019s bid to switch off Tafida\u2019s life-support machine.\n\nHe ruled that it was right that difficult decisions should \u2018be taken by a parent in the exercise of their parental responsibility\u2019. As Tafida was not suffering, it was vital for him to consider \u2018the sanctity of life\u2019.\n\nDoctors initially concluded that Tafida could no longer move, see or feel. They said she had no prospect of getting better and asked the High Court for permission to withdraw her life supporting treatment\n\nThe couple\u2019s lawyers \u2014 who spent five days arguing in court last month \u2014 say the ruling establishes that parents know best what care is right for their child.\n\nIt is in the starkest contrast to the tragic cases of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans, where judges sided with the NHS. Yesterday, the hospital announced it would not pursue an appeal.\n\n\u2018I am still in shock,\u2019 says Shelina, 39, a dignified woman who finds it hard to believe she has been catapulted into the limelight.\n\nTalking for the first time since the judgment, exclusively to the Mail, she says: \u2018When the judge gave his verdict, I burst into tears. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve allowed myself to cry in public. I was overwhelmed. All the stress and tension just poured out.\n\n\u2018We have waited over three weeks for the verdict and it has been horrific \u2014 even harder than when this all started. Privately, I\u2019ve wept every night. On Wednesday I was so petrified that I paced all night.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t banish the fear that Tafida was going to get a death sentence. I kissed her goodbye and all I could say was, \u201cPray for life, baby.\u201d \u2019\n\n\u2018I knew the judge had listened very carefully to all our arguments and I have great faith in the justice system \u2014 I\u2019m a lawyer. But I was in such a state it took seconds for the verdict to sink in.\n\n\u2018We aren\u2019t deluded. We know that \u2014 even with treatment \u2014 Tafida is very unlikely to ever be the same. But this gives her the best chance.\n\nHer mother Shelina Begum (pictured) and father Mohammed Raqeeb won a historic legal victory which now allows them to take their little girl to Italy for treatment\n\n\u2018She was such an energetic, happy girl with a big smile and a huge heart. I don\u2019t know whether she will ever tear around on her bike again with her dad or whirl around the kitchen showing off her ballet steps.\n\n\u2018But I hope and pray that one day she will run into my arms. Just to hear her call me \u201cMummy\u201d again would be magical.\n\nWhatever happens \u2014 whatever adaptations we have to make \u2014 we will bring her home and love her. Her life is precious and our love for her is unconditional. It isn\u2019t based on what she can or can\u2019t do.\u2019 It\u2019s impossible to know whether Tafida has a sense of the significance of what has just happened.\n\nOn life support, she cannot speak or do more than move her arms and legs a little. But, pointing at the balloons swaying gently in the slight breeze, Shelina says, \u2018You\u2019ve done it, Tafi. You brave girl. You\u2019ve been Mummy and Daddy\u2019s strength. You\u2019ve done it,\u2019 before covering the little girl\u2019s forehead in kisses.\n\nTafida, an outwardly perfectly healthy, happy little girl who had just started school, was left brain damaged in February when a blood vessel burst in her brain.\n\nIt happened because she was born with the rare and undiagnosed condition AVM (arteriovenous malformation), which causes a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between the arteries and veins.\n\nThe shock for the family is unimaginable. For eight months they were forced to fight through the courts to give her a chance of life.\n\nTafida is pictured in hospital with her mother Shelina Begum and surrounded by uplifting balloons. The parents are overjoyed as they have just won their legal battle\n\nWhile they are proud that their victory may give hope to the parents of other desperately ill children, uppermost in the family\u2019s mind is that it clears the way for them to take Tafida to the specialist Gaslini children\u2019s hospital in Genoa, Italy.\n\nDoctors there, who have studied her case and seen 11,000 images, are confident they can offer treatment and are poised to send an air ambulance to collect her next week.\n\nHer father Mohammed, a 45-year-old construction consultant, was so ecstatic when the judgment came that he insisted the only way to celebrate was to buy the biggest balloons he could find and rush back to the hospital with them.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Tafida\u2019s victory,\u2019 he says. \u2018There have been so many times when the doctors said she was going to die \u2014 but she has always fought back. That\u2019s why we have kept fighting.\u2019\n\nTafida\u2019s 14-year-old brother (who the family are choosing not to name) heard the news from friends.\n\n\u2018We tried to ring the school. But we couldn\u2019t get an answer,\u2019 says Shelina. \u2018By the time we spoke to him, he knew. He was over the moon. . . He\u2019s so excited \u2014 we all are.\u2019\n\nGaslini, on the northern Italian coast, is one of the top children\u2019s hospitals in Europe. In its neurology department Tafida will get an advanced rehabilitation programme, including hydrotherapy and state-of-the-art robot technology, to help her to walk again.\n\nShelina says: \u2018Tafida will paddle in the sea and even swim if she\u2019s strong enough . . . She will get to feel the breeze on her face. It will be the first time she will have been in the fresh air since February.\u2019\n\nThe family are well aware that going to Italy for six months will take a massive financial and emotional toll. Neither parent has been able to work for months. Through crowdfunding they are seeking to raise \u00a3400,000 for the costs of treatment, travel to Italy and legal costs. So far, they have raised over \u00a335,000.\n\nWhile they are in Italy, their son will stay behind with family members. Shelina and Mohammed are at the centre of a huge and loving family who all live in Upton Park, East London.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not ideal but he understands it\u2019s necessary. He adores his little sister so much he even wanted to make his own appeal to the judge,\u2019 says Shelina. \u2018We will miss him desperately. But he will fly out to see us at weekends.\u2019\n\nMohammed is acutely aware of the sacrifices to come. \u2018I worry about the toll it is taking on Shelina and my son,\u2019 he says. \u2018She has been amazing \u2014 even stronger than I realised. And he has been a star. I am so very proud of him.\u2019\n\nIn reaching his decision, Mr Justice MacDonald made it clear that he was moved by the obvious devotion of Tafida\u2019s family.\n\nBut the couple are the first to admit that until February 8 there was absolutely nothing to mark them out as anything other than completely ordinary.\n\n\u2018Tafida was sleeping in our bedroom and just after five in the morning she woke me and said, \u201cMummy, my head\u2019s hurting,\u201d \u2019 recalls Shelina. \u2018Her eyes were fixed on the ceiling. She wasn\u2019t moving but tears were rolling down her cheeks and she was struggling for breath.\n\n\u2018Mohammed had gone out for an early-morning jog. When I called out in panic, my son came. I asked him to call the paramedics. I was so distraught that he had to talk to them. He got Tafida on the floor and started doing CPR \u2014pushing on her chest to keep her alive. He had learnt the technique in school. He saved her life. She took a breath, her pulse came back just as the paramedics rushed in.\u2019\n\nHer parents have spent eight months camping out beside her and have described the 'agony' of every-day as their daughter has only a one per cent chance of living\n\nMohammed arrived home to find his daughter being put into an ambulance. \u2018I still can\u2019t really believe it,\u2019 he says, his eyes welling up. \u2018I think I will wake up and find it\u2019s a nightmare.\u2019 Tafida went through a seven-hour operation at London\u2019s King\u2019s Hospital and was in a coma. Outside the operating theatre, the consultant was frank.\n\n\u2018He told us: \u201cShe only has a one per cent chance. Most likely, she is going to die on the table\u201d \u2019 recalls Shelina. \u2018We were in agony.\u2019\n\nBut while Tafida survived, her condition has been unpredictable.\n\nThe morning after the operation her heart stopped. She went into a coma and the family were told if she had not died by noon, she would die within 24 hours. But to the family\u2019s intense joy a brain stem test showed that, although Tafida had sustained a brain injury, she was not brain dead. \u2018That was the best moment,\u2019 recalls Shelina.\n\nAfter two weeks, Tafida opened her eyes for the first time. The family started researching the condition. A birth defect, AVM is caused where blood vessels do not form correctly and can rupture.\n\nIn the brain, the effects are similar to a huge stroke. Around ten babies a year in England are affected, although the condition may not be picked up until later in life. The family learned that AVM patients like Tafida go into a deep coma but can slowly emerge as the brain builds new connections.\n\nIn April, Tafida was transferred to Royal London Hospital. In June the medical staff concluded that any more treatment was pointless. \u2018They sat us down and said, \u201cLook, we are taking the decision away from you. Any more treatment is futile,\u201d \u2019 recalls Shelina. \u2019They would take her breathing tube out and that would be it.\u2019\n\nThe couple have spent eight months camping out beside Tafida. Their \u2018home\u2019 is a single bedroom with shared facilities in a house provided by a charity. Shelina has not set been home since February.\n\n\u2018Most days I am with Tafida from 8am until midnight when Mohammed takes over,\u2019 she says. \u2018If I can\u2019t be there \u2014 because of seeing lawyers \u2014 family step in. We don\u2019t want her ever to wake up and feel frightened or wonder, \u201cWhere\u2019s Mummy and Daddy?\u201d\n\n\u2018Walking into the hospital I always take a deep breath. Although the staff are kind, it still feels wrong. I\u2019ve made her bed a little oasis of calm. She has her toys, including a teddy I brought back from Italy and the pink cushion she used to cuddle up on, saying princess.\n\n\u2018If she\u2019s asleep, I call her name and she wakes to my voice. Her pupils open wide and she looks at me. I brush her teeth and plait her hair. It\u2019s waist-length now.\n\n\u2018Then I chat, pray and read to her. I have a Disney book about princesses. And we watch Frozen, her favourite Disney film, at least twice a day.\n\n\u2018Staff haven\u2019t mentioned the case. I\u2019m not angry with the hospital. I am just upset they have put us under such needless pressure and wasted so much of our money and theirs.\u2019\n\nMost of us will never know how it feels to be in Shelina\u2019s position. But few of us would argue that she deserves to feel vindicated.\n\n\u2018I remember reading about those other cases \u2014 Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans \u2014 and thinking that parents should be allowed to have the final say,\u2019 Shelina says. \u2018But never in my wildest dreams did I think it would happen to us.\n\n\u2018This has been a victory for all parents. It shows that parents\u2019 rights won\u2019t be taken away. And it recognises the value of disabled children. Tafida might be profoundly disabled but her life is still of value.\u2019\n\nFor more information or to donate to the fund, go to www.gofundme.com/f/save-tafida", "description": "Shelina Begum and Mohammed Raqeeb have won their legal battle to send daughter Tafida to Italy for treatment after she suffered permanent brain damage and was told she had no chance of living.", "authors": ["Tessa Cunningham For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/00/19319942-0-image-a-2_1570233589413.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
