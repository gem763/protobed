Instead, she credits her new glow to a movement that has lurked in corners of the internet for several years.\n\nKristel is a follower of NoFap, a platform that encourages its users to refrain from masturbation. She claims her new lifestyle has led to a complete physical and mental reformation.\n\n\u201cAfter starting NoFap I felt more motivation, more willpower and more discipline,\u201d Kristel tells me. \u201cI decided to take part in the movement because I like challenging myself and I wanted to prove that I could accomplish this.\u201d\n\nThe flippantly named NoFap community has gained a strange prominence since it was founded in 2011 by Pittsburgh web developer Alexander Rhodes. Inspired by a small study that suggested that male testosterone levels rose after seven days of abstinence from ejaculation, followers avoid masturbation in order to \u201creboot\u201d their brains.\n\nHaving first gained momentum among men in Reddit forums and backwaters of the internet, the community regards NoFap as a sexual health program to combat porn addiction. But there is also a consensus among many NoFappers (who often brand themselves \u201cFapstronauts\u201d) that refraining from masturbation can lead to \u201csuperpowers\u201d, ranging from increased energy and confidence to commanding respect from peers or curing social anxiety. NoFap\u2019s Reddit forum now has more than 450,000 members primarily in North America and the UK, and Kristel is part of a smaller subset of female subscribers.\n\nRhodes estimates that about 5% of the NoFap followers are female and although the cohort may be small, it is seemingly mighty. Kristel\u2019s transformation video alone has racked up almost 1.5m views to date. She says the vast majority of her viewers are based in the US, with a smaller but significant following in India.\n\nIn an attempt to engage its rising female cohort, NoFap has recently introduced new measures including hiring female moderators and creating women in reboot forums.\n\nKristel explains: \u201cEven though most of the responses I get are encouraging and positive, there is also a side of people not taking it seriously. They think girls don\u2019t even masturbate to begin with.\u201d\n\nKristel has become something of a poster-girl for the Femstronaut movement, but there is a darker side to NoFap. Among the reams of Reddit discussions and YouTube videos, a fundamentally misogynistic rhetoric regularly emerges. The movement\u2019s focus on testosterone inherently idealizes masculine traits, and the oft-cited claim that NoFap makes men more attractive to the opposite sex objectifies women and frames them as the \u201cprize\u201d in the game of who can hold out for longest. Some have even linked the movement to incel (involuntarily celibate) communities, who extend contempt towards masturbation and pornography to a more insidious hatred of women.\n\nSo what drives women to participate in this male-dominated trend? Like Kristel, Chicago-based YouTuber Alana, 29, joined the NoFap movement as a lifestyle improvement in 2017.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest issue is porn,\u201d she says. \u201cPorn is where people go to learn how to have sex, and most of the time the approach to sex in porn is built around the man\u2019s pleasure. Even as a heterosexual woman, porn made me sexualize and objectify women \u2026 I also began to think of myself as a sex object, and that my value came from my sex appeal.\u201d\n\nKristel also cites the influence of pornography as a key driver of the trend. She says the unrelenting theme of male dominance, unrealistic body standards and the overly performative scenes made watching adult content a discomfiting experience for her. She claims that without pornography to masturbate to or compare her own experiences with, she is able to enjoy sex in a way that she wasn\u2019t able to before.\n\nSex addiction therapist Staci Sprout says the phenomenon really is \u201ca new grassroots movement where people are seeking to reclaim their bodies separately from pornography\u2019s input. If a woman has only learned how to self-pleasure through high-stimulation pornography and later just re-enacts this with others, she probably won\u2019t know herself very well sexually.\u201d\n\nIt seems no coincidence that both Alana and Kristel, seemingly some of the most prominent and outspoken women in the NoFap movement, are part of a generation that has grown up with extreme sexual content only ever a few clicks away. Despite the almost non-existent science behind its claims, the NoFap movement seems to represent a solution to very real concerns. Yet it is not clear whether NoFap offers any relief. Although the thousands of women who post on NoFap might be benefiting from access to a community of like-minded people, it fails to provide the expert support that may realistically be needed for women struggling with sex or porn addiction.\n\nThe women drawn to NoFap seem trapped in a conundrum of the digital age. They see themselves as victims of a world where access to online pornography is unlimited, but also end up seeking solutions within a similarly opaque and murky world. Although they may feel isolated from the male-centric world of pornography, their association with an ideology that idolizes the strange pseudo-science of semen retention and stereotypically masculine powers could only further isolate them from the nuances of female sexuality.\n\nAnd yet, Kristel has no plans to stop. \u201cAfter years of abstaining, there is no restriction involved, it feels natural to me now,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any urge to go back.\u201d", "description": "A Reddit forum dedicated to abstaining from masturbation has over 450,000 members \u2013 and about 5% of them are female", "authors": ["Katie Bishop"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c581a5cc29f1ae3a9fe1844c4fb682ffa9d81e2/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=155ec8cf8a34a0b82af50b3a922abb91", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
