So Ms Welch went down in person to find out more.\n\n\"First of all, we don't do gay weddings or mixed race,\" says a woman in a gray shirt, identified as the venue's owner by US media.\n\nAsked why not, she replied: \"Because of our Christian race, I mean our Christian beliefs,\" adding: \"We just don't participate. We just choose not to.\"\n\nWhen asked what passage of the Bible informs that belief, the owner adds: \"I don't want to argue my faith.\"\n\nThe exchange prompted the City of Booneville to release a statement condemning \"these types of discriminatory policies\".\n\nThe Facebook page for Boone's Camp Event Hall was taken offline following the video's release, but later re-opened on Sunday to post a lengthy apology before being closed again.\n\nIn the post the owner said she had been taught as a child that people were meant to stay \"with your own race\" but that after consulting with her pastor she now realised nothing in the bible prohibited interracial marriages.\n\nShe continued: \"To all of those offended, hurt or felt condemn [sic] by my statement I truly apologise to you for my ignorance in not knowing the truth about this. My intent was never of racism, but to stand firm on what I 'assumed' was right concerning marriage.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to BBC News, the Boone's Camp Event Hall said \"they are grateful that the bride forgave them\" and that the couple has been re-invited to use the event space.\n\nInterracial marriage has been legal across the US since 1967 when the Supreme Court reached that decision in Loving v Virginia.\n\nIn 2016, Mississippi passed a first of its kind law that protects \"sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions\", meaning businesses can legally refuse service to same-sex partners and transgender people.\n\nThe law, which was meant to preserve religious freedom, does not mention race.", "description": "In a viral exchange, a Mississippi wedding hall owner cited \"Christian beliefs\" for the rejection.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1031A/production/_108603366_caa252342fpture.jpg"}
