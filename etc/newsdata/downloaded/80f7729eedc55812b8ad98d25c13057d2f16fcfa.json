Biden, including provisions that allowed prosecutors to charge minors as adults for certain crimes and that expanded the list of crimes eligible for the death penalty.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke would also end mandatory minimum sentencing, end the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine, reinstate a system of federal parole, and abolish the death penalty at the federal level.\n\nHe would legalize marijuana and expunge the records of those convicted of possession.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke also wants to ban private, for-profit prisons, end the cash bail system, and reform the civil asset forfeiture process \u2014 priorities that other 2020 contenders have mentioned or included in their own criminal justice proposals.\n\nHe would also boost resources for public defenders and wipe out outstanding loan debt of public defenders who have served five or more years.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan also calls for ending solitary confinement and tripling federal investment in grant funding for re-entry programs.\n\nHe would also guarantee \u201cfull enfranchisement\u201d to 4.5 million formerly incarcerated individuals.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke would also decriminalize truancy, institute a federal ban on corporal punishment in schools, and dedicate $500 billion toward a fund designed to eliminate funding disparities in schools based on race and income.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
