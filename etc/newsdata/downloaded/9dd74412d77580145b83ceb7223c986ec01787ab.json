These are the only items \u00adbelonging to her nine-year-old \u00addaughter Sue Eismann has kept.\n\nAfter Nicola Fellows was strangled alongside her best friend Karen Hadaway in what became known as The Babes in the Woods murders, her mum Sue bravely decided to donate everything else to charity.\n\nBut she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to part with the unworn outfit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she shrugs, struggling to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely. In a way it feels like a piece of her future that I have held on to.\u201d\n\nNicola and Karen were killed in Brighton\u2019s Wild Park 33 years ago today. Paedophile Russell Bishop was sensationally acquitted of their killings the following year when DNA evidence failed to stand up in court.\n\n(Image: Connors)\n\n(Image: Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nThat miscarriage of justice hung over the girls\u2019 families until finally, last December, Bishop was tried again under new double jeopardy laws \u2013 where a person can now be tried for the same crime twice.\n\nThis time he was found guilty thanks to advances in DNA testing.\n\nGiving her first newspaper interview since her \u201cangel\u2019s\u201d killer was brought to justice, Sue feels she has a future at last \u2013 and, in a sense, Nicola does too.\n\nSo for the first year, for that reason, she won\u2019t be returning to the place where Nicola was murdered on the anniversary of her death.\n\n\u201cI always felt she was stuck at the place where they died, I felt her there, that\u2019s why I went back every October,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think she\u2019s there now, I won\u2019t go back again.\n\n(Image: SUSSEX POLICE/HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s in her angel bed, not lingering anymore. When they read out \u2018guilty\u2019 I think she went up.\u201d\n\nAlthough it brought immense relief for Sue, enduring Bishop\u2019s second trial also brought fresh horror.\n\nBecause she couldn\u2019t \u201cbear to hear the truth\u201d she didn\u2019t attend much of the first trial, so this time she heard exactly what he had done to Nicola, including sexually assaulting her before, and after, he murdered her.\n\nSue can only shake her head and grapple for words. \u201cI felt sick. How?\u201d she \u00adwhispers. \u201cI took her big photo off the wall and cuddled it. To think she went through all that. I said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019.\u201d\n\nSue, 70, speaks so quietly you have to lean close to catch her words. Three decades of strain fighting for answers, layered on top of the most acute grief, and the horror of watching her daughter\u2019s killer walk free, have eroded her. More grief came weeks before the 2018 trial when her son \u00adJonathan, 47, died of liver failure.\n\nJust five years older than Nicola, he had developed PTSD after her death, and turned to alcohol. He\u2019d so desperately wanted to see justice. \u201cHe\u2019d had a row with Nicola over a roller boot before she died,\u201d Sue says. \u201cIt stuck in his mind. He couldn\u2019t talk about it. It ruined his life. I feel sometimes Bishop also took his life.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nSue, a former cleaner who lives in Hove, not far from her old home in \u00adMoulsecoomb, Brighton, remembers the day she lost Nicola clearly. The little girl, who \u201cknew her mind\u201d had been to school as normal on October 9.\n\n\u201cShe came in, chucked her shoes off, pulled her other ones on, and said she was going out to play. Now, I wish I had said more,\u201d she sighs.\n\nAround 5pm Karen\u2019s mum Michelle called to see if her daughter was there. Worried, both mums went searching. \u201cThe mist had come down, it got dark. We went to the park but I said she wouldn\u2019t be there \u2013 Nicola was scared of the dark.\u201d\n\nHer husband Barrie joined the search. By 8pm they called the police.\n\nThe next day officers found the girls in a den. Their bodies were huddled together, Karen\u2019s head resting on \u00adNicola\u2019s arm. They had been strangled.\n\nWhen Sue learnt the truth she passed out. Bravely, days later, she visited Nicola\u2019s body in the mortuary.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t look like her,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was bruising over her face.\u201d\n\nBishop was known to the family, but Sue never suspected anything \u201cwrong\u201d about him. However, he was on the police\u2019s suspect list because they were clear this wasn\u2019t a \u201cstranger abduction\u201d \u2013 there were no defence marks on their bodies, they\u2019d gone with someone they knew. By the end of the month, he\u2019d been arrested, thanks to his blue Pinto sweatshirt, which contained forensic evidence linking it to him and the girls. That evidence did not hold up in court.\n\n(Image: SUSSEX POLICE/HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nSue couldn\u2019t bear to be there for the verdict and it was perhaps just as well \u2013 the \u201cnot guilty\u201d was unanimous.\n\nThe following years were harrowing. Sickening rumours spread Barrie was responsible for the murder, and they were to dog him, fanned by Bishop and his former girlfriend, for two decades.\n\nThe marriage disintegrated, although the family, particularly Barrie\u2019s half-brothers Nigel and Ian Heffron, the latter a former copper, didn\u2019t give up.\n\nThey were determined to nail Bishop, especially when, in 1990, he was convicted of attempting to murder a seven-year-old girl. He was sentenced to life. As the years passed and Sussex Police were able to use new DNA \u00adtechniques, a case against Bishop built again. But it took double jeopardy to be repealed in 2003 for doors to open.\n\nFinally, in 2015, new one-billion-to-one DNA was found linking Bishop\u2019s sweatshirt to matter taken from Karen\u2019s left arm. He was arrested in custody. Before an appeal deciding whether to quash Bishop\u2019s previous ac- quittal, Sue ended up in hospital with a \u201cmassive panic attack\u201d.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\u201cIt was the build-up of stress. I thought that was going to be it,\u201d she says. Sue has been on anti-depressants since Nicola\u2019s murder, and admits she has considered jumping off Brighton\u2019s pier \u201cto be with her\u201d. Somehow she found the inner strength, and decided she must be in court. Unlike Bishop, who refused to attend the unanimously \u201cguilty\u201d verdict.\n\nSue feels \u201crobbed\u201d she didn\u2019t get to see his expression. \u201cBut to know he did it has finally brought me some peace,\u201d she says. That peace has allowed her to move on \u201cwith a new phase of life\u201d.\n\nSupporting her is partner Brendan Gleason, 68, a childhood sweetheart who heard of the trial and offered his support. When I ask if she feels hatred towards Bishop, she says that energy has been long spent.\n\nIf there was one missing piece of this tortuous three-decade puzzle left, it would be for him to admit he\u2019d done it \u2013 and offer some explanation.\n\nShe adds: \u201cI\u2019ll say to him now: Why?\u201d\n\nThe Babes in the Woods Murders by Paul Cheston, published by John Blake in paperback, \u00a38.99\n\nemily.ret", "description": "After Nicola Fellows was strangled alongside her best friend Karen Hadaway by Russell Bishop in 1986, her mum Sue has visited the scene every year since - but now explains why this year will be different", "authors": ["Emily Retter", "Image", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror", "Connors", "Alamy Stock Photo", "Sussex Police Handout Epa-Efe Rex Shutterstock", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539357.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PCP_MDM_SUSIE_EISMANN_BABES_IN_WOODS_MOTHER_9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
