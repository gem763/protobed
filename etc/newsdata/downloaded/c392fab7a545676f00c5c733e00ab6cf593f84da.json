(AP) - With nary a conference championship since 1999, and now on its fifth coach since Tom Osborne\u2019s teams ruled the mid-1990s, Nebraska has been an afterthought in college football most of the last two decades.\n\nThis week, the Cornhuskers (3-1, 1-0 Big Ten) are front and center again. Their game against No. 5 Ohio State (4-0, 1-0) on Saturday night was always going to be a big one. Add a visit from ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d show in the morning, and it\u2019s become huge.\n\n\u201cThis is a good opportunity to highlight our program, the direction the program is going, the improvement we have made, the path that we are on,\u201d second-year coach Scott Frost said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great to get national attention here in Lincoln.\u201d\n\nYes, if Rece Davis, Desmond Howard, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso show up on campus, chances are your team is playing in the top game of the week.\n\nThe party starts early.\n\nCrowds congregate behind and around the set from 9 a.m. to noon EDT holding signs with messages supporting their team, taking a shot at the opponent or maybe asking people at home to send money for beer. The folks cheer or boo depending on what they hear - or which mascot head Corso puts on when he predicts the winner of the host school\u2019s game. A favorite segment features a \u201cguest picker,\u201d typically a celebrity with ties to the school or area who joins the panel in predicting winners of the day\u2019s key games.\n\nThe atmosphere, to say the least, is raucous. And, for that week\u2019s host, it\u2019s akin to a three-hour advertisement aimed at prospective recruits.\n\nSaturday marks the 317th time GameDay has originated from a campus. It\u2019s the seventh visit to Nebraska, but the first since 2007.\n\n\u201cThis is Nebraska. This is big-time college football,\u201d quarterback Adrian Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019m excited that College GameDay\u2019s back here this Saturday, and that\u2019s the way it should be again.\u201d\n\nOhio State has hosted the show 18 times, most of any school. Alabama is next, at 13, followed by Michigan, Florida and LSU, at 12 each.\n\nOhio State this week will tie Alabama with 45 appearances in the featured game.\n\nThe GameDay crew, including people in front of and behind the cameras, decides mostly by committee where they will go each week, coordinating producer Drew Gallagher said.\n\nLincoln was selected around midnight last Saturday, shortly after the Cornhuskers came from behind to win at Illinois. Had Nebraska lost, GameDay might have gone elsewhere, though the fact Ohio State is coming to town weighed in Lincoln\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cWith Ohio State right now, there\u2019s a little bit of curiosity, especially with Justin Fields,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t really been tested in a road environment like this. This has also been the kind of game over the several years that Ohio State has struggled in. Factor it all in - the scene, Lincoln on a Saturday night - and it was a pretty easy decision.\u201d\n\nESPN during the offseason maps out possible GameDay sites for the first month of the season. Schools receive letters outlining how much space would be needed, along with other requirements. Gallagher said he\u2019s never heard of a school not wanting GameDay to come.\n\nFan bases often lobby for a visit through social media campaigns, and schools themselves sometimes ask. Nebraska was notified last week it was a candidate. Gallagher said a person from the athletic department, whom he declined to name, then initiated contact to sell the network on why Nebraska would be the best choice.\n\nGameDay\u2019s visit comes the morning after new basketball coach Fred Hoiberg holds a public scrimmage followed by a performance by rapper Rick Ross. Some of the football and basketball programs\u2019 top recruiting prospects will be visiting.\n\nESPN no longer estimates on-site GameDay attendance. A number is hard to lock down because it\u2019s not a ticketed event and people come and go. The highest reported attendance was 18,000 at Missouri in 2010, hours before the Tigers upset third-ranked Oklahoma.\n\nAverage viewership across ESPN\u2019s platforms is just under 2 million through four shows this year.\n\nAccording to Omaha-based Universal Information Services, which measures the impact of media mentions, the GameDay appearance at Georgia last week generated an estimated $1.3 million in publicity value through local and national broadcast mentions (the figure didn\u2019t account for the three-hour show itself). Publicity value is the estimated cost of promotion, based on advertising rates across TV and radio platforms, that would produce an equal amount of exposure.\n\nThe buzz here has been high. Two days after the Lincoln visit was announced, the publicity value already had matched the $1.3 million produced in a full week for the Georgia stop.\n\n\u201cA lot of this stuff is for the fans. People eat it up,\u201d Frost said.\n\nThat\u2019s true, and something not to be minimized. The fan base that started selling out games in 1962, and continues to do so despite the program\u2019s recent struggles, has become one of the Huskers\u2019 biggest talking points in the absence of significant wins or championships. A scene where thousands of people in red gather around the GameDay set sends a message to prospects.\n\nGameDay\u2019s visit also shows Frost\u2019s work has not gone unnoticed.\n\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t improving and getting better and going in a really good direction that was obvious to a lot of people,\u201d he said, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have those guys on ESPN coming to town.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With nary a conference championship since 1999, and now on its fifth coach since Tom Osborne's teams ruled the mid-1990s, Nebraska has been an afterthought in college football most of the last two decades.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/big_ten_gameday_glory_50611_c0-251-6000-3749_s1770x1032.jpg?21cd7831eab7ad0be624c464dc808fe93f3b603e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
