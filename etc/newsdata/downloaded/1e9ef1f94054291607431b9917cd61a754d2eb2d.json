The stated aim, indeed a noble one, is to help researchers, start-ups, and maybe even the government itself to provide better services to the citizens and consumers. Such data sharing can be immensely useful for both start-ups, researchers and others for entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific discovery, where the \u201ccommunity data\u201d helps build new technologies and services to solve consumer/citizens\u2019 problems.\n\nThe government has made a small start by sharing its own data with anyone who wishes to use it. Under the aegis of the National Informatics Council, it has set up a major infrastructure in the form of a network of data officers to standardise, templatize and anonymise data collected by various government agencies and to share them with individuals and groups willing to build solutions using them. The scheme, a laudable one, is still in the early stages and the main challenge at present is getting the data from various government departments and the states.\n\nIn sharing government-collected data, India seems to be following a global trend. Open Data framework in South Africa has strengthened the SDGs and has unlocked the economic value of data; in Barcelona, community data is proposed to be used for controlling noise levels and pollution; in Amsterdam, to empower and draw citizens into policy formation and decision making process, e.g. to develop the city\u2019s alternative home renting platform and others. Similarly, open data sharing platforms like DECODE in Europe are set to support smart-contracts. The United States, under its open data policy, publishes data that is not private or restricted for national security reasons, in order to increase public access to high value, machine-readable datasets such as weather and GPS data, which powered private industry worth tens of billion dollars. Norway adopted the \u2018digital government\u2019 with the help of an open data framework.\n\nWhile there is an emerging framework of sharing government data across the world, sharing of commercial data seems to be a concept unique to India. There is a very vague concept of \u201cData Philanthropy\u201d floated by Sonatel and Orange in parts of the middle east and north Africa. Under the scheme, they shared their anonymized, aggregated data of mobile phone Call Detail Records for developmental policies in agriculture, health, transportation, and urbanization. Needless to say, there was much resistance to this scheme from other companies and, more importantly, users.\n\nIn countries such as India, where the rule of law prevails, sharing of commercial data even if anonymised would face resistance from commercial and civil rights laws of the country. Given that most of the data beneficiaries/ buyers are likely to be competitors rather than benign start-ups, researchers or developmental agencies, it is bound to face resistance. There are other problems too with data sharing. Data triangulation may be harmful to certain set of members of society. Even when data is anonymised, data of a particular \u201ccommunity\u201d, say, religious or ethnic group may be misused for social exclusions. There may also be other complicated issues of bad or biased algorithms being written on big data leading to undesirable outcomes.\n\nEven when the ideological, conceptual and legal issues are solved, there would still be two issues left to be solved: a) which are the sectors from which data needs to be collected?, b) how would be entire mechanism of collection and sharing be governed. The first issue is perhaps easy to solve. The popular view that only consumer internet companies have data is incorrect. Most of the large consumer companies in telecommunications, retail FMCG, consumer durables, automobiles, etc. have data. All of them above a certain size and turnover must come on board.\n\nOn the second issue of governance, there is hardly any global benchmark. Two ideas have been suggested. The first is the instrument of \u201cOpen Algorithm\u201d to eliminate the threat of competition. Instead of giving access to datasets, researchers and start-ups provide the data analysis code which is validated and run inside the firewalled private data centre under the full control of the data sponsors. The second model is simply incubating start-ups or research organisations in house and proprietarily sharing data under legal restrictions against disclosure. Both these models are imminently workable if the policy framework is able to eliminate a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d approach. The other acceptable approach is to create a public infrastructure such as the NPCI or the NIXI [without their current shortcomings] and let it be managed by a public-private partnership. We can ambitiously call it the National Data Trust! The Trust needs to comprise representatives of government and corporates who would share data, and should have authority to create standards of sharing data; rules of engaging with data collectors; and rules of including data beneficiaries.\n\nAt present, ideologically it is tempting to support the alluring concept of sharing commercial data for greater good.
