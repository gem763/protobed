REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators are working to complete a text for the agreements for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile Nov. 16-17.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not signed in Chile, that doesn\u2019t mean that it falls apart. It just means that it\u2019s not ready,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cOur goal is to sign it in Chile. But sometimes texts aren\u2019t ready. But good progress is being made and we expect to sign the agreement in Chile.\u201d\n\nTrump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top U.S. officials have all said good progress is being made on the deal after a nearly 16-month trade war, while also noting that it would be fine if the deal was not finalized by the APEC summit.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said both sides were still working to complete work on the interim deal.\n\n\u201cAs the president said several weeks ago, we have reached a phase-one agreement with the Chinese and both sides are working to finalize the text for a signing in Chile,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. stocks turned negative after Reuters reported the administration official\u2019s comments, as investors bet the closely watched trade talks were further away from resolution.\n\nThe interim trade agreement announced by Trump on Oct. 11 had buoyed markets, promising relief for companies rocked by nearly 16 months of tit-for-tat tariffs that have slowed global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, citing a person briefed on the arrangements, reported early Tuesday that the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies were tentatively slated to sign the interim trade deal on Nov. 17 \u201cif everything goes smoothly.\u201d\n\nA U.S.-based source confirmed that was the target date for a meeting, but the administration official cautioned that the text might not be completed in time.\n\nWhite House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, told a panel at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mnuchin \u201chave made a fabulous deal\u201d with Beijing.\n\n\u201cI think people understand the president, that he\u2019s firm. They know that he\u2019s going to make the decisions that he thinks are right, and I think ultimately that we\u2019ve come to an understanding with China now on where we want to head,\u201d he said.\n\nLighthizer said on Friday that Washington and Beijing are \u201cclose to finalizing\u201d some sections of a trade agreement after a phone call between top negotiators.\n\nU.S. officials have said the deal is to cover Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, intellectual property protections, currency practices and increased access for U.S. companies to China\u2019s financial services market.\n\nJude Blanchette, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the phase one deal was restoring the status quo to where it stood before the trade war began in 2017, calling into question how much progress had actually been made.\n\nTougher issues - such as China\u2019s industrial policy, subsidies for state-owned enterprises, forced technology transfers - had been deferred for negotiation later, he said.\n\n\u201cThe can has been kicked down to a phase two or phase three, but we\u2019re really just wondering if we\u2019re going to get through phase one,\u201d he said.", "description": "An interim trade agreement between the United States and China might not be completed in time for signing in Chile next month as expected but that does not mean the accord is falling apart, a U.S. administration official said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446286580&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1EV", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
