Target in June said the retailer's 360,000 salaried and hourly workers, including part-time employees, would get up to four weeks of paid time off to care for a new or ailing family member. And the National Football League last month said the roughly 1,000 workers who staff its offices in Los Angeles, New Jersey and New York could take up to 16 weeks of paid time to welcome a new family member.\n\nSenators unveil paid family leave proposal: \"It's time to catch up with other countries\"\n\nNot everyone who works for the Hilton brand is entitled to the expanded perk \u2014 just over 35,000 of the company's U.S. workforce of 285,000 are eligible. That's because more than two-thirds of its U.S. workforce are employed by independently owned and operated franchisees. And, while Hilton directly employs roughly 73,000 in the U.S., only those who work full-time and have been with the company at least a year are eligible.\n\nA global company, Hilton employs about 420,000 people around the world.\n\nThe company is also partnering with Milk Stork to give traveling employees a means to more easily ship or carry breast milk home to their infants, along with training videos to help employees make the transition to parenting. Hilton three years ago enhanced its benefits to offer $10,000 to support employee adoptions, something hundreds have made use of, Fuentes said.", "description": "Company to offer 12 weeks paid time off for birth mothers and four weeks for dads --  same for maids as for execs", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/01/15/154411fc-5abe-4772-a2ed-859ab3ec2593/thumbnail/1200x630/f88d6bc7b20595f2922daabc456fbabf/baby-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
