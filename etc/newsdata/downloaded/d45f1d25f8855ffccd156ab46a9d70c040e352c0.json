Start from the back!", "language": "en", "text": "Half the people questioned in a recent survey said they had pretended to read a book when they had not.\n\nApparently, the most common book to pretend to have read is the Bible, followed by To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nThis seems strange. The Bible is full of longueurs, so it would be very hard to read from start to finish. On the other hand, To Kill A Mockingbird is snappy, with a strong story. I suspect a lot of its fake readers were taught it at school, which is a sure way of killing enthusiasm.\n\nFake reading extends to the highest quarters. An English professor once advised me never to trust anyone who claimed to have finished Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.\n\nHalf the people questioned in a recent survey said they had pretended to read a book when they had not\n\nA few years ago, an Irishman professed to have discovered an old letter in which James Joyce himself admitted that he hadn't managed to finish reading it.\n\n'Yes, it's true,' he wrote to his fellow writer Ezra Pound, 'I've never quite managed to finish it. I know I probably should, being the writer and all, but Christ, it all just gets too much, doesn't it?'\n\nWith commendable honesty, Joyce went on to criticise his own novel for 'the way it all gets really confusing, and then even more confusing \u2014 my head hurts just thinking about it'.\n\nBut even if we are excused reading Finnegans Wake, that still leaves millions of other books to read, or pretend to read.\n\nOf course, the most expensive way of not reading a book is to buy it, then leave it untouched. The Japanese have a term for this: tsundoku.\n\nIn 2014, a maths professor called Jordan Ellenberg used data from Kindle to work out the year's most unreadable bestseller. Here are the top five, with the percentage of people who read them all the way through:\n\n1. Hard Choices by Hillary Clinton (1.9 per cent)\n\n2. Capital by Thomas Piketty (2.4 per cent)\n\n3. Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (6.4 per cent)\n\n4. A Brief History Of Time by Stephen Hawking (6.6 per cent)\n\n5. Thinking, Fast And Slow by Daniel Kahneman (6.8 per cent)\n\nPoor Hillary! Presumably, her publishers will give her next book the more inviting title Easy Choices. Equally, Professor Hawking could have made his History Of Time even briefer, while Daniel Kahneman might think of cutting out his slow thinking chapters altogether.\n\nI wish someone would commission Professor Ellenberg to perform his experiment in reverse. How many of us have read the beginning and end of a book, but not the middle?\n\nWhat is the percentage of readers who have started an Agatha Christie and then, after one or two murders, skipped to the last chapter to find out who did it?\n\nApparently, the most common book to pretend to have read is the Bible, followed by To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nOften the end can be even more boring than the middle. Personally, I find Hercule Poirot's dogged explanations very long-winded. 'Eh bien!' he goes.\n\n'On the day in question, Mr Peach went to Mrs Pomegranate's hotel only to find that his sister, Mrs Prune, had arranged a secret meeting with Mr Mango, who . . .' So I would recommend skipping to the second-last page, by which time Poirot has stopped boring on and the red-faced murderer is led away in handcuffs.\n\nSome classics so exhaust their bright young readers that they never again read anything worthwhile. I have a friend who studied John Milton's Paradise Lost at Oxford University, gained a first-class degree and went on to read nothing but cheap thrillers for the rest of his life.\n\nMy own shelves are full of books I hope to get around to one day. Some of them have been stuck in the same place for years. Their spines stare back at me reproachfully.\n\nI am now of an age when I gaze at books and struggle to remember if I have read them or not. This is particularly true of popular classics. John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga is about 1,000 pages long, and I'm pretty sure that I have read it, but I can't be certain. Perhaps it was just that, 20 or 30 years ago, everyone else was reading it.\n\nOr were they just pretending?", "description": "Apparently, the most common book to pretend to have read is the Bible, followed by To Kill A Mockingbird.", "authors": ["Craig Brown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/01/19518772-0-image-a-85_1570667512203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
