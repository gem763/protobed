He said any \"exploitation of natural resources of a sovereign state without its consent is illegal,\" according to a translator of his remarks in Russian.\n\nCavusoglu, however, remained focused on a top priority for Turkey in Syria: Ensuring that Kurdish fighters whom the United States supported to help drive out ISIS don't threaten Turkish interests.\n\nAnkara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey, U.S. and the European Union have designated the PKK as a terrorist organization.\n\nTurkey has led a military incursion into northeastern Syria to create a 30-kilometer (19-mile) \"safe zone\" between Kurdish fighters and the Turkish border.\n\nCavusoglu reiterated the hopes of Turkey \u2014 along with much of the international community \u2014 that Syria won't split apart. He suggested that areas now controlled by Turkish forces and their allies in Syria could one day be \"handed over\" to the Syrian government, especially if the talks enhance prospects for peace and stability.\n\n\"When times come that the Syrian regime, at the end of this political process, is capable enough to protect the country's territories and eliminate the terrorist organization (PKK) from that, I think all the territories should be handed over to Syria,\" he said. \"This is the territory of Syria.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
