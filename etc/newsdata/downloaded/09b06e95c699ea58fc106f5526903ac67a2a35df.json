And Ukraine is all about natural gas. Most Russian gas sold to Europe flows through pipelines crossing the nascent democracy. The gas sector is where a huge amount of Ukraine\u2019s wealth comes from\u2014and, by extension, its corruption. And the country\u2019s huge state-owned natural gas company, Naftogaz, finds its way into smackdowns between oligarchs and international energy stand-offs.\n\nThat\u2019s why Energy Secretary Rick Perry hovers in the background of the impeachment saga. As Texas governor, he earned the affection of America\u2019s oil and gas barons. And as energy secretary, he\u2019s pushed for reforms to make Ukraine friendlier to Western investment.\n\nIn the process, he\u2019s encouraged the Ukrainian government to turn to at least two Americans for advice: one man who donated to Perry\u2019s inaugural campaign, and another who used to advise one of Ukraine\u2019s most Russia-friendly politicians. So who are they?", "description": "One man donated to Perry\u2019s inaugural campaign, and another used to advise a Russia-friendly politician.", "authors": ["Betsy Swan", "Adam Rawnsley", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571119215/191014-rawnsley-rick-perry-tease_qev3sb", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
