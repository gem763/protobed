As Belinda Bencic appeared to give Osaka\u2019s game a keen reading for the third time this year, it grew clear that Osaka\u2019s opponents included, in ascending order, Osaka\u2019s knee, Bencic\u2019s knowhow and the diabolical system that placed Bencic in Osaka\u2019s draw neighborhood.\n\nWhile Osaka\u2019s 2019 season will always include her Australian Open title, her ascent to No. 1 and her widely revered turn of sportswomanship from this past Saturday night, her record this year against Bencic shouts 0-3 after Bencic\u2019s 7-5, 6-4 win in the fourth round. That outcome in 97 well-played minutes made Bencic the second Swiss player within 15 hours to dismiss a No. 1 seed, after that old male warhorse Stanislas Wawrinka spent Sunday night surpassing Novak Djokovic.\n\n[No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic exits U.S. Open in fourth round after retiring vs. Stan Wawrinka]\n\nOsaka was gone only about 40 hours after her moment of Saturday night, when she beat 15-year-old Floridian sensation Coco Gauff, 6-3, 6-0, then persuaded Gauff to stay with her untraditionally for the traditional on-court interview because she wanted Gauff to feel the fans\u2019 appreciation. Yet after the global response surprised her even with her notifications turned off, she came upon an opponent who had watched from the stands for Osaka-Gauff, who admired the gesture and who maybe even studied further the winner. Bencic\u2019s ensuing show of expertise left Serena Williams, pursuing her record-tying 24th Grand Slam title, as the only remaining quarterfinalist with any Grand Slam singles championship, left No. 8 Williams and No. 5 Elina Svitolina as the only top-10 players still churning here, prevented any Osaka-Williams rematch of last year\u2019s noisy final and left a reminder that the player at No. 12, Bencic, can menace.\n\nIn Indian Wells, Calif., in March, she bested Osaka, 6-3, 6-1.\n\nIn Madrid in May, she shook off an unfavorable match point and beat Osaka, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5.\n\nBy the time they got to New York in September, beneath a closed Arthur Ashe Stadium roof shielding them from downpours at high noon, Bencic seemed to play points as if a split-second prescient. That, mixed with a mere 12 unforced errors, made Bencic look just about ironclad.\n\n\u201cI think my game is very much on instinct,\u201d she said, soon continuing with, \u201cYou have to react to it in seconds. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s maybe just a feeling inside me. It\u2019s not like I watch her games and I see, \u2018She\u2019s going crosscourt all the time. It\u2019s just where she stands, the angle of the ball, how fast is it, how much spin is there.\u2019 I think you need to decide all this in seconds. I think it\u2019s not the brain, but it\u2019s just instinct.\u201d\n\n[As Serena Williams eyes history at the U.S. Open, a topsy-turvy field just tries to keep up]\n\nAll that instinct left Osaka \u201cnot that mad at this\u201d loss, of which the 21-year-old said, \u201cI think she had, like, a specific plan that she wanted to execute.\u201d Bencic executed it with reading skill that derives partly from childhood training, which began at the ripe age of 3 with Melanie Molitor, best known as the mother and coach to five-time Grand Slam champion Martina Hingis. By the time Bencic was a teenager, she occupied that wonderful, horrible zone of the prodigy, the kind of promising talent who eventually reaches 22 and says, as she did Monday, \u201cPeople always think I\u2019m older than I actually am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really young when she was playing,\u201d Bencic said of Hingis, whose Grand Slam final appearances came compressed between 1997 and 2002. \u201cObviously I knew who she was and what she has achieved. I think it was not necessary to study her game. I did everything on the practice the way I should.\n\n\u201cBut I think with Melanie we didn\u2019t try to, like, copy Martina\u2019s game. We tried to make my own game. And obviously know there are similarities because that\u2019s the way Melanie teaches, but it was about to make my own strengths and my own game style. I think I play, of course, a little bit different than Martina. I think she was even more skilled and smarter on the court and playing more chess. I think I have a little bit less maybe talent and touch than her but maybe a little more power.\u201d\n\nAt 17, Bencic whisked through such bright lights as Angelique Kerber and Jelena Jankovic to the 2014 U.S. Open quarterfinals. Then she spent five years and 16 Grand Slam tournaments and umpteen injury recoveries seeking that stage again. She accessed it Monday when she served for the match, held her nerve and held at love, closing with a cunning serve up the middle that coaxed a sitter, which she blasted, and from which Osaka\u2019s lunging reply never had any hope.\n\n\u201cI hurt my knee [last month] in Cincinnati, but it\u2019s getting better,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that that\u2019s the reason that I lost, because I obviously had played, like, three matches before this. Yeah, I just needed to take a painkiller.\u201d\n\nOddly, she remains unbeaten in Grand Slam quarterfinals, semifinals and finals, at 6-0. Yet she found this exit less dispiriting than others, saying, \u201cI mean, in Wimbledon [a first-round loss], I walked out on you guys [reporters]. In Roland Garros [a third-round match], I came straight from the match, so I was all gross and I just wanted to get out of there. Obviously, as you can see, I took a shower.\u201d\n\nEveryone laughed, and she said: \u201cYeah, I feel like I\u2019m more chill now. Because it sort of relates back to . . . I feel like I grew. I don\u2019t feel like I put so much weight on one single match.\u201d\n\nIn a season with some dips, she had learned it hadn\u2019t helped to take herself too seriously. And she seemed clearheaded when she said: \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learned over the summer that even if you aren\u2019t playing your best, you\u2019re going to play people who are going to play their best. You have to figure out how to win those matches. And it\u2019s matches like that that are most important, because it really tests your character. So I think on that side I have a lot of growing up to do.\u201d", "description": "Bencic is 3-0 against Osaka in 2019.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Pm", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FcJB_uBD02kcs0_rcXM83H_HxDQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2HT6XWNVMI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg"}
