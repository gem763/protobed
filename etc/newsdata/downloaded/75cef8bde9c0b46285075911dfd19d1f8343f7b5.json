Since losing to Donald Trump in the 2016 general election, Clinton has maintained a \"woe is me\" attitude, blaming her defeat on anything other than her own weaknesses.\n\nShe's pointed fingers at sexist Americans, misogynists, the media. And, last but not least, Russians. She stated as fact that Russia propelled Trump to victory, and now she's musing that the Kremlin is doing the same favor for Tulsi Gabbard in the 2020 Democratic primary. The Hawaii congresswoman is, Clinton charged, a \u201cfavorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nGabbard shot back on Twitter with a video informing Clinton that she's \"not afraid\" to stand up to her and her elitism.\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced. Join me in taking our Democratic Party back & leading a govt of, by & for the people! https://t.co/TOcAOPrxye pic.twitter.com/TahfE2XOek \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 20, 2019\n\nGabbard suggested that her support Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 is one reason for Clinton's attacks. Sanders defended Gabbard on Twitter, calling Clinton's accusation \"outrageous.\"\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) had his own message for Hillary: get help.\n\n\"That's absolutely insane,\" Zeldin said of Clinton's Russian accusation. \"And she seriously needs to see a psychiatrist. She needs to talk through this with someone. She's not dealing with her loss well.\"\n\n\"She's acting out and blaming anyone but herself for that loss,\" Zeldin charged.", "description": ".10/22/2019 12:14:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/6b7d14ff-ab3e-4d3e-8402-120fdd1b18e7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
