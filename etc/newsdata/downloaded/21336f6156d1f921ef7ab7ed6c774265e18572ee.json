Porn is back in Times Square.\n\nAdult film company Evil Angel quietly snagged billboard space in New York City\u2019s Times Square to advertise their latest adult feature, I Am Riley. One of the most-viewed porn stars on the internet, Riley Reid is now prominently displayed on multiple billboards throughout the historic Midtown Manhattan area, paying homage to seedier times and bringing porn culture front and center once more.\n\nUnlike the family-friendly NYC Times Square of today, in the 1970s it was a gritty, open-air concrete palace of debauchery. Summers in Midtown had that post-coital odor, like stale sweat and exhaled nicotine. Pornography played on the big screen, theaters promoted live sex shows on the marquees, corner newsstands prominently featured an array of glossy porno mags\u2014it served as the hub for illicit adult entertainment. Advertisements for adult content couldn\u2019t be avoided, practically synonymous with Times Square. It was a far cry from the tourist trap it is today, largely due to then-Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani, who mercilessly drove the effort to clean up Times Square from the \u201890s to the early 2000s by imposing ordinance and zoning regulations to drive out adult-oriented business. For better or worse, many credit Giuliani for today\u2019s \u201cDisneyfied, family-centric\u201d atmosphere, which has played a key role in developing the city\u2019s tourism trade. Prominent porn ads were a relic of the past\u2014until now.\n\n\u201cI can say I understand his effort and desires trying to make the city seem more family-friendly. I one hundred percent understand those perspectives and everything like that, but sex is how we were all created. Sex is the root of technology and everything that happens in our world. Vogue and everybody else, they all use nude female bodies. They use sex constantly to sell products,\u201d says Riley Reid. \u201cSo I want to say [to Giuliani]: I\u2019m sorry that you felt the desire to somewhat banish us from the city life but we have only begun to fight back. We will be back in that city. I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t be glamorized in that same light. We all watch it, we\u2019re all part of it, we all need sex to create life, so why not just glorify it?\u201d\n\nMillions of tourists now flock to the storefronts where neon XXX signs once stood\u2014signs some claim could be seen flying into John F. Kennedy airport. Riding high on it\u2019s record-breaking year for tourism, New York City welcomed 65.2 million visitors in 2018, and is expecting that number to rise by the end of 2019. According to a study conducted by the Times Square Alliance and Times Square Advertising Coalition, billboards are one of the main attractions in Times Square, where people spend an average of 81 minutes\u2014eight of which are spent ogling billboards. The study also cited how \u201c 243,358 people in Times Square post about their experience in Times Square on social media each day.\u201d\n\n\u201c I think it\u2019s going to be huge for the general public. I hope we have more opportunities like this. I hope other companies will take the time to glamorize themselves in the mainstream media, because if it can be done it should be done. \u201d\n\n\u201cNot being egotistical but I know I\u2019m a big name and I know that I\u2019m recognizable,\u201d says Reid, excited about the ad campaign. \u201cFor the people who know who I am to be walking around in Times Square and be stopped in their tracks and be like, \u2018Wait a minute, is that Riley Reid on a giant billboard in Times Square? What?\u2019 And then for the people who don\u2019t know who I am, they\u2019ll see it and probably be like, \u2018Oh, what is this? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 And then hopefully do their research, look into it because they\u2019ll be curious, and then see that it\u2019s an adult story documentary porno all mixed together. I think it\u2019s going to be huge for the general public. I hope we have more opportunities like this. I hope other companies will take the time to glamorize themselves in the mainstream media, because if it can be done it should be done.\u201d\n\nWith a following larger than most B-list celebrities\u2014over a million followers on Twitter and over two million on Instagram\u2014Reid might be the new Queen of Porn, surpassing Jenna Jameson. Choosing Reid to headline a series of five billboards that start on 42nd Street and 7th Avenue was a strategic move, as was ditching the \u201cEvil Angel\u201d company name. How to get the billboard space and fly under the radar while still advertising their product was an idea hatched by the film\u2019s director, Chris Gentile, who also works as Evil Angel\u2019s chief creative officer.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go out of my way to spell it out for them,\u201d recalls Gentile, on whether or not the company that sold the billboard space knew it was an advertisement for porn. \u201cIt\u2019s really safe for work. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say maybe they haven\u2019t put it together. The billboard is an image of Riley, really safe for work, a portrait really, and all it says is: \u2018I am Riley: A docuseries coming this fall.\u2019 It looks a lot like something Amazon would run for one of their shows. Performers should be celebrated like any other celebrity, and putting Riley on a billboard moves towards that.\u201d\n\nFor Evil Angel\u2019s owner/founder, John Stagliano, seeing his product in Times Square brings back a sense of nostalgia. \u201cI remember when Times Square was the center of adult entertainment, DVDs were sold all around Port Authority. It was 1993 and this one store was duping my movies, everything in this store was copies. A big mafia guy owned the store, so my lawyer gives this guy a call and I got a settlement. It was the only time I ever made money going after someone for my movies,\u201d recalls Stagliano. \u201cMy favorite memory: there was a girl I saw at a peep booth once, it was the seventies, I met this girl, the window would come down and there would be no glass and I shall say no more. Back then it was common but it all ended a long time ago. They cleaned it all up.\u201d", "description": "A series of porn billboards secretly made their way into New York City\u2019s Times Square, recalling the pre-Giuliani days.", "authors": ["Aurora Snow"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570102109/191002-snow-times-square-porn-tease_pjtoik"}
