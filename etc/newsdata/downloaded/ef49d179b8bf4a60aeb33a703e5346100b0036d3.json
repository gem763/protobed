I should have intervened, because nobody was denying, contesting the lies Boris Johnson and others were spreading around.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSlating the two British Prime Ministers and the media, Mr Juncker said the papers had spouted \u2018nonsense\u2019 and \u2018bulls**t\u2019 \u2018day after day\u2019 for 46 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the press had portrayed Britain as \u2018not really in Europe\u2026 [only being there] for economic and internal market reasons\u2019.\n\nIt is not the first time Mr Juncker has hit out at Brexit and key backers of the Leave campaign.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson (left) and Jean-Claude Juncke earlier this month (Picture: PA)\n\nEarlier this week he labelled Brexit a \u2018waste of time and energy\u2019.\n\nSingling out Mr Johnson for criticism tonight, he continued: \u2018They were saying things, some of them \u2013 lying. Telling the people things which have nothing to do with our day by day reality.\u2019\n\nAs a result, he said the outcome of the referendum was unsurprising, declaring himself \u2018always convinced\u2019 the referendum would be a \u2018negative\u2019 one.\n\nHe said he had bet a British commissioner that Leave would win, suggesting he would give him a euro if he was wrong, and that he be given a pound if he was right.\n\n\u2018I have the pound in my pocket\u2019, he said.\n\nDefending the EC when asked what mistakes they had made under his leadership, he said the commission was not responsible for the result of the referendum and that it had not been part of the debate.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
