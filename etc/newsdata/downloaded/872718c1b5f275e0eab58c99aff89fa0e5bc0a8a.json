Adam Schiff\u2019s secret hearings on impeachment, stormed a closed-door session of Schiff\u2019s secret hearings on impeachment \u2014 effectively putting a halt to Schiff\u2019s secret hearings on impeachment.\n\nGo, GOP. Title this: The Day the GOP Bared Its Teeth.\n\nHonestly, what right does Schiff think he has to hold secret hearings on impeachment?\n\nIf anything is worthy of openness and transparency, it\u2019s matters pertaining to impeachment of America\u2019s duly elected president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try and go in there, and we\u2019re going to to try to figure out what\u2019s going on, on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent that want to see this Congress working for them and not obsess with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who led the storming-Norman charge across the closed-door finish line, Fox News reported.\n\nAnd guess what: It worked.\n\nSchiff, the chairman of House Intelligence, stood down.\n\nHe suspended the secret hearings on impeachment \u2014 the secret hearings on impeachment that never should have been in the first place. And he left the room.\n\nThat\u2019s called LOL.\n\n\u201cWhat is Adam Schiff trying to hide? I think that\u2019s the question so many people have,\u201d said House Minority Whip Steve Scales, who took part in the storming.\n\nIt is. It is a key question. After all, why talk in the dark if the topic of conservation could withstand the light?\n\nIf Schiff had the goods for impeachment, he wouldn\u2019t have a need for secret meetings.\n\nHe\u2019d be out and about, in day and in light, crowing, cheering and catcalling of all the proof of impeachable offense \u2014 and then he\u2019d be taking votes, not just crowing, cheering and catcalling.\n\nJust goes to show: Democrats, after all these years, still have nothing on which to impeach. It\u2019s nice the Republicans in Congress are calling them out on this. It\u2019s nice the Republicans are finally forcing their hands.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
