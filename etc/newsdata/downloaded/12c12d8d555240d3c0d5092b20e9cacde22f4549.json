But a handful of e-commerce stocks still have plenty of room to run in this difficult market. Today, three of our Motley Fool contributors will highlight JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), Wayfair (NYSE: W), and Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) -- companies that deserve to go higher despite the near-term macro challenges.\n\nAn unloved Chinese market leader with improving fundamentals\n\nLeo Sun (JD.com): JD is the largest direct retailer and second largest e-commerce player in China after Alibaba (NYSE: BABA). Unlike Alibaba, JD takes on inventories and runs its own fulfillment and logistics services. That business model is more capital-intensive than Alibaba's, but it's better shielded from counterfeit products.\n\nA virtual shopping basket on a tablet app. More\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJD seemed to be in deep trouble last year, as its growth accelerated, its costs rose, and it struggled to remain profitable. A rape allegation against CEO Richard Liu and the escalating trade war exacerbated the pain.\n\nThe criminal charges against Liu were eventually dropped, and JD's latest quarter indicates that the e-tailer has finally turned a corner. JD's second-quarter revenue rose 23% annually, marking its strongest growth in three quarters. It expects that momentum to continue with 20% to 24% growth in the third quarter.\n\nMuch of that growth was fueled by higher demand for higher-ticket items like electronics and home appliances -- indicating that consumer spending in China remains robust in the shadow of the trade war. JD's adjusted net profit also surged more than sevenfold as JD Logistics' gross margin hit the break-even point for the first time ever. JD is also providing logistics to other companies as a third-party service, which will diversify its revenue streams beyond its core commerce business.\n\nIt also expects to remain consistently profitable for the year with a net profit margin of 1.4% to 1.7%. That's a big improvement from previous years, and indicates that economies of scale are kicking in -- which will make it tough for smaller rivals to compete while staying profitable. Despite all that good news, JD still trades at less than one time this year's sales -- so it could rebound quickly if investors develop an appetite for Chinese stocks again.\n\nWayfair has the growth\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Wayfair): Home furnishings specialist Wayfair has seen its stock return to roughly market-return levels after having nearly doubled at one point in 2019. Not much about the business story has changed in that time, though, which means investors are simply getting a better deal today.\n\nSure, Wayfair is no closer to achieving profitability. Instead, net losses ballooned over the first half of the year and are expected to jump again in the hiring buildup before the key holiday season. But look closer and you'll see gathering evidence of earnings strength. Advertising spending is falling as a percentage of sales, repeat-customer orders are hitting new highs, and Wayfair's active customer base is barreling toward 20 million shoppers.\n\nCEO Niraj Shah and his team issued a conservative outlook for the third quarter. That caution, plus spiking volatility in the broader market, helped push shares down in recent weeks despite the company reporting its fifth straight quarter of surprisingly strong growth in August. As a result, investors who believe management's target of robust profitability is achievable over the long term might want to buy shares of Wayfair as it lines up another year of market share gains.", "description": "These companies are still firing on all cylinders as the market frets over macro headwinds.", "authors": ["Leo Sun", "Steve Symington", "Demitrios Kalogeropoulos", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GX2pm_Fu9Y9zKW9dzSeIuA--~B/aD00NjY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/0313c3442fefea9ad6f2fc5022d2ffcf"}
