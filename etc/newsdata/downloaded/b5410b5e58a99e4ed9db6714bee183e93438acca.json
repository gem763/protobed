Sign up here.\n\nDon\u2019t just blame President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if Turkey\u2019s central bank decides again to err on the side of lowering interest rates more than anticipated.\n\nGovernor Murat Uysal may not quite match the record cut he delivered during his first meeting at the helm in July. Most of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a reduction of 275 basis points on Thursday. But a sizable minority sees a bigger move, and others point to the risk of another dovish surprise.\n\nThe central bank won\u2019t need to borrow from Erdogan\u2019s unconventional playbook for monetary policy, which holds that lower rates bring price growth down. In real terms, Turkey\u2019s benchmark is now double the average for its emerging-market peers, providing room for 4 percentage points of easing relative to the central bank\u2019s year-end forecast for inflation, according to Bank of America Corp.\n\n\u201cGiven the dovish stance of the authorities, the risk is for a more front-loaded cutting cycle,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Yarkin Cebeci. While expecting a 275 basis-point cut on Thursday, he said \u201cit could easily be more.\u201d\n\nForecasts for a rate cut in the Bloomberg poll of 31 analysts range between 125 and 400 basis points. When Uysal slashed the benchmark by 425 basis points in July, the median estimate was for easing of 250 basis points. It was the first reduction since 2016 and the biggest since a shift to inflation targeting in 2002.\n\nHow \u2018Reasonable\u2019?\n\nThe new governor has already signaled that more cuts were on the cards but also vowed to preserve \u201ca reasonable rate of real return\u201d for investors. Turkey\u2019s price growth, currently at 15%, will end the year at 13.9%, according to the central bank\u2019s latest forecast.\n\nA rare calm has settled over the market before the decision. After soaring to an eight-month high ahead of the central bank\u2019s July meeting, volatility in Turkish stocks has come down before this week\u2019s gathering. The lira ended four days of losses with a gain of 0.3% against the dollar on Wednesday.\n\nErdogan is unlikely to be far from the minds of the seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Just days ahead of this week\u2019s meeting, Erdogan suggested Turkey will lower borrowing costs to single digits soon and inflation will follow suit.\n\nThe irony is that he may be right for all the wrong reasons. Much of the credit for the disinflation and the room to cut rates should go to the outsized monetary tightening delivered last year.\n\nConfronting more restless voters and other political challenges, Erdogan will have little patience for a \u201cmore moderate\u201d easing cycle, according to Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at Teneo Intelligence. \u201cMarket complacency\u201d is only likely to embolden him, he said.\n\n\u201cIn his fight for political survival, Erdogan will not hesitate to use whatever means he has available,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cThis week\u2019s tool will be monetary policy.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Harumi Ichikura, Tugce Ozsoy and Constantine Courcoulas.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Cagan Koc in Istanbul at ckoc2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Onur Ant at oant@bloomberg.net, ;Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net, Paul Abelsky\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
