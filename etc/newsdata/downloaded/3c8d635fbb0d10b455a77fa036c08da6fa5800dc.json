Theragun Is For You (And Everyone Else)", "language": "en", "text": "Runners, CrossFitters, Yogis and Cyclists, unite! Well, kind of \u2014 or, at least have the opportunity to bond over a Theragun (yes, that sleek handheld recovery device you\u2019re seeing all over social media \u2014 especially in the hands of fitness trainers).\n\nAs someone who is OK with stretching but very vocally hates foam rolling, I discovered Theragun as a relief while marathon training, and then it stuck with me as I recovered from an injury that promptly ended said marathon training.\n\nDespite a variety of (trendy and true) popular workouts requiring different equipment, space and time \u2014there\u2019s one thing most athletes can agree upon: taking care of muscles (ahem, the recovery phase) is a must. But heck, even if you aren\u2019t training for the Olympics (read: you\u2019re sore from sitting at a desk all day), the motor, attachments, speeds and adjustable arms of the Theragun are designed to target treatment for every muscle \u2014 catering to area-specific relief for every body\u2019s needs.\n\nThe Theragun app is available to download (and encouraged). The app guides consumers how to use the device correctly: sweeping the device from point A to point B, whether it\u2019s targeting glutes, feet, hands, hip flexors, shins and more. Step-by-step guides highlight which attachment should be used and durations for respective areas of the body so you\u2019re not left wondering if you\u2019re doing it right.\n\nDespite their power, the motor (although not completely silent) has a hum that isn\u2019t disruptive \u2014 it\u2019s a far cry from a jackhammer you\u2019d expect granted the power that\u2019s softly massaging your muscles. The devices are small enough to carry (and travel with) in a small case. The Theragun comes in three varieties: G3PRO, G3 (in black and white), and liv and it\u2019s going to be your new favorite way to recover. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
