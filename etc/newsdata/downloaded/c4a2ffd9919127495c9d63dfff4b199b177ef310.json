Electronic devices are not permitted.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans began shouting at each other, reports say, and the Republican protesters refused to leave the room for a number of hours, even ordering pizza at lunchtime.\n\nThe protest delayed the testimony of Laura Cooper, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, for five hours, although she resumed her testimony later in the afternoon.\n\nWhy did they barge in?\n\nThe Republicans argued that Democrats were conducting the impeachment inquiry in secret, with Representative Steve Scalise describing it as \"a Soviet-style process\".\n\n\"Every member of Congress ought to be allowed in that room. The press ought to be allowed in that room,\" he added.\n\nThe inquiry is led by a Democrat - Adam Schiff - and being run by the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nHowever, more than 40 Republicans are members of those committees, and permitted to take part in the hearings.\n\nDemocrats have argued that it is common for the initial stages of a congressional investigation to be conducted behind closed doors, and say private hearings are needed at the start, to stop witnesses from coordinating their testimony.\n\n\"The special counsels in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments conducted their investigations in private and we must initially do the same,\" Mr Schiff wrote in a letter to colleagues.\n\nWhy is this happening now?\n\nSome commentators have argued that the Republicans, and Mr Trump, have come under increased pressure following Tuesday's testimony by the acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What does it take to impeach a president?\n\nMr Taylor testified that Mr Trump had made the release of military aid to Ukraine conditional on a pledge that his political rival, Joe Biden, would be investigated, and said relations with Ukraine had been \"fundamentally undermined\" as a result.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham responded in a statement: \"President Trump has done nothing wrong - this is a co-ordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution\".\n\nDemocratic congressman David Cicilline described Wednesday's protest as \"a stunt that corresponded very specifically to the president's complaint that they weren't fighting hard enough for him, and in direct response to devastating testimony... from Ambassador Taylor\".\n\nHowever, Republican Jim Jordan, who has taken part in the hearings, suggested that the protesters were simply fed up with the lack of transparency.\n\n\"It's finally reached the point where members just said they're so frustrated at the idea that they can't be a part of this and see what's going on,\" he told reporters.", "description": "They forced their way into a secure meeting room, after Trump urged Republicans to \"get tough\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rv82x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
