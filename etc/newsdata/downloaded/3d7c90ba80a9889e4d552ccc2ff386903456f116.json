Each variant contains a specially paired variety of fynbos as well as botanical superfoods, he says, and is also is a potent source of phytonutrients and antioxidants. According to Montsi, the first step in combating the obesity problem is to provide alternative health-conscious products.\n\nHe says their range is 100% natural and contains zero sugar, zero sweeteners, zero preservatives and zero colourants.\n\nThe dangers of too much sugar\n\nThis company\u2019s mission is to spread awareness about the impact of excessive sugar and sweetener intake, as well as bring clarity to health claims that often leave consumers with an inaccurate assessment of it. \u201cWe have found the term \u2018no added sugar\u2019 [is] used in a manner that implies there is little sugar within the labelled product,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, according to Montsi, what isn\u2019t communicated is that while no cane sugar was actually added, alternatives such as honey or fruit juice are included, which are sugar rich in themselves. \u201cVery often the resulting sugar content is quite comparable to cane sugar sweetened beverages, but the wording \u2018no added sugar\u2019 implies otherwise.\u201d\n\nWorld Health Organisation guidelines recommend that to prevent obesity and tooth decay, adults and children should reduce their consumption of free sugars to less than 10% of their daily energy intake.\n\nLowest sugar levels on the market\n\nMontsi maintains that he doesn\u2019t believe that sugar is evil, however it\u2019s no longer a secret that excessive sugar intake is extremely bad for the human body. \u201cIt\u2019s also well-known that the amount of sugar in the current serving sizes of sugary drinks is excessive, even with efforts to partially replace sugar with sweeteners.\n\nThe jury is still out on sweeteners, and they may ultimately form part of the solution, but their definite metabolic effects (such as triggering insulin release) are extremely disconcerting.\u201d While it may be difficult to get away from their sugar addictions, in order to assist people with the transition towards unsweet and to recognise the possibility of moderate sugar intake, each of the Monatea\u2019s variants is available lightly sweetened with a touch of cane sugar.\n\n\u201cAs far as we can tell, we have the lowest sugar levels in the market, and without sweeteners,\u201d he adds. Montsi says Monatea has enormous potential overseas, and says they are already developing a line of loose leaf and powdered instant Monatea for the Chinese market.\n\n\u2013 Health-e News\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "With obesity on the rise globally and locally, and the link with high sugar consumption, a newly launched drink is a welcome reprieve.", "authors": ["Thabo Molelekwa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9433/edc31a1b2e16453a8d60da94ee75ff8d.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
