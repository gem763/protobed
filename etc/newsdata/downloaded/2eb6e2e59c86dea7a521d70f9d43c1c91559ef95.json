It follows him everywhere, even though he isn\u2019t proud of some of the language that on-field microphones caught him using during that July 18 game. His parents wear T-shirts printed with \u201cSavages in the Box,\u201d the phrase he repeatedly yelled. His players and fans do, too. The name plates in the home clubhouse at Yankee Stadium now include the words \u201cOctober Savages.\u201d\n\nAnother reminder came when the Yankees visited the Tampa Bay Rays in the final week of the season. Hanging from the walls of the visiting manager\u2019s office at Tropicana Field are 29 photographs of rival managers either talking or arguing with umpires. On the one of Boone, a previous visitor had left a note: \u201cWE ARE SAVAGES!\u201d\n\nWhile Boone can laugh about it now, his intense outburst might be the most memorable moment of the Yankees\u2019 year so far. Known for his calm manner and affable personality, Boone let his edge \u2014 and vocabulary \u2014 show in that argument about the strike zone with the home-plate umpire, Brennan Miller.\n\nTo Boone\u2019s players, it was an example of how their relatively inexperienced manager, who so often feels like one of them, was growing in his second year on the job \u2014 a season that might earn him the American League Manager of the Year Award. In their eyes, he was becoming more comfortable and more assertive \u2014 traits that could serve him well in this year\u2019s playoffs.", "description": "In his second year as the team\u2019s manager, Boone has learned from his missteps and complemented his upbeat demeanor with bursts of intensity.", "authors": ["James Wagner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/sports/04Boone/04Boone-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
