He needs to bring in a little bit of discipline to his cricket.\u201d\n\nWith next year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup in mind, Rathour extended the message to all young members of the side that fearless cricket did not mean reckless cricket.\n\n\u201cWhat the team management is asking from them is fearless cricket - having clear gameplans and playing with intent, backing your strengths. At the same time, you cannot be careless,\u201d the former India opener said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they are smart enough to understand that.\u201d\n\nIndia will also play three tests against South Africa next month, when limited-overs stalwart Rohit Sharma may reinvent himself as a test opener.\n\nRohit smashed a record five centuries at this year\u2019s 50-overs World Cup, but the white-ball stalwart has managed only 27 sporadic test appearances.\n\nRathour said 32-year-old Rohit has the game to succeed across formats, which would be a massive boost for the side.\n\n\u201cHe has done so well as an opener in white ball cricket, so I don\u2019t see any reason why he can\u2019t do well in red ball cricket as well, provided we provide him enough opportunities,\u201d Rathour said.\n\n\u201cIf he comes good, it will be a huge asset for the team. Somebody of his experience, the kind of cricket he plays - if he plays at the top of the order, it will be a huge thing.\u201d", "description": "India's newly appointed batting coach Vikram Rathour has joined head coach Ravi Shastri in demanding more discipline from exciting stumper-batsman Rishabh Pant.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430814746&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0TO", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
