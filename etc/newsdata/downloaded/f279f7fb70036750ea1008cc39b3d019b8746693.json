Given that credit spreads are still relatively tight on a historical basis, we continue to believe it is prudent to remain up in quality as we await better opportunities to deploy capital in riskier credit sectors in the coming downturn.\"\n\nMinerd said investors should keep a close eye on the stock market and the shape of the yield curve.\n\n\"Stock market response will be a key indicator of the success of the Fed's move to cut rates, and if the curve stays inverted the market is signaling its skepticism that Fed policy will keep the economy from falling into recession,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "Guggenheim Partners global chief investment officer Scott Minerd warned on Tuesday the firm's recession forecast model showed a 58% chance of the economy being in a recession by mid-2020, and a 77% chance of one beginning in the next 24 months.", "authors": ["Jennifer Ablan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gjVUgvNCh8JYlx9vn43xbw--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/5f64f994eed14569c33ca3d0e7a3d21a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
