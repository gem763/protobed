On Friday, demonstrators torched at least a dozen stations, causing an estimated $300m (\u00a3230m) of damage.\n\nPlay Video 0:58 Chile: students ambush metro stations in mass fare-dodging protest over price hikes \u2013 video\n\nBut Paula Rivas, the president of the Metro Workers\u2019 Union in the capital, Santiago, said the fare hike was not the driving force behind the mutiny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the low pensions, the privatisation of water, the rise in electricity prices, the healthcare system, the need for equal education rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe metro fare was just the trigger, it is symbolic. It made people say, \u2018enough\u2019. We will not be silenced.\u201d\n\nObservers and protesters say the rebellion \u2013 the worst unrest Chile has faced since the dying days of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship three decades ago \u2013 is fuelled by deep-rooted disillusionment at how millions of citizens have been frozen out of the country\u2019s economic rise.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t because of the metro price \u2013 it is because the system is squeezing us like lemons,\u201d said Bessy Gallardo Prado, a 34-year-old law student who has joined the protests.\n\n\u201cThis is happening because of decades of injustice, abuse, and inequality. There is no social security in this country. People earn little and work a lot and wages are not enough to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nNavia, who is based in the Chilean capital, said unlike in other Latin American countries, public anger was not the product of worsening living conditions.\n\n\u201cLiving conditions are in fact improving. Poverty levels are going down \u2026 Chile has been growing for most of the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that people perceive that wealth and opportunity are not evenly distributed. There isn\u2019t a level playing-field.\n\n\u201cThey feel like they are at the gates of the promised land. And they see all the elites inside having fun and enjoying the benefits of economic development \u2013 and they are not being let in.\u201d\n\nThe Santiago mayor, Karla Rubilar, struck a conciliatory tone on Monday, calling for dialogue between authorities and demonstrators.\n\n\u201cWe want the word of the day to be \u2018rebuilding\u2019 \u2013 rebuilding trust. Because we know it has been lost. Not during this government, but over many years,\u201d she told reporters.\n\n'This conflicted place made me who I am': Santiago, Chile \u2013 a cartoon Read more\n\nBut many blame Pi\u00f1era, who was elected in 2017 and is one of Chile\u2019s richest men, for inflaming the situation with his uncompromising and inept response.\n\nAs Santiago descended into chaos last Friday and the state of emergency was declared, the president was photographed dining with his family at an upmarket restaurant. \u201cPi\u00f1era eats pizza as Santiago burns,\u201d one critic tweeted.\n\nOn Sunday night he caused further fury with a hardline address in which he claimed the country was \u201cat war\u201d with \u201cevil\u201d delinquents who were bent on causing chaos and destruction.\n\nNavia said: \u201cIt was reminiscent of George W Bush \u2026 It is a provocation. When you tell protesters you are at war with them, they will go out and provoke you.\u201d\n\nHe said Pi\u00f1era\u2019s administration appeared to believe the declaration of a state of emergency would extinguish the uprising \u2013 but many protesters were defying the government\u2019s curfew.\n\n\u201cThings are tense and quiet [in Santiago] \u2013 almost like a public holiday,\u201d Navia said. \u201cBut this could reignite in the coming days.\u201d", "description": "More clashes likely after Pi\u00f1era expands state of emergency following \u2018weekend of rage\u2019", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e225870b37b84d1d268a2be47c7eb6cdee89bce/0_156_3069_1841/master/3069.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d87b87ceb4300459c5af2e5ba52bf7db", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
