Study paints cows to find answer", "language": "en", "text": "Cows are not known for their stripes, however new research suggests this may be about to change.\n\nScientists in Japan have found that if cows have zebra-style stripes painted on them, they are bitten less by the aptly named \u2018biting flies\u2019 - pests that are estimated to cost US farmers around $2,211 million per year in productivity.\n\nDespite sounding like something out of a cartoon, the study in Aichi prefecture, which was published in the journal PLOS One, was based on previous research that suggests one of the functions of zebra\u2019s stripes is to avoid being bitten.\n\nComparing cows painted with black and white stripes, black stripes and no stripes, the study observed the number of biting flies on each cow, as well as noting if they displayed typical anti-fly behaviour.\n\nIt found that the black and white striped cows had less than 50% of the amount of biting flies on their body compared to the unpainted cows, as well as exhibiting significantly less fly-repelling behaviour.\n\nBiting flies are some of the most damaging pests to cattle in the world, and heavily impact grazing and feeding in cows. They also cause significant stress to the animals, which results in reduced weight gain in beef cattle, and milk yields in dairy cows.", "description": "Cows are not known for their stripes, however new research suggests this may be about to change.", "authors": ["Charlie Filmer-Court", "Dominic Chorney", "Suella Braverman", "Greg Hands"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212495003-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyezZw7xbEqAKOdJbMb6knQL2vsvFAC0cjj_Ba7hslbI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
