The gendarmes carted away computers, documents, and as many secret hard drives as they could find. Then they left and sealed the office.\n\nThe investigators were looking into what may seem like just the latest scandal within the Vatican\u2019s beleaguered financial system. But this time it touched Pope Francis personally with allegations that money meant for his beloved charities for the poor was actually going into pricey London property and seedy apartments alleged to be used for sinful activities.\n\nFive people, including AIF director Tommaso Di Ruzza, were banned from entering the Vatican\u2019s fortified walls while the investigation tied to the raid was carried out. A wanted poster\u2014featuring photos of the five people who worked in the office and meant for Swiss Guards\u2019 eyes only to know who not to let in\u2014was inevitably leaked to the press.\n\nPope Francis, to put it mildly, was pissed off that the wanted poster was leaked and the reputations of those on it\u2014who may not be guilty of anything\u2014sullied. A Vatican statement condemned the outing of those on the wanted poster as \u201cprejudicial to the dignity of the people involved.\u201d The pope turned to his security chief Domenico Giani to find out exactly who leaked the photo. On Monday, his detective work still fruitless, Giani resigned.\n\nIn his official letter of explanation, he blamed his inability to smoke out whoever leaked the photos. \u201cI felt shame for what happened and for the suffering of these people,\u201d he wrote, according to the letter sent to Vatican accredited journalists. \u201cHaving always said I was ready to sacrifice my life to defend the Pope\u2019s, in the same spirit I made the decision to resign.\u201d\n\nMany now wonder if there is more to Giani\u2019s resignation, just as details of the AIF raid are starting to sound something like the explosive scandal in the 1980s tied to American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, mobsters, Masons, and murder. That scandal is also loosely related to the disappearance of Italian teen Emanuela Orlandi, who some believe was tasked with delivering a message from Marcinkus to someone he was collaborating with or to Orlandi\u2019s father\u2014it has never been clear\u2014and then killed to stop her from testifying. In the Marcinkus scandal, Roberto Calvi, the head of Italy\u2019s largest private bank before it collapsed, which was tied to Marcinkus\u2019 crafty accounting, ended up hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London with a pocket full of bricks and cash in various currencies.\n\nThis latest scandal also leads to the U.K., but so far at least, no one has been killed. The Italian newsmagazine L'Espresso uncovered a trail that leads to a former warehouse for Harrods on Sloane Ave. in London, which the Vatican controls through British Grolux Investments Ltd.\u2014 which records show is run by the Vatican's Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA). Apparently, around $400 million that was earmarked for the pope\u2019s charity fundraiser Peter\u2019s Pence\u2014named for Peter, the Catholic Church\u2019s original pope tapped by Jesus\u2014went to pay off the mortgage of private apartments in the warehouse.\n\nInvestigative documents unearthed by L'Espresso say the property now houses about 100 apartments, some of which are frequented by priests and other clergy as a sort of lurid London getaway. There have been reports in the Italian press of gay brothels where priests meet up with young men, and on rarer occasions, young women, as well as other unseemly activities taking place on the premises, but apart from going door-to-door, it is impossible to verify. Rome is filled with gay saunas frequented by priests that operate in the shadow of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, so it would surprise few if the clergy got up to the same thing when they traveled abroad.\n\nJust days after his gendarmes raided the AIF offices, Francis assigned anti-Mafia prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone to head the Vatican court assigned to get to the bottom of the Vatican Bank\u2019s alleged charity theft. Previous wrongdoings have been investigated internally. Tapping an outsider like Pignatone marks a change in strategy and sends a clear message that the pontiff doesn\u2019t exactly trust the usual gatekeepers. Among Pignatone\u2019s many accomplishments in his storied career fighting organized crime is helping pull back the curtain on Rome\u2019s own mafia that involved a one-eyed gangster and 40 thieves. Whether the pope believes there is a link between the Roman mafia and the Vatican Bank has not been made clear. The first case Pignatone will preside over is the trial of Angelo Caloia, the former Vatican Bank president who is accused of embezzling millions off Vatican property deals.\n\nThe Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for Religious Works or IOR, has been sketchy for years. In 2013, the European Central Bank closed down its credit card capabilities, meaning everyone from tour groups slogging through the Vatican Museums to nuns trying to buy rosaries had to pay cash on Vatican property. In 2014, Francis created the first ever Secretariat for the Economy to try to unravel the mess. But the first head of that department was Cardinal George Pell, now appealing a child sex abuse conviction in Australia. Pell had announced the discovery of hundreds of millions of dollars that were not accounted for when he first took the job. He has not yet been replaced and doesn't look like he will return any time soon. It is little wonder that Francis has been left with no choice but to handle things first-hand if he ever hopes to clean up the Vatican\u2019s dirty money problems.", "description": "The pope fired the head of his security detail and called in a mafia prosecutor to get to the bottom of secret London apartments, and what happened to money in his charity fund.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571089336/191014-barbie-vatican-dirty-money-tease_qn1tf3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
