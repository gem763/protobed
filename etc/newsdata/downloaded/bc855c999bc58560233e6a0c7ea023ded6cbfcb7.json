The area off Mauritania and its neighbour Senegal in West Africa is one of the most-watched basins in the world for gas drilling and has attracted investments from companies such as Australia\u2019s Woodside Energy and BP. If exploited, such discoveries could transform the economies of both nations, bringing much-needed revenues. Kosmos had planned to sell down its interest in the Mauritania-Senegal basin by the end of the year, but it will extended its timeline to 2020, \u201cgiving potential bidders additional time to analyze the new data\u201d, the company said. The volume of gas potentially trapped in the area is equal to around 8.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which could make it one of the largest hydrocarbon discoveries in the world since Italy\u2019s Eni discovered the 30 tcf Zohr gas field offshore Egypt in 2015.", "description": "Oil and gas explorer Kosmos Energy said on Monday it had made one of the largest discoveries of natural gas in recent years in waters offshore Mauritania, where it sees the potential to extract 50 trillion cubic feet of gas.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
