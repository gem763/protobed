Immigration activists started boycotting the paper.", "language": "en", "text": "That complaint has grown into the latest clash over campus speech, with hundreds signing a petition demanding that the newspaper stop talking to ICE altogether \u2014 a movement that has left professional journalists and media ethics experts around the country aghast.\n\nIn a letter published by Crimson editors Angela N. Fu and Kristine E. Guillaume on Tuesday, the paper defended its work, noting that asking for comment is a standard journalism practice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe seek to follow a commonly accepted set of journalistic standards, similar to those followed by professional news organizations big and small,\u201d the editors said. \u201cForemost among those standards is the belief that every party named in a story has a right to comment or contest criticism leveled against them.\u201d\n\nThe battle started with a Sept. 12 protest hosted by the student-led organization Act on a Dream, which advocates for undocumented students and opposes the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. In its story the next day, the Crimson quoted student activists criticizing the federal immigration agency during the rally in front of the Memorial Church of Harvard University.\n\nOne line in the piece quickly drew ire from several student groups: \u201cICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this month, the paper\u2019s editors met with leaders from Act on a Dream to explain why the reporters had reached out to ICE and reassure the students that the Crimson had not shared any personal information with the federal agency.\n\nDays later, students from Act on a Dream and 10 other student groups urged their classmates to boycott the paper by refusing to return requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThe Crimson relies on the trust of student organizations to accurately and effectively report on events happening on campus,\u201d the groups said in their petition, which more than 670 people have signed as of early Wednesday. \u201cThey have violated that trust.\u201d\n\nThe critics\u2019 complained that undocumented students who spoke out at the protest might be targeted by ICE due to the Crimson\u2019s reporting. Immigration advocates have been arrested by the federal agency, and groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights say some of those cases were in retaliation for vocal opposition to ICE, which the agency denies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn social media, some students accused the Crimson of \u201cdoxing\u201d undocumented students by asking ICE for a response to the protest. Critics said the paper had \u201ccalled ICE on their fellow students\u201d and demanded the paper \u201ccut off any relationship with ICE.\u201d The petition called the request for comment \u201cvirtually the same as tipping them off.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper denies sharing any personal information with the federal agency.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear: In The Crimson\u2019s communication with ICE\u2019s media office, the reporters did not provide the names or immigration statuses of any individual at the protest,\u201d the Crimson editors wrote on Tuesday. \u201cWe did not give ICE forewarning of the protest, nor did we seek to interfere with the protest as it was occurring.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMedia ethics experts from the Student Press Law Center and the Society of Professional Journalists backed up the Crimson\u2019s actions. SPJ\u2019s Code of Ethics calls for reporters to \u201cdiligently seek subjects of news coverage to allow them to respond to criticisms or allegations of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe student groups who signed the petition did not immediately return a request for comment early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe dust-up has already had an effect on the Crimson\u2019s coverage. When reporters reached out to the Harvard College Democrats for Warren for comment on last week\u2019s Democratic debate, the group supporting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) refused to talk to the student journalists, it said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nAD\n\nRecently, The Crimson, a newspaper on campus, has begun the dangerous practice of calling ICE for comment on events... Posted by Harvard College Democrats for Warren on Tuesday, October 15, 2019\n\nThe Crimson\u2019s response on Tuesday to the on-campus rebukes has been bolstered by professional journalists and journalism professors.\n\n\u201cThis type of journalistic transparency and moral clarity, even in the face of criticism that may seem overbaked, is something all newsroom leaders can learn from,\u201d said New York Times reporter Astead W. Herndon, sharing a link to the Crimson\u2019s note on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nDenver Post senior enterprise editor Matt Sebastian called the controversy \u201cwild.\u201d Columbia Journalism School professor Bill Grueskin said the student paper\u2019s editor \u201chandled this perfectly\u201d in the note to readers. Doug Fisher, a former Associated Press correspondent who teaches journalism at the University of South Carolina, called the activists\u2019 criticism \u201ca fundamental, basic misunderstanding or a deliberate refusal to understand what journalists do and how they do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis type of journalistic transparency and moral clarity, even in the face of criticism that may seem overbaked, is something all newsroom leaders can learn from. Good on @krisguillaume https://t.co/oyj4FvWa8q \u2014 Steadman\u2122 (@AsteadWesley) October 23, 2019\n\nBut some of the Crimson\u2019s own staff have joined in the calls to stop contacting ICE for any story. Emily Romero, an associate editorial editor for the paper who says she is undocumented, tweeted her support of the protests and wrote that \u201cit pains me to feel unsafe in the building I have devoted countless hours to.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the editorial staff, Jessenia Class, wrote on Twitter that the paper\u2019s decision to continue reaching out to the subjects of stories for comment was disappointing and \u201cantithetical to our journalistic values of reporting with sensitivity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe student paper\u2019s editors argued requesting comment from ICE makes their coverage of immigration issues more thorough, fair and balanced.\n\n\u201cAt stake here, we believe, is one of the core tenets that defines America\u2019s free and independent press,\u201d Fu and Guillaume said Tuesday. \u201cA world where news outlets categorically refuse to contact certain kinds of sources \u2014 a world where news outlets let third-party groups dictate the terms of their coverage \u2014 is a less informed, less accurate, and ultimately less democratic world.\"\n\nAD", "description": "The student paper reached out to the federal agency for comment on an anti-ICE protest.
