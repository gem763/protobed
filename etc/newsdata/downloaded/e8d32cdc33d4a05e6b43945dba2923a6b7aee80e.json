It\u2019s an offhand comment, but it still feels like a big compliment coming from someone who has twice been named model of the year at the British Fashion awards, the woman who singlehandedly sold bushy brows to the masses, and who \u2013 for a time \u2013 was so conspicuous that you could barely pick up a magazine without said brows staring back at you. For her part, Delevingne looks laid-back yet pristine, the same way wealthy people do at airports \u2013 sequin top and impractical-for-most white trousers; smudgy, kohl-rimmed eyes that are just the right side of slept in; a loose French plait slung over one shoulder; \u201ccurated\u201d diamond piercings snaking up both ears. She chose her top because it was in the colours of the union jack but, come to think of it, she says, \u201cit could be the American flag couldn\u2019t it ... or, er, French?\u201d\n\nHowever, Delevingne quickly puts the kibosh on the fashion chat, because she is an actor, too \u2013 and seemingly in it for the long haul. Since 2015, the 27-year-old has been on a break from her first career, the one in which the privileged goddaughter of Joan Collins became an unexpectedly relatable icon, ushering in the now ubiquitous pizza-noshing, Insta-friendly model who\u2019s as likely to be talking about their mental health as they are jumping on a private jet (she once chartered Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s to fly from Austria to London).\n\nBut while she still has lucrative endorsements with the likes of Burberry, Delevingne\u2019s \u201cit girl\u201d days have given way to a new chapter. Having starred in Paper Towns \u2013 adapted from the hit young adult novel \u2013 space epic Valerian, and attention-deficit superhero romp Suicide Squad among other projects, she has showed her range and commitment to acting, even if the latter two films were widely panned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shot in -10C \u2026 Cara Delevingne and Orlando Bloom in Carnival Row. Photograph: Jan Thijs\n\nNow she\u2019s on to a new challenge, having landed her first starring role in a TV show, Amazon\u2019s Carnival Row. The series marries the growing trend for fantasy TV sagas with an appealing amount of Victoriana and a whodunnit subplot. Delevingne plays Vignette, a faerie exiled from her homeland who ends up at the bottom of an increasingly divided feudal society. Filming took place in Prague, in temperatures of \u201310C. \u201cIt really added to the dire situation in the show,\u201d Delevingne explains. \u201cPlus you get takes done quicker because it\u2019s just too cold!\u201d\n\nWe meet at a plush London hotel where the launch for the programme is taking place \u2013 PR execs, reporters, foreign press and other assorted people in suits buzzing around a corridor of elegant suites. Delevingne\u2019s here; her co-star Orlando Bloom \u2013 who plays the ornately named Rycroft Philostrate, Cockney detective and Vignette\u2019s love interest \u2013 is on his way. As soon as I ask a question she speaks for a minute, barely drawing breath, keen to show her competence \u2013 and perhaps to steer the conversation away from her much talked-about personal life.\n\nShe starts with an answer to my question: was she a fan of Game of Thrones, the biggest fantasy series of them all, and the one Carnival Row seems designed to ape? The answer is no (\u201cI didn\u2019t watch it at the time, and then when I got Carnival Row, I was like, that would be too much. So I just started watching Drag Race.\u201d) She doesn\u2019t wait for the next question, and instead, politely but firmly, explains why she wanted to play Vignette. \u201cI always get an instinct with characters, when I see the way their spirit is \u2026 I have to fight for the role and do everything I possibly can. And Vignette had this \u2013 as a woman she had this strength, [it] was unparalleled. But her strength was her vulnerability. No matter how much she gets knocked down or gets everything taken away from her, she still fights back.\u201d\n\nDelevingne then changes tack, speaking simply about the show\u2019s themes. \u201cI think the most important thing about it is the social commentary,\u201d she explains. \u201cI love the love story and the crime thriller, but I think it\u2019s so interesting to see when fantasy really tries to play a part in talking about life. It gives you a different perspective, and it gives people whomaybe want to be ignorant of certain things more of a view as to how things are.\u201d\n\nWhat she\u2019s primarily talking about is Vignette\u2019s status as a refugee, something she hopes will draw attention to the plight of many in the present. \u201cBecause of when it\u2019s set, it could fit the time, but why the hell is it happening now?\u201d she says, brow furrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing I want people to get from it.\u201d Indeed, while Carnival Row has A Lot Going On for any one series, the constant is a sense of injustice. Vignette is treated like an animal by her masters, the upper-class Spurnrose siblings, with the faeries forced into sex work and servitude.\n\nThough its politicians have names like Ritter Longerbane and Nigel Winetrout, the issues they\u2019re debating \u2013 immigration and identity \u2013 are straight out of 2019. \u201cFantasy should allow you to escape into another world, but I also think that if you\u2019re able to escape into a place where you can have a different perspective, why not lay on things people need to talk about in a way that\u2019s not as intense as a documentary?\u201d\n\nModelling isn\u2019t fulfilling. A lot of the time, you don\u2019t get your voice heard. I didn\u2019t. Or maybe I didn\u2019t have one\n\nDelevingne\u2019s seemingly in control of herself and her career, but how easy has it been to get people to take her seriously as an actor? \u201cI like to make people laugh, so I think people have always found it hard to take me seriously,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m very professional, I work extremely hard and also I like the fact that people were questioning my talent. Because to be honest, I like having to prove myself to people, you know. I don\u2019t want an easy ride.\u201d\n\nBesides, she says, modelling \u201cisn\u2019t fulfilling, it\u2019s not! Especially when a lot of the time, you don\u2019t get your voice heard. I didn\u2019t in so many ways. Or maybe I didn\u2019t have one, or I didn\u2019t have the confidence to feel like I had one. I always wanted to be an actor. That was always something I knew since I was a kid. Dreams don\u2019t always come true, but they did.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s bordering on earnestness. Surely there must be downsides to the job \u2013 Suicide Squad received a two-star review from the Observer, for example. \u201cReviews just ruin the process for me,\u201d she says, looking bored. \u201cPeople take what they want from it but also generally people love to critique things and I get that, that\u2019s the way the world is. But it just doesn\u2019t help me as a person, unless it\u2019s constructive, which I love. But I\u2019d rather have that from people I know and respect.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Superhero romp \u2026 third left, as Enchantress in Suicide Squad. Photograph: Clay Enos/Warner Bros\n\nSimilarly, she\u2019s uninterested in whatever new gossip abounds about her personal life, which has ranged from dating Harry Styles back in the day, to, er, purchasing a \u00a3400 leather sex bench with her current girlfriend, actor Ashley Benson (before Benson, she dated the musician St Vincent).\n\n\u201cThose things just fog your mind, you don\u2019t need that kind of stuff in your life,\u201d she says of the press coverage. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even go and look at nice [articles] because I think that\u2019s also blowing smoke up your arse, too. You have to feel that in yourself and not worry about other people.\u201d\n\nDoes she think that being in a same-sex relationship might have heightened the media scrutiny around her and Benson, whom \u2013 if the latest headlines are to believed \u2013 she married in secret earlier this year? \u201cI don\u2019t know, but if there\u2019s any sense of raising awareness for young girls or anyone to see relationships in a way where they\u2019re like, that\u2019s a possibility, then that\u2019s great. But at the same time, I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d Either way, these days she has a comfortable attitude to her sexual fluidity and queerness \u2013 a far cry from when Harvey Weinstein told her that she would never get ahead in the industry if she was seen with a woman.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Delevingne with partner Ashley Benson in New York. Photograph: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for The Trevor Project\n\nFittingly, that\u2019s the most Delevingne will give away about her personal life. These days, she\u2019s here to act, and maybe to get behind the camera, too. \u201cI wanted to go to AFI and do cinematography,\u201d she says, referring to the American Film Institute, whose alumni include Andrea Arnold and David Lynch. \u201cI\u2019ll spend time on set and just sit with the director when I\u2019m not shooting. Maybe I\u2019ll do an internet course instead, if that\u2019s a thing.\u201d\n\nCarnival Row has already been commissioned for a second series, but her next release will be a movie with Jaden Smith, Life in a Year, in which she plays a dying teenager. Filming it was, she says, \u201cone of the best experiences ever. I think with these last couple of roles I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s definitely been a lot more heavy and \u2026 depthful, is that a word? Deep, I mean.\u201d She smiles, momentarily adopting her trademark cross-eyed pose. She might be a serious actor these days, but you get the sense that Cara Delevingne still quite enjoys being a goofball.\n\n\u2022 Carnival Row is available on Prime Video.", "description": "Her eyebrows launched 1,000 photoshoots but now the top model is making it big on screen \u2013 as an exiled faerie in a fantasy thriller opposite Orlando Bloom", "authors": ["Hannah J Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31af10e584ed49a162958792fcd2d6d83bcde466/0_985_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7cec56829d6d22b31198a87e2304d83f"}
