Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. [nL2N26I1N4]\n\nTrump, in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday evening, said he wanted to \u201cmeet\u201d the whistleblower, who he called \u201cmy accuser,\u201d as well as \u201cthe person who illegally gave this information\u201d to the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d wrote Trump, who added without providing evidence, \u201cI want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s identity has not been made public.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call came shortly after the United States froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, prompting concern that the president was using the taxpayer money approved by Congress as leverage for his personal political gain.\n\nThe complaint said White House lawyers directed that an electronic summary of the call be moved from the place where such things are usually kept to a separate electronic system reserved for classified and especially sensitive material - a move Democrats have called part of a cover-up.\n\n\u201cIf those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there\u2019s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes we\u2019re determined to find out,\u201d Schiff said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nSchiff did not say whether he plans to subpoena that information. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe intelligence committee has reached an agreement with the whistleblower to appear before the panel, Schiff told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Schiff said he hoped the whistleblower would appear very soon.\n\nMark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, wrote on Twitter that the legal team was working with both parties in Congress and \u201cwe understand all agree protecting whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount.\u201d Zaid said no agreement has been reached and no date has been set for the whistleblower\u2019s \u201ccontact\u201d with Congress.\n\nIn addition, a letter from Andrew Bakaj, another lawyer for the whistleblower, informed Joseph Maguire, the top U.S. intelligence official, of \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the individual\u2019s safety after receiving threats, and expressed appreciation for \u201cappropriate resources\u201d provided by Maguire\u2019s office.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a joint news conference after their meeting in Helsinki, Finland, July 16, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nThe Ukraine scandal arose just months after Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that concluded that Moscow waged a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. Mueller\u2019s investigative report, released in redacted form in April, laid out numerous contacts between Russian officials and Trump\u2019s campaign, but found insufficient evidence to determine that a criminal conspiracy had taken place.\n\n\u2018DEEP STATE OPERATIVE\u2019\n\nTrump has defended his phone call with Zelenskiy and called the whistleblower a \u201cpolitical hack.\u201d\n\nWhite House adviser Stephen Miller took up the attack on Sunday, accusing the whistleblower of being part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d government conspiracy against Trump.\n\n\u201cI know the difference between a whistleblower and a \u2018deep state\u2019 operative. This is a \u2018deep state\u2019 operative pure and simple,\u201d Miller told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is the whistleblower. And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,\u201d Miller added.\n\nTrump\u2019s former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, in a break with the president, called himself \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, and not just because the president sought assistance in getting political dirt on Biden.\n\nBossert voiced concern that Trump also asked Zelenskiy to investigate the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which looked into the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016 and helped lead American intelligence to conclude that Russia had done it, as well as the location of a Democratic server.\n\nBossert, who resigned from his post last year, said Trump was referring to \u201ca debunked conspiracy theory that somehow Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic emails in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly believe this president has not gotten his pound of flesh yet from past grievances on the 2016 investigation. ... If he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down,\u201d Bossert told \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nSchiff said Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani appeared to lay the foundation for Trump\u2019s call to Zelenskiy through his efforts to encourage Ukrainian authorities to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters he met Ukrainian officials in Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year as he pushed for the investigation but said Trump did not pay his expenses for the trips. [nL2N26K098]\n\nSchiff told ABC his committee would decide whether to have Giuliani testify after the investigation fleshes out details of his involvement.\n\nGiuliani said on Sunday he would testify only with Trump\u2019s approval.\n\nFILE PHOTO - U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (R-CA) talks to reporters after testimony from Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire about the handling of the whistleblower complaint on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019.
