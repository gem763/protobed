USA TODAY\n\nAbout 25,000 Chicago Public Schools teachers are on strike Thursday morning, upending plans for hundreds of thousands of families and about 400,000 students in the nation's third-largest city.\n\nChicago Teachers Union members were positioned to strike starting at 6:30 a.m. outside their respective schools. Per orders from CPS, buildings remained open on a normal bell schedule for children to attend \u2014 staffed by administrators and other non-union employees. Meals were to be served, but with no teachers with classes canceled.\n\nAn additional 7,500 school support staff were also expected to be missing, joining teachers on the picket lines in their own strike for a new contract.\n\nAbout 2,500 Chicago Park District workers initially planned to join the walkout with teachers and school staff workers, but their bargaining unit on Wednesday announced they'd reached an agreement with City Hall.\n\nSchool closed: What to know about the Chicago teachers strike\n\nAs for the teachers, the long-anticipated work stoppage is drawing attention to what labor leaders say is a failure to reach a fair contract with the city that defines and funds more support staff in the form of nurses, librarians, counselors and school psychologists. Union leaders say they also want enforceable limits on class sizes, which have swelled to the high 30s and mid-40s in some schools.\n\nBut Mayor Lori Lightfoot reiterated Wednesday that the deal on the table was the best in the history of the Chicago Teachers Union \u2014 it offers a 16% raise for teachers and would raise the pay of the average support staff worker by 38% over the life of the contract, she said. Lightfoot said management has made more than 80 changes to the proposal and \"bent over backwards\" to meet the union's requests.\n\nCPS-CTU NEGOTIATIONS: Mayor Lightfoot and CPS CEO Dr. Jackson holding a brief media availability on CPS/CTU negotiations. https://t.co/3D9X8cdTnp \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cSince Friday, we\u2019ve discussed a framework that puts enforceable targets on class sizes in high-poverty schools and staffing level supports for personnel in the contract,\" she said in a press conference Wednesday. \"The union said that these were its two most important issues. They wanted us to put it in writing, and that\u2019s exactly what we did.\u201d\n\nLightfoot said the union's total requests would add an additional $2.5 billion to the CPS annual budget, which she called \"completely irresponsible.\"\n\nLightfoot proposed a $7.7 billion district budget in August, up about $117 million from the 2019 budget.\n\nChicago's children are 'deserving' of educational equity\n\nUnion leaders have contested the salary figures in the contract proposal, saying the average teacher salary would be closer to $85,000, not $100,000. They say that other critical demands have not been inserted into the contract language, such as a commitment to put a nurse in every school. They also want the contract to address other issues that affect the city's students, such as affordable housing.\n\nMembers of CTU and SEIU march in downtown Chicago on Oct. 14, 2019.

They could think about the issues and make up their own minds about who and what to support.\n\nInside the classroom: We followed 15 of America's teachers on a day of frustrations, pressures and hard-earned victories\n\nHe said teachers in Chicago believe their children deserve the same equitable supports in schools that children are receiving in suburban Chicago, especially since CPS is receiving more state money this year because of a 2017 change in the state's education funding formula.\n\n\"We don't understand the response that this is not financially feasible,\" he said. \"We see the money there, and we think our children are as deserving of it as anyone else's children. That's why you see such a passionate confrontation here.\"\n\nWhere will Chicago's children be during the strike?\n\nWhile CPS students can attend their normal school or any other age-appropriate building during the strike, many community sites and nonprofits are preparing to offer child care Thursday.\n\nUnlike attending a school building, most of those community options involve a fee.\n\nActivities range from a day camp at Shedd Aquarium for about $100 per day to a \"Schools Day Out\" program at YMCA sites located near public schools, which costs between $35 to about $60 per day.\n\nMan-Yee Lee, spokeswoman for the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago, said the centers offer the same program to families of kids ages 5 to 12 when the public schools are off for other reasons, such as federal and state holidays.\n\n\"But there is an element of emergency and surprise to this one, because we've only known for a couple of weeks that this was actually going to happen,\" she said.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
