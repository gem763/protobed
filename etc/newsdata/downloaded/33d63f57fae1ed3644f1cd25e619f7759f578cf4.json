(Lisette Poole)\n\n\n\nMarta, center, and Liset, not pictured, are taken with other migrants to a processing station after being picked up by migration officials in Peru. (Lisette Poole)\n\nPhotographer Lisette Poole\u2019s first book, \u201cLa Paloma y la ley\u201d (Red Hook, 2019), is an extraordinary tale of two Cuban women\u2019s dream of leaving their homeland and making it to the United States. The bilingual book, whose title translates to \u201cThe Dove and the Law,\u201d also contains several long-form essays. The two women, Marta and Liset, embarked on this journey in May 2016 with no plan. The only thing they had as they set out was the name of a smuggler scribbled on a piece of paper.\n\nLiset and Marta had hoped to arrive in the United States before the end of the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy.\n\nAs Poole notes in the introduction to her book:\n\n[The policy was] the informal name given to a 1995 revision of the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which essentially stated that anyone who emigrated from Cuba and entered the United States would be allowed to pursue residency a year later. ... In 1995, the Clinton administration created \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d in response to a mass departure the year before that became known as the Cuban Rafter Crisis. ... The policy stated that the U.S. would send home any Cuban caught on the waters between the two countries \u2014 wet feet \u2014 while those who made it to shore \u2014 dry feet \u2014 could remain in the United States.\n\nIn 2017, the year after Marta and Liset\u2019s journey began, President Obama ended the policy.\n\nPoole followed the women on a significant portion of their journey. Dressed as a migrant, she went along with them for 51 days, traversing 13 countries and 10 borders. The odyssey, as the photos so viscerally show, was harrowing and exhausting. It included six grueling days in the infamous \u201cDarien Gap,\u201d a roadless stretch of jungle between Colombia and Panama.\n\nPoole told me she moved to Cuba in 2014, planning to stay only six months while working on projects, but ended up staying much longer than that after Cuba and the United States began to renew relations. She covered this news for publications around the world but felt there was something missing from all the coverage \u2014 mainly the fact that \u201cCubans were leaving the island in record numbers.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Poole met Marta through one of her friends. When Marta told Poole that she wanted to leave Cuba, Poole asked if she could tag along, and Marta agreed. After eight months of getting to know each other, Marta called Poole one day in 2016 and said she was getting ready to make the journey and asked: \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d\n\nPoole left with them on May 16, 2016.\n\n\u201cThey would travel through Guyana, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, then through the Darien Gap for six days. Eventually I would follow Liset until she crossed the border into Texas, 51 days after she left Cuba. Marta would get to the U.S. shortly after,\u201d Poole said. \u201cThe final chapter of the book shows the last three years of their lives in the United States. The last photo in the book was taken in January of this year.\u201d\n\nTime magazine\u2019s Karl Vick captures just how extraordinary Poole\u2019s endeavor was in the foreword to the book:\n\nWhat she fashioned from her reportage makes most news stories about migration feel as dry and removed as a UN report. The book is part travel journal, part photo essay, and wholly unique. It feels both lived-in and entirely fresh. The field notes double as poetry; the drama is real life. ... The book adds ticket stubs, assorted currency, chicken receipts, Western Union slips, and, at the start of every chapter, a map that tracks the route the way an airplane hop-scotches the globe in \u201cCasablanca.\u201d\n\nVick exhorts the reader to take their time and examine the book closely, because \u201cI believe you\u2019ll find it authentic.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nYou can find out more about Poole on her website.\n\n\n\nMarta and Liset, right, check their phones after arriving in Lima before dawn.
