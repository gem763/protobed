I like the wide mouth and the contact on the side.\n\nHowever I cannot give it 5* because of the cap. It is not perfectly closing, especially with hot liquid. Or you have to twist very hard which in return means it will be tough to open. Second complain, it keeps stuff cold for a long time but the hot stuff not so much. I like hot tea but even boiling water does not stay that way very long. I would 4-6h before it is just warm... My sigg in comparison is all bumped but still keeps it warm a solid 12h min up to 16 sometimes.\n\nNow I know, I manage which one I take and I love this one for travel and office work, going to the gym. For a long day, not so much if I want hot stuff to remain hot.\n\nI like the choice of colors as it is sad when you have to choose between white or black...\n\nVery good overall and I would recommend it knowing its limits.", "description": "Buy the Hydro Flask 18oz Wide Mouth Water Bottle online or shop all  from Backcountry.com.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://content.backcountry.com/images/items/large/HYF/HYF0015/CT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
