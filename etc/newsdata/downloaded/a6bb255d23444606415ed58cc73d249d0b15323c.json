It is the state's official blueprint for future energy generation, including things like projected electricity demand, cost estimates, and from what sources power will be generated, for the next decade.\n\nBusiness Day first reported on the mistake. On Friday a spokesperson for the department of energy said she was not aware that the gazetted version was incorrect, but confirmed the version sent to journalists was correct.\n\n\n\nThe correct version was subsequently gazetted later on Friday, with a note saying it replaced the previous version.\n\nThe key difference between the two versions of the plan appears to be in a paragraph describing plans for nuclear energy.\n\nThe initial gazetted version of the IRP states that government will \"immediately commence the nuclear build programme to the extent of 2500MW\".\n\nIn the corrected later version, the word \"immediately\" is removed. The paragraph has been changed to government will \"commence preparations for a nuclear build programme to the extent of 2500MW at a pace and scale that the country can afford\".", "description": "A wrong version of the Integrated Resource Plan was published on Friday morning.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8486/f3d8e4a54b534176bd21c0004746bb81.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
