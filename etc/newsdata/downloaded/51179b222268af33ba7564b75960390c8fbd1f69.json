He has been a brilliant, talented minister and a fantastic MP.\n\n\"The PM, as both a politician and brother, understands this will not have been an easy matter for Jo. The constituents of Orpington could not have asked for a better representative.\"\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson's resignation - following the removal of the Tory whip from 21 MPs this week for supporting moves to prevent a no-deal Brexit - showed \"unbelievable timing\".\n\nShe added that Mr Johnson was \"understood to be upset about the purge of colleagues\".\n\nFormer cabinet minister David Gauke, one of the MPs who lost the Conservative whip, tweeted: \"Lots of MPs have had to wrestle with conflicting loyalties in recent weeks. None more so than Jo. This is a big loss to Parliament, the government and the Conservative Party.\"\n\nLabour MP Wes Streeting tweeted: \"Whatever our disagreements, I very much respect Jo's integrity and always appreciated his decency and courtesy in our discussions on higher education policy. The Conservative Party is losing too many One Nation Tories.\"\n\nMr Johnson appeared at several of his brother's campaign events during the Conservative Party leadership contest.\n\nIn 2013, Boris Johnson predicted Jo Johnson was himself \"very likely\" to become prime minister, telling The Australian newspaper: \"He'd be brilliant.\"\n\nAt the last general election, Jo Johnson held the Orpington seat by a 19,461 majority.\n\nHe is expected to stand down at the next general election, rather than leaving Parliament immediately and prompting a by-election.", "description": "Jo Johnson, the younger brother of the prime minister, says he is \"torn between family and national interest\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/134E/production/_108624940_e074632c-24af-4f59-a474-53606b340c76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
