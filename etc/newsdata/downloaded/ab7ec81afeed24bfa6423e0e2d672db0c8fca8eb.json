Embarrassed to have my name associated with it.\"\n\nAnd he wasn't content with just stopping there, as he later expanded on his disappointment to Newsweek, explaining: \"I felt degraded and dehumanised after I left the theatre.\n\n\"Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it, and today that's an unfortunate message.\n\n\"That film is typical of ultra-violent 1970s exploitation 'grindhouse' films, the technique of which Rambo: Last Blood resembles. The sets here look cheap. The direction is awkward.\n\n\"Rambo could be called John Smith, and the film wouldn't change,\" he added. \"It assumes the audience is familiar with Rambo's background, whereas anyone under 40 will wonder what on Earth is going on with those tunnels.\"", "description": "\"I felt I was less a human being for having seen it.\"", "authors": ["Joe Anderton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.8Kv1dwAcG4LaSd33jTWaA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_spy_281/253404e83e20ae2b659d11948360cf6f", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
