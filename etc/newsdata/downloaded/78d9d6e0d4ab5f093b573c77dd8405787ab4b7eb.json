Friends is, after all, the franchise that prompted Netflix to pay a rumoured $100m in order to keep it on its catalogue for at least another year. Now, a pop-up devoted to the show has opened in New York City to mark the anniversary of the show's premiere.\n\nTucked away in Soho, the exhibition advertises an immersive experience with set recreations, photo opportunities, and even a trip to the iconic Central Perk \u2013 such tantalising promises that tickets for the pop-up sold out within three hours. We checked it out just a few hours before its opening.\n\nIt all begins with a giant photo of the cast in the show\u2019s early days. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, we met six vibrant 20-somethings whose lives and loves were intimately entwined,\u201d a nearby sign reads. \u201c... For 10 seasons they welcomed us into their world. Welcome back. Take a seat on the couch. You\u2019re among Friends.\u201d Cheesy, yes, but also cute. Then, there\u2019s a reproduction of an early ticket to a taping of Friends Like Us, the show\u2019s original working title, which transports us back to May 1994 when the pilot was shot, and just like that, we\u2019re off.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat follows is the first of several displays acknowledging and celebrating the show\u2019s culture. It\u2019s a large wall celebrating the best known \u201cFriends-isms\u201d, which is to say, those words and phrases that immediately transport you back to specific plotlines on the series (\u201cShe\u2019s your lobster\u201d, \u201cWe were on a break\u201d, \u201cThis is all a moo point\u201d, \u201cTransponster\u201d, and the list goes on.) Visitors then continue one to a pair of orange couches, on which multicoloured umbrellas are resting \u2013 an invitation to sit down and have fun recreating the show\u2019s opening credits. It\u2019s a touch gimmicky, but this is the Instagram age, after all.\n\nThe next corner is where things get really interesting. Here, fans are greeted with more than 50 original props from the show, all preserved under glass cases. There\u2019s Ross\u2019s Science Boy comic \u2013 the one Phoebe saved after mugging him on the street when they were both children. There\u2019s Rachel\u2019s sonogram from when she got pregnant with Emma, as well as her infamously long \u201clet\u2019s get back together\u201d letter to Ross, which he pretends to have read in season four. There\u2019s Ross\u2019s Spudnik helmet, which he wears in a Halloween episode in season eight. There\u2019s the outfit he wears on that ill-fated season-five date, when he removes his leather pants in the bathroom and can\u2019t pull them back up. There\u2019s the Geller cup, that troll-like contraption Ross and Monica fight over in season three. There\u2019s the red sweater that dramatically reveals the identity of Rachel\u2019s baby\u2019s father in season eight. There\u2019s Monica\u2019s chef outfit and the giant sunglasses she dons after stuffing her head inside a turkey to appease Chandler. There\u2019s Chandler\u2019s hypnosis tape, which he uses in an attempt to quit smoking, as well as the \u201cbest bud bracelet\u201d Joey gives Chandler in season two. It\u2019s great to see it all in one place and to be reminded of the many moments that have helped turned a simple sitcom into a worldwide phenomenon. On the walls, signs remind viewers of each character\u2019s evolution throughout the series, as well as the history of some of the series\u2019s most emblematic pairings (Ross and Rachel, Joey and Chandler). A handy chart also traces each character\u2019s romantic relationships, joining two separate lines into one to mark Chandler and Monica\u2019s marriage as well as Ross and Rachel\u2019s bouts of dating.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 8,500-square-foot exhibit space also includes set replicas, meaning you can peek through the iconic purple door, complete with a golden frame around the peephole, relax on the Central Perk sofa, or sit in a recliner at the centre of Joey and Chandler\u2019s living room. Those replicas are a mix of reproductions \u2013 the reclining chairs, for example, are not originals \u2013 and actual props \u2013 such as Hugsy, Joey\u2019s cherished stuffed penguin - displayed inside a glass case. Sure, it would be even more impressive to walk amongst the show\u2019s actual set, but there are enough real elements for the experience to feel satisfying.\n\nThere is, in fact, an actual coffee counter where visitors can order drinks and pastries, some of which were inspired by specific episodes. For example, Ross\u2019s \u201cmini blueberry bribe muffin basket\u201d calls to mind the season five episodes in which he tries to lay a claim on his neighbour\u2019s soon-to-be-vacated apartment thanks to the power of baked goods, while Rachel\u2019s \u201coops I dropped the cheesecake\u201d refers to the season seven episode in which she and Chandler eat a couple of stolen cheesecakes after a delivery error.\n\nIt all ends, naturally, with a souvenir shop where fans can procure themed merchandise, and the range includes pretty much everything from T-shirts to Christmas ornaments and oven mitts. You can visit the store even if you haven\u2019t scored a ticket to the exhibit, by the way, via a separate entrance on Broadway. But the most interesting part of the pop-up remains inside, somewhere between Rachel\u2019s beloved seashell lamp and Joey\u2019s Soapie trophy. That\u2019s where you\u2019re transported back to the time you watched Friends for the first time, be that in your childhood or your adolescence. That\u2019s where you remember why you keep enjoying that show despite mounting evidence that it was anything but perfect. That\u2019s where the nostalgia lies.\n\nThe \u2018Friends\u2019 pop-up is open in New York City until 6 October, 2019.
