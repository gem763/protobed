As a co-sponsor of H.R. 5087, introduced in the House last year, she is publicly acknowledging her belief that removing certain weapons would be a fruitful and productive step in the fight against gun violence.\n\nBut as David French noted at National Review at the time the bill was introduced: \u201cWe know it would burden the self-defense rights of law-abiding Americans without meaningfully addressing the problems it\u2019s purportedly designed to address. We know it wouldn\u2019t affect overall gun death rates. We don\u2019t have evidence it would prevent mass shootings.\u201d With her stance on assault weapons, Gabbard blends in seamlessly with other leftists and their ideas concerning gun control.\n\nGabbard may seem more down to earth than Sanders, but when it comes to funding higher education, she is fully on board with his ultra-left plan.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kimberly Ross", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Why-Conservatives-Should-Stop-Being-Cheerleaders-For-Tulsi-Gabbard"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
