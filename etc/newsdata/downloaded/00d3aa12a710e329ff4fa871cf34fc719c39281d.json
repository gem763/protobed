Joevin Jones picked it up in the right side of the penalty area, crossed a target ball toward the far post, and Torres - in his second game back from a 10-game suspension - ran onto it at the top of the 6-yard box. His header ricocheted off the turf and into the left side of the net past goalkeeper Vito Nannone.\n\nTorres was suspended for 10 games at the start of August for violating the MLS substance abuse policy. The defender returned to action as a late-game substitute last Sunday in a 1-0 victory at San Jose and got the starting call Sunday.\n\nMinnesota nearly tied it in the 40th minute. Ethan Finlay picked up an errant pass by Brad Smith and streaked toward the goal, one-on-one against goalkeeper Stefan Frei. Finlay\u2019s shot from directly behind the penalty spot banged off the left post and bounced away.\n\nIn the 74th minute, Finlay sent a dangerous cross through the 6-yard box, but it zipped past Mason Toye before he could get a foot to it.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Roman Torres scored in the 29th minute and the Seattle Sounders beat Minnesota United 1-0 on Sunday in the regular-season finale to finish second in the Western Conference.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Moschetti"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/mls_united_sounders_soccer_42929_c0-112-2698-1685_s1770x1032.jpg?830f7e2a66d78ef64725aec0c2cd69223c1af309", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
