The judge added that verdicts in these types of cases often result in debates about the meaning of the outcome.\n\n\u201cA trial is at best a limited way to get to the truth,\u201d said Judge Drain. \u201cThere are trials where people stand up and say \u2018I did it.\u2019 But that mostly happens on Perry Mason,\u201d he said, referring to the popular books and TV series from the 1950s and \u201860s featuring a lawyer who won virtually every case.\n\nThe hearing was centered around how much members of the Sackler family should be held accountable for the role Purdue Pharma played in the crisis.\n\nThis decision does not mean that a tentative settlement struck between the company and about half the states in a New York bankruptcy filing last month would become a final agreement.\n\nState attorneys general are evenly divided over whether to accept terms offered by Purdue to settle some 2,600 claims against it. About half of them say the proposed deal is too lenient to family members who siphoned billions out of their privately held company and stashed much of it overseas.\n\nLast week, the attorneys general filed court papers contesting the firm's tentative agreement to settle thousands of opioid-crisis lawsuits. The confederation of AGs claim the settlement doesn't include an admission of wrongdoing from the Sacklers, wouldn't stop family members from future misconduct and would not force them to repay money. \"They pocketed from their illegal conduct,\" the filing stated, \"If the States accepted the offer, there would never be a trial to determine the Sacklers' liability for one of the greatest public health crises of our time.\"\n\nThe biggest bombshell in the court papers was that Purdue funneled up to $13 billion to the Sackler family over an unspecified period of time.\n\nThe litigation has 24 states participating and there are over 2,600 lawsuits against the privately-held company - and its owners, the Sackler family -for their part in the opioid crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, from 1999 to 2017, more than 702,000 people have died from a drug overdose. Of those deaths, almost 68 percent involved a prescription or illicit opioid.\n\n\u201cA trial is at best a limited way to get to the truth.\" - U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in hearing where he halted lawsuits aganist Purdue Pharma\n\nThe Stamford, Conn.-based company has agreed to advance $200 million to battle the opioid crisis within six months in exchange for a pause on litigation against family members who own the company.\n\nPurdue\u2019s signature painkiller, OxyContin, made it the biggest name in a case that consolidated the hundreds of lawsuits by local governments, Native American tribes and other entities under a federal judge in Cleveland. That trial will begin on schedule, starting Oct. 21, after two efforts to delay it were downed by the Cincinnati-based Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost argued that it should not proceed because states - not local governments - possess the sole authority to file such lawsuits on behalf of their citizens.\n\nPurdue is one of five pharmaceutical companies that has settled with Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga and Summit counties to avoid the trial. The latest was Johnson & Johnson, and its Janssen Pharmaceutical subsidiary, which reached a deal worth more than $20 million on Oct. 1.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nNo longer part of the Cleveland case, Purdue and the Sackler family are hoping to resolve all lawsuits against them through the bankruptcy process. Sackler family members face hundreds of lawsuits in state courts, including about two dozen brought by state attorneys general. The biggest immediate question looming over the bankruptcy case is whether the judge will allow those cases to proceed.\n\nA ruling in favor of the attorneys general -- who want to push forward with their lawsuits --\n\ncould imperil the tentative settlement. Members of the Sackler family would give up control of Purdue under that proposal, and the company would continue to operate as a trust with all profits going into the settlement.\n\nTwenty-four states and lawyers representing local governments have agreed to the proposed deal, while another 24 states and more than 500 local and tribal governments oppose it. Two states, Kentucky and Oklahoma, have previously settled lawsuits with Purdue.\n\nCourt filings from Purdue say that, if the separate lawsuits against members of the Sackler family are allowed to go ahead, it could mean the family would not be willing or able to pay the money it has committed to the settlement.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Purdue Pharma scored a major victory in court as cases against company halted for six months.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/oxy-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
