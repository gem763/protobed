On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake \u2014 the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan \u2014 struck the T\u014dhoku region, subsequently triggering powerful aftershocks and a massive tsunami which left over 15,000 people dead and melted three reactors at Fukushima.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the government is waiting on a report from nuclear experts before it decides what to do about its growing collection of nuclear waste.\n\nTEPCO has said it will run out of space to store the contaminated water by 2022, though it is unclear how much water Harada is proposing dumping out to sea.\n\nLocal fisherman groups are strongly opposed to the plan, which could impact the sales of their fish from the region due to public concerns over contamination.\n\nStorage tanks for radioactive water are seen at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, Japan February 18, 2019.

Here's how it compares with Fukushima and Three Mile Island.\n\nAccording to the Japan Times, nuclear plants located along the coastline regularly dump contaminated water into the ocean which contains tritium, a hydrogen isotope that is difficult to separate and is considered relatively harmless. But TEPCO admitted last year that its contaminated water contains contaminated particles other than tritium, according to the Japan Times, which has fueled concerns.\n\nAccording to the BBC, scientists have said the move would pose a low risk. More than 200 tons of contaminated water is pumped out of the damaged reactor buildings every day, it added.\n\nGreenpeace slammed early discussion of the move in January, saying dumping the contaminants \"was motivated by short-term cost-cutting, not protection of the Pacific Ocean environment and of the health and livelihoods of communities along the Fukushima coast.\"\n\nSouth Korea has also criticized its neighbor's proposal, as tensions between the two nations continue to simmer. Last month, South Korea summoned a Japanese diplomat to discuss the plan, and the South Korean government has signaled that dumping the contaminants would worsen relations, according to the BBC.\n\nOn Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors discussed nuclear safety in Vienna, where representatives from both Japan and South Korea continued to trade barbs over the plan, according to Japan's national broadcaster NHK.", "description": "Local fisherman groups, environmental groups, and even neighboring South Korea have slammed the plan because of the risks it poses to the region.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7895fef4fc247c1a0227db-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
