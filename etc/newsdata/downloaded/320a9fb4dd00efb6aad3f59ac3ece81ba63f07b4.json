The law allows U.S. citizens to sue foreign firms and Cuban entities over their use of properties expropriated after Cuba's 1959 revolution.\n\nThe administration activated the long-dormant law for another reason - as part of a campaign to pile pressure on Cuba to reform and drop its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Miami-based law firm Rivero Mestre argues that Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport was expropriated from the father of Jose Ramon Lopez Regueiro in 1959.\n\nThe \u201cdefendants have trafficked in or benefited from ongoing, unlawful trafficking in the Airport, by arriving and departing the Airport and using its facilities for cargo and passenger transport,'' the court filing reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJos\u00e9 Ramon L\u00f3pez Regueiro speaks during a news conference in in Coral Gables, Fla. Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2019. Rivero Mestre LLC filed a Helms-Burton Act lawsuit on behalf of Jos\u00e9 Ramon L\u00f3pez Regueiro against American Airlines and LATAM Airlines Group Expand\n\n\u201cWhat we seek to recover is the value of the airport times three,\u201d attorney Andr\u00e9s Rivero, who is handling the case, said. Rivero estimates the current value of the airport as \u201capproaching 1 billion,\u201d which means Regueiro could potentially receive up to $3 billion.\n\n\u201cI have had to wait 60 years, unfortunately. But at the end, there will be justice.\u201d Jose Ramon Lopez Regueiro\n\nL\u00f3pez Regueiro, 66, said his family\u2019s properties were taken \u201cviolently\u201d and his family was never compensated but rather \u201cdefamed.\u201d He departed Cuba for Holland in 1989, and then moved to Spain, where he worked in construction. He settled in Miami in 2009 and is now retired.\n\n\u201cI have had to wait 60 years, unfortunately,\u201d L\u00f3pez Regueiro said during a news conference, \u201cBut at the end, there will be justice.\u201d\n\nAmerican Airlines said in a statement it would review the lawsuit in detail and \u201cvigorously defend (its) service to Cuba, and added, \u201cAmerican Airlines' service to Cuba including Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport in Havana is authorized by the U.S. government,'' it said. \u201cIn addition, (this law) specifically exempts lawful travel, which is what American provides.''\n\nA spokesman in Chile for Latam, South America\u2019s largest airline, did not respond to a request for comment. There is no precedent for these kinds of cases, which means it remains unclear how these lawsuits will fare in the courts.\n\nThere also is a question of how plaintiffs could collect the proceeds if they win a case against foreign firms because many countries have implemented laws blocking the Helms Burton Act\u2019s implementation.\n\nHavana-based diplomats and consultants claim the lawsuits are worsening Cuba's business climate and putting off future investors.\n\nSome analysts say U.S. courts could determine that the travel these companies facilitate is actually tourism, thereby violating the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba.\n\nIn August, U.S. courts declined U.S. cruise line Carnival's request for the dismissal of a separate lawsuit over its alleged trafficking in Cuban docks.\n\nThis suggests that these lawsuits could carry increasing weight as they are filed.\n\n\"If more airlines are sued, some of the smaller ones may leave Cuba or change airports - presuming other airports are not subject to claims,'' said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. \"There are fifty-one airlines serving Havana.''\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSome analysts say the Trump administration could also be seeking to win over the influential Cuban-American community in the swing state of Florida ahead of the November 2020 presidential election.
