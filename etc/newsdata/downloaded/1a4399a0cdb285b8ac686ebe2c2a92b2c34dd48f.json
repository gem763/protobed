Travis \"Lefty\" Patterson, a U-2 pilot, said at an Air Force event in New York City in May.\n\n\"It's effectively a giant wet film camera,\" about the size of a projector screen, that fits in the belly of the aircraft and carries 10,500 feet of film, Patterson said during a panel discussion about the U-2 and its mission.\n\nThe camera has improved greatly since the 1950s. \"What we can do with that, for instance, in about eight hours, we can take off and we can map the entire state of California,\" Patterson said. \"The fidelity is such that if somebody is holding a newspaper out ... you can probably read the headlines.\"\n\nUS Air Force Senior Airman Charlie Lorenzo loads test film into an onboard camera for a test in preparation for a U-2 mission at a base in Southwest Asia, April 17, 2008.

Matt \"Top\" Nauman, also a U-2 pilot, said at the event.\n\n'Just a sensor'\n\n99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron airmen prepare a U-2 pilot for a mission at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, March 13, 2019. US Air Force/Senior Airman Gracie I. Lee\n\nThe U-2 is \"just a sensor in a broader grid that the United States has all over the world ... feeding data to these professionals,\" Patterson said.\n\nWhether it's radar imagery or signals intercepts, \"We bring all that on board the aircraft, and we pipe it over a data link to a satellite and then down to the ground somewhere else in the world where we have a team of almost 300 intel analysts,\" Patterson said.\n\n\"So while we're sitting by ourselves over a weird part of the world doing that ISR mission, all the information we're collecting is going back down to multiple teams around the globe,\" he added. \"They're ... distilling it, turning it into usable reports for the decision makers, and [getting] that information disseminated.\"\n\nCapt. Joseph Siler, chief of intelligence training with the 492nd Special Operations Support Squadron, was tasked leading those efforts.\n\n\"I loved talking to the [U-2] pilots, and ... having that pilot [who] is actually understanding the context of where they're at and is able to dynamically change direction and help us, it just brings something to the fight,\" especially when sudden changes require a new plan, Siler said at the same event, during a panel discussion about the mental and physical strain of Air Force operations.\n\nA U-2 pilot signals flight-line personnel while taxing at Beale Air Force Base in California, September 20, 2018. US Air Force/Senior Airman Valentina Viglianco\n\n\"I got more of the quick-time, actionable intelligence\" from U-2s, Siler said. \"It's all going into this common picture, but that's where they fit into it.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the U-2 can't play a role in the action on the ground as it unfolds.\n\n\"We have multiple radios on board,\" Patterson said. \"So let's say you're flying a mission over a desert somewhere and we have troops on the ground that are in contact. We'll be talking directly to them sometimes, providing imagery.\"\n\nThat imagery isn't going straight from the U-2 to the troops, but \"they can tell me what they need to listen to, where they need to look, and we'll move the sensors to that spot, snap an image, kick it back over whatever data links we need to to get it to the intel professionals,\" he said. \"They will do their rapid analysis and send that, again, to the forward edge, where those folks can take a look at it.\"\n\n\"You can see troop movements. You can see things like that,\" Patterson said. \"We've spent a lot of time looking for [improvised explosive devices] and providing [that information] real-time to convoys and things like that. I've done that personally.\"\n\n'Constant, constant stress'\n\nUS Air Force Maj. Sean Gallagher greets his ground support crew before a mission in a U-2, at an undisclosed location in Southwest Asia, November 24, 2010. US Air Force/Staff Sgt. Eric Harris\n\nPatterson analogized the relay of information to a game of telephone.\n\nIt's on \"the airmen that are receiving that to be able to make that decipherable and useful,\" Siler said of intelligence gathered by U-2s. \"When I was in there, in that environment, receiving all that information and how that work, it's just such a weird place. It's different from traditional conflict.\"\n\nThe waves of incoming information are a source of \"constant, constant stress,\" added Siler, who has spoken about his recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"I'm getting information from the U-2. I'm getting information from satellites. I'm getting information from an MQ-9, and I have an Army task force that's about to go in, and there's people's lives that are going to be tested,\" Siler said.\n\n\"What the intelligence community does is we look at all the information we can get, from whatever sensor it is, we pipe that together, and then we say, 'all right, based upon what the U-2 is saying and what the Global Hawk is saying and what the satellites are saying, we believe this is the best route, this is the best time.'\"\n\nFinal decisions about when and where to go are made by operators. But, Siler said, \"you can imagine the sense of responsibility that these young airmen, 19-, 20-years-old, feel as they make those calls, and we say, 'is that the bad guy or is that his 16-year-old son?'\"\n\n'Algorithmic warfare'\n\nA U-2 pilot drives a high-performance chase car on the runway to catch a U-2 during a low-flight touch and go at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, March 15, 2019. US Air Force/Senior Airman Gracie I. Lee\n\nThe reason the U-2 funnels that intelligence back to crew members on the ground is that \"it's so much data that we just simply can't process all of it on board,\" Patterson said.\n\nA U-2 pilot can key on an interesting signal their sensor picked up, sending imagery to intelligence analysts on the ground. Those analysts can decide to look into it, routing a satellite to take a look or sending a drone to get photos and video.\n\nThe process can run the other way as well. A tip from social media can lead analyst on the ground to send in a U-2 to gather photos and other imagery. If necessary, assets like a drone or an F-16 with video capability can be sent in for a closer look.\n\n\"As you start networking [these assets], using these algorithms and using these processing capabilities, if I hear a signal here, and somebody hears the same signal but they're over here, you can instantly refine that\" if the assets are in sync, Patterson said. \"We're able to map down some pretty interesting stuff pretty quick.\"\n\nA U-2 high above the earth. via US Air Force\n\nBut the goal is do it quicker, and the Air Force has been looking at artificial intelligence and machine learning to sort through all the data gathered by U-2s and other aircraft and sensors and make sense of it.\n\nIntegrating that into the broader intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission is still in its \"infancy,\" Nauman said.\n\n\"We know the capability's there. We know the commercial sector is really doing a lot of development on that. They're ahead on that frankly,\" Nauman said. \"We're trying to figure out, A) how to catch up and be as good, and then Part B is what do we do with that, how do we make ourselves more effective with that.\"\n\n\"Processing is getting really good, really fast, so there are a number of efforts to actually take a lot ... of the stuff that we collect, running it through an algorithm at ... what we call the forward edge \u2014 like right on board the aircraft \u2014 [and] disseminate that information to the fight real-time, without having to reach back, and those some of the projects that we're working right now,\" Patterson said, describing what senior leaders have called \"algorithmic warfare.\"\n\n\"It's easier to put racks and racks of servers and [graphics processing units] on the ground, obviously, to do the processing, but how do we take a piece of that and move that to the air?\" Nauman said. \"I think that's going to be kind of the follow-on step.\"", "description": "The U-2's first flight came as an accident in 1955, but over the 64 years since, the Dragon Lady has been an unrivaled source for intelligence.", "authors": ["Christopher Woody"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6448132e22af21dc3fe7c3-2732-1366.jpg"}
