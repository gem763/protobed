Anticipation builds as DOJ watchdog still hasn\u2019t released review", "language": "en", "text": "For weeks, it\u2019s been speculated the long-awaited review of alleged surveillance abuses by the Department of Justice and the FBI during the investigation into Russia\u2019s purported meddling in the 2016 presidential election could drop any day.\n\nIt\u2019s still not here.\n\nFor more than a year and a half, Inspector General Michael Horowitz has been investigating alleged misconduct related to the FISA warrants delivered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The Justice Department and FBI obtained warrants in 2016 to surveil Trump adviser Carter Page. It is unclear, at this point, if Page was the only Trump official to the DOJ obtained a FISA warrant against.\n\nThat highly anticipated report will likely spark new congressional investigations and deliver critical information to other federal reviews probing allegations of abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\nDOJ WATCHDOG SUBMITS DRAFT FISA REPORT TO BARR\n\n\u201cAs soon as Horowitz is done with his review of the FISA warrant application, the counterintelligence investigation, the Trump campaign, we\u2019ll have a hearing in public with Horowitz and we\u2019ll call a bunch of witnesses,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox Business\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nLast month, Horowitz submitted a draft of his report to Attorney General Bill Barr, who was reviewing the document -- fueling the belief that the public release was coming soon.\n\nBut a Justice Department official told Fox News last week that the report is still in the declassification process \u2014 one of the final steps to be completed before the report is released to the public.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and the DOJ are working together smoothly on the declassification process,\u201d the official told Fox News.\n\nPresident Trump -- who has the authority to declassify and release as much of the report as he wants -- has been hyping its forthcoming release. \u201cThe IG report is going to come out soon, and we\u2019ll see what happens,\" the president told reporters last week, adding he's \"waiting for the report like everybody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I predict you will see things that you don\u2019t even believe, the level of corruption \u2014 whether it\u2019s [James] Comey; whether it\u2019s [Peter] Strzok and his lover, [Lisa] Page; whether it\u2019s so many other people \u2014 [Andrew] McCabe; whether it\u2019s President Obama himself,\u201d Trump charged.\n\nHe added: \u201cLet\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s President Obama. Let\u2019s see whether or not they put that in.\u201d\n\nHorowitz has been probing how the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was used to secure the original FISA warrant for Page in October 2016, as well as three renewals.\n\nHorowitz also has looked into why the FBI may have regarded Steele \u2013 funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie \u2013 a credible source, and why the bureau used news reports to bolster Steele\u2019s credibility before the FISA court.\n\nBut the inspector general\u2019s investigation is not the only probe related to alleged misconduct at the onset of the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates.\n\nGraham has vowed to probe alleged FISA abuses at the start of the Russia investigation, saying he would look for answers on how much money the Democrats paid research firm Fusion GPS to commission the dossier compiled by Steele, or if the contents of the dossier have been verified.\n\nAs part of that investigation, Graham has said that he could call on Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and former FBI Director James Comey to appear before his panel. Graham had pushed for the appointment of a second special counsel to probe the allegations into \"whether or not a counterintelligence investigation was opened as a back door to spy on the Trump campaign.\"\n\nThe attorney general has also appointed U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham to take on the probe to investigate possible misconduct by the intelligence community at the origins of the Russia investigation. Durham, who is known as a \u201chard-charging, bulldog\u201d prosecutor, was asked to help Barr \u201censure that intelligence collection activities by the U.S. government related to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign were lawful and appropriate.\u201d Durham also is probing whether Democrats were the ones who had improperly colluded with foreign actors.\n\nIG REPORT IN DECLASSIFICATION PROCESS\n\nDurham was reviewing the days leading up to the 2016 election and through the inauguration. But based on his initial findings, he has expanded the probe to include a post-election timeline through spring 2017 \u2014 up to when Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel.\n\nAs part of the probe, Barr and Durham traveled to Italy to speak to law enforcement officials about their investigation, and also had conversations with officials in the U.K. and Australia about the investigation, according to multiple sources familiar with the meetings.\n\nThe attorney \u201cis gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said last month.\n\nDurham\u2019s review is separate from another probe run by U.S. Attorney John Huber from Utah. Huber was appointed in 2017 by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI but also the handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation and other matters. Republicans, for months, had expressed concerns about Huber\u2019s probe saying he\u2019s made little progress.\n\nIt is unclear at this point if Huber\u2019s investigation is complete, or whether it could dovetail with the current review being led by Barr and Durham.\n\nFox News' Jake Gibson, Gregg Re and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "The highly-anticipated Justice Department inspector general report reviewing surveillance warrants obtained against Trump campaign officials during the 2016 election could drop any day\u2014a release that will likely spark new congressional investigations and deliver critical information to other federal reviews probing allegations of abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
