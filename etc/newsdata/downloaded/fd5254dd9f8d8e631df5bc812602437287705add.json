She said pro-choice and progressive movements \u201cwill lose\u201d elections unless they allow more people to join \u201cwho do not agree 100% with the most extreme ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Americans hold complex truths: they can both personally oppose abortion & support others\u2019 right to choose; they can both feel uncomfortable about abortion & not want women to die from back-alley procedures,\u201d Dr. Wen tweeted. \u201cIf we understand reproductive healthcare to be the standard healthcare that it is, then use the language of public health. Take heart surgery. It\u2019s a procedure that should be available if needed, but prevention is the best medicine. Access is not in conflict with prevention.\u201d\n\nDr. Wen was fired by Planned Parenthood after only nine months on the job. She spoke about her experience last month at Johns Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg School of Public Health, explaining that the organization wanted to focus on abortion politics while she saw more value in making reproductive rights a health care issue.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
