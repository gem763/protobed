"language": "en", "text": "Image copyright Jen McAdam\n\nA woman has received death threats after speaking out about an international cryptocurrency \"scam\".\n\nJen McAdam, from Glasgow, has been leading a band of investors who believe they have been duped by the OneCoin digital currency.\n\nOneCoin is said to have raised as much as \u00a34bn around the world in investment.\n\nBut US prosecutors argue that far from being the next Bitcoin, OneCoin is a pyramid scheme masquerading as a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe scheme's founder Dr Ruja Ignatova has disappeared and is facing money laundering charges.\n\nMs McAdam is one of an estimated 70,000 people in the UK who bought packages from OneCoin but have been unable to trade or fully cash in their stake.\n\nThe Bulgaria-based firm is still trading and denies any suggestion OneCoin is a scam, claiming it fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency.\n\n'Vile abuse'\n\nMs McAdam is taking part in the 'Cryptoqueen' BBC Sounds podcast which is investigating the disappearance of Dr Ignatova and OneCoin, and said she has had a torrent of abuse since.\n\nThe 49-year-old revealed she has received scores of messages, mainly through Facebook, threatening her with sexual violence and death in what she claims are co-ordinated attacks by OneCoin supporters, and has now reported the threats to Police Scotland.\n\nShe said: \"It is horrible, the abuse is vile and the threats feel very real to me, I'm always looking over my shoulder now.\n\n\"It is taking its toll on my health but I will not give up until me and the thousands of other OneCoin victims like me see some form of justice.\"\n\nImage copyright YouTube Image caption At a big event at London in 2016, Dr Ruja Ignatova talked up her cryptocurrency OneCoin to supporters\n\nMs McAdam invested about \u00a38,000 of her own money in the scheme, and persuaded family and friends to put in about \u00a3220,000, before realising she was not going to get the money back.\n\n\"I know through the different victims' groups around the world that it is people just like me who are affected,\" she said. \"They invested their life savings, they remortgaged homes and they convinced their friends and family to get involved -and they feel as awful as I do about it all because we were all duped.\n\n\"We think there's around 70,000 victims in the UK but it feels as if they are being left behind, nobody here seems interested in this.\"\n\nMs McAdam has called on the UK policing and financial regulation authorities to take the issue more seriously.\n\n'Pyramid scheme'\n\nThe Cryptoqueen podcast estimates OneCoin has raised as much as \u00a34bn from people in 175 countries, with up to \u00a396m in the UK alone.\n\nThe flamboyant leader of OneCoin, Dr Ignatova, disappeared in 2017 and in March this year US prospectors charged the Oxford-educated businesswoman in absentia with money laundering, with the Department of Justice calling OneCoin an old-fashioned pyramid scheme.\n\nNew York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance was reported as describing OneCoin as \"an old-school pyramid scheme on a new-school platform\".\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Investment in cryptocurrencies has soared since Bitcoin was invented in 2008\n\nAn alternative to centuries-old forms of currency such as notes and coins, a cryptocurrency is like a virtual token which can be bought and sold on the internet.\n\nThe currency is not printed by governments or traditional banks but created through a complex process known as \"mining\".\n\nThe process is monitored by a network of computers across the world which use cryptography for security.\n\nCryptocurrencies can be used to buy goods and services, like traditional currencies, but are also used as investments where people take advantage of their volatile exchange rates.\n\nBitcoin is probably the most famous cryptocurrency but there are now thousands of the standalone digital currencies, with Facebook looking to launch its own too.\n\nBut as OneCoin has proved, crypto can be more controversy than currency.\n\nResearch published on 7 October showed that UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority was conducting 87 investigations into the sector as of September, up from 50 a year earlier.\n\nOneCoin has rejected allegations that it is a scam, and states that \"OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency\".\n\nIt says the BBC podcast series into its business does \"not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased\".\n\nThe company also claims that the allegations made about it around the world are being challenged, stating: \"Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established\".\n\nA Police Scotland spokeswoman confirmed they had visited Ms McAdam and offered her advice in the wake of the anonymous threats against her.\n\nYou can listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast series on BBC
