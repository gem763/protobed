US media reports also claimed the same on Sunday.\n\nThe White House announced President Donald Trump would make a \"major statement\".\n\nMeanwhile Turkey said it had coordinated with the United States before the operation. A war monitor said US helicopters dropped forces in an area of Idlib province where \"groups linked to the Islamic State group\" were present.\n\nA picture taken on October 27, 2019 shows a destroyed vehicle at the site where helicopter gunfire reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha in the Idlib province along the border with Turkey.

There were two people killed inside\" the car, he said.\n\nUS media cited multiple government sources as saying Baghdadi may have killed himself with a suicide vest as US special operations forces descended.\n\nHe was the target of the secretly planned operation that was approved by Trump, officials said.\n\nThis file image grab taken on July 5, 2014 from a propaganda video released by al-Furqan Media allegedly shows the leader of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, aka Caliph Ibrahim, adressing Muslim worshippers at a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, held at the time by IS.
