I'm stoked.'\n\nThe band: Goodbye Honolulu is pictured playing their set at Alphaville in Brooklyn\n\nRide or Die: On Monday Selena shared this picture of herself and Taylor Swift while hanging out with Taylor's cat Benjamin Button", "description": "Her latest single Lose You To Love Me is at the top of the charts and that means Selena Gomez has a few reasons to celebrate.\nThe 27-year-old Disney alum was spotted at the dive bar Alphaville.", "authors": ["Shelslaughter At Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20331660-0-image-a-83_1572364341607.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
