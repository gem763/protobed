Game 5 is Wednesday in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of players who are very talented and that have conceded playing time for the sum of the ballclub,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThey have earned this opportunity, as we well as have, for a Game 5. The second half of the season they played as well as anyone.\u201d\n\nRoberts said he plans to start Will Smith at catcher as Walker Buehler gets the start for the Dodgers.\n\nRoberts did not rule out using any pitchers on his staff, though he said it is unlikely Cy Young candidate Hyun-Jin Ryu is used.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
