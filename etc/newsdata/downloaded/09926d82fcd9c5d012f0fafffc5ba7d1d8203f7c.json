Call me. Email me. Let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Television Academy told the Times that while the organization \u201ccelebrates inclusiveness,\u201d it has no plans to make that change.\n\nThe Oscars and the Tony Awards are also expected to maintain separate awards for actors and actresses.\n\nThe one award show that has done away with gendered categories is the MTV Movie & TV Awards. The Viacom-owned MTV announced in 2017 that its flagship awards show would eliminate gender-specific categories for the first time.\n\nInstead of categories like \u201cBest Actress\u201d and \u201cBest Actor,\u201d the show honors \u201cBest Actor in a Movie\u201d and \u201cBest Actor in a Show.\u201d\n\nDillon plays the gender non-binary character Taylor Mason in Showtime\u2019s Billions, and chose to be submitted for Emmy consideration in the supporting actor category two years ago. Dillon, who has so far failed to earn an Emmy nomination, was born female and but now identifies as non-binary and uses the pronoun \u201cthey.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we separated categories by the colors of eyes, hair or skin, people would go, \u2018This is unacceptable,\u2019\u201d Dillon told the Times. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about gender categories. At this point, it feels unacceptable and unnecessary and archaic.\u201d\n\nOpponents of such a measure said that men would end up dominating non-gendered acting categories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s placing this huge bet that sexism is so solved that it doesn\u2019t need to be paid attention to anymore,\u201d Mark Harris, the writer and entertainment journalist, told the Times. \u201cIt\u2019s so solved even though a vast majority of voters in awards groups are men. It\u2019s so solved even though actresses have absolutely no shortage of important and fascinating things to say about the way gender inequities persist in the industry.\u201d\n\nThe John Wick 3 star kicked off the MTV Movie & TV Awards night by presenting the award for Best Actor in a Movie.\n\n\u201cThis year has been full of firsts for me. I am the first openly non-binary actor to play a non-binary character on a major television show,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s so cool to be here presenting the first acting award ever that celebrates performance free of any gender distinction.\u201d\n\n#MTVAwards: Asia Kate Dillon presents gender-neutral acting award to Emma Watson https://t.co/bDgVu89Ks2 pic.twitter.com/YoyydJv4Ty \u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) May 8, 2017\n\nBillions, which has been renewed for a fifth season, was co-created by Brian Koppelman, who has repeatedly ripped President Donald Trump.\n\nKoppelman recently said in a blog post that he will \u201crefuse to call him Mr. President and I\u2019d hope you\u2019d do the same.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
