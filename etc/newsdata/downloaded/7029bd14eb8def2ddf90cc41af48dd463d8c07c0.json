Most of that money comes from the Division I men\u2019s-basketball tournament. In 2016, the NCAA extended its television agreement with CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting through 2032\u2014an $8.8 billion deal. About 30 Division I schools each bring in at least $100 million in athletic revenue every year. Almost all of these schools are majority white\u2014in fact, black men make up only 2.4 percent of the total undergraduate population of the 65 schools in the so-called Power Five athletic conferences. Yet black men make up 55 percent of the football players in those conferences, and 56 percent of basketball players.\n\nBlack athletes have attracted money and attention to the predominantly white universities that showcase them. Meanwhile, black colleges are struggling. Alabama\u2019s athletic department generated $174 million in the 2016\u201317 school year, whereas the HBCU that generated the most money from athletics that year, Prairie View A&M, brought in less than $18 million. Beyond sports, the average HBCU endowment is only one-eighth that of the average predominantly white school; taken together, all of the HBCU endowments combined make up less than a tenth of Harvard\u2019s.\n\nWhy should this matter to anyone beyond the administrators and alumni of the HBCUs themselves? Because black colleges play an important role in the creation and propagation of a black professional class. Despite constituting only 3 percent of four-year colleges in the country, HBCUs have produced 80 percent of the black judges, 50 percent of the black lawyers, 50 percent of the black doctors, 40 percent of the black engineers, 40 percent of the black members of Congress, and 13 percent of the black CEOs in America today. (They have also produced this election cycle\u2019s only black female candidate for the U.S. presidency: Kamala Harris is a 1986 graduate of Howard University.)\n\nRead: Why America needs its HBCUs\n\nIn a country where the racial wealth gap remains enormous\u2014the median white household has nearly 10 times the wealth of the median black household, and the rate of white homeownership is about 70 percent higher than that of black homeownership\u2014institutions that nurture a black middle class are crucial. And when these institutions are healthy, they bring economic development to the black neighborhoods that surround them.\n\nMoreover, some black students feel safer, both physically and emotionally, on an HBCU campus\u2014all the more so as racial tensions have risen in recent years. Navigating a predominantly white campus as a black student can feel isolating, even for athletes. Davon Dillard is a basketball player who transferred to Shaw University after Oklahoma State dismissed him for disciplinary reasons. \u201cGoing to a school where most of the people are the same color as you, it\u2019s almost like you can let your guard down a little bit,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend to be somebody else. You don\u2019t have to dress this way, or do things this way. It\u2019s like, \u2018I know you. We have the same kind of struggles. We can relate.\u2019 It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re back at home in your neighborhood.\u201d Perhaps partly for this reason, black students\u2019 graduation rates at HBCUs are notably higher than black students\u2019 at other colleges when controlling for factors such as income and high-school success.", "description": "They attract money and attention to the predominantly white universities that showcase them, while HBCUs struggle.
