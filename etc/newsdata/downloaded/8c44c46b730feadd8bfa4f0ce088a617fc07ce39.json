It comes at the backdrop of our plight as a province with the high number of unsuitable schools. We have been making a clarion call to the national government to help us deal with this problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been arguing with the national government, for instance, using the example of building stadiums prior to the 2010 Soccer World Cup, saying that these facilities were built in a short space of time and why not schools?\u201d\n\nHe said they were also appealing to the private sector to join hands with the department and government in the projects to build proper schools.\n\n\u201cRemember we are a rural province that inherited a lot of mud schools from the Bantustan governments. So the intervention from national government and the presidency will assist us, it will go a long way,\u201d Mtima said.\n\n\u201cSo we are saying the private sector must also come on board because we want to eradicate all these mud structures and unsafe toilets and ensure that at the end of the day teaching and learning takes place at a conducive environment,\u201d he said.\n\nRamasedi Mafoko, infrastructure director in the department of basic education, said R1.327 billion has been budgeted for Asidi in this financial year for all projects nationally.\n\nThe SAFE\u2019s budget was R700 million, he said.\n\nMafoko said the SAFE programme had 244 projects planned for completion this financial year in the Eastern Cape alone.\n\nAccording to Mafoko, the Asidi programme targets schools built, in their entirety, from inappropriate material.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, all Asidi projects involve the building of a brand-new replacement school \u2013 complete with administration block, classrooms, science lab and computer lab which are often housed in the media centres or separately depending on school site or enrolment. Nutrition centres, multipurpose centre or halls [will also be built] again, depending on enrolment and Grade R centres,\u201d said Mafoko.\n\nSome of the schools which will be fixed are: Clarkson Primary School in Sarah Baartman District Municipality; Gabazi Junior Secondary School in Qumbu; Somagunya Senior Secondary School in Tsolo in the OR Tambo District Municipality; and Andrieskraal Primary School in the Kouga Local Municipality.\n\nDuring his visit to Lusikisiki two weeks ago, the president said there were many projects focused on schools in the Eastern Cape.\n\nWe are seeking to ensure that we also get rid of mud schools. President Cyril Ramaphosa\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure that we work together with the various structures in our municipalities as we go on investing in maintenance and repairs in the various infrastructure installations that we have.\n\n\u201cHere [in the Eastern Cape] we also want to focus on 116 schools so that we can conclude the installation of better ablution facilities so that we get rid of pit latrines.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking to ensure that we also get rid of mud schools. All these things that we are embarking on we believe we are well positioned for,\u201d said Ramaphosa.\n\nThe president said the projects were meant to make sure that the education and schools outcomes of the province were improved.\n\nTALK TO US Are the latest government initiatives enough to address the mud schools and pit latrines crisis?
