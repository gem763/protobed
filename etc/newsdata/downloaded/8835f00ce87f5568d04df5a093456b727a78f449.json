Lately, however, it has come under criticism for what some see as a left/liberal bias.\n\nCertainly, what we have just learned about its dealings with anti-Trump partisans in the Justice Department does nothing to improve our perception of the news service.\n\nWe have released two sets of heavily redacted FBI documents \u2013 28 pages and 38 pages \u2013about an April 11, 2017, \u201coff-the-record\u201d meeting set up by then-Chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Fraud Section Andrew Weissmann.\n\nThe meeting included representatives of the DOJ, the FBI and the Associated Press in which AP reporters provided information on former Trump Campaign Director Paul Manafort, including the numeric code to Manafort\u2019s storage locker.\n\nTwo months later, in early June, Weissmann was hired to work on Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel operation against President Trump. Weissman then reportedly spearheaded the subsequent investigation and prosecution of Manafort.\n\nIncluded among the new documents are two typed write-ups of the meeting\u2019s proceedings and handwritten notes taken during the meeting by two FBI special agents.\n\nAccording to a June 11, 2017, FBI write-up:\n\nThe purpose of the meeting, as it was explained to SSA [supervisory special agent, redacted] was to obtain documents from the AP reporters that were related to their investigative reports on Paul Manafort.\n\nNo such documents were included in the documents released to us.\n\nDuring the meeting, the AP reporters provided the FBI information about a storage locker of Manafort (the Mueller special counsel operation raided the locker on May 26, 2017):\n\nThe AP reporters advised that they had located a storage facility in Virginia that belonged to Manafort\u2026The code to the lock on the locker is 40944859. The reporters were aware of the Unit number and address, but they declined to share that information.\n\nThe reporters shared the information that \u201cpayments for the locker were made from the DM Partners account that received money from the [Ukraine] Party of Regions.\u201d\n\nThe notes suggest the AP pushed for criminal prosecution of Manafort:\n\nAP believes Manafort is in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), in that Manafort send [sic] internal U. S. documents to officials in Ukraine AP has documentation proving this, as well as Manafort noting his understanding doing so would get him into trouble.\n\nAP asked about the U.S. government charging Manafort with violating Title 18, section 1001 for lying to government officials, and have asked if the FBI has interviewed Manafort. FBI and DOJ had no comment on this question.\n\nAlso, according to the FBI write-up, \u201cThe AP reporters asked about FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] violations and they were generally told that they are enforceable.\u201d\n\nAlthough, according to the FBI write-up, \u201cno commitments were made [by DOJ] to assist the reporters,\u201d Andrew Weissmann asked the AP to contact foreign authorities to follow up:\n\n[A]fter the meeting was started and it was explained to the reporters that there was nothing that the FBI could provide to them, the reporters opted to ask a series of questions to see if the FBI would provide clarification. No commitments were made to assist the reporters in their further investigation into the life and activities of Paul Manafort, and the AP reporters understood that the meeting would be off the record.\n\n***\n\nThey [AP reporters] reiterated what they had written in their article, which was a response from the Cypriot Anti-Money Laundering Authority (MOKAS) that they [MOKAS] had fully responded to Department of Treasury agents in response to [Treasury\u2019s] request. The AP reporters were interested in how this arrangement worked and if the U.S. had made a formal request. FBI/DOJ did not respond, but Andrew Weissman [sic] suggested that they ask the Cypriots if they had provided everything to which they had access or if they only provided what they were legally required to provide.\n\n***\n\nThe AP reporters asked if we [DOJ/FBI] would be willing to tell them if they were off based [sic] or on the wrong traack [sic] and they were advised that they appeared to have a good understanding of Manafort\u2019s business dealings.\n\nThe reporters asked about any DOJ request for the assistance of foreign governments in the U.S. Government\u2019s investigation of Manafort:\n\nThe AP reporters asked if there had been any official requests to other countries. FBI/DOJ declined to discuss specifics, except to state that the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty requests are negotiated by diplomats, so they should remain at that level.\n\nAP reporters told the FBI about payments in the \u201cblack ledger,\u201d a Ukrainian record of allegedly illegal off-the-books payments:\n\nThe reporters advised that their next report, which was scheduled to come out in the next day or so after the meeting, would focus on confirming, to the extent that they could, payments in the so called \u201cblack ledger\u201d that were allegedly made to Manafort.\n\n***\n\nThe impression that their sources give is that Manafort was not precise about his finances, specifically as it related to the \u201cblack ledger.\u201d The AP reporters calculated that he received $60 to $80 million from his work in Ukraine, during the time period the ledger was kept. According to their review of the ledger, it appears that there is a slightly lesser amount documented based on all of the entries. The AP reporters accessed a copy of the ledger online, describing it as \u201cpublic\u201d document (Agent\u2019s note \u2013 the ledger has been published in its entirety by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, after it was given to them by Sergei Leshenko, Ukrainian RADA member [Ukrainian parliament] and investigative reporter.)\n\nThe AP reporters discussed an extensive list of issues, companies, and individuals that they felt should be investigated for possible criminal activity, including a $50,000 payment to a men\u2019s clothing store; a 2007 meeting with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska; Loav Ltd., which was possibly incorporated by Manafort; NeoCom, which the AP reporters implied was incorporated solely to cover up money laundering; and other matters.\n\nThe reporters described an \u201cinternal U.S. work product that had been sent to Ukraine.\u201d The reporters described it as an \u201cinternal White House document.\u201d The FBI report stated that it \u201cwas not clear if the document was classified.\u201d\n\nEvidently referring to these documents, Manafort\u2019s lawyers alleged that Weissmann provided guidance and leaked grand jury testimony to the AP reporters investigating Manafort.\n\nThis document production comes in our April, 2019 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:19-cv-00879)) filed after the FBI failed to respond to a July 5, 2018, FOIA request for:\n\nAll records concerning the April 2017 meeting between Department of Justice and FBI personnel and representatives of The Associated Press. This request includes all notes, reports, memoranda, briefing materials, or other records created in preparation for, during, and/or pursuant to the meeting.\n\nAll records of communication between any representative of the Department of Justice and any of the individuals present at the aforementioned meeting.\n\nUnder Mueller, Weissmann became known as \u201cthe architect of the case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort,\u201d which produced no evidence of collusion between Manafort, the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. It indicted Manafort on unrelated charges.\n\nIn an October 2017 article describing Weissmann as Mueller\u2019s \u201cPit Bull,\u201d The New York Times wrote, \u201cHe is a top lieutenant to Robert S. Mueller III on the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links to the Trump campaign. Significantly, Mr. Weissmann is an expert in converting defendants into collaborators \u2014 with either tactical brilliance or overzealousness, depending on one\u2019s perspective.\u201d Weissman oversaw the pre-dawn home raid of Manafort in what one former federal prosecutor described as \u201ctextbook Weissmann terrorism.\u201d Weissmann reportedly also attended Hillary Clinton\u2019s Election Night party in New York.\n\nIn May 2019, we uncovered 73 pages of records from the DOJ containing text messages and calendar entries of Weissmann showing he led the hiring effort for the investigation that targeted President Trump.\n\nIn December 2017, we made public two productions of DOJ documents showing strong support by top DOJ officials for former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates\u2019 refusal to enforce President Trump\u2019s Middle East travel ban executive order. In one email, Weissmann applauds Yates, writing: \u201cI am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.\u201d\n\nThese latest shocking FBI reports evidence a corrupt collusion between the DOJ and the media, specifically The Associated Press, to target Paul Manafort. These reports are further reason for President Trump to pardon Manafort and others caught up in Mueller\u2019s abusive web.\n\nThis new evidence strengthens the widespread belief that the media are in league with the anti-Trumpers in the administration and in the Congress.", "description": "The AP, with a reputation for independence and fairness over the years, has come under\u00a0criticism\u00a0for what some see as a left/liberal bias.", "authors": ["Tom Fitton"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/wi/ap/27/91d8bd_aptopix-trump-russia-probe-manafort-73340-paul-manafort-arrives-in-court-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
