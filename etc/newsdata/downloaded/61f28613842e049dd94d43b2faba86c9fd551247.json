But the D.C. alcoholic board declined to take up the case because the petition was filed after the hotel had already been granted its liquor license, The Washington Post reported in June.\n\nWhen the hotel\u2019s renewal came up in May, the group again challenged it.\n\nRepresentatives from the Trump Organization did not respond to an email request for comment.\n\nJoshua A. Levy, the attorney representing the complainants, said the board ruled on technicalities but never on the merits of the challenges and the \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d against Trump\u2019s character.\n\n\u201cWith each passing day, the story of Donald Trump\u2019s lack of good character continues to play out in the public. Residents of the District can and should come forward to urge the liquor board to reach the merits of this complaint,\u201d Levy said.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The District\u2019s alcohol board ruled that the challengers did not meet a residency requirement.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rJuNlDjziMPEXLuZz7OjmhAuFus=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6RUCTDUNDAI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
