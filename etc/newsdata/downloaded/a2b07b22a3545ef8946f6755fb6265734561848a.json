You can form your own view.

A coalition of labour groups is pushing similar legislation in New York, and bills in Washington State and Oregon that were similar to California\u2019s but failed to advance could see renewed momentum.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They have warned that recognising drivers as employees could destroy their businesses.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "California legislators approved a landmark bill on Tuesday that requires companies like Uber and Lyft to treat contract workers as employees, a move that could reshape the gig economy and that adds fuel to a yearslong debate over whether the nature of work has become too insecure.", "authors": ["Kate Conger", "Noam Scheiber"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/08/uber.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
