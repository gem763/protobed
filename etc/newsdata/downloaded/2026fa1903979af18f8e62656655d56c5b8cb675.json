Skoda Octavia: 1,950 2. VW Passat: 1,874 3. Toyota Prius: 1,742 4. Ford Mondeo: 1,278 5. VW Golf: 1,047 6. Toyota Avensis: 1.027 7. Audi A4: 997 8. Mercedes Benz E-Class: 956 9. Ford Galaxy: 899 10. Audi A6: 637 Source: MotorEasy using DVSA data\n\nThat might not be such a coincidence as the Passat shares many parts with the Octavia through the generations, given they're both VW Group models after the brand bought Skoda back in 1986.\n\nThe Passat has been around for longer than its Czech counterpart, now in its sixth generation since the 1970s.\n\nAccording to DVSA figures unearthed by MotorEasy, there are 1,874 Passats of all years and body styles being used in the UK having racked-up 250,000 miles or more.\n\nIn third spot is the Toyota Prius.\n\nThe world's first volume-selling hybrid is now 21 years old, and there are plenty examples - 1,742 to be exact - that are still being driven with over a quarter-of-a-million miles under their belt.\n\nA common theme among the top three 250,000-mile-plus motors is that they're all favourites for minicab firms.\n\nWhile the Octavia and Passat are extremely common taxis, the Prius is also a popular among drivers working for ride-hailing services like Uber.\n\nThe VW Passat has, in various guises, been around since the mid 1970s. There are almost 1,900 UK-registered examples with over a quarter-of-a-million miles under their belt\n\nToyota's Prius is supremely popular among minicab and ride-hailing firms, which might explain why so many are still in use having already covered 250,000 miles\n\nDuncan McClure Fisher, the founder of MotorEasy, said: 'Finding a car that'll run and run is the Holy Grail for most motorists on a budget.\n\n'If you're investing in a vehicle you want it to last as long as possible, and many of the cars in this list will also have been used in the taxi trade, too.\n\n'And with more high-mileage examples on the road than any other car, the Skoda Octavia appears to have real staying power.'\n\nMondeo man is still going strong, with 1,278 examples of Ford's family motor being driven with more than 250,000 miles on the clock\n\nThe VW Golf is the fifth most common UK car to have over 250,000 on the clock. Having been around for so long and proving hugely popular, we thought it might have been higher\n\nHe added: 'It's also slightly surprising that the Toyota Prius is in the top three.\n\n'But when a car has such good fuel economy - around 80 miles to the gallon for the latest model - it's no wonder Prius owners want to keep them on the road for as long as humanly possible.'\n\nAccording to the DVSA stats, other dependable mile-munching motors include the Ford Mondeo, VW Golf and Toyota Avensis, along with Audi's A4, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Ford Galaxy and Audi A6.\n\nIn terms of vans, the mighty Mercedes-Benz Sprinter trounced its nearest rival, the Ford Transit, with 9,295 high mileage Sprinters compared with 4,773 Transits legally on the road.\n\nThe Mercedes Sprinter is the van of choice if you're looking to have one that keeps running. Over 9,000 on UK roads have over 250,000 miles showing on their record\n\nThe Ford Transit is, unsurprisingly, the second most common 250k-mile van, though there are almost half as many as the Sprinter\n\nTop 9 high-mileage vans and taxis on UK roads with over 250k on the clock 1.
