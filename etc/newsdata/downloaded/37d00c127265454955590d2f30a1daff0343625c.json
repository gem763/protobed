Right, granted, it was tweeted by the president, but the president \u2026 tweets a lot of stuff. This one is an obvious photoshop blending the photo of the dog that Trump released on Monday with a different photo of Trump presenting the Medal of Honor. The \u201cmedal\u201d itself in the pic is a paw print for extra ridiculous-ness. And yet our media appears to be taking it quite seriously indeed:\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday shared a photograph from 2017 altered to show him placing a medal around the neck of the dog injured in the raid that led to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State\u2019s leader.https://t.co/XUWwq0b9Ie \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) October 30, 2019\n\nThe original image appears to be an Associated Press photo of Trump giving the Medal of Honor to Vietnam veteran James McCloughan in 2017.\n\nhttps://t.co/50guJqKy9F \u2014 USA TODAY (@USATODAY) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cTrump Tweets Faked Photo of Hero Dog Getting a Medal,\u201d sniffs the headline of the Times story.\n\nIf you find those tweets too ambiguous to draw the conclusion that journalists are missing the joke, be advised that there are others:\n\nFine, just the president of the United States disseminating a doctored image created by a right-wing propaganda site. pic.twitter.com/Ky26zdDaXe \u2014 S.V. D\u00e1te (@svdate) October 30, 2019\n\nI've requested details from the @WhiteHouse on this photo.\n\nThere was no such canine event on today's @POTUS schedule but there is a Medal of Honor ceremony set here for later today for an active duty Green Beret. https://t.co/NESINT9J4b \u2014 Steve Herman (@W7VOA) October 30, 2019\n\nWhy, they\u2019ve caught the president red-handed attempting to spread disinformation. About placing a paw-print medal around a dog\u2019s neck.\n\nThe Times story at least acknowledges in the subhead that it was a joke photo. Some anti-Trumpers, recognizing that taking this too seriously is a bad look, have shifted instead to complaining that the photo is disrespectful to James McCloughan, the man who received the Medal of Honor in the original image that was used for the photoshop. WaPo\u2019s headline, for instance, blares that \u201cTrump tweeted a photo of a Medal of Honor recipient \u2014 who was edited out and replaced by a dog.\u201d Quote:\n\nA watermark for the [Daily Wire] appears in Trump\u2019s tweet, but it is a cropped version that removes the attribution of the source photo, which is the Associated Press. That would have indicated that it began as a legitimate news photo, raising the question of whether Trump or a staffer knew McCloughan had been edited out.\n\nThere\u2019s a question of whether Trump knew whether he actually gave a medal to a dog or not?\n\nAnyway, McCloughan disappointed everyone by telling the NYT that he got a kick out of it:\n\nIn a phone interview on Wednesday, Mr. McCloughan, 73, who had not seen the image before a reporter sent it to him, said that he interpreted it as Mr. Trump recognizing the dog\u2019s heroism. He certainly was not offended and laughed when he compared the two images. After all, he said, Medal of Honor recipients accept on behalf of their entire teams, especially those that did not return from battle. And canines have long been part of war efforts. \u201cThis recognizes the dog is part of that team of brave people,\u201d he said\u2026 \u201cThey are very courageous,\u201d he said of military canines.\n\nImagine how disappointed those reporters must have been to have gone to the trouble of tracking down McCloughan, teeing him up for a \u201cTrump has besmirched my honor\u201d soundbite, and getting that reaction instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the obvious punchline to the story is that there will, inevitably, be an actual ceremony of some sort at the White House for the dog. Trump\u2019s getting too much good political mileage out of it not to hold a photo op with such a very good boy.\n\nHere\u2019s a snippet today from a Pentagon briefing on the Baghdadi raid, including a bit of drone footage from overhead of the assault on the compound. What about the dog-cam video of Baghdadi running for his life, bro?", "description": "What?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
