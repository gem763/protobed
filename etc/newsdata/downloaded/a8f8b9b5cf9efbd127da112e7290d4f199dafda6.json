He attends all three-and-a-half days as our official ambassador and typically gives forward-looking presentations multiple times.\n\nSteve\u2019s newest project is the podcast, \u201cWhat\u2019s Ahead,\u201d in which \u201che engages the world\u2019s top newsmakers, politicians and pioneers in business and economics in honest conversations meant to challenge traditional conventions.\u201d\n\nWe have been friends for years \u2014 and have something in common. We were both born in 1947. (See the accompanying photo.)\n\n\n\nSteve Forbes and Mark Skousen share a gold coin minted in 1947, their birth year.\n\nI was privileged to be on his show this week. Past experts have included Howard Schultz (the former CEO of Starbucks), Gov. Mitch Daniels, Maria Bartiromo, George Gilder and Burt Malkiel.\n\nOffering a Better Way to Measure the Economy\n\nDuring my appearance, I talked about my new revolutionary way to measure the economy \u2014 gross output (GO), which the government adopted in 2014. I call it a triumph in supply-side, Austrian economics.\n\nGO challenges a traditional convention in economics \u2014 gross domestic product (GDP). Most people don\u2019t know this, but GDP leaves out all the business-to-business (B2B) parts of the supply chain in the economy! B2B spending reached almost $26 trillion last year in the United States. This was far bigger than the U.S.\u2019s GDP of $20 trillion.\n\nGO also shows that business spending is almost twice the size of consumer spending, thus disproving the popular myth that \u201cconsumer spending drives the economy.\u201d Consumer spending is not 70% of economic activity. It\u2019s more like 30%. Business spending is much larger, representing over 60% of total economic activity in the United States. It is business entrepreneurship, innovation, capital investment and technology that determines economic growth. Say\u2019s Law tells us consumption is the effect, not the cause, of prosperity!\n\nGO is better and more comprehensive because it includes the supply chain. GO measures the \u201cmake\u201d economy, GDP accounts for the \u201cuse\u201d economy \u2014 which accounts for a big difference.\n\nI like the way Steve Forbes compared GO with GDP \u2014 \u201cGDP is the X-ray of the economy; GO is the CAT scan.\u201d\n\nForbes considers GO a \u201cbig deal.\u201d He even wrote, \u201cGross output, long advocated by Mark Skousen, will have a profound and manifestly positive impact on economic policy and politics.\u201d\n\nGO is much more volatile than GDP, so it\u2019s a better way to determine what\u2019s happening in the economy. (For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, nominal GDP \u2013 which includes changes in prices due to inflation \u2014 fell only 2%, while GO fell more than 6%. GO did a better job of describing how bad things got in 2008-09.)\n\nAre We Headed for a Recession?\n\nWhat is GO telling us now? According to the latest data in 2019, the economy is slowing down. GO rose only 1.6% in the first quarter, substantially less than GDP growth of 3.1%. That\u2019s a sign of a struggling economy.\n\nGO also is an important leading indicator. The economy is in a slow growth mode. So, I was not surprised when the government announced that the second-quarter real GDP rose only 2.1%, far less than the 3.1% rise in the first quarter.\n\nThe second-quarter GO will be released next month on Oct. 29. At some point in the near future, the U.S. government said that it would release the GO and GDP figures at the same time.\n\nRead the Forbes Podcast Interview Here\n\nIt\u2019s important that you read Forbes\u2019s short introduction, followed by the podcast interview.\n\nThe title of Steve Forbes\u2019s podcast is: \u201cWe\u2019re Using the Wrong Measure (GDP) To Gauge The Economy\u2019s Real Health: Mark Skousen.\u201d\n\nStart by clicking here.\n\nThe following is a surprisingly positive comment from Austrian economist Walter Block, who has been a long-time critic: \u201cSkousen is to be congratulated for creating an entirely new concept in economics, GO. There are not many social scientists of whom such a claim can be made, so this constitutes a gigantic feather in his cap. There are other instances of this phenomenon: Menger, Austrian Economics; Rothbard, libertarianism; Buchanan and Tullock, Public Choice; Coase and Posner, Law and Economics; Milton Friedman, monetarism, the negative income tax, school vouchers; Wenzel, Private Property Society\u2026 the fact that Skousen can even be mentioned in such august company is an indication of his creativity.\u201d \u2014 Walter Block, Loyola University\n\nIf you want to know more about GO, go to www.grossoutput.com.\n\nBy the way, normally I don\u2019t share personal investing stories in my column. But recently I \u201cfessed up\u201d to the biggest holding in my IRA in front of a small group in Washington, D.C. For the longest time, this investment was off-limits to regular investors, but that\u2019s all changed. In fact, it\u2019s helped me become a millionaire, and I believe it can do the same for my readers.
