Mitt Romney (R-UT) speaks at a news conference about the Tobacco to 21 Act on Capitol Hill, May 8, 2019. REUTERS/ (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nSenator Mitt Romney (R., Utah) was sharply critical of the Trump administration\u2019s handling Turkey\u2019s invasion of Northern Syria during a press conference with reporters Wednesday afternoon, questioning why the president did not make \u201ca clear agreement with Turkey as to what they would do, and what they would not do\u201d before ordering a withdrawal of American troops from the region.\n\nSen. Romney on US troop withdrawal from northern Syria: \"Turkey let us know what they were going to do. This is not a surprise. Everybody told the administration what would happen \u2026 The reality is what's happening in Syria is a result of our decision.\" pic.twitter.com/8sy3yhFeDq \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cThis is not a surprise. Everybody told the administration what would happen if we pulled our troops out precipitously,\u201d Romney said. \u201cInstead, there should have been a negotiation beforehand, we should\u2019ve sat down with Turkey and said, \u2018Alright, look: We\u2019re willing to talk to you about your concerns, let\u2019s see if we can negotiate a program here where we protect the Kurds, where we can make sure the ISIS prisoners are kept in place, and where we honor our commitments to our friends the Kurds, as well as our alliance with you, Turkey.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this stage, it\u2019s trying to cover ourselves as well as we can and look like we\u2019re being tough and we\u2019re putting sanctions on Turkey and so forth, but the reality is the decision was made by this administration which has led to the Turks going into Syria and wiping out our friends, the Kurds. That\u2019s what\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Romney added.\n\nThe chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism went on to say that neither he nor the subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, Senator Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) were briefed on the decision to withdraw troops ahead of time, and to voice hope that the White House would provide the subcommittee a transparent explanation of the process that led to the move.\n\nRomney and Murphy released a statement October 7 that called the Syria withdrawal \u201ca betrayal that will have grave humanitarian and national security consequences.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s invasion of Northern Syria entered its eighth day Wednesday, amid heavy fighting that has displaced over 130,000 people and attracted Russian and Syrian troops to the region.\n\nRomney\u2019s comments marked the latest twist in an often-testy relationship with Trump that has publicly soured amid disagreements over the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and the Syria withdrawal. On Wednesday, the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group, released a 30-second ad which paints Romney as a \u201cDemocrat secret asset\u201d who is \u201cplotting to take down President Trump with impeachment.\u201d", "description": "Senator Mitt Romney (R., Utah) was sharply critical of the Trump administration\u2019s handling Turkey's invasion of Northern Syria during a press conference with reporters Wednesday afternoon, questioning why the president did not make \u201ca clear agreement with Turkey as to what they would do, and what they would not do\u201d before ordering a withdrawal of American troops from the region.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
