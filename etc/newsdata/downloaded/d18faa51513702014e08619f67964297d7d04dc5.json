And then the government said, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to read this book.\u2019 They said, \u2018God, sue Snowden as fast as you can, do anything you can, stop it, stop it, stop it.\u2019 And now we\u2019re number 1, basically everywhere,\u201d Mr. Snowden told \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah.\n\n\u201cSo you could say the attorney general is the best hype man that I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Mr. Snowden.\n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s memoir, \u201cPermanent Record,\u201d was released worldwide on Tuesday, more than six years after the former CIA employee and National Security Agency contractor admittedly leaked a trove of classified material to members of the media about the U.S. government\u2019s surveillance operations.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Mr. Snowden when \u201cPermanent Record\u201d hit the shelves because he did not submit it for review prior to publication. Federal prosecutors allege Mr. Snowden violated non-disclosure agreements he signed years earlier and have argued that the government should reap any profits made by his memoir.\n\n\u201cPermanent Record\u201d was the second best-selling book available on Amazon as of Friday morning, according to the online retailer.\n\nThe Justice Department announced criminal charges against Mr. Snowden, 36, shortly after he revealed himself as the source of the NSA leaks in June 2013. He was outside the U.S. when the charges were unsealed and has not returned to face prosecution. Mr. Snowden was interviewed by Mr. Noah while appearing remotely from Russia, where he has lived for the last six years.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
