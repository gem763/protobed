From clever apps to canny tips, here\u2019s a guide to getting into good habits \u2026 while still having money for a flutter\n\nPay yourself first\n\nRather than treating savings as an afterthought, set up a standing order into a separate account as soon as you get paid, says Anna Bowes, the co-founder of Savings Champion. \u201cThat way it can become just another bill, but one that you will benefit from in the future.\u201d\n\nJasmine Birtles, the founder of MoneyMagpie.com, calls it paying yourself first. \u201cEveryone says they have no money at the end of the month to put into savings,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to put the money into a savings account at the beginning of the month.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much it is, says Bowes, as long as you start. Some savings accounts accept payments from just \u00a31.\n\nSet goals\n\nWhile most finance experts advocate saving into a pension, retirement should not be your only goal. Shorter-term goals may be more motivating. If you usually pay for your holiday by credit card and pay it back over months, consider saving for it in advance.\n\nMany banks let you set specific markers that show you how much progress you are making towards your target. When you have ticked off one goal, keep saving for the next.\n\nUse technology\n\nBirtles recommends the \u201csavings jars\u201d offered by digital banks such as Monzo and Starling, which allow you to separate money from your current account, but move it back easily if you need it. Many of these banks also let you set spending limits \u2013 either overall daily maximums or for different categories of purchases \u2013 then round up your spending to the nearest \u00a31 and squirrel away the difference.\n\nThere are also apps that may help kickstart a savings habit. Chip, for example, makes automatic \u201cmicrosavings\u201d based on how much you are spending. Birtles suggests Moneybox, which lets you put small amounts into an investment Isa. There are fees, she warns, \u201cbut it\u2019s still worth doing as it gets you into stock market investing with just 50p here and there.\u201d\n\nLock your money away\n\nIf you find a savings account linked to your current account too easy to plunder, open one at a different bank and pick one without a cash card. You could even destroy the online login details if you really don\u2019t trust yourself.\n\nAlternatively, go for an account that restricts your access. Regular savings accounts often have terms and conditions that you need to stick to. \u201cThat could discourage skipping deposits and making withdrawals,\u201d says Bowes.\n\nHave a flutter\n\nPremium bonds may not be fashionable or hi-tech, but every bond you own has the chance of winning you up to \u00a31m. Though you are likely to get better returns from a good savings account, you need just \u00a325 to buy bonds, and they are a bit of a faff to cash in, which should help you resist withdrawing your cash. Plus there\u2019s always the hope that next month could be your lucky one \u2026", "description": "It doesn\u2019t matter how little you put away, the trick is to get started.
