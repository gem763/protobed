Unicorns are Queer Horses, I is for Intersex, A is for Asexual, What Is Privilege???, and Transitioning \u2013 all topics Amer apparently believes are on the minds of preschoolers.\n\nIn the video What Is Gender? Amer and her teddy bear teach toddlers, \u201cDid you know that some people aren\u2019t boys or girls? Some people are boys \u2026 some people are girls \u2026 and some people are people.\u201d\n\nTransgender individuals, Amer says in the video, are \u201cpeople who do not identify with the gender the doctors tell them they are when they are born.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad doctors!\u201d reads a recent post at 4thWaveNow, a site that welcomes the views of \u201cparent-skeptics who question medicalising gender-atypical youth\u201d and that promotes \u201cfree speech,\u201d \u201cscience,\u201d and \u201crational feminism.\u201d\n\nThe writer continues:\n\nDo tell, readers. When you were 3 or 4 years old, would the words \u201cidentify as\u201d make any sense to you? Can you picture your mom or dad casting aspersions on those dumb doctors who jumped the gun, and stupidly TOLD your parents you were a boy or girl?\n\nWhen Teddy expresses confusion about how to tell who is a boy and who is a girl if \u201call of them can wear ties and dresses,\u201d Amer responds, \u201cThat\u2019s actually really easy, Teddy. All you have to do is ask someone what their pronouns are.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy, preschooler,\u201d states 4thWaveNow. \u201cJust take a few minutes out of your busy play day to inquire whether Jimmy or Judy were assigned the wrong sex at birth by doctors\u2014you know, doctors, the people your parents told you to trust when they jabbed you with those ouchy pre-K shots?\u201d\n\n4.

Even toddlers can understand it.\u201d\n\nAmer recently presented her views at an official TED conference. Her bio on the TED site states her \u201ceducational video series \u2026 breaks down complex ideas around gender and sexuality through songs and metaphors.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving kids and their families a vocabulary to express themselves, Amer is helping to create more empathetic adults \u2013 and spreading a message of radical acceptance in a world where it\u2019s sometimes dangerous to just be yourself,\u201d the bio continues. \u201c\u2019I want kids to grow up and into themselves with pride for who they are and who they can be,\u2019 Amer says.\u201d\n\nWhile Amer recommends adults watch the videos first before showing them to their toddlers or pre-school students, she does direct them to another site called itgetsbetter.org/glossary for assistance in the language of gender ideology in order to facilitate the preschoolers\u2019 learning.\n\nHer videos have corresponding activity sheets and lesson plans for teachers to use in classrooms as well as \u201cqueer-inclusive classroom tips.\u201d\n\nIn August, Amer joined other LGBTQ+ individuals with YouTube channels in a federal lawsuit against YouTube and its parent company Google. As Variety reported, the coalition alleged sexual orientation discrimination against the tech giant by restricting their ability to make money off their videos.\n\nVariety reported:\n\nIn their lawsuit, these creators allege that YouTube regularly labels their videos as offensive or sexually explicit simply because of their sexual orientation. They also allege that their videos are regularly being demonetized, that YouTube changes their thumbnail videos, and excludes them from content recommendations, resulting in suppressed view counts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud that so many LGBTQ creators have chosen YouTube as a place to share their stories and build community,\u201d a YouTube spokesperson said, according to Variety. \u201cOur policies have no notion of sexual orientation or gender identity and our systems do not restrict or demonetize videos based on these factors or the inclusion of terms like \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018transgender.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we have strong policies prohibiting hate speech, and we quickly remove content that violates our policies and terminate accounts that do so repeatedly,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "description": "Queer Kid Stuff is an LGBTQ YouTube channel that targets preschoolers as it seeks to instruct them in gender ideology and social justice.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/teddy-bear-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
