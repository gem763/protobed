Surveillance video indicates that Sacoolas, who is American, was driving \u201con the wrong side of the road\u201d on the night of the fatal crash, police said. British media reported that she had recently arrived in the country, leading to a theory that she may have been unaccustomed to driving on the left, as is the rule in Britain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing the fatal crash, Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity under international law, allowing her to avoid prosecution and return to the United States \u2014 despite telling officials she had no plans to do so.\n\n\u201cThe woman was driving on the wrong side of the road. And that can happen, you know. Those are the opposite roads. That happens. I won\u2019t say it ever happened to me, but it did,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSo a young man was killed. The person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity. We\u2019re going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet,\u201d he added.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents have frequently expressed hope that Trump would consider waiving diplomatic immunity so that Sacoolas could be held accountable in the British legal system. However, the U.S. Embassy noted in a statement that \u201cimmunity is rarely waived.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s suggestion that a meeting between Sacoolas and Harry Dunn\u2019s grieving parents might be possible, Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford captured a shot at the news conference of Trump\u2019s National Security Council briefing notes, labeled \u201cSecret,\u201d that appeared to contradict that idea. One note read: \u201c(If Raised) Note, as Secretary Pompeo told Foreign Secretary [Dominic] Raab, that the spouse of the U.S. Government employee will not return to the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe Dunn case has sparked controversy at home and abroad and placed the issue of diplomatic immunity under intense scrutiny. Since Harry Dunn\u2019s death, his parents, Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, have tirelessly campaigned for justice, calling on British and American officials to help hold Sacoolas accountable.\n\nAfter meeting Wednesday with Raab, the British foreign secretary the parents said they were \u201cno further forward\u201d and told Sky News they were \u201cdisgusted.\u201d They said they felt they had been \u201c extremely let down\u201d by both the British and U.S. governments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPart of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the U.K. government side to show they are trying to help,\u201d Charles said before vowing to continue her fight to obtain justice for her son.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it\u2019s okay to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away,\u201d Tim Dunn added.\n\nOn Tuesday, the parents said they had heard \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d from the Sacoolas family since the fatal collision.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump carried briefing notes saying that the driver allegedly at fault, the wife of a US. diplomat, would not return to Britain.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8xnWjmGNy5r-DwiFiSm4LW_mtY8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AZPCHRYYWBAORNEV33FINGPZCU.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
