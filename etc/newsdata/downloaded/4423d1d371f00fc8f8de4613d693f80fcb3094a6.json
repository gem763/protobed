But why then have we seen ATC come out and buy products?\" he said.\n\nSeveral trading sources said Aramco had bought at least 120,000 tonnes of diesel for prompt loading in the UAE. It was not clear if the purchases were a result of the attacks.\n\nGary Ross, founder of Black Gold Investors and a veteran oil industry expert, said it was difficult not to believe that Riyadh was being \"overly optimistic\" in its timeline for repairs. \"Tightness is coming,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said his company had more than 60 million barrels of crude inside the country, without specifying how much was abroad.\n\nAramco holds oil in storage in Okinawa in Japan, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and at the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir.\n\nQuestions also persist about the speed at which stores at home or abroad have been depleted. Data analytics firm Kayrros estimated Saudi stocks at home fell by nearly 10 million barrels in a single day to 66.5 million barrels on Sept. 16 from 76.4 million on Sept. 15.\n\nSome major clients are already turning to other suppliers to meet their needs. The trading arm of China's Sinopec, Asia's top refiner, chartered at least four crude tankers this week from the United States, ramping up its U.S. shipments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSWITCHING GRADES\n\nEven if Saudi Arabia keeps the same volumes flowing to customers, there are signs it may struggle to supply the same grades, an important factor for refiners whose plants are often built to handle a specific range of lighter or heavier crudes.\n\nAbqaiq was the key hub processing for Arab Light and Arab Extra Light coming from the Ghawar, Shaybah and Khurais fields.\n\nAramco informed at least six refiners in Asia it would still supply full allocated volumes of crude in October, but at least two have been told of a grade switch.\n\nIndia's Reliance Industries was due to load a shipment of Arab Light just before the attacks but was now taking Arab Heavy instead, two trade sources said. Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Saudi Arabia's ability to avert a global oil supply crunch will only become clear in a few weeks, because for now its crude held in storage can fill the gap and mask the scale of damage to its facilities, traders and analysts say.
