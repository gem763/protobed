Maybe in the next year or two you could see that matchup, but I\u2019ve got some work to do. I\u2019m more than happy to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa Boi\u201d hopes to make some progress in his weight class this weekend, though. After bouncing between middleweight and light heavyweight, he is back in the lower division where he said he feels more comfortable.\n\nAnders knows he\u2019s got a dangerous opponent in Meerschaert, who has finished 27 of his 29 career wins inside the distance, but he said he won\u2019t hold back anything against him on fight night.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not play stupid or coy: I\u2019m on a mission,\u201d Anders said. \u201cEvery time I step in there it\u2019s to do one thing and that\u2019s win in devastating fashion.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place at Amalie Arena. The entire card streams on ESPN+.\n\nFor more from Anders, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Eryk Anders doesn't have any delusions about his place in the UFC middleweight pecking order.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/eryk-anders-ufc-tampa-media-day-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
