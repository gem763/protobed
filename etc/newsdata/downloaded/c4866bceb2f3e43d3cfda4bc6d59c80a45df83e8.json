The latest? Protesters \u201cbooing\u201d the Chinese national anthem \u201cMarch of the Volunteers\u201d during a World Cup qualifier match between Hong Kong and Iran at the Hong Kong Stadium yesterday.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, protesters also formed a long human chain during the game, after a call to do so was posted online. The televised game was attended by 13,942 people.\n\nBefore the game kicked off, hundreds of fans sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d a song which many Hong Kongers are touting as their new national anthem.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that some even raised their middle fingers as the Chinese national anthem played, while others turned their backs away from the field.\n\nThe act is particularly defiant at the moment, as a proposed anthem law is still in the works. The bill, which has not been withdrawn, would make any insult or alteration to the Chinese national anthem a criminal act. Offenders could face up to three years of prison time or a fine of HK$50,000 (approx. US$6,400).\n\nAs a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong officially adopted the Chinese anthem as their own after the 1997 handover.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time for Hong Kongers to protest during a football game. In November 2015, following the large-scale Umbrella Movement protests, football fans booed the Chinese national anthem during a game where Hong Kong faced off with the mainland\u2019s team. Similar protests have increased since then.\n\nFor the last 14 weeks, Hong Kongers have protested an extradition bill which has now been withdrawn officially. But rallies continue as their demands have expanded.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "This is not the first time pro-democracy protests happened in a sporting event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d789001363d8500086b0b59/lede/1568182340698-football-fans-booing.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8739xh;0xw,0.0426xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
