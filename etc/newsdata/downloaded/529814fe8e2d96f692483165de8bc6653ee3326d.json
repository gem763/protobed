Pictured left before and after the treatment right\n\nThe treatment is available at Dr Judy Todd's Synergy Advanced Skincare & Aesthetics Clinic in Glasgow's Southside for \u00a32,950\n\nThe physical therapist, said: 'I was in and out in my lunch hour and genuinely looked ten years younger less than two weeks later once the treatment had worked its magic.'\n\n'I am inundated with friends asking me how I've managed to turn back the years and many cannot believe this was done during my lunch hour. I feel like a new woman. I am getting so many compliments, I never believed that you could make such a difference without having a full surgical facelift.'\n\nShe confessed that the treatment, which she received at Dr Judy Todd's Synergy Clinic in Glasgow's Southside for \u00a32,950, made her feel more 'relaxed' and 'at ease' than she would have going under the knife.\n\nShe admitted: 'I have never liked the idea of going under the knife because I saw so many people who got terrible results with lopsided faces.\n\nFrances (left before the treatment and right after) says she feels like a 'new woman' and 'never believed that you could make such a difference' without going under the knife\n\nNHS consultant anaesthetist Judy (pictured) offers groundbreaking non-surgical procedures and treats a number of A-list Scottish stars who want to look younger discreetly\n\n'I feel so lucky to have found a non-surgical solution with an amazing doctor who made me feel so relaxed and at ease throughout the procedure which was done so quickly.\n\nFrances' skin problems started 30-years ago, when she fell asleep sunbathing using sunflower oil to speed up the tanning process.\n\nShe woke up with sunburn so bad that doctors at the Western Infirmary thought she'd had a pan of boiling oil poured over her.\n\nFrances said: 'I had terrible burns on my neck and chest. My neck never really recovered and the skin was all crinkly after the wounds healed, making me look years older than my real age.\n\nFrances suffered terrible burns on her neck and chest 30-years ago, when she fell asleep sunbathing using sunflower oil to speed up the tanning process\n\n'It made very self-conscious about my appearance and I would always cover up by neck by wearing polo necks and scarves.\n\n'I always wanted to sort it out but was wary of having cosmetic surgery because of the expense and the horror stories you read about operations going wrong.'\n\nFrances then met Dr Judy Todd, a consultant anaesthetist who also runs the Synergy Clinic in Glasgow, offering ground-breaking non-surgical treatments.\n\nShe treats a number of A-list Scottish stars who want to look younger discreetly and are keen to avoid the stigma attached with having a full facelift.\n\nFrances (pictured) says she's ' inundated' with friends asking how she's managed to 'turn back the years' and insisted that can't believe she did it all on her lunch break\n\nFrances said: 'I very nervous beforehand and doubtful that a non-surgical treatment could work. But the heat treatment and liposuction dissolved away the fat that was giving me the turkey neck and the double chin.\n\n'My skin was tight again and I had a whole new face. For the last few years, I had been reluctant to go out without covering up. Now I am so confident and enjoy dressing up and going out for dinners and drinks. I can honestly say I have so much more body confidence.'\n\nThe FaceTite treatment uses heat from radio frequency energy to tighten loose and baggy skin and remove excess fat and tightens up the skin by up to 40%.\n\nFaceTite probe is inserted under the skin through small incisions and the heat causes skin to contract - lifting the face by shrinking and tightening the skin while also killing some of the fat cells\n\nFrances also had a 20-minute session under the Forma skin tightening machine. This heats the layers under the skin to stimulate new collagen and pump up the face\n\nWhen the technology is also used on the neck, it lifts the jowls and gives a more clearly defined jawline.\n\nOnce the anaesthetic has taken effect, the FaceTite probe is inserted under the skin through small incisions and the heat causes skin to contract.\n\nThis lifts the face by shrinking and tightening the skin and kills some of the fat cells while further fat is removed from the neck and jowls through liposuction to heighten jawline definition.\n\nFat is removed from the neck and jowls through liposuction to heighten jawline definition while the heat from the FaceTite also kills some of the fat cells\n\nFrances also had a 20-minute session under the Forma skin tightening machine. This heats the layers under the skin to stimulate new collagen and pump up the face.\n\nDr Todd said: 'I am delighted that Frances has had such a fantastic result and looks years younger.\n\n'Non-invasive treatments are gradually taking over from conventional facial cosmetic surgery because they work just as well at a fraction of the cost.\n\n'As an NHS consultant, I really believe that they are the way forward for women and men who want to transform their sagging faces but are wary of full surgery and are looking for a more discreet solution.'", "description": "Frances Barrett, 55, from Glasgow, says she looks 'ten years younger' after undergoing a non-surgical facelift on her lunch break which took only 90 minutes and improved her neck,chest and chin.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19845100-0-image-a-85_1571326092945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
