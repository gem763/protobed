(AP) \u2014 Some St. Louis County leaders are calling for a police leadership shakeup after a jury found that a sergeant was discriminated against because he\u2019s gay and recommended that he be awarded nearly $20 million.\n\nThe police officer of 22 years was told to \u201ctone down your gayness\u201d if he ever wanted a promotion to lieutenant, according to a discrimination lawsuit.\n\nCouncilwoman Lisa Clancy says Police Chief Jon Belmar should resign because of what she described as a \u201cculture of rampant racism and homophobia.\u201d The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that she and another council members also called for County Executive Sam Page to replace members of the police board that holds the power to fire the chief.\n\nPage could replace the entire board because all five members are serving on expired terms. Page said in a statement that those appointments were \u201cforthcoming\u201d but didn\u2019t indicate whether he thought Belmar should remain in his job.\n\nBelmar didn\u2019t respond to a call seeking comment.", "description": "The officer was told to \u2018tone down your gayness\u2019 by his lieutenant if he ever wanted a promotion.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU143_Office_ZG_20191028122521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
