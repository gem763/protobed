(AP) - Cornerback Patrick Peterson\u2019s return to the Arizona Cardinals practice facility included a gift for teammate Larry Fitzgerald, whose birthday he had missed while serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance enhancers.\n\nIt was a framed poster of the world\u2019s top 100 golf courses. Someday, Peterson hopes to play a few of them with the star receiver.\n\nBut first, there\u2019s work to do.\n\n\u201cIt should be a great 10-game season for me,\u201d Peterson said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m planning on this being the best 10 games I\u2019ve played in my career.\u201d\n\nPeterson, a three-time All-Pro, returns just as a young Cardinals team has started to build some confidence. Arizona (2-3-1) has won two straight games and will try to get back to .500 when it faces the New York Giants in a road game on Sunday.\n\nPeterson said he spent a big chunk of his suspension training at 7,000 feet of altitude in the mountains in Flagstaff, about two hours north of Phoenix. He would simulate games each week, placing cones around the field and mirroring different routes, like he would defend on the field.\n\nHis only real concern is tackling, which is hard to simulate. But from a conditioning perspective, Peterson said Wednesday\u2019s first full workout went well.\n\n\u201cIt was a piece of cake,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt felt like a walkthrough for me. I don\u2019t know if I was so geeked, the anxiety, or what it was, but it was like I didn\u2019t even practice today. I felt really well. I had a great bounce in my step today and just ready to get out there and face some live action.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been ideal - the Cardinals rank 30th in the league in pass defense - but it has allowed several young players to get ample experience.\n\nThree rookies, including cornerback Byron Murphy Jr. and safeties Deionte Thompson and Jalen Thompson, have been a part of the recent two-game winning streak.\n\nThey\u2019ve made some good plays. They\u2019ve also made quite a few mistakes. But everyone on the Cardinals agrees they\u2019re much farther along in their development than typical rookies.\n\nNow, Peterson\u2019s presence gives the Cardinals a little experience and elite talent to combine with youthful enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThe ability just to say, \u2018You\u2019ve got this guy and help in other areas.\u2019 I think that\u2019s a big positive,\u201d coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \u201cWhen you have a dominant player like him, you can put him on the best receiver and try to help the coverage in other areas, and we weren\u2019t able to do that.\u201d\n\nPeterson gave Arizona\u2019s rookie quarterback Kyler Murray high praise on Wednesday, saying it\u2019s obvious that the 22-year-old knows how to win games and has already started to prove it at the NFL level.\n\nThe nine-year veteran - who had never missed a game until the suspension - said it\u2019s the job of the defense to \u201ctake the next step and start finishing football games.\u201d\n\nMurray didn\u2019t hesitate to say that Peterson got the best of him during Wednesday\u2019s practice. He also said it\u2019s good to have him back.\n\n\u201cHe brings that leadership back to the locker room,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHe\u2019s been here a long time. He\u2019s one of the best to ever do it. I know we\u2019re very happy to have him back, I\u2019m very happy to have him back and I can\u2019t wait to see him go to work on Sunday.\u201d\n\nPeterson didn\u2019t elaborate much on his suspension other than to say he felt bad that he wasn\u2019t able to help his teammates during the first six weeks of the season.\n\nHe said watching from the couch wasn\u2019t much fun.\n\n\u201cI really just hope I did not tarnish what I stand for, what I\u2019ve done up until this point in my career,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a great player. I have no reason to cheat. I work my tail off too hard each and every offseason to be in this situation.\n\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation that I wish I could have back, but I can\u2019t. We\u2019re moving forward. I\u2019m looking forward to the Giants.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cornerback Patrick Peterson's return to the Arizona Cardinals practice facility included a gift for teammate Larry Fitzgerald, whose birthday he had missed while serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/falcons_cardinals_football_51139_c0-141-3379-2112_s1200x700.jpg?fbcb9e2745bcb0ae3441169447de4c97dee5a699", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
