[Photo/VCG]\n\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia - Thirty-five foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near the Muslim holy city of Medina, Saudi state media said on Thursday.\n\nThe accident on Wednesday evening involved a collision between \"a private chartered bus ...with a heavy vehicle\" near the western city, a spokesman for Medina police said, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThose involved were Arab and Asian pilgrims traveling from Medina to Mecca, according to Saudi media, which carried pictures of the bus engulfed in flames and with its windows blown out.\n\nThe injured have been transferred to Al-Hamna Hospital, the Saudi Press Agency added. Authorities have launched an investigation.\n\nThe Okaz newspaper said that the victims were expatriates who lived in Saudi Arabia and who were performing the umrah - the lesser pilgrimage to the Muslim holy places, which can be undertaken year round.\n\nThis year about 2.5 million pilgrims traveled to the kingdom from across the world in August to take part in the annual hajj pilgrimage - one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\nThe hajj and the umrah center on Mecca and its surrounding hills and valleys, in the west of the country, but the itinerary also often takes in the other holy city of Medina.\n\nLast year, a high-speed train line was opened linking Mecca and Medina in just two-and-a-half hours, halving the previous travel time.\n\nSaudi Prince Faisal bin Salman, the governor of Medina region, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, the Saudi Press Agency said.\n\nThe nationalities of the victims was not known but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also sent his condolences.\n\n\"Anguished by the news of a bus crash near Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. Praying for a quick recovery of the injured,\" he tweeted.\n\nTransporting worshippers around the holy sites, particularly during the hajj, is a huge challenge for Saudi Arabia. During the pilgrimage, the roads can be chaotic with thousands of buses creating interminable traffic jams at all hours.\n\nPast tragedies\n\nFour British pilgrims were killed and 12 others injured in April last year when their bus collided with a fuel tanker while they were on the way to Mecca. And in January 2017, six Britons, including a two-month-old baby, were killed in a minibus on their way to Medina after making a pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nIn September 2015, a stampede killed up to 2,300 worshippers - including hundreds of Iranians - in the worst disaster to strike the hajj. Earlier that month, 100 people were killed when a construction crane toppled into a courtyard of Mecca's Grand Mosque.\n\nAs part of efforts to diversify its oil-dependent economy, the ultraconservative kingdom wants to foster a year-round religious tourism sector that attracts millions of pilgrims.\n\nUntil last month, it only issued visas to Muslim pilgrims, foreign workers and recently to spectators at sporting or cultural events, but tourists are now allowed to visit as part of the drive to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.\n\nAgence France-presse", "description": "Thirty-five foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near the Muslim holy city of Medina, Saudi state media said on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/18/5da91c24a310cf3e97a1d65f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
