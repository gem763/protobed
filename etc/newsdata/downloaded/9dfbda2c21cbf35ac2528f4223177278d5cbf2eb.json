Her name is Eloise, and she lives up to her name \u2014 she's as fiery and precocious as the literary character we named her after.\n\nBut as our third daughter, she\u2019s proven to us that we aren\u2019t the experts in parenting that we thought we were.\n\nRead More from the author Brianna Bell: How Relinquishing Control Over Our House Helped Save My Marriage\n\nAt 20 months old, Eloise continues to remain an anomaly in our family. While the rest of us eat with a ferocious appetite, Eloise is steadfast in her disinterest and refusal to eat. As her mother, my instincts tell me it\u2019s more than disinterest, although allergy testing and elimination diets have failed to deliver a diagnosis.\n\nWe\u2019ve prayed she\u2019d grow out of her aversion to food, but at nearly two, she continues to refuse to eat, pushing away purees and sliced fruit in equal displeasure.\n\nHer weight is low \u2014 a waif little girl who is prone to catching every virus to which she\u2019s exposed. We all worry about her. Our pediatrician is on speed dial, and I regularly check in with occupational therapists, trying my best to get her to eat the foods she\u2019s meant to. She\u2019s been tested for a host of illnesses, poked and probed by more doctors than I can count, but she continues to remain without a diagnosis.\n\nWhatever is placed in her mouth will be chewed and spit out, leaving me to wonder why I even bother.\n\nShe is not failure to thrive, although I worry that we teeter dangerously close.\n\nShe receives sufficient calories and nourishment, for now, because she breastfeeds. Her frequency of feeds is nearer to a newborn that an almost two-year-old.\n\nMeal time in our home requires careful precision, choosing foods that are high fat, and also of varying flavours, colours and textures. A typical meal might include bite-sized strawberries, cubed cheddar cheese, naan bread, diced cucumber, tender shredded chicken and high fat yogurt. I offer her these foods knowing that most will end up on the floor or pushed aside.\n\nRead about some options if you're introducing solids: Starting Solids \u2014 Do I Choose Baby-Led Weaning Or Spoon Feeding?\n\nWhatever is placed in her mouth will be chewed and spit out, leaving me to wonder why I even bother.\n\nInevitably, she will cry out at the end of the meal, pulling down my shirt to nurse hungrily at my breasts, a tear sliding down my cheek in defeat.\n\nAt night I find myself running down a rabbit hole of fears and anxieties. What have I done wrong? Am I making things worse by nursing her so much? My instincts tell me that my breasts have kept her from a feeding tube, and that without my miraculous milk supply we would be worse off. But I\u2019ve been accused of filling her up with my milk and spoiling her by giving her what she wants.\n\nWe are two beating hearts operating like a single unit, and that\u2019s a beautiful thought in the short-term, but it\u2019s become a burden I no longer want to carry.\n\nI know that can\u2019t be true. I\u2019ve offered her foods first and tried telling her she cannot nurse. But I know that to stop nursing would be to risk starvation, and I cannot go down that road.\n\nIn the last few months I have mentally struggled with the reality that my body might be keeping my child alive. I feel burdened by this thought, not just because it\u2019s a horrifying concept, but because I am so desperately weary from it all. The calories she receives through breastfeeding are enough to keep her at a decent weight, but the price is high for my mental health. My breasts are connected to me, and she is often connected to my breasts. We are two beating hearts operating like a single unit, and that\u2019s a beautiful thought in the short-term, but it\u2019s become a burden I no longer want to carry.\n\nI sometimes dream about weaning her. I wonder what it would be like to be free. We\u2019ve tried bottles and a variety of milks and formulas, but nothing seems to appeal to her \u2014 not in the way nursing does. I\u2019m afraid to deny her milk would mean a dip in my supply, and what happens if her health suffers because of it? It\u2019s an impossible situation, and I continue to face the choice between myself and my child. Of course, I\u2019m her mother, and I will choose my child a million times over. I do, every time she pulls my shirt down, and a tear slides down my cheek.\n\nYou Might Also Like: Breastfeeding photo series challenges stereotypes of Indigenous parents\n\nDefeat and triumph mixed together, because she\u2019s feeding, but it feels like with each feed I\u2019m losing sight of me.\n\nNext month, Eloise has a three-hour appointment at McMaster Children\u2019s Hospital. We\u2019ll meet with a team of doctors and specialists who will look at her feeding, swallowing and nutrition. The appointment has been on our calendar for many months, and as it draws nearer, my hope rises, my expectation high that we will finally solve this feeding puzzle. It\u2019s this appointment that keeps me motivated, drawing nearer to a conclusion to this nightmare.\n\nI want my daughter, my sweet, energetic, buoyant and bright little girl, to finally enjoy the full health that she deserves. On lonely nights I can forget that my aching breasts and bruised spirit are a byproduct of the biggest question in my life right now: Why won\u2019t Eloise eat?", "description": "I know a lot of kids have trouble eating, but she's 20 months and won't eat anything but breastmilk.
