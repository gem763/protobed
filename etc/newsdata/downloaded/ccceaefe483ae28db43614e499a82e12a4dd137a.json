Washington manager Dave Martinez, still enraged at umpires, was ejected during the seventh-inning stretch, screaming as a pair of his coaches held him back while the crowd sang along to \"Deep in the Heart of Texas.\"\n\nRendon added a two-run double off Chris Devenski in the ninth to just about seal it after Strasburg gutted through without his best fastball to throw five-hit ball for 8 1/3 innings.\n\nWashington Nationals starting pitcher Stephen Strasburg reacts after Houston Astros' Michael Brantley grounded out to end the fifth inning of Game 6 of the baseball World Series Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019, in Houston. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nNationals pitcher Max Scherzer, boosted by an injection of painkiller, is primed to return from an irritated nerve in his neck to start Game 7, Martinez said before the game. Scherzer was warming up in the seventh before Rendon's homer, then sat down as Martinez became the first manager tossed from a Series game since Atlanta's Bobby Cox in 1996.\n\nNow the Nationals will attempt their ultimate comeback in a year in which they were written off time after time, hoping for the first title in the 51-season history of a franchise that started as the Montreal Expos and the first for Washington since the Senators in 1924. Zack Greinke will be on the mound for the Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins and are seeking their second title in three seasons.\n\nVisiting teams have won three straight Game 7s in the Series since the Cardinals defeated Texas at home in 2011.\n\nWashington rebounded from a 19-31 start - the Nats were given just a 1.6% chance to win the Series on May 23 - to finish 93-69. They rebounded from a 3-1 eighth-inning deficit against Milwaukee in the NL wild-card game, a two games to one deficit vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series and a 2-1, fifth-inning deficit in Game 6 vs. the Astros.\n\nOutscored 19-3 at Nationals Park while going 1 for 21 with runners in scoring position, the Nationals got the strong outing they needed from Strasburg, who allowed his only runs in the first inning, struck out seven and walked two while throwing 104 pitches.\n\nHe improved to 5-0 in six postseason starts this October despite failing to get a swing and miss in the first two innings for the first time this year, and eight of nine swings and misses overall were on breaking balls. Strasburg escaped a two-on, two-outs jam in the fourth by striking out Carlos Correa.\n\nAfter George Springer's one-out double put runners at second and third in the fifth, Jos\u00e9 Altuve struck out on curve in the dirt and Michael Brantley hit a hard grounder to second.\n\nSean Doolittle got the final two outs as the Nationals bullpen headed into Game 7 relatively rested. He gave up a two-out double to Correa before retiring Robinson Chirinos on a popup.\n\nVerlander dropped to 0-6 with a 5.68 ERA in seven Series starts, a blemish on his otherwise sterling career.\n\nIn the first game with lead changes since the opener, Rendon's RBI single through a shifted infield put the Astros ahead in the first. Verlander gave up 10 runs in the first inning during six postseason starts this year after allowing 12 during 34 regular-season outings,\n\nHouston needed just four pitches to tie the score. Springer lined a fastball off the left-field scoreboard, at 112 mph off the bat the hardest-hit ball of the Series. He advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Altuve's sacrifice fly to left, easily beating Soto's throw.\n\nBregman put the Astros ahead on Strasburg's 12th pitch, driving a fastball into the Crawford Boxes over the left-field scoreboard for his fourth home run of the postseason and third of the Series. Bregman carried his bat out of the batter's box and tried to hand it to first base coach Don Kelly, only for the bat to fall as Kelly stuck out his hand for a shake.\n\nEaton tied the score in the fifth when Verlander hung a slider. Soto, who homered at age 20 in the opener, followed one out later with his second long ball after turning 21. He lined a high-and-inside fastball into the right-field upper deck, a no-doubt drive Verlander didn't bother to watch.\n\nSoto, too, flipped the bat at his first base coach, Tom Bogar.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nWashington Nationals' Juan Soto celebrates his home run against the Houston Astros during the fifth inning of Game 6 of the baseball World Series Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019, in Houston.
