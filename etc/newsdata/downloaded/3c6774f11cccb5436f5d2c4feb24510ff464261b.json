The approach, which doesn\u2019t require approval by Congress, would mark an important win for investors who have been betting politicians wouldn\u2019t follow through on those promises.\n\nTreasury officials said they would aim to privatize the government-controlled firms without making it tougher and more expensive for people to get mortgages. They generally avoided making specific policy recommendations on how to accomplish these goals in a report released Thursday.\n\nThey said they would work with federal regulators to flesh out the details on how to put Fannie and Freddie on a sounder financial footing as well as to curtail the firms\u2019 roles in housing finance. The process could take years to implement and won\u2019t affect existing mortgages.\n\n\u201cOur view is that the government footprint has become too big,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview ahead of Thursday\u2019s report. \u201cThere are people in Washington who are happy to leave this the way it is for another 10 or 20 years, and that\u2019s not us. We feel an obligation to try to fix this.\u201d\n\nFannie and Freddie don\u2019t make loans but instead buy them from lenders and package them into securities that are sold to other investors. Figuring out how to refashion the companies remains the largest single piece of unfinished business from the financial crisis. The government assumed control of the firms in 2008 during the height of the crisis to prevent their failure, which officials\u2019 feared would trigger a broader collapse in the housing market.\n\nThe report says the government would continue to backstop the companies after they are privatized, providing a line of credit in times of emergency, in return for a periodic fee.\n\nIf the administration follows through on privatizing the firms, they would essentially return to a status similar to before the financial crisis, with their effective duopolies intact, for lack of a better alternative.\n\nThough privatizing Fannie and Freddie remains a top priority for the Trump administration, any steps to quickly curtail the government\u2019s role in housing could prove disruptive to the housing market just as the 2020 campaign gets under way.\n\nTreasury officials minimized the risks, saying privatization will be slow and incremental and that they won\u2019t upend the availability of the popular 30-year fixed rate mortgage, a product ensured by Fannie and Freddie\u2019s business.\n\nIt also could be hard to meaningfully shrink the firms\u2019 housing footprint without affecting borrowing costs. The reason: If some mortgages are no longer bought by Fannie and Freddie, they would be bought by private investors who would demand higher interest rates because the loans wouldn\u2019t have government backing. Such backing is enjoyed by Fannie and Freddie.\n\n\u201cInvestors will be much pickier and charge more for the loans they are willing to invest in,\u201d said Jim Parrott, a former Obama administration housing adviser who is now an industry consultant. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we shouldn\u2019t consider reducing the government\u2019s role in places, but we should be honest about its impact.\"\n\nLeft unresolved were several key questions, such as what to do with the government\u2019s large stakes in the firms and how, exactly, to build up their capital so they can operate as private companies again.\n\nTreasury included few specifics for shrinking Fannie and Freddie\u2019s footprint in housing, though they suggested that their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, could limit the amount of multifamily mortgages that they are allowed to purchase.\n\nTreasury also said FHFA should reassess whether the companies\u2019 purchases of cash-out refinancings and loans for investment and vacation properties align with the firms\u2019 core mission.\n\nRelated Video Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back about half of new mortgages in the U.S. Now, talks are heating up about reshaping or shrinking the two companies, a move that could impact millions of Americans.

The firms would pay an \u201cappropriately priced\u201d periodic fee for that support.\n\nFannie and Freddie got into trouble during the crisis because they took on an increasing amount of risk while using their political clout to beat back attempts to force them to hold more capital. They amassed huge investment portfolios to profit from the difference between their lower cost of capital\u2014a benefit of an implied federal guarantee because Congress created the firms\u2014and the rates they could earn on mortgages.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you think President Trump\u2019s proposal will affect the mortgage market in the coming years? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Wall Street firms raced ahead of Fannie and Freddie by packaging larger quantities of riskier loans that often weren\u2019t eligible for backing by the mortgage-finance giants. By 2005, Fannie and Freddie were losing market share and began loosening their own loan standards to compete, taking on more risks at what would later prove to be the worst possible time. By August 2008, Treasury officials concluded the firms didn\u2019t have enough capital and feared what would happen if investors lost confidence in Fannie and Freddie.\n\nIn September of that year, the government seized the companies through a process known as conservatorship, during the George W. Bush administration. In return for injecting about $190 billion into the firms, the government created a new class of stock\u2014senior preferred shares\u2014that paid an annual 10% dividend, along with warrants to acquire nearly 80% of the firms\u2019 common stock. The Treasury revamped its bailout agreement in 2012 to require nearly all the firms\u2019 profits be swept to the federal Treasury in lieu of dividend payments on those preferred shares. Some investors filed suit over the change.\n\nTrump administration officials say they are compelled to act because the conservatorship was meant to be temporary. They also say the government should cease playing a central role in housing, a massive sector that touches on some 15% of the economy.\n\nIn recent years, Fannie and Freddie\u2019s strong profits have more than made taxpayers whole for the federal money they received after the crisis.\n\nWashington\u2019s about-face will come as little surprise to market participants who for years predicted that efforts to replace Fannie and Freddie, which together back around half of all outstanding mortgages, would prove too difficult. But the shift nevertheless illustrates one way in which ideologues appear to have lost ground to market realities.\n\nWhile Treasury\u2019s report envisions Congress passing legislation to refashion the nation\u2019s $10 trillion mortgage market, that is a heavy political lift as the 2020 campaigns get under way\u2014rarely a window for sweeping bipartisan change in Washington. Current and former administration officials concede Congress is unlikely to tackle the issue.\n\nWrite to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration said it would support returning mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to private hands, a development that could keep the companies at the center of the housing market for decades to come.", "authors": ["Andrew Ackerman", "Kate Davidson", "Andrew.Ackerman Wsj.Com", "Kate.Davidson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104422/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
