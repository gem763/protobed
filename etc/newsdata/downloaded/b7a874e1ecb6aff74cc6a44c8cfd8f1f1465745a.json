Cory Booker (D-NJ) during CNN's Democratic presidential debate earlier this month for continually interjecting President Barack Obama's name whenever possible.\n\n\"First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign,\" Booker said. \"You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.\"\n\nBiden has attempted to run with President Obama's record while paving his own path and vision for the nation. While other Democrats, like Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) continually push for Medicare For All, Biden has defended Obamacare and said politicians should build on the Affordable Care Act, not tear it down.\n\nBiden has attempted to latch onto Obama's voter appeal so much that, back in June, the former vice president wished a \"Happy Best Friends Day\" to Obama.\n\nBut during a town hall meeting, Biden couldn't think of President Barack Obama's name.\n\n\"He's [Donald Trump] saying that it was President...\" Biden trails off, trying to come up with Obama's name. \"...my boss, his [Barack Obama] fault.\"\n\nJoe Biden appears to forget Barack Obama's name pic.twitter.com/ffyaqSHYBA \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) August 28, 2019\n\nWhat's wrong, Joe? Cat got your tongue? What happened to Barack being your best friend? Most people can name their so-called best friend right away. Most people can name off the person they worked under for eight years, no problem.\n\nMost politicians would be able to name someone they worked so closely with for such a long period of time, especially if they're trying to get a job based on the other person's performance.\n\nThis wasn't just a slip up. This is a sign of a bigger problem. And if this moment doesn't call into Biden's ability to govern and lead this nation, nothing will.", "description": "Whoa..09/02/2019 3:09:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/cb6dab6e-e3c1-4399-a093-14bfc30b83ac.png"}
