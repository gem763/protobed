MORE was the major winner of the debate. He has moved the Overton window more than any other candidate in this race, taking an issue which nobody was talking about to the forefront of that stage.\n\nMoving the Overton window to literally debate UBI \u2014 Universal Basic Income \u2014 versus a a federal jobs guarantee is not something that anybody even two months would have predicted for the Democratic stage. It is an extraordinary remarkable achievement.\n\nBernie Sanders to his credit has at least been in office for 40 years, pushing these ideas. Andrew Yang a couple of years ago was one of those weird guys at a UBI conference and now he\u2019s brought it forefront of American politics. That shows that there is actually a new model for politics in this country and I\u2019m actually extraordinary excited about it. That the democratization of information that the internet, that the allowance of somebody like Andrew Yang can seize upon an issue that people actually care about \u2014 the job loss in this country.\n\nI actually don\u2019t even particularly agree with him on the issue of whether it\u2019s automation or trade policy. However, everyone can look around and now that your malls are closing, that there are kiosks. They can feel like melees and the depression that aches within so much of the middle and working class within our country.", "description": "Opinion by: Saagar Enjeti", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/newsletter-yang_100919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
