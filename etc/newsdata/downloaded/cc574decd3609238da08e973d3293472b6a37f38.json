Teams are very much more technical currently than the previous tournament.\n\n\u201cBut knowing we had the loss to Japan in 2015, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s stuck in our head. We know that it happened but this is four years later.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing Japan in the quarter-final so we will make sure we\u2019re really well prepared and won\u2019t have what happened in 2015 in the back of our heads.\u201d\n\nBoth Ireland and Scotland struggled to contain Japan\u2019s relentless energy in attack.\n\nThe pace and ruthlessness of wingers Kenki Fukuoka and Kotaro Matsushima has been key to their success, with the pair contributing nine tries between them so far.\n\nNeither rank among the giants of the game but at 5ft 7ins himself, Kolbe knows it is not always size that counts.\n\n\"There is a saying that dynamite comes in small packages,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it all depends on different players. We all have something special to contribute to our various teams.\n\n\u201cBoth Japanese wingers are playing really phenomenal rugby.\n\n\u201cI played against Fukuoka at the Rio Olympics. He\u2019s a really good player and is very powerful and explosive.\n\n\u201cI also played against Matsushima back in 2012 when he was playing in the Currie Cup in South Africa. I know he loves to run with the ball and have a lot of freedom.\n\n\u201cBut what happens on Sunday will come down to the team that wants it the most.\n\n\u201cJapan are playing some really exciting rugby. They are giving the ball a lot of air and they want to stretch your defence structures.\n\n\u201cThat is a style I love to play, but as a team we have our own plan that we will try to implement.\u201d\n\n- TeamTalk", "description": "Springbok wing Cheslin Kolbe says his side are not feeling the pressure due to their 2015 defeat to Japan ahead of this weekend's quarter-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2858/03e8ee6261e1421f95ad038eb17d33bc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
