Brady also passed Peyton Manning\u2019s career passing yardage total, climbing to No. 2 on the all-time list.\n\nThe Giants (2-4) fought hard in the first half, trailing 21-14 at the break. The Patriots defense shut out the Giants in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe just grinded it out pretty good,\u201d Brady told reporters. \u201cGot kind of forced into one grouping there in the second half. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened in 20 years, but defense played great, special teams played great.\n\n\u201cOutside of a few plays, it would have been pretty good. So, we\u2019re hanging in there.\u201d\n\nNeither offense scored in the first quarter. The Patriots took a 7-0 lead on a blocked punt at the end of the quarter. Brandon Bolden was credited with the block. Chase Winovich recovered the ball and returned it for a 6-yard score.\n\nFINAL: The @Patriots keep it rolling on #TNF! #NYGvsNE #GoPats\n\n(by @Lexus) pic.twitter.com/f6KuNcDCYS\u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 11, 2019\n\nPatriots defender Duron Harmon intercepted Giants rookie Daniel Jones in the second quarter and had a 27-yard return, giving New England the ball at the New York 20 yard line. Bolden capped off the Patriots\u2019 resulting drive with a 1-yard rushing score.\n\nJones made up for the miscue on the next drive, hooking up with Golden Tate for a 64-yard touchdown.\n\nGiants defender Lorenzo Carter sacked Brady on the Patriots\u2019 next drive. Markus Golden recovered a Brady fumble during the sack and had a 42-yard return for a touchdown, tying the score at 14-14.\n\nThe Patriots responded with an 11-play, 75-yard drive, capped off by Brady\u2019s first rushing score. Neither team scored in the third quarter. Kyle Van Noy also had a 22-yard fumble return for a score in the fourth frame, extending the Patriots\u2019 lead to 28-14. Brady returned to the end zone on the Patriots\u2019 next possession, scoring at the end of a 7-play, 63-yard drive.\n\nBrady Sneak: Part II@TomBrady's second rushing TD of the night! #GoPats\n\n: #NYGvsNE on @NFLNetwork | @NFLonFOX | @PrimeVideo\n\nHow to watch: https://t.co/I6INVckndX pic.twitter.com/3CGPnHdclu\u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 11, 2019\n\n\u201cAny of those defensive or special teams touchdowns are really kind of bonus points,\u201d Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think about getting those when you go into the game so to be able to get 14 of them was huge. That was a big spark.\n\n\u201cAgain, give the Giants credit. They battled back and they hit us on a big play and then they got a scoop-and-score and got back into the game as well. We\u2019ve got to avoid giving those kind of big plays up to offset the ones that we make. In the end, we made enough plays in the second half to come out on top.\u201d\n\nBrady completed 31 of 41 passes for 334 yards and an interception in the win. He also had six yards and two scores on seven carries. Sony Michel had 113 yards from scrimmage for the Patriots. Julian Edelman had 113 yards on nine catches in the win.\n\nJones completed 15 of 31 passes for 161 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions for the Giants. Tate had six catches for 102 yards and a score in the loss.\n\n\u201cWe battled, we didn\u2019t win though,\u201d Giants coach Pat Shurmur said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve got to make more plays so we can win. But I was proud of the way we battled. I\u2019ve never been disappointed with how hard our guys fight, but we got to find a way to make more plays than the other team and win the game.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots face the New York Jets at 8:15 p.m. EDT Oct. 21 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
