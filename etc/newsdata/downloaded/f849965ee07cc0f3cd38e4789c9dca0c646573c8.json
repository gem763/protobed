The pair endured a tumultuous six-year marriage before calling it quits in 2016. The estranged couple's divorce has yet to be finalized.\n\nNow, Stodden says she has a fresh perspective on life and has rediscovered herself through her music and as an animal rights activist. And she's hoping her new series, \u201cCourtney,\u201d will give viewers a new idea of who she really is.\n\nCOURTNEY STODDEN SAYS SHE DOESN'T REGRET MARRYING DOUG HUTCHISON AT AGE 16\n\nAs Fox News arrived at the swanky hair and beauty parlor located underground just off Beverly Hills\u2019 iconic Rodeo Drive, we were immediately met by co-executive producer and FNL Network executive Rocco Gaglioti in a panic.\n\n\u201cAre you here to speak with Courtney?\u201d he asked hurriedly. \u201cShe just got into an argument and is about to leave.\u201d\n\nGaglioti\u2019s introduction was a fitting start to an interview centered on Stodden\u2019s new reality show.\n\nEventually, Stodden entered, sporting a revealing bright pink dress and stilettos that elevated her 5-foot-3 frame. She appeared irritated, but her presence was immediately felt by everyone -- the charm turned on in an instant.\n\n\u201cI'm just looking to break out of myself. I've had a really crazy life and then it just got crazier when I became famous overnight and the rest is kind of history,\u201d Stodden said about doing the show. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Hollywood ever since just being celebrity Courtney Stodden and doing that. So I guess now I'm just trying to find myself and show people who I really am.\u201d\n\nCOURTNEY STODDEN IS UNRECOGNIZABLE IN THROWBACK PHOTO\n\nThe reality star, who swore off drinking after turning 25 in August, said part of getting sober and allowing the camera into her life was that she simply didn\u2019t want her life to end prematurely -- a fate that has befallen so many of her idols.\n\n\u201cI don't want to end up like Marilyn Monroe,\u201d said Stodden. \u201cI don't want to end up like Anna Nicole Smith. And I know FNL Network and Rocco Gaglioti, the owner, was friends with Anna Nicole and that's great, but I just want to just do what I want to do and that's music and singing and just show people really who I am \u2013 the girl underneath all of this stuff.\n\nStodden said she realized she'd become a bride too soon. And a miscarriage took a toll on the way she coped with loss.\n\nCOURTNEY STODDEN SAYS SHE'D 'RATHER GO NAKED THAN WEAR VICTORIA'S SECRET' AFTER EXEC'S CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS\n\n\"I don't want to end up like Marilyn Monroe. I don't want to end up like Anna Nicole Smith.\" \u2014 Courtney Stodden\n\nWhen asked if her decision to stop drinking came as a result of something specific or a litany of events leading up it, Stodden exhaled, seeming to brace herself to confront a mountain of emotion.\n\n\u201cI think it's a pile-up of things. Like, I definitely have had family members pass away from alcohol addiction,\u201d she said. \u201cI've had close family members addicted to alcohol. I grew up with my father drinking and it was normal in the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I started drinking when I was 16 because Doug [Hutchison] drank and it was like, 'Oh, whatever you know, it's normal,'\u201d added Stodden.\n\nCOURTNEY STODDEN FLAUNTS NEWFOUND CURVES IN SOCIAL MEDIA POST: 'I NEVER WANTED TO STAY SKINNY'\n\n\u201cAnd I just got really sick one night \u2013 not one night but the next day after a photo shoot, and I was just like, \"For my birthday I need to give myself the gift of no poison like alcohol. I've been drinking for almost 10 years, almost every other day. Like, I would kick back three bottles of Champagne in one night, like it was crazy. And I don't want to do that anymore, you know?'\u201d\n\nWhen asked how he would describe Stodden, Los Angeles real estate agent and \u201cCourtney\u201d cast member David Kean didn\u2019t hold back.\n\n\u201cShe's like a quarter-carat diamond in a big pile of steaming s---,\u201d the luxury broker said. \u201cYou know, it's sparkly and it's fun and you see a glimmer but you got to dig through some crap to get to it.\n\n\"Is it worth it? I don't know at times.\u201d\n\nKean said he fears the people Stodden keeps around her will send her into a downward spiral. He said friction with the budding entertainer comes from the way in which Stodden\u2019s pals feed off her bad behavior.\n\n\u201cIt's not really healthy for her. I think she needs to clean house,\u201d said Kean. \"I'm hoping with some of these other people, especially now that she's not drinking \u2013 thank God -- which I'm sure they're going to try to sabotage. Because what better way to control somebody than to keep them kind of like loopy?\u201d\n\nCOURTNEY STODDEN SAYS SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED TWICE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Los Angeles \u2013 people will be your friend and feed your ego to get into a club free. She's interesting because I really want to like her,\u201d he quickly added.\n\nGaglioti said it was Stodden\u2019s mother, Krista Keller, who introduced the two at L.A. Fashion Week. The network head said it took a lot of effort to persuade Stodden to say yes to the show. The only catch: It had to be completely unscripted.\n\n\u201cCourtney wouldn't have it any other way. And many production companies, many networks have approached her since she was 16 ... to do a show,\u201d said Gaglioti, who billed the finished product as more of a docuseries.\n\n\u201cThis is Courtney's life. It's how she's making music interpreting her feelings from everything that she's gone through in her life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I've been able to spend a lot of time with Courtney and her family. There are family members of Courtney that I spent with that she doesn't even know yet until she watches the show.\u201d\n\nCOURTNEY STODDEN'S ESTRANGED HUSBAND DOUG HUTCHISON: 'SHE IS ADDICTED TO FAME'\n\n\u201cBut if you look in the inside of who she is, she's incredible, and that's because of her upbringing from her mom, Krista Keller,\" Gaglioti added. \"And the foundation of all of that is Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\"This is explosive, dynamic television where you get to see the characters of who is in her life and how they interact,\" He said. \"As crazy as it gets \u2013 and yeah, her mom and her fight like cats and dogs -- but they love each at the end of the day.\"\n\n\u201cCourtney\u201d is available to stream on Amazon Prime TV, Amazon Fire TV and Roku.", "description": "Courtney Stodden has lived a life worth chronicling.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Courtney Stodden", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/courtney-stodden-getty-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
