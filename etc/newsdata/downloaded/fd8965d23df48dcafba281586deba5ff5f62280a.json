If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\u201cOver the years various people have had access to my Insta. I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u201d\n\nRebekah\u2019s camp were so outraged that they even consulted lawyers with a view to taking legal action. The friend added: \u201cThey thought about sending a letter for libel but Becky doesn\u2019t want to do that.\n\n(Image: LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cObviously the girl is upset and must genuinely thinks it\u2019s Rebekah\u2019s doing. She just wants it all to go away.\u201d\n\nRebekah\u2019s legal team have launched a forensic IT investigation to try to prove her innocence. The pal said: \u201cOver the last few years a lot of people have had access to her social media account. They\u2019re looking into everything.\u201d\n\nFriends also fear for Rebekah\u2019s state of mind, saying she is being trolled and has been reduced to tears on holiday. The pal added: \u201cShe rarely cries, if at all...She\u2019s a tough character.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s inconsolable. She\u2019s crying her eyes out and is heavily pregnant. Coleen knew Becky and was friendly with her and she didn\u2019t know there were any issues. Now she\u2019s getting relentlessly trolled and is just beside herself.\u201d\n\nThe pal even suggested Coleen\u2019s camp could have their own reasons for going public with the row. They said: \u201cBecky and Jamie are always happy. There is no scandal with their marriage.\n\n\u201cMaybe to Coleen\u2019s camp, they were overshadowing them and becoming a bigger brand and that\u2019s why this has been so public.\u201d\n\nA friend of Coleen\u2019s last night said she, too, had been left \u201cinconsolable...not least because it\u2019s turned out to be one of her friends who has been informing the press of her private moments\u201d.\n\nThe friend added: \u201cShe has had to cope with this throughout pregnancies and household turmoil.\u201d\n\nThey also denied it was part of any plan by Coleen\u2019s camp to overshadow the Vardys and be a bigger brand, adding: \u201cColeen has never been interested in being a brand, that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d A spokesman for Coleen said: \u201cIt is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nColeen, 33, had accused Rebekah after using a process of elimination to find who was passing information from her private Instagram to a newspaper.The mum-of-four, wife of former England captain Wayne, said she spent five months working it out by blocking everyone\u2019s account but Rebekah\u2019s.\n\nShe said she watched as a series of fake stories she had planted on her account appeared in the newspaper.\n\nAnd she took screen shots showing the only account to have viewed her original posts was Rebekah\u2019s.\n\nIn an online statement yesterday, Coleen said: \u201cAfter a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account.\n\n\u201cOver the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u201dNow I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from. It\u2019s Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nShe added alongside the statement: \u201cThis has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nColeen is estimated to be worth \u00a313million thanks to endorsements, media deals and fitness DVDs. Husband Wayne is said to be worth \u00a3100million.\n\nMeanwhile the Vardys are believed to have a collective net worth of \u00a39million.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The footballers' wives are embroiled in a very public spat after Coleen accused Rebekah of selling stories about her to the press", "authors": ["Tom Bryant", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Lightrocket Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544618.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jamie-Vardy-and-Rebekah-Vardy-at-The-Mirror-Pride-of-Sport.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
