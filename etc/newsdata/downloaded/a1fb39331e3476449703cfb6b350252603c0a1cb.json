However, more new drugs are coming out with 6- and 7-figure list prices \u2014 most notably drugs like Zolgensma and Luxturna.\n\nHigher starting prices for brand-name drugs are costly on their own, but they also beget higher starting prices for their generics.\n\nBy the numbers: Using data from Elsevier's Gold Standard Drug Database and the federal government, analysts at 46brooklyn organized the launch prices of both brand and generic drugs for each year they came out, going back to 2006.\n\nThe median monthly price of a new brand-name drug has increased 381% since 2006 (from $150 to $722).\n\nThe median monthly price of a new generic drug has increased 712% since 2006 (about $100 to almost $800).\n\nThese are list prices, not net prices, and therefore do not reflect any rebates given by manufacturers to middlemen. But these prices still affect patients' out-of-pocket costs, and some list prices could be close to actual net prices paid depending on the contract and marketplace.\n\nOne step further: Almost 80% of all generic drugs studied had no decrease in their average wholesale price in the past 5 years.\n\nThe bottom line: There is systemic failure in the pharmaceutical market. Rising starting points for drugs benefit every entity, except patients.\n\nBrand-name drugmakers reap the first rewards and usually don't provide a lot of, if any, rebates for new drugs with no competitors.\n\nGenerics manufacturers often don't lower prices by much after a drug patent elapses.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers pocket the difference between what they charge insurance programs for overpriced generics and what they pay pharmacists.\n\nWholesalers and pharmacists collect their smaller cuts along the way.\n\nGo deeper: The drug pricing maze\n\nEditor's note: This post has been updated to note the analysis looks at list prices, not net prices.", "description": "There is systemic failure in how drugs are priced.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/F6nyjPcZlTq1BIDpYPWjmvNJuPY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/15/1571171422046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
