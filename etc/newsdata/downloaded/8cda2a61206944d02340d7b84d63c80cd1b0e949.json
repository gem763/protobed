No one else matters, really, in L.A., which makes the city atypical of most sports markets where NFL franchises generally reign.\n\nBut there was no NFL team in Los Angeles for more than 20 years, after the Rams, losing fan support, left in 1994 for St. Louis.\n\nLife went on in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter all, fans, media, advertisers and corporate sponsors had plenty of choices. USC football, already a dominant force for many years, stepped in as an NFL franchise of sorts with two national championships in 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe Lakers continued their dominance on the court and in the market with five NBA titles from 2000 to 2010 with Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant, and now are about to enter the LeBron James-Anthony Davis era.\n\nThe Dodgers struggled with ownership issues, but the deeply rooted club remained relevant with fans. The Anaheim Angels won the World Series in 2002, and, after being sold to Arte Moreno, solidified their presence in the market by renaming themselves the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Staples Center opened in 1999, and in addition to being the home of the Lakers, also hosts the city\u2019s second NBA team, the Clippers, who, under owner Steve Ballmer, have become a force as well, ready to take it to another level with the arrival of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\n\nThere are also two NHL franchises \u2014 the Kings and the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nEven in the absence of the NFL, L.A. was a crowded market.\n\nThen, just like that, the NFL dropped not one, but two franchises back into the city.\n\nNo one knew what would happen. After all, no other sports market has ever seen such a dramatic change.\n\nSo what has been the impact of the 2016 return of the Rams and the surprising arrival of the Chargers from San Diego?\n\n\u201cThe Rams have been received pretty well, and they\u2019ve played well,\u201d said Mark Whicker, long-time Orange County Register columnist. \u201cBut they still had a constituency. There are grandfathers and fathers who watched them when they were here and some were still holding out hope that they would come back. They have their niche.\n\n\u201cThe Chargers just kind of showed up,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody really asked them to come.\u201d\n\nIt was a return for the Rams, who moved from Cleveland to Los Angeles in 1946. And, under coach Sean McVay, they gave Los Angeles a winner. McVay led them to an 11-win season in 2017 and a Super Bowl appearance last year.\n\nThey play in the Los Angeles Coliseum, and have drawn reasonably well, finishing 10th in the NFL in attendance in 2018, averaging 72,429 per game.\n\nLos Angeles Times columnist Arash Markazi said fans looked to other NFL teams during the Rams\u2019 absence.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles didn\u2019t have an NFL team for 21 years, that\u2019s an entire generation of fans, so most in the city gravitated toward other teams such as the Cowboys, who had training camp in Oxnard, the Raiders, who moved only a one-hour flight north and won the city\u2019s only Super Bowl, or other popular teams like the Steelers, Packers or Patriots,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Los Angeles has embraced the Rams as their team. Not only did they have a 50-year history before, but they\u2019ve been a fun team to watch the past two seasons. The team that has struggled to gain traction is the Chargers. They will always be viewed as San Diego\u2019s team by L.A. sports fans.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers, who ironically began in Los Angeles in 1960 before moving to San Diego, have been largely ignored, playing in a 25,000-seat soccer stadium.\n\n\u201cThe San Diego fans are mad at them so they don\u2019t come up,\u201d Whicker said. \u201cMore often than not it is road game for them.\u201d\n\nThe question is what will the impact be of the opening of the new $5 billion stadium in Inglewood to be shared by the Rams and the Chargers \u2014 the L.A. Stadium and Entertainment District at Hollywood Park?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a saturated market,\u201d Whicker said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to win, or you\u2019re on page eight. UCLA football is like a non-entity, the Angels are kind of like a non-entity now. They haven\u2019t been in the playoffs since 2014. The hockey teams are both rebuilding, and not many people are paying attention to them. People expect to be in the finals. They expect championships.\u201d\n\nThis is why the Dodgers are feeling the pressure after two straight World Series losses.\n\nI asked Whicker how the teams rank now in terms of market influence and attention.\n\n\u201cIf you were to rank the popularity, it would be Dodgers-Lakers or Lakers-Dodgers, whichever way you put them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dodgers drew nearly 4 million this year, and they are incredibly popular in the Latino areas, which we kind of gloss over that. They are huge in that part of town.\n\n\u201cThe Lakers are the Lakers. They were selling out even when they were bad. They haven\u2019t made the playoffs in six years. Now with them getting LeBron and Anthony Davis, basketball season is going to be nuts, with both of those teams in the same building.\u201d\n\nNow the Rams and the Chargers, soon to be in a new home, will fight for their place in L.A.\u2019s sports pecking order. It is a strange place to be for two NFL franchises.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
