The next morning, Alesi was found dead of an overdose of cocaine and fentanyl.\n\nIn the following months, Shannade used Alesi's debit card details to treat herself to designer clothes, headphones, plane tickets and to pay her bills, attempting to make $20,000 in purchases but only succeeding in buying $5,000 worth of items.\n\nShe was arrested months later in July 2018 and was sentenced to a year in prison this past April after pleading guilty to wire fraud.\n\nNow, in an exclusive statement given to DailyMail.com, Alesi's grieving family blasts Shannade's one-year sentencing and reveals Alesi's toxicology report disputes Shannade's claim he was drunk, as well as likening the model's actions to a 'Hustlers' type scheme.\n\nShannade, one of the Clermont twins, went on a paid 'sugar daddy date' with James Alesi, 42, on January 31, 2017, claiming sometime in the three-hour window of their time together, he became 'very drunk'.

He was not a sugar daddy. He did not know her, as court documents have proved.\n\n'He was with the wrong person the night he died. Shannade Clermont took advantage of him. In our opinion, she's heartless.\n\n'The Alesi family believes Ms Clermont should have called 911 when James fell unconscious.\n\n'Ms Clermont admitted to and plead guilty to using James' debit card to buy luxury items even after his death.'\n\nThe lawyer added on behalf of the Alesis: 'Our family is destroyed. Both of his parents died within six months of James' death, frankly from broken hearts.\n\n'His father, three months to the day of his death and our mother three months later.\n\n'One year is not enough. Instead of remorse, she's using this for publicity.\n\n'We feel this is shameful. We will never recover.

He was incapacitated.\n\n'There is dispute over what Ms. Clermont knew as to why the victim passed out and was incapacitated, whether it was a result of a drug overdose, whether it was a result of simply being drunk.\n\n'Whatever it was, in her presence, the victim passed out. He was incapacitated.\n\n'Although it is unknown what happened while the defendant was inside the Victim\u2019s apartment for over three hours, the Victim was found dead the next morning from a drug overdose, there were baggies of cocaine and a tablet that contained fentanyl around the apartment, and a loose condom that appeared to have been broken was found on the Victim\u2019s bed. The defendant maintains that the Victim simply passed out on his bed.'\n\nHowever, Shannade told a different story outside court. She told the Post: 'He wasn\u2019t asleep when I left. He was just drunk.\n\n'I have never been around people who have been on heavy drugs, so I didn\u2019t really know.'\n\nAfter Alesi passed out, Shannade found his wallet and 'took or recorded his debit card information and she left,' according to court documents.\n\nIn total, Shannade (right) tried to make $20,000 worth of purchases - even going so far to set up a new email account under Alesi's name so that she could directly transfer money from his account to her own, prosecutors said.
