Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nDespite an absence of official statistics on how many refugees have returned to Syria, the report claims that hundreds of refugees were forcibly deported to Syria after being coerced or conned into signing \u201cvoluntary return\u201d documents.\n\nSome of those interviewed claimed they were forced into signing the document by being physically beaten, while others believed they were signing a document that confirmed they had received a blanket at a refugee detention center.\n\nMurad Sezer/Reuters, FILE\n\nAmnesty claims to have verified 20 individual cases such as these. Those individuals claim to have been sent across the Syrian border on buses with dozens of other refugees who, handcuffed with plastic ties, appeared to also have been deported against their will.\n\nOne refugee was held in a Turkish police station, and threatened with a year in prison unless he went to Syria, according to the report. Another, John, a Syrian Christian, was detained for a week by an Islamist group immediately after crossing the border. \u201cIt was a miracle I got out alive,\u201d he said, according to the report.\n\nTurkey, according to Reuters, has previously denied sending Syrians home against their will.\n\nThere are 3.6 million registered Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he wants to return as many refugees from the Syrian Civil War as possible back across the border. Referring to his plans to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d at the Turkish-Syrian border, Erdogan told lawmakers from his own party that the military action will \u201crebuild an area for 1 million people, for those who want to return to their country and don\u2019t have a home to go back to,\u201d according to the AP.\n\nThe Turkish government claims that more than 300,000 refugees have already left Syria voluntarily, but Amnesty claims its findings refute that claim, saying that \u201cmillions of refugees were at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s claim that refugees from Syria are choosing to walk straight back into the conflict is dangerous and dishonest,\u201d Anna Shea, a researcher on Refugee and Migrant Rights at Amnesty International, said in a statement. \u201cRather, our research shows that people are being tricked or forced into returning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is chilling that Turkey\u2019s deal with Russia this week agrees to the \u2018safe and voluntary return\u2019 of refugees to a yet-to-be-established \u2018safe zone.\u2019 Returns until now have been anything but safe and voluntary \u2013 and now millions more refugees from Syria are at risk,\u201d said Anna Shea.\n\nTurkish forces launched a military incursion over the Syrian border earlier this month after President Donald Trump announced he would pull U.S. troops in Syria back from the area. Critics have blasted the administration as compromising U.S. interests and ceding the territory of Northeast Syria, controlled by previously US-allied Syrian Kurdish forces, to Turkey, Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.", "description": "Amnesty International report today says Turkey has been forcibly returning refugees to war-torn Syria over the past few months.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/turey-syria-refugees-rt-aa-191025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
