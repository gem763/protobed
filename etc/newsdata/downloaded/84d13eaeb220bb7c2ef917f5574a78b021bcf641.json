Basically, the two are going to try and develop new applications for 5G to solve some of India's major problems in various fields.\n\n\"DoT has taken increased interest over the last few days that has helped us fast-track the activities of the centre of excellence,\" says Brejesh Lall, coordinator of the 5G Centre of Excellence at IIT Delhi.\n\nThe two parties are currently awaiting the renewal of their spectrum licence in order to continue 5G work. And their experiments will provide improvements in more than just broadband and wireless communication.\n\nDon't Miss 113 SHARES 3 K SHARES 23.8 K SHARES\n\nThe lab expects to use 5G to revolutionise everything from smart vehicles and public transport, to the automation of critical services, to allowing doctors remote access to patients in need of surgery, and even sensors networks for various purposes.\n\nWith 5G, doctors could conduct and oversee surgeries in far-off places in real time, bringing proper healthcare services to the poorest of the poor. It could be used to automate ticketing and other systems for public transport.\n\nHonestly, the possibilities are endless, and IIT-Delhi wants to be on top of things as we slowly develop the infrastructure to implement all of this.", "description": "As the world gears up to begin adopting the new 5G wireless, standard, IIT-Delhi is also attempting to bring the new technology to India.
