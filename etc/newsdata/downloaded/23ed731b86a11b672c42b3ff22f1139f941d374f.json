REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The editor-in-chief of a Chinese state-run newspaper on Thursday criticized White House trade adviser Peter Navarro for quoting a fictitious anti-China economist in his books, and said it raised questions about his counsel to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Navarro said in a statement that the name he used was \u201ca whimsical device and pen name I\u2019ve used throughout the years for opinions and purely entertainment value, not as a source of fact.\u201d\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education reported this week that Navarro invented and quoted an economist named Ron Vara. It said that according to Tessa Morris-Suzuki, an emeritus professor at Australian National University, Vara\u2019s name had appeared a dozen times in six of Navarro\u2019s nonfiction books but no such person could be found.\n\n\u201cThis is shameless fabrication. Navarro cheated his readers. Who knows if he also misled the US President,\u201d Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the People\u2019s Daily of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, said in a Twitter post.\n\nNavarro acknowledged in his statement that \u201cRon Vara\u201d was an anagram for \u201cNavarro\u201d and went on to say that \u201cit\u2019s refreshing that somebody finally figured out an inside joke that has been hiding in plain sight for years.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined comment.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in a trade war for more than a year and the Global Times has repeatedly criticized Navarro, who has advocated a hard line against Beijing. Washington and Beijing have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.", "description": "The editor-in-chief of a Chinese state-run newspaper on Thursday criticized White House trade adviser Peter Navarro for quoting a fictitious anti-China economist in his books, and said it raised questions about his counsel to U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442098007&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H038", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
