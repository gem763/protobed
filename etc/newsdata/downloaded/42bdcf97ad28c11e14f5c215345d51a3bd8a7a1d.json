The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump urged Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d to help Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani probe the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\nThe officials think release of the transcript would show definitively that Trump did nothing illegal. The president\u2019s adversaries, determined to use the issue to demand his impeachment, might still argue that he acted inappropriately, but release of the president\u2019s precise words, the officials believe, would make it more difficult for critics to claim that Trump did something wrong.\n\nThe officials also believe the public should know the circumstances of the whistleblower complaint. The complaint is hearsay; the author did not have direct knowledge of the substance of the complaint but rather heard it from someone else. Being hearsay does not totally invalidate a complaint, but some officials believe it weakens the alleged whistleblower\u2019s case.\n\nThe bottom line is that the officials believe public release of the transcript would be in President Trump\u2019s best interest.", "description": "", "authors": ["Byron York", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Columnists Trump-Allies-Urge-Release-Of-Transcript-At-Center-Of-Whistleblower-Controversy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
