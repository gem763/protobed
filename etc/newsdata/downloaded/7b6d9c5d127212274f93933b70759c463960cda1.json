The index uses official statistics to track the movement of mainstream residential prices across 150 international cities.\n\n\n\nXi\u2019an beat out Budapest, Hungary, which had an annual growth rate of 24.2% for the second quarter of 2019. However, the European city has the largest growth rate for the last five years, with home prices more than doubling during that time. Izmir, Turkey, had the second highest growth rate for the last five years at 80%, the index found.\n\n\n\nMore: A Guide to the Season\u2019s New Developments\n\nStill, on the whole, average growth around the world has slowed, according to Knight Frank.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe index continues to track lower recording average growth of just 3.5% in the year to June 2019, down from a high of 6.7% at the end of 2016,\u201d Kate Everett-Allen, Knight Frank\u2019s head of international residential research, said in the report. \u201cRising economic uncertainty, trade tensions, political crises and affordability concerns are leading to weaker sentiment in mainstream housing markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Indian cities of Hyderabad, 18.3%, and Ahmedabad, 15.3%, had the third and fourth highest growth rates over the last year, the index found.\n\n\n\nOther Chinese cities in the top 10 include Wuhan and Chongqing, with annual growth rates of 14.6% and 12.1%, respectively. Europe\u2019s Porto, Portugal (13.6%), Zagreb, Croatia (11.4%), and Athens, Greece, (11.2%) also made the top 10.\n\nMore: Hong Kong Clashes Put Brakes on Property Boom\n\nPhoenix, Arizona, had the highest annual growth in the U.S., at 5.8%, the data showed. But it was still 41st on the global index.\n\n\n\nThe report also noted the \u201cwidening gap between cities in the same country,\u201d such as the difference between Phoenix and Seattle, which had a -1.3% annual growth rate.\n\n\n\n\u201cLocal economic fortunes, opposing market cycles and in some cases, tighter property market regulations are behind this divergence,\u201d Ms. Everett-Allen wrote in the report.\n\nFrom Penta: Future Returns: Green Bonds on the Rise\n\nTop-tier locations like London, New York, Auckland, Rome, Dubai and Sydney are all the bottom third of the index rankings this quarter, the data found.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a number of these cities, the prime sector continues to outperform the mainstream market,\u201d according to Ms. Everett-Allen. \u201cIn others, analysis of price movements in the last quarter suggest their rate of decline is starting to slow.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
