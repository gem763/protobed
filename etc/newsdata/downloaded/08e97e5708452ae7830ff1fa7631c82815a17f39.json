In his first half of his Steelers debut, Fitzpatrick had an interception and forced a fumble on a San Francisco 49ers run deep in Pittsburgh territory.\n\nThe Steelers lost quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for the season, so trading a 2020 first-round pick to the Dolphins for Fitzpatrick was an odd move on the surface. If the Steelers, who were 0-2, had the bottom fall out and replacement quarterback Mason Rudolph wasn\u2019t good, then they wouldn\u2019t have a 2020 first-rounder to use on a potential franchise quarterback in the draft.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut Fitzpatrick\u2019s talent is clear. He is versatile enough to play cornerback or safety, though the Steelers\u2019 initial plan is to let him focus on safety. He was a high first-round pick of the Dolphins last season. He\u2019ll be a good player for the Steelers.\n\nAnd in his first Steelers game, Fitzpatrick was already making the trade look good. The 0-3 Dolphins could use a guy like that.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick made some big plays in his Steelers debut.
