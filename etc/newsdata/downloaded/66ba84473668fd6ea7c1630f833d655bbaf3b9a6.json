After a tryout, the Patriots signed Nugent.\n\nBut Nugent, who has kicked only sporadically in recent years \u2014 three games last year with Oakland, four each with Chicago and Dallas in 2017 \u2014 has had his struggles.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFor a team that\u2019s had the reliable Gostkowski for well over a decade (he\u2019s the third-most accurate kicker in NFL history), mistakes are hard to swallow.\n\nSo after last Sunday, when Nugent had one field goal blocked and missed a second in New England\u2019s win over Cleveland, his second and third misses in eight attempts, he was cut.\n\nThe Patriots signed Mike Folk to replace Nugent.\n\nFolk hasn\u2019t kicked in the NFL since 2017, when he was with the Buccaneers for four games. Earlier this year he was in the AAF, making 12-of-16 kicks in eight games with the Arizona Hotshots.\n\nNick Folk, who was kicking in the AAF this spring, signed with the Patriots on Tuesday.
