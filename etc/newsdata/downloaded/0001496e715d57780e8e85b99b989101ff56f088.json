Elijah Cummings gave powerful speeches on Freddie Gray, Benghazi, Michael Cohen and more", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cBooming,\u201d \u201cstirring\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d were just a few of the ways Cummings\u2019s congressional colleagues described his style as remembrances of him poured in Thursday.\n\nDuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s weekly news conference, Pelosi (D-Calif.) relayed an anecdote shared with her by a former colleague of Cummings\u2019s from the Maryland House of Delegates: When Cummings would stand up, \u201cthe room would fall silent, because everyone wanted to hear what Elijah has to say. And that of course was the case in Congress, in his committee, and in the country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCummings made an impression early on in his congressional career with his very first House floor speech in 1996, and continued to deliver high-impact addresses until he died. Below are five of his most memorable:\n\nFirst House floor speech (1996):\n\nCummings spoke for less than six minutes on the House floor just after he was sworn in April 25, 1996. He introduced himself to a national audience with a poetic mix of personal biography, faith and vision, and laid out his hopes for a future in which Americans could find common ground to work with one another and \u201cthat the power is within them.\u201d\n\nCummings closed with a poem by Parren J. Mitchell, the first African American to represent Maryland in Congress: \u201cI only have a minute \u2014 60 seconds in it. Forced upon me I did not choose it, but I know that I must use it. Suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it. Only a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBenghazi hearing (2015)\n\nCummings was the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee when the majority-Republican House Select Committee on Benghazi convened to investigate decisions made by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in relation to an attack on U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, that left a U.S. diplomat and three other Americans dead. As the highest-ranking Democrat on the panel, Cummings blasted Republicans for what he criticized as a costly, partisan hearing with \u201cno rules, no deadline, and an unlimited budget\u201d meant to damage Clinton as a presidential candidate.\n\nDespite clashing with Cummings, Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) respected his convictions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about politics to him; he says what he believes,\u201d Gowdy told the Hill newspaper at the time. \u201cAnd you can tell the ones who are saying it because it was in a memo they got that morning, and you can tell the ones who it\u2019s coming from their soul. And with Mr. Cummings, it\u2019s coming from his soul.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFuneral of Freddie Gray (2015)\n\nAfter the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man whose death became a symbol of police mistreatment of black men, Cummings was a constant presence in the neighborhoods as protests rocked the city. At Gray\u2019s funeral in April, Cummings lamented Gray\u2019s death and the hard circumstances of his youth that preceded it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often said that our children are the living messages we send to the future we will never see, but now, our children are sending us to a future they will never see,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something wrong with that picture.\u201d\n\nMichael Cohen testimony (2019)\n\nAfter testimony in February by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen before the House Oversight Committee, Cummings\u2019s stirring closing remarks were deeply empathetic. In an attempt to insulate the president from Cohen\u2019s damaging testimony, House Republicans sought to portray Cohen as opportunistic and untrustworthy, calling him a \u201crat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCummings, meanwhile, highlighted their shared experiences as fathers, and acknowledged the pain and difficulty Cohen had experienced by testifying. Cummings hinted that the difficulty wouldn\u2019t be in vain if it could help Cohen personally, and the country at large.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question we\u2019ll be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?\u201d Cummings asked. \u201cDid we stand on the sidelines and say nothing?\u201d suggesting that the country could learn a lesson from Cohen\u2019s trajectory and find a path to redemption.\n\nRobert S. Mueller III\u2019s testimony (2019)\n\nCummings made an impassioned plea to the American people in July, after testimony by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III in which he said his report into investigations of Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 election did not exonerate the president.\n\nAD\n\nCummings dismissed the notion that the furor over the Mueller report was because of Democrats\u2019 dislike of Trump, and implied that the country was at a crossroads under Trump\u2019s leadership. How Americans chose to react, he argued, would define the state of democracy for generations to come.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about not liking the president, it\u2019s about loving democracy. It\u2019s about loving our country. It\u2019s about making a difference for generations yet unborn,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI\u2019m begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on. Because if you want to have a democracy intact for your children and your children\u2019s children, and generations yet unborn, we have got to guard this moment. This is our watch.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nElijah E.
