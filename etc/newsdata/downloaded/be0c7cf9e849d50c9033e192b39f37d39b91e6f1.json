In particular, the threats now emanate from multiple countries, including Iran and China, where malicious actors have adopted Russia\u2019s playbook in a bid to manipulate social media to their political advantage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome said they were unnerved by the nature of the recent Instagram posts, which seemed to target battleground states and demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the dynamics at play in the 2020 Democratic primary. They appeared, for instance, to stoke African American resentment of former vice president Joe Biden while tapping into themes designed to undercut Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well. The Russian network appeared to be relatively small and in an audience-building mode, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are repeating the same tactics they used during the 2016 election but only growing more strategic in identifying divides and capitalizing on those divides to create fault lines in society and distrust between people and institutions,\u201d said Ali Soufan, a former longtime FBI agent who wrote a report in May for the Department of Homeland Security that warned, \u201cTo date, the United States has no national strategy to counter foreign influence.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official said there is a strategy, but that it is classified, adding, \u201cThe U.S. government has made significant progress in recognizing malign foreign influence operations and defending our homeland and our allies against this threat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther experts decried the lack of a public national strategy and said that relative silence from the government, as well as President Trump\u2019s years-long efforts to discredit U.S. investigations of Russian interference that he repeatedly calls a \u201choax,\u201d have undermined the effectiveness of security agencies to educate the public to the threat and dissuade adversaries.\n\nDemocratic campaign officials said they were stunned to learn from media reports that their candidates had been potentially affected, wondering why they had not been briefed by Facebook or by law enforcement.\n\nOne official, who like other campaign representatives spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security concerns, argued that Facebook in particular had failed to \u201cequip candidates with information to confront this threat yet again.\u201d The posts were especially difficult to detect because they amplified existing viral content that had originated with domestic U.S. users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDemocrats have to band together and apply pressure on Facebook, but in the end we need to plan for worst-case scenarios where we are fighting mass disinformation campaigns on our own,\u201d said a digital director for one Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, which released no public statement about the influence campaigns, \u201ccould be doing more to publicly lead this fight,\u201d the digital director said, while acknowledging that the party was constrained in its ability to defend individual candidates because of allegations of bias that roiled the 2016 primary.\n\nA DNC spokesman laid responsibility at the feet of Facebook and the government, saying, \u201cThis is a time of crisis in our country, when the government should be stepping up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked about criticism from Democrats, Facebook pointed to an earlier statement saying it had \u201cshared information with industry partners, policy makers and law enforcement.\u201d The company has sought in recent months to show that it has beefed up its anti-interference efforts since 2016, with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg telling lawmakers last week that Facebook\u2019s defenses against disinformation are more \u201csophisticated than any other company has at this point, and frankly, governments too.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIndividual Democratic campaigns, still competing against one another, have strained to arm themselves against viral disinformation. They receive briefings from the DNC, which uses software tools to detect trending topics that could prove damaging to the party\u2019s candidates.\n\nThe Biden campaign has entertained the idea of bolstering its defenses, at one point holding discussions with analysts at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence firm. But the talks did not yield a formal contract, according to Tom Hofmann, the company\u2019s vice president of intelligence.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it \u201cextraordinarily disturbing\u201d that Facebook did not inform the Democratic campaigns before disclosing that they had been targeted. The decision, Democrats warned, could further erode the party\u2019s trust that the company will provide the tools needed to respond in real time to escalating information warfare.\n\nAD\n\nFacebook\u2019s announcement last week underscored the evolving nature of the threat to campaigns. Although explicit election-related content was a minority of the Russian posts, many of the accounts set their location to swing states that could tip the 2020 contest.\n\nThe company revealed that it had removed a network of accounts originating in Russia targeting the United States, and three networks of accounts originating in Iran targeting the United States and other countries, including several in North Africa and Latin America. The material offered a snapshot of the increasingly visual nature of foreign-backed disinformation, which games Instagram\u2019s algorithm to serve users with content on trending topics, analysts said. \u201cGIFs, short videos, memes \u2014 that\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s doing really well on social media at the moment,\u201d said Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher with Oxford\u2019s Computational Propaganda Research Project.\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement came as foreign intervention in U.S. politics remains a heated partisan issue. Trump faces an impeachment inquiry over allegations that he withheld aid from Ukraine in return for that country promising to investigate Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\nAD\n\nThere have been clandestine efforts to thwart Russian and other influence, including a Cyber Command operation last fall to knock out Internet access to Russian trolls seeking access to U.S. social media platforms.\n\nIn July, shortly before stepping down as director of National Intelligence, Daniel Coats created a new elections-threat executive position and tapped a veteran intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, to hold it. She convenes regular meetings of all intelligence agencies collecting information on foreign threats, as well as entities that address election security. And an interagency working group, composed of many of the same agencies, has been coordinating responses to foreign influence.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe threats are ongoing and persistent,\u201d said a senior intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the official\u2019s agency. \u201cThey\u2019re more diverse. We have more actors on the field. In addition to Russia, there\u2019s China, Iran, hacktivists, ransomware.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt a recent Silicon Valley meeting with tech firms, Pierson pressed the private companies to share more of what they were seeing with the government. Some tech executives replied that they were constrained by privacy laws.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security each have a foreign influence task force, with the FBI probing foreign threats to the United States generally, and DHS emphasizing election systems. The FBI offered group threat briefings to the presidential campaigns in May.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no law that requires us\u201d to notify any individual of a potential foreign influence effort, said a senior FBI official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. But such notification \u2014 especially to the tech platforms \u2014 has happened after consultation with other intelligence agencies to determine whether disclosure can be done without compromising sources and methods, the official said.\n\nAD\n\nIn general, the official said, the FBI is not monitoring the Internet for misleading content, such as \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos. \u201cWe are not the truth police,\u201d the official said.\n\nExperts say the relative silence from the White House, as well as Trump\u2019s posture toward Russian interference, undercuts U.S. efforts and emboldens Moscow.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s continued questioning of the intelligence community\u2019s findings about the 2016 election and the threat that Russia poses to U.S. national security undermines the deterrent effect of much of what the government is trying to do,\u201d said Andrea-Kendall Taylor, a former senior intelligence officer on Russia at the National Intelligence Council and the CIA who is now with the Center for a New American Security.\n\nIn fact, Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin appears unfazed by the U.S. response, joking in a public appearance earlier this month about the prospect of interfering in the 2020 U.S. election. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret: Yes, we\u2019ll definitely do it,\u201d he told a Moscow audience, cupping the microphone conspiratorially. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he added.\n\nThe metastasizing power of Russia\u2019s influence operations was apparent in the days following Facebook\u2019s announcement that it was taking down the accounts, as the material removed from Instagram continued to live on Facebook\u2019s main social media service in the form of reposted content.\n\nA post from an account that posed as a black voter in Michigan still existed on a Facebook page with more than 30,000 followers called \u201cThe Black Truth and Nothing but the Truth.\u201d When contacted by a reporter on Wednesday, a representative for the page replied, \u201cThank you!\u201d and said the material would be removed.\n\nFollowing Facebook\u2019s disclosure, Google said it removed a \u201csmall number\u201d of accounts across its services, including some on YouTube, that were linked to Iran. Twitter said it received intelligence from Facebook and had not found similar behavior, but researchers pointed to accounts on Twitter that appeared to have some links to the Iranian accounts removed by Facebook.\n\nExperts warned that simply removing fake accounts from the platforms would not deter hostile actors. Following recent takedowns in Eastern Europe, Russians resorted to bribing authentic users to relinquish control of their accounts, according to Jakub Kalensk\u00fd, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab.\n\nTrump delivered no statement last week rebuking the apparent new Russian effort targeting his potential 2020 rivals, an operation that Facebook said showed \u201csome links\u201d to the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg company and \u201ctroll farm\u201d owned by a Putin ally.", "description": "Campaigns targeted by Russian interference on Facebook-owned Instagram were not alerted by the tech giant.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4i0Sh-42CDCTqg8DiOqqucZoIsY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NKTIMFHY3YI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
