John Kennedy is using his perch on the Senate appropriations financial services subcommittee to press FCC Chairman Ajit Pai on spectrum auction programs at a Thursday hearing.\n\nState of play: A group of satellite providers is pushing the FCC to allow them to privately sell their spectrum licenses. But cable companies \u2014 and Kennedy \u2014 want the FCC to run a public auction, with a portion of the proceeds going to government coffers.\n\nThe players: Broadcasters and cable companies currently use the spectrum to receive programming and are worried about losing access.\n\nSome of the foreign satellite operators that hold the licenses \u2014 Intelsat, SES and Telesat \u2014 formed the C-Band Alliance and pitched a plan to move their customers to a smaller portion of the spectrum and sell the extra airwaves for 5G services.\n\nVerizon and AT&T see a private auction as the quickest path to buying the airwaves, although AT&T wants an auction to be run like a traditional FCC auction.\n\nMeanwhile, small cable companies oppose the private sale and have offered an alternative proposal of their own, which Charter Communications also supports.\n\nThe big questions: How much spectrum will be freed up, who will run the auction, and whether any of the proceeds will end up in the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe C-Band Alliance said it could free up 200 MHz of spectrum, but is revising that estimate after FCC commissioners called for 300 MHz to be made available.\n\nCBA also said it would make a \u201ccontribution\u201d to the U.S. Treasury, but have not said how much. Previous airwaves auctions run by the FCC have raised billions to pay down government debt.\n\nBottom line: The wireless industry says these airwaves are essential for U.S. 5G deployments, but an airwave auction that doesn't send sizable proceeds to the U.S. Treasury is proving to be a tough hurdle with Congress.", "description": "The fight over 5G spectrum draws cable, satellite and wireless companies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/xMXW63MNaeS6tdqRC2HTY_vZSe8=/0x54:5472x3132/1920x1080/2019/10/16/1571260896929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
