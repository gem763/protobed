In their absence, the music industry didn\u2019t get any better at persuading people to sit through whole albums.\n\nSo Tom Chaplin and company have come up with a radical solution: performing their new album, in full, on the day of release.\n\nIt could go horribly wrong, if it weren\u2019t for three things. First, Keane may be men in their 40s now, but here by the sea in Sussex they\u2019re still local boys bathing in the warmth of a home crowd.\n\nKeane (above) may be men in their 40s now, but here by the sea in Sussex they\u2019re still local boys bathing in the warmth of a home crowd\n\n\u2018Love you, Tom,\u2019 someone yells. \u2018It\u2019s nice,\u2019 Chaplin drily replies, \u2018to have our parents in tonight.\u2019\n\nSecond, the new album, Cause And Effect, is as likeable as the oldies that round off the show. The Keane sound remains the same: gentle indie-pop, with Tim Rice-Oxley\u2019s soulful synths supplanting the guitars.\n\nThe lyrics are sadder and heavier, reflecting Rice-Oxley\u2019s divorce and Chaplin\u2019s struggles with addiction, but the music remains light. The songs are halfway between a therapy session and a box of cupcakes.\n\nIT'S A FACT In 1997 the band were called Cherry Keane, after a woman who served tea at Tim and Tom's school. They subsequently dropped the Cherry.\n\nAbove all there is Chaplin\u2019s voice. He\u2019s the kind of singer who can carry a crowd with him \u2013 a choirboy with the horsepower of a whole choir. Last time I saw him on stage he was singing the songs of Queen at the London Palladium, and Freddie Mercury\u2019s imprint lingers in the way Chaplin hurls himself into each line.\n\nThis commitment is all the more striking when it comes bursting out of a self-deprecating son of East Sussex.\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted by the new album, I\u2019d suggest starting with Chase The Night Away, a soaring pop song with a kick in the chorus, or Strange Room, a piano ballad with a Christmassy feel (can someone tell John Lewis?).\n\nBetter still, just buy the whole thing.\n\nkeanemusic.com", "description": "Keane are back together after spending five years on a break.
