The previous mark of 267 was set last year by New York. This year\u2019s Yankees became the first team with 14 players reaching double-digits in home runs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody will ever forget the \u2018Bomba Squad,\u2019\u201d first-year Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.\n\nMajor League Baseball has asked for more scientific tests on baseballs, and Commissioner Rob Manfred expects to have results after the World Series.\n\nStrikeouts set a record for the 12th consecutive season at 42,823, up 4% from 41,207 last year and 33% from 32,189 in 2007. A year after strikeouts exceeded hits for the time, the gap was ever greater.\n\nTim Anderson became only the third Chicago White Sox player to win an American League batting title and injured Milwaukee star Christian Yelich wound up as the National League\u2019s first repeat champion in two decades.\n\nAnderson went 0 for 2 Sunday and finished at .335, eight points ahead of the Yankees\u2019 DJ LeMahieu. Anderson joined Luke Appling (1936, \u201843) and Frank Thomas (\u201897) as White Sox batting champions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a huge accomplishment,\u201d said the 26-year-old Anderson, who hit .240 last year. \u201cTo think where I was when I first came here to where it is now. . I just came in and continued to work. It\u2019s such an unbelievable moment for me.\u201d\n\nYelich wound up at .3292, just ahead of Arizona\u2019s Ketel Marte\u2019s .3286, as neither made it to the season\u2019s final weekend. Yelich\u2019s season ended when he broke his right kneecap by fouling a pitch of it on Sept. 10. Marte has not played since Sept. 17 due to lower back inflammation.\n\nYelich won at .326 last year and became the NL\u2019s first back-to-back batting leader since Colorado\u2019s Larry Walker in 1998 and \u201899, which started a run of three titles in four years. The closest NL race was in 2003, when Albert Pujols of St. Louis beat Todd Helton of Colorado .35871 to .35849.\n\nThe New York Mets\u2019 Pete Alonso became the first rookie since the modern era began in 1900 to lead the major leagues in home runs, hitting 53. Jorge Soler hit his 48th Sunday to become the Royals\u2019 first home run champion. He finished three ahead of the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 Mike Trout, who last played Sept. 7 because of a right foot injured that required surgery.\n\nWashington\u2019s Anthony Rendon led the major leagues with 126 RBIs and Jos\u00e9 Abreu of the White Sox topped the AL with 123.\n\nHouston\u2019s Justin Verlander led the major leagues with 21 wins and teammate Gerrit Cole earned his 20th victory on the final day by winning his 16th straight decision. Boston\u2019s Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez was in line for his 20th win before Matt Barnes blew an eighth-inning lead Sunday against Baltimore.\n\nCole led the major leagues with 326 strikeouts and Verlander had 300, the first teammates to reach the figure in the same season since Arizona\u2019s Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002. Cole had 21 double-digit strikeout games, the most since Johnson in 2001, and became the first pitcher to strike out 300 with no complete games.\n\n\u201cI never really envisioned the numbers or anything,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI envisioned getting better, and I did.\u201d\n\nJacob deGrom of the Mets led the NL for the first time with 255.\n\nHyun-Jin Ryu of the Los Angeles Dodgers won his first ERA title at 2.32. Cole led the AL at 2.50, just ahead of Verlander\u2019s 2.58.\n\nHouston (107), the Dodgers (106), the Yankees (103) and Minnesota (101) became the first four teams to win 100 games in the same season. Detroit (114), Baltimore (108), Miami (105) and Kansas City (103) became the second set of four teams to lose 100 in the same year and the first since Tampa Bay, Detroit, Milwaukee and Kansas City in 2002.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s Kirby Yates led the major league with 41 saves and Houston\u2019s Roberto Osuna topped the AL with 38.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. had 37 stolen bases, the lowest total for an NL leader since Maury Wills\u2019 31 for the 1961 Los Angeles Dodgers. Seattle\u2019s Mallex Smith led the AL with 46.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major league batters finished with 6,776 home runs, shattering the previous record of 6,105 set two years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/tigers_white_sox_baseball_54086_c0-123-3000-1872_s1770x1032.jpg?638d87d471198716a92bdd753afc4a2ee0294bf9", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
