FB -0.11% has suspended tens of thousands of apps over data-privacy concerns as the social-media company attempts to tighten oversight of developers after receiving a $5 billion fine for failing to protect users\u2019 data.\n\nIn a blog post Friday, Facebook said the suspended apps are associated with about 400 developers, though many were still in test phases. The company said it also banned some apps permanently and noted that it had filed lawsuits earlier this year against some developers for fraud or for failing to cooperate with an internal investigation.\n\nFacebook\u2019s action on Friday is by far the largest step it has taken to enforce its rules for developers. In May of 2018 the company said it had suspended about 200 apps for suspected misuse of users\u2019 information; months later, that number grew to more than 400.\n\n\u201cApp developers remain a vital part of the Facebook ecosystem,\u201d the company said in the blog post. \u201cThey help to make our world more social and more engaging. But people need to know we\u2019re protecting their privacy.\u201d\n\nFacebook said it first began cracking down on apps that violate its policies in March 2018 in response to its role in a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct data firm that worked on President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Using data purchased from a Facebook quiz app, the firm compiled personality profiles of tens of millions of people\u2014revelations that sparked a Federal Trade Commission investigation.\n\nThe apps that were the focus of Facebook\u2019s review had access to an earlier, more permissive system that allowed developers to collect information on their own apps\u2019 users as well as those users\u2019 friends.\n\n\u201cFacebook didn\u2019t screen developers or their apps before giving them access to massive amounts of data that users had designated as private,\u201d the FTC said at the time of its record-setting settlement with Facebook. Facebook began phasing out developers\u2019 ability to access such extensive data in 2014, though the federal agency said some entities maintained that access until last year.\n\nTo settle the FTC investigation, Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion fine and adopt new oversight practices, including creating a privacy committee with independent board members. It also committed to more carefully vetting apps that access user data and notifying users in instances where it believes data might have been misused.\n\nIn addition to the app suspensions and removals, Facebook said Friday that it had created new rules to more tightly control developers\u2019 access to its data.\n\nFor example, apps that provide little value to users, such as personality quizzes, may not be allowed, the company said. Facebook also said it has expanded teams that investigate abuse of data-access rules.\n\nSeparately, Facebook said its agreement with the FTC requires developers to now certify compliance with its policies annually.\n\n\u201cAny developer that doesn\u2019t go along with these requirements will be held accountable,\u201d the company said.\n\nRelated Video Facebook must pay a $5 billion fine after the FTC found the social media company deceived users and improperly managed their personal data. Under the settlement, Facebook is also subject to stricter oversight on how it manages user data. WSJ explains what that means for users. Photo: Andrew Harnik / Associated Press\n\nWrite to Sarah E.
