What sight to behold.\n\nSee, one of the namesakes of the school and the namesake of the monument had something in common.\n\nGeorge Washington was a slave owner from Virginia. Anthony Bowen was born a slave in Maryland. Bowen, a Christian, eventually bought his freedom, opened a faith-based schoolhouse for black children and eventually got federal funding for his school.\n\nWashington became the nation\u2019s first president and was among the brain trust who founded the nation\u2019s capital on land owned by Virginia and Maryland.\n\nThe view from atop the Washington Monument includes the White House, which Washington never occupied, and the U.S. Capitol and various Senate and House buildings, where several top city leaders were making a case for D.C. statehood on Thursday.\n\nUnderstand, the founders of the capital never intended for D.C. to be a state but a federal district to house the federal government.\n\nYet, some advocates for statehood want to flip the script of the U.S. Constitution, and some quasi-supporters even want to grant the District\u2019s nonvoting House delegate full voting rights.\n\nTheir efforts are not a fool\u2019s errand, but they do need to be reminded that Congress, the president and the U.S. Supreme Court cannot merely wave their magic wands and make it so.\n\nThe parchment used to create our republic and describe our government is surely old, but it will withstand a man-made wand (likely manfractured in China).\n\nGrowing up in Washington, as Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Mayor Muriel Bowser did, one enjoys traisping to the National Mall, walking up (and sometimes skipping) the 897 steps of the Washington Monument, peering through the windows and relishing the spectacular view of the District.\n\nIt\u2019s OK that Virginians reclaimed their land, and Marylanders occasionally encouraging D.C. voters to join their state is OK, too.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no place like home, your own home.\n\nSo now that the mayor, Mrs. Norton and other top D.C. leaders have wrapped up their weeklong statehood push, perhaps they can catch their breath and prepare for a more realistic celebration, the signing of the Residence Act of 1790 to create a national capital. They want to even rip Washington\u2019s name off and rename the District.\n\nWell, don\u2019t get me started.\n\nAnyway, if they want to stage a big birthday bash in 2021 that would be OK, too \u2014 as L\u2019Enfant, et al, began laying out the District in 1791.\n\nWashington forever!\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
