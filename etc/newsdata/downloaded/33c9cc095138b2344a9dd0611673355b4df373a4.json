REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Passport maker De La Rue (DLAR.L) warned on Wednesday that its annual profit would be significantly lower than market expectations, as its new top boss, a turnaround specialist, leads a review of the business.\n\nThe company did not specify the reason for its lowered expectations, but a previous warning was triggered by a margin squeeze from competitive pressures in banknote printing.\n\nThe company had said in May that operating profit for the current year would be \u201csomewhat lower\u201d than the previous year.\n\nEarlier this month, it named Clive Vacher as chief executive officer. He faces significant challenges alongside new chairman Kevin Loosemore.\n\nThe company\u2019s woes have been compounded by the loss of its 400 million pound contract to produce Britain\u2019s passports ahead of the country\u2019s planned exit from the European Union.\n\nThe group, which prints some 7 billion banknotes and 15 million passports a year, also said it expects adjusted operating profit for the first-half ended Sept.28 to be in the low-to-mid single digit millions. It reported a profit of 17 million pounds for the same period last year.\n\nShares of the smallcap firm have more than halved in value since the first profit warning and could lose as much as 30% on Wednesday, according to premarket indications from traders.", "description": "Passport maker De La Rue warned on Wednesday that its annual profit would be significantly lower than market expectations, as its new top boss, a turnaround specialist, leads a review of the business.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446458005&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0I2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
