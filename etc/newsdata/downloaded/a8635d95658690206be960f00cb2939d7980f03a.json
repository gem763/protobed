The goal calmed us down and, from there, we imposed ourselves well. We didn't give much away and had chances to score more.\n\n\"If you want to win LaLiga you have to win a lot of games away from home, not just your home games. Getafe were a tough rival, it's a hard place to come and we've played well. Now we have three days to prepare for Inter.\"\n\nBarca were without Ousmane Dembele for the Getafe trip due to a thigh injury and it remains to be seen whether the France international will be fit for Wednesday's Champions League showdown against Inter.\n\n\"It's true that I left him out of the [matchday] squad,\" Valverde added. \"It was more as a precaution. He's told me that he is calm. We think it's a little nuisance, but it's nothing serious.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen asked if Dembele would feature against Inter, Valverde replied: \"I don't know. I wish that wasn't the case, but I can't say for sure.\"", "description": "Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde was full of praise for Luis Suarez following Saturday's victory away to Getafe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9AzAM6TR4Z06hPdoUMHr6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wklx3G5a_tQ8zsTKgCtqSA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/2b9b43762749fb7215ccb9923f819c3e", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
