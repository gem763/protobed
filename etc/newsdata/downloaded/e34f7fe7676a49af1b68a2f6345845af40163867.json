It was due to cover 260km (160 miles) of Pacific waters in the archipelago country.\n\nBut it set off without notifying authorities, and did not issue a distress signal when it began to fall apart hours after leaving shore.\n\nIt did not have a working or activated radio beacon - meaning it was days before anyone realised the ferry was missing.\n\nWhen the alarm was finally raised, an international search effort got under way, with aircraft from New Zealand, Australia and the US scanning the ocean.\n\nOn 27 January, a New Zealand military plane found one of the ferry's aluminium boats carrying seven survivors, among them a 14-year old girl.\n\nThe inquiry was ordered by the Kiribati government. It found:\n\nThe ferry - which was also carry 30 tonnes of copra (dried coconut) - was not licensed to carry passengers at sea\n\nThe master, who died in the accident, \"took no notice\" of weather warnings\n\nThe boat broke apart because of \"recent groundings\" and poor maintenance\n\nOf the two life rafts, one got a puncture, and the other suffered a \"failed\" floor\n\nThere were not enough lifejackets for all passengers\n\nThere was widespread use of alcohol by the master and crew during working hours\n\nThe use of alcohol \"gave ever drunken crew the feeling of grandeur and power to make decisions alone\".\n\nThe inquiry made a number of recommendations, including a national standard on boat building; a ban on alcohol for crew during working hours; and a strengthened code of ethics.", "description": "One of the victims on the Kiribati ship was a woman who died while giving birth after the sinking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6167/production/_99853942_05671921-76ab-4d57-a43e-5f3e60c3d9a2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
