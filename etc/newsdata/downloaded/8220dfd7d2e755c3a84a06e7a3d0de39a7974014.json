The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price.\n\nFundstrat's Mr Lee retains his overall optimism for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"For the most part, our current framework is that \u2018crypto winter\u2019 ended in late-2018 and bitcoin is in a new bull market,\" Mr Lee said. \"But like prior bull markets, the rise in price is not continuous and we are in the midst of a consolidation, with potential downside risk near-term.\n\n\"In other words, the crypto market is not about being greedy, but rather, to keep sufficient dry powder to take advantage of dips.\"\n\nMr Lee said the start of this risk-off period was July 31st because Fundstrat\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) fell below 66.\n\n\"Historically, a downturn in the BMI and a break below 66 signalled forthcoming weakness. And this has largely played out in 2019. We are now waiting for the BMI to fall below 30 before concluding sentiment has properly reset.\"\n\nWhat could go wrong? Mr Lee asks: \"White House and Congress have incrementally turned hostile to crypto, particularly because of Libra. As we have noted multiple times recently, we think the US remains the central crypto story over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\"Bottom line: We remain risk-off for bitcoin and crypto but see a higher probability of conditions improving within the next 10 weeks. Thus, bitcoin below $US7000 would be an attractive risk/reward.\"\n\nWith Reuters", "description": "The cryptocurrency was more than 9 per cent lower after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg cast doubt over the outlook for Libra.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7486%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_219%2C$y_257/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/353b38249ab82a8b987f6a1d6f6ebd7228216ba5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
