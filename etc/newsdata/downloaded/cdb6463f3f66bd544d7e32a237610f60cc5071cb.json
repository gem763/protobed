Andreas Solaro/Pool via REUTERS\n\nPompeo reserved his toughest criticism for China in a keynote speech at a Vatican conference on religious freedom. The others were Cuba, Iran, Pakistan and Myanmar.\n\n\u201cWhen the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God. That\u2019s why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims ... in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the state rules absolutely, God becomes an absolute threat to authority,\u201d he said.\n\nChina has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang that it describes as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.\n\n\u201cToday we must gird ourselves for another battle in defense of human dignity and religious freedom. The stakes are arguably higher than they were even during the Cold War, because the threats are more diverse and more numerous,\u201d he said at the conference organized by the U.S. embassy to the Vatican.\n\nPompeo, who is due to meet Pope Francis on Thursday morning, later visited the Sistine Chapel and other parts of the Vatican museums.\n\nHis trip, which will also include a visit to his ancestral home in the rugged Abruzzo region northeast of Rome and stops in Montenegro, North Macedonia and Greece, has been overshadowed by an impeachment inquiry at home targeting President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic opponents have accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his personal political benefit.\n\nAt issue is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBiden\u2019s son had served as a director for a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nU.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and two other Democratic committee chairmen have accused Pompeo of \u201cstonewalling\u201d the impeachment inquiry, and called him a \u201cfact witness\u201d in the investigation, based on media reports that he had listened in on Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.\n\nPompeo has not commented on Wall Street Journal report saying he took part in the phone call.\n\nOn Tuesday, he sternly objected to a move by the U.S. House of Representatives to obtain depositions from five current and former State Department officials as part of an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday blasted China over its treatment of Uighur Muslims, during a Vatican conference taking place in the shadow of a political crisis back home.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436232980&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910X8"}
