It turned out to be a nothing call,\u201d Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Zelensky, who had a long-scheduled meeting with Mr Trump at the United Nations on Wednesday, also played down the call. \u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d he said.\n\nLater in the day, Mr Trump dismissed as a \"joke\" the grounds laid out for the impeachment inquiry into him.\n\n\"They are getting hit hard on this witch hunt because when they look at the information, it's a joke,\" said the president, who struck an uncharacteristically subdued tone at his first news conference since Democrats launched an official impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Impeachment for that? When you have a wonderful meeting or you have a wonderful phone conversation?\"\n\nThe five-page \u201cmemorandum\u201d declassified and released under Mr Trump\u2019s orders detailed a call with Mr Zelensky on July 25 which lasted 30 minutes. It was not a verbatim transcript but compiled from notes taken at the time.\n\nThe conversation begins with Mr Trump congratulating Mr Zelensky on his election victory and is followed by a discussion about US support for Ukraine. Mr Trump then asks for a \u201cfavour\u201d.\n\nAt first Mr Trump mentions a number of issues linked to Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the subsequent investigation, suggesting the Ukrainian president should try to \u201cfind out what happened\u201d. Mr Zelensky responds by saying those issues are \u201cvery important\u201d.\n\nThen Mr Trump brings up another topic: \u201cThe other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nMr Zelensky responds by saying that a new prosecutor general loyal to him will soon be established, adding: \u201cHe or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d\n\nThe incident Mr Trump was referring to was Mr Biden\u2019s calls while he was US vice president for Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor to be sacked. The demand was echoed by other Western countries and centred on perceived failure by the prosecutor to crack down on corruption at the time.\n\nMr Trump and his allies have raised questions over the behaviour given Mr Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden was then working for a Ukrainian gas company. The Ukrainian prosecutor in question had at one point been looking into that company. Mr Biden has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFormer officials in Barack Obama\u2019s administration have said previously that Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings had no effect on Mr Biden\u2019s actions over Ukraine. Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cattorney general\u201d comment appears to reference his own appointee, Mr Barr.\n\nOn Wednesday the US Justice Department said Mr Barr never spoke to Mr Trump about working with Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, according to US media reports.\n\nThe transcript appears less clear on whether Mr Trump held back hundreds of millions of pounds worth of military aid to Ukraine to strong-arm its country\u2019s leader into investigating the Bidens, as has been alleged.", "description": "Donald Trump privately urged the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, according to an explosive transcript of a phone call released on Wednesday.
