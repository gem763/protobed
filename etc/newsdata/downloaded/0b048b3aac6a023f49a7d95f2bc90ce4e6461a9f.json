She won the silver medal in contact fighting at the Moscow Wushu Stars 2019 tournament in Russia this February. Earlier, she had bagged two silver medals for India at the 3rd International Thai Martial Arts Games 2018 in Bangkok. She also won the bronze at the 2nd International Thai Martial Arts Games in 2017. Among this feisty young athlete\u2019s other achievements is a bronze in the Senior Women\u2019s category at the 9th National Grappling Championship in Delhi in 2016.The determined fighter talks about her incredible journey.The 2nd International Thai Martial Arts Games in 2017 in Bangkok was my first international championship. At the early stages, I felt under-prepared in terms of my skills and fitness, but as the championship progressed, I took notes from the experienced players, and started mirroring their style. Gradually, I gained confidence and realised I wasn\u2019t as bad as I had thought. I also made a lot of friends among sportspersons and organisers. From thereon, many of them helped me, and advised me to train in Thailand\u2014the hub of martial arts training\u2014to up my game. As a result, I was far more prepared at this year\u2019s Moscow Wushu Stars 2019 tournament in Russia in February. I won the silver by beating a Russian athlete on her home turf. I will forever be grateful to my coach for preparing me so well.Not much has changed. It feels as if my win didn\u2019t make a difference at all. MMA, kickboxing, and other martial arts are not so popular in India. The government also doesn\u2019t give these sports much recognition. I, however, don\u2019t let that feeling bog me down. I am happy to represent both Tibet and India as it is a privilege, and I want to keep giving it my best shot.I practice at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in New Delhi daily, morning and evening. I am fortunate to have Shelly ma\u2019am (Pantilinmei Kamei) from Manipur as my coach. As part of my training, I also have to ensure that I follow the correct diet so that I maintain my weight for the category I fight in (49 kg). I have plenty of fruits, vegetables, and proteins, and avoid rice.Growing up in Sikkim, I was a Muhammad Ali fan, and watched his fight videos on repeat. I wanted to become a boxer but lacked a guiding factor in life since I lost my parents when I was a child. After completing my studies, I landed a job as a journalist in Dharamsala, but wasn\u2019t satisfied with what I was doing. I went back to my childhood dream to become a boxer, and quit my job. In 2014, I came to Delhi to start training. By then, Manipuri boxer Laishram Sarita Devi had become my inspiration, and I still consider her my hero. I would train hard since I wanted to become like her. After a point, I realised that the competition was too intense in the Indian boxing circuit, and decided to shift my focus to MMA.Finance was the main one. After some time, I could not afford to train full-time. My savings had run out, and I needed a fixed stream of income for living and training expenses. I took a break, and worked part-time jobs in the hospitality sector for a year to shore up my finances, and save up enough to get back to what I really wanted to do. My friends helped in their own ways, by letting me stay with them, even though they thought I was a bit mad!By 2016, I was participating in state-level competitions\u2014I won a bronze in the Senior Women\u2019s category at the 9th National Grappling Championship in Delhi. In 2017, I competed at the 2nd International Thai Martial Arts Games in Bangkok. I was up against participants from 56 countries and won the bronze. I haven\u2019t looked back since.My childhood has made me who I am. Like I said, I was orphaned very young, my mother passed away when I was three, andmy father when I was seven. While I had community sponsors who ensured that I had an uninterrupted education, I had to work sometimes as house help, often as a babysitter and in a few cases looking after farm animals to earn a little money. These experiences, however, have toughened me and taught me to take care of myself. I have been lucky that God has always looked after me and blessed me with great friends who have made up for my lack of family.", "description": "Tenzin Pema, a Tibetan-origin wushu and mixed martial arts sportsperson has a number of prestigious laurels to her name, but fame continues to elude her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthtenzin1571931028.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
