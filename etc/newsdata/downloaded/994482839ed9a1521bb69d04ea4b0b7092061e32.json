Did it benefit us or did it cause harm? [Government officials] don\u2019t want the jury to consider that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want the jury strictly to consider whether these actions were lawful or unlawful, not whether they were right or wrong. And I\u2019m sorry, but that defeats the purpose of a jury trial.\u201d\n\nSnowden\u2019s interview comes just one day before his memoir, \u201cPermanent Record,\u201d is set to be released, sharing his side of the story.", "description": "The whistleblower who remains in exile in Russia wants a chance to explain himself in court.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7fb95a3b00002efad4b48c.jpeg?cache=gmskjkfgju&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
