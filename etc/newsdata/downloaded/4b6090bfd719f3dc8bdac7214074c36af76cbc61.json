The company had promised over a year ago that it would soon roll out support for offline viewing, having developed a way to include advertising with its downloads. However, the downloads feature launching today is only available to iOS users on Hulu\u2019s \u201cNo Ads\u201d plan, the company says.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Hulu couldn\u2019t offer a timeline for when support would arrive on the ad-supported version of Hulu, whether those plans had been shelved, nor could it explain the delay to bring a downloads product to market.\n\nAt launch, there are \u201cthousands\u201d of TV shows and movies offered for offline viewing, including Hulu Originals like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Shrill and The Act, as well as series like Family Guy, Desperate Housewives, This is Us, How I Met Your Mother, and ER. In fact, the majority of the content on Hulu is available for offline viewing, as its content agreements were already negotiated to allow for downloads.\n\nIn a few cases, however, only past seasons of a TV show will be offered for download.\n\nTo access the content, Hulu is adding a new \u201cDownloads\u201d tab at the bottom of the screen. You can also browse for shows and movies to download by clicking on \u201cSee What\u2019s Downloadable,\u201d says Hulu.\n\nYou can also search for specific titles to see if they\u2019re offered for offline viewing. If so, a download icon will be displayed on the title\u2019s details page.\n\nViewers will be able to download up to 25 titles across 5 devices, and will have up to 30 days to watch the downloaded content. After starting playback of downloaded content, viewers have 2 days to finish before the download expires. If you didn\u2019t finish watching, you\u2019ll have to renew the expired download while online \u2014 assuming it\u2019s still offered on Hulu.\n\nThe feature is initially available for iOS users but Android users will get the same option \u201csoon,\u201d says Hulu.\n\nHulu is aware that it\u2019s extremely late to add support for offline viewing.\n\nMost consumers today expect there to be a way to download content, ad-free, for those times they want to watch TV shows or movies without access to the internet \u2014 like when traveling by plane or underground train, for example.\n\nAmazon Prime Video added downloads to its service way back in 2015, and Netflix followed the next year. Even smaller players in the streaming market have since added downloads, like CBS All Access did last year, and Showtime the year prior.\n\nHulu had barely even touched on the topic, until recently. At the 2018 Newfronts, Hulu CEO Randy Freer told advertisers that a \u201cdownloads\u201d feature would arrive sometime in the \u201c2018-2019 Upfront season.\u201d He said the feature would allow viewers to download shows with ads included, which would benefit advertisers.\n\nSince then, there\u2019s been no news as to why the option hadn\u2019t yet arrived or why.\n\nOne possible explanation some people may point to is Hulu\u2019s big executive re-organization last summer, which saw the departure of its Chief Content Officer and its SVP of Experience, among others. But the re-org didn\u2019t really involve Hulu\u2019s technical team, so that shouldn\u2019t have had a significant impact. However, the company did also launch a revamped version of its consumer mobile app this summer \u2014 a change that Hulu may have decided should be prioritized ahead of adding the new Downloads functionality.\n\nHulu could also be struggling with the technical challenges of ad-supported downloads, perhaps. Making those ads work properly and be attributed correctly could require a longer timeframe than originally planned. And Hulu may even be reconsidering if such a product is necessary, as long as on-demand downloads are available.\n\nThe downloads feature will arrive on iOS today, but you\u2019ll need to update your app to gain the option.", "description": "Hulu is finally adding downloads to its streaming service, years after Netflix and Amazon Prime Video did the same.
