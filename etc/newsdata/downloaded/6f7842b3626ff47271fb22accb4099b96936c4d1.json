O\u2019Rourke is currently polling nationally at just below two percent of the Democratic vote.\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren released her own LGBT rights platform in which she promises to provide government funding for gender transition surgeries for inmates. In addition, she pledged to incarcerate transgender inmates with prisoners of the opposite biological sex, meaning that a transgender man would be placed in a women\u2019s prison.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) released a statement Friday condemning Beto O'Rourke for \"extreme intolerance\" after O'Rourke advocated revoking tax-exempt status from churches that refuse to perform same-sex marriages.\"This bigoted nonsense would target a lot of sincere Christians", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/11RA_nuXWX3EahZTGtwzSw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/73a42ccf812dccc5185bdca510c47983", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
