Facebook scored $17.652 billion of revenue, up 29 percent year-over-year, with $2.12 in earnings per share.\n\nFacebook\u2019s earnings beat expectations compared to Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimates of $17.37 billion in revenue and $1.91 earnings per share. Facebook\u2019s quarter was mixed compared to Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimate of $2.28 EPS. Facebook earned $6 billion in profit after only racking up $2.6 billion last quarter due to its SEC settlement.\n\nFacebook shares rose to 5.18% in after-hours trading to $198.01 after earnings were announced, following a day where it closed down 0.56% at $188.25.\n\nNotably, Facebook gained 2 million users in each of its core US & Canada and Europe markets that drive its business, after quarters of shrinkage, no growth, or weak growth there in the past 2 years. Average revenue per user grew healthily across all markets, boding well for Facebook\u2019s ability to monetize the developing world where the bulk of user growth currently comes from.\n\nFacebook says 2.2 billion users access Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger every day, and 2.8 billion use one of this family of apps each month. That\u2019s up from 2.1 billion and 2.7 billion last quarter. Facebook has managed to stay sticky even as it faces increased competition from a revived Snapchat, and more recently TikTok. However, those rivals might more heavily weigh on Instagram, for which Facebook doesn\u2019t routinely disclose user stats.\n\nZuckerberg Defends Political Ads Policy\n\nFacebook\u2019s earnings announcement was somewhat overshadowed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announcing it would ban all political ads \u2014 something TechCrunch previously recommended social networks do. That move flies in the face of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s staunch support for allowing politicians to spread misinformation without fact-checks via Facebook ads. This should put additional pressure on Facebook to rethink its policy.\n\nZuckerberg doubled-down on the policy saying \u201cI believe that the better approach is to work to increase transparency. Ads on Facebook are already more transparent than anywhere else\u201d he said. Attempting to dispel that the policy is driven by greed, he noted Facebook expects political ads to make up less than \u201cless than 0.5% of our revenue next year\u201d. Since people will disagree and the issue will keep coming up, Zuckerberg admitted it\u2019s going to be \u201ca very tough year.\u201d\n\nFacebook also announced that lead independent board member Susan D Desmond-Hellman has resigned to focus on health issues.\n\nEarnings Call Highlights\n\nFacebook expects revenue deceleration to be pronounced in Q4. But CFO David Wehner provided some hope, saying \u201cwe would expect our revenue growth deceleration in 2020 versus the q4 rate to be much less pronounced.\u201d That led Facebook\u2019s share price to spike from around $191 to around $198.\n\nHowever, Facebook will maintain its aggressive hiring to moderate content. While the company has touted how artificial intelligence would increasingly help, Zuckerberg said that hiring would continue since \u201cThere\u2019s just so much content. We do need a lot of people.\u201d\n\nRegarding Libra\u2019s regulatory pushback, Zuckerberg explained that Facebook was already diversified in commerce if that doesn\u2019t work out, citing WhatsApp Payments, Facebook Marketplace, and Instagram shopping.\n\nOn anti-trust concerns, Zuckerberg reminded analysts that Instagram\u2019s success wasn\u2019t assured when Facebook acquired it, and it\u2019s survived a lot of competition thanks to Facebook\u2019s contributions. In a new talking point we\u2019re likely to hear more of, Zuckerberg noted that other competitors had used their success in one vertical to push others, saying \u201cApple and Google built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into their operating systems\u201d.\n\nScandals Continue, But So Does Growth\n\nOverall, it was another rough quarter for Facebook\u2019s public perception as it dealt with outages and struggled to get buy-in from regulators for its Libra cryptocurrency project. Former co-founder Chris Hughes (who I\u2019ll be leading a talk with at SXSW) campaigned for the social network to be broken up \u2014 a position echoed by Elisabeth Warren and other presidential candidates.\n\nThe company did spin up some new revenue sources, including taking a 30% cut of fan patronage subscriptions to content creators. It\u2019s also trying to sell video subscriptions for publishers, and it upped the price of its Workplace collaboration suite. But gains were likely offset as the company continued to rapidly hire to address abusive content on its platform, which saw headcount grow 28% year-over-year to 43,000. There are still problems with how it treats content moderators, and Facebook has had to repeatedly remove coordinated misinformation campaigns from abroad. Appearing concerned about its waning brand, Facebook moved to add \u201cfrom Facebook\u201d to the names of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile it escaped with just a $5 billion fine as part of its FTC settlement that some consider a slap on the wrist, especially since it won\u2019t have to significantly alter its business model. But the company will have to continue to invest and divert product resources to meet its new privacy, security, and transparency requirements. These could slow its response to a growing threat: Chinese tech giant ByteDance\u2019s TikTok.", "description": "Despite ongoing public relations crises, Facebook kept growing in Q3 2019, demonstrating that media backlash does not necessarily equate to poor business performance.
