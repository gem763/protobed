In the conference call, Singer explained in English that he needed SUI to wire $100,000 to Singer's bank account, which would be \"paid to the coach at UCLA\" in exchange for a letter of intent from the coach recruiting Applicant 1 onto his soccer team,' states the complaint.\n\n'Singer further explained that the $100,000 would be paid to \"the UCLA men's soccer coach directly.\" The translator translated what Singer said into Chinese, telling SUI: \"Your son is admitted to this school through UCLA's soccer team.\n\n'That $100,000 is directly transferred to that soccer coach. So, although your son is a tennis player, because there is a place in soccer team, so it is the soccer team that takes your son.\"'\n\nThe court filing then states: 'SUI responded, \"OK.\"'", "description": "Gregory and Marcia Abbott paid $50,000 to have a test proctor falsify their daughter's ACT exam in 2018, and $75,000 to do the same in her SAT subject tests.
