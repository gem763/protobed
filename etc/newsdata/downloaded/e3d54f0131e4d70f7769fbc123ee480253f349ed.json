After a series of delays, the phone was eventually released to a lackluster reception in October 2018.\n\nThe promised modules never materialized, and in March, Jannard announced \u201cbig changes\u201d for the Hydrogen program. Instead of attachments for the Hydrogen One, the company instead would be working on a new \u201cpro camera version\u201d of the Hydrogen One smartphone with a camera designed by the RED team (instead of the off-the-shelf components found in the original model.)\n\nJannard would go on to blame the Hydrogen One\u2019s unnamed Chinese ODM for having \u201csignificantly under-performed\u201d on the original phone in July, teasing a new Hydrogen Two model designed \u201cvirtually from scratch\u201d with a new manufacturing partner. But based on today\u2019s announcement, whatever Hydrogen One successor the company had in the works won\u2019t be making it to market, at least as part of the Hydrogen brand.\n\nThe Hydrogen Two seems to be dead\n\nCustomers who have bought into the Hydrogen One won\u2019t be left entirely in the lurch \u2014 Jannard\u2019s post promises that \u201cHydrogen One will continue to be supported in the future.\u201d Jannard also teased RED\u2019s next camera, the Komodo 6K, which he says is \u201cabout to be launched\u201d and will work with the Hydrogen One in some fashion. But it\u2019s likely a disappointing ending for anyone hoping that RED would be able to leverage some of the failures of the original model into a more refined product later on.\n\nJannard has been the face of RED and its high-end cameras since he founded the company back in 1999. According to Jannard, RED Digital Cinema will live on under the leadership of Jarred Land (RED\u2019s current president), Tommy Rios (RED\u2019s executive vice president) and Jamin Jannard (RED\u2019s president of marketing and creative).", "description": "RED\u2019s ambitious Hydrogen phone project is ending after the release of just a single device, the Hydrogen One, according to an announcement from company founder Jim Jannard that he is \"shutting down the HYDROGEN project\" as he retires due to \"a few health issues.\"", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8SnRi8pdPTGo3giTPvL8QK7uPk=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13335571/akrales_181025_3026_0102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
