The Montreal Expos became the Nationals by the narrowest of margins, a 7-6 vote of the D.C. Council to use public financing to build an unpopular stadium for an unnamed team in an unknown part of town.\n\nFourteen years ago, the nascent Washington franchise operated out of a couple of rattling trailers in the parking lot of a rusty, rat-infested stadium that had been abandoned by both its baseball and football tenants. For years, the team was awful, a cellar-dweller that lost 100-plus games per season.\n\nAD\n\nThis week\u2019s victory came just eight months after the Nationals lost their marquee player, who signed a mega-contract with the reviled rival Phillies a couple of hours up the interstate. This season began with a losing skid that had even diehard fans declaring their surrender and calling for the manager\u2019s head.\n\nAD\n\nEven now, an online encyclopedia defines the Nationals simply as \u201cone of two current major league franchises to have never played in the World Series.\u201d (The unrelieved drought is in Seattle.)\n\nAnd now suddenly misery has flipped to joy. A divided city feels united, if only for a fleeting moment.\n\n\u201cThis is catharsis,\u201d said Fliegel, a business strategist in the aerospace industry who has written a Nats blog since the team\u2019s first season. \u201cFinally, they\u2019ve done it. It just connects you to the city. You feel a pride of place through the team. Locals like to point out the difference between \u2018Washington\u2019 and \u2018D.C.\u2019 \u2014 the people who just come here to work and the people who really live here. With the Nats, it doesn\u2019t matter why you\u2019re here. You live here and you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere have been more popular teams \u2014 the Redskins at their peak owned a day of the week in the most important city in the world. And there have been other championships \u2014 hockey\u2019s Capitals captured hearts in their Stanley Cup run two seasons ago and the basketball Mystics just won their first trophy last week.\n\nAD\n\nBut because baseball is played every day during its season, it has the capacity to insinuate itself into people\u2019s lives in a more constant way. And at a time when other institutions that once provided the region\u2019s civic glue \u2014 the Redskins, Metro, The Washington Post \u2014 have struggled or shifted their roles, Washingtonians craved something that could bring people together.\n\n\u201cThe Nats have truly grabbed hold of Washington \u2014 I\u2019m enchanted and my 33-year-old son\u2019s totally enchanted,\u201d said Kornheiser, who hosts ESPN\u2019s \u201cPardon the Interruption\u201d and a podcast. \u201cThis is a chance for people around the country to see Washington as something other than a dysfunctional, back-biting city.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKornheiser moved to Washington in 1979 to write sports columns for this newspaper, arriving from his hometown of New York, where sports teams come in pairs in each game.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like the hold the Redskins had on Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI was looking around for baseball and people said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s up the road.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter losing the Senators baseball franchise twice \u2014 in 1961 to become the Minnesota Twins and in 1972 to become the Texas Rangers \u2014 D.C. fans spent three decades battling I-95 traffic to get to to games in Baltimore. Kornheiser went along with the crowd; he even framed his scorecard from the first game at Camden Yards, the Orioles\u2019 spiffy ballpark that opened in 1992.\n\nAD\n\nBut although the Orioles came to depend on Washington fans, the craving for a team of their own nagged at generations of Washingtonians.\n\nFor years, Washington boosters pitched the idea that the city was the biggest, richest, best-educated market without a baseball team \u2014 the perfect market for a sport that was suffering from mounting attendance problems in several cities. The Senators\u2019 failures had come in a time when the DMV was far less populated, with vastly less disposable income and without one of the country\u2019s busiest transit systems.\n\nAD\n\nFor decades, those arguments fell flat. Washington was a loser sports town. Baseball had failed twice. Baltimore was just up the road. Washingtonians weren\u2019t really from there, had no allegiance to the place (never mind that the Redskins at the time were the NFL\u2019s biggest moneymaker).\n\n\u201cThere are no real baseball fans in D.C.,\u201d Orioles owner Peter Angelos infamously pronounced in a last-ditch effort to kill the move to Washington in 2004.\n\nWhen he said that, Angelos\u2019s team was flying high, drawing 2.75 million fans that summer, 12th-best in baseball. This year, with his team a shambles on the field, the O\u2019s fell to 1.3 million paying customers, 28th of baseball\u2019s 30 teams.\n\nAD\n\nBringing baseball to Washington \u201cwould be an affront to the Orioles franchise,\u201d Angelos said back then. \u201cBoth franchises would drive themselves financially into the ground.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe was right about his own business. The Nats, not so much: The team drew 2.3 million fans this season, down from the huge numbers that poured out to RFK when baseball first returned to Washington, but about average for the sport.\n\nBeyond the games, the stadium has sparked a storm of development, creating one of the region\u2019s most popular entertainment clusters, reviving the Southwest waterfront and luring more than 10,000 new residents.\n\n\u201cMy whole big shtick was: Restore respect to D.C., show that the city\u2019s working, and restore the Anacostia River,\u201d said Williams, who was mayor from 1999 to 2007. \u201cBaseball helped achieve all of those goals, so it\u2019s one of my proudest things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe stadium was built, with Williams driving the site choice, along a riverfront that had been the city\u2019s trashheap, a ragtag, largely forgotten hodgepodge of scrap yards, taxi barns, cement plants, sex clubs, vacant lots and abandoned dreams.\n\nAD\n\nToday, a riverfront boardwalk draws families to summertime concerts and water features. Washingtonian magazine Wednesday called the area possibly \u201cthe hottest dining neighborhood in D.C.\u201d Where there was one forlorn liquor store and a corner carryout surrounded by empty lots, there are now more than 50 restaurants. Where a few dozen people lived, new highrise apartment buildings have produced crowded sidewalks and an unusually busy Metro station.\n\nThe Navy Yard station, a block from the ballpark, has seen average weekday traffic shoot up by more than 250 percent since 2007, the year before Nationals Park opened, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. Some of that is fans attending games \u2014 about a quarter of Nats fans at Tuesday\u2019s game went home by Metro, Stessel said \u2014 but most riders are new residents, workers and people going to the new eateries and other amenities.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNavy Yard has really become a neighborhood unto itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt counters the trend we\u2019ve seen at most stations,\u201d where usage of the subway system has declined in recent years because of extensive repair work, reduced service and competition from ride-hailing apps.\n\nAD\n\nThe stadium area has so far generated more than $7 for every dollar the city invested in infrastructure, including about $300 million a year in new tax revenue to the city, according to a study by the Capitol Riverfront business improvement district.\n\nOpponents of the deal to bring the Nats to town argued that the team\u2019s owners should pay all, most or at least some of the massive cost of a stadium. But Major League Baseball, holding all the cards, insisted that the city bear nearly all the risk.\n\n\u201cVoting against the stadium doesn\u2019t mean money will automatically go to schools and other needs,\u201d then-council member and future mayor Adrian Fenty said at the time. \u201cBut it does mean that a government that does not get those things right should not be exploring putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the pockets of multimillionaires.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, those who opposed the stadium have generally stuck to their positions, noting that every dollar committed to financing the ballpark was therefore unavailable for building schools or libraries. Williams said that not one of the council members who voted against the stadium deal has ever told him they were wrong to do so.\n\nOne former council member who insisted on a better deal now says the city was right both to push back against the deal and to finance the stadium. \u201cWe just had to make sure the original deal wasn\u2019t outlandish,\u201d Carol Schwartz said. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely been worth the investment.\u201d\n\nEconomists who argue that stadiums are a waste of public dollars still contend that all they achieve is a displacement of entertainment spending from one neighborhood to another.\n\nIn the District\u2019s case, however, that displacement has been transformative, because the city depends heavily on spending by suburbanites from Virginia and Maryland. The Nationals say that 80 percent of their fans commute in from the suburbs \u2014 45 percent from Virginia and 35 percent from Maryland \u2014 bringing their leisure dollars to the city\u2019s coffers.\n\nSimilarly, according to D.C. finance officials and real estate developers, about two-thirds of the new residents of the ballpark area have come not from other parts of the city, but from Virginia, Maryland and beyond.\n\nReceipts from taxes on tickets and food and drinks at the ballpark, as well as the ballpark tax levied on the city\u2019s largest businesses, have run so far ahead of projections that the District expects to pay off the stadium debt upwards of 10 years early.\n\n\u201cThe Nationals showed people you could come to D.C. and have a good time and be safe,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe idea that this stole from schools and public needs is nonsense. The stadium was part of an investment in the city that brought back our ability to invest in social needs.\u201d\n\nDave Marsden grew up going \u201cto see the Senators get crushed\u201d at Griffith Stadium, the baseball field in Shaw, where Howard University Hospital now stands. Now, even though he lives in Fairfax, where he is a state senator, he views the Nats as an essential binding agent.", "description": "As the Washington Nationals head to the World Series, the historic moment fuses the D.C. region", "authors": ["Marc Fisher", "Senior Editor Reporting On A Wide Range Of Topics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Fjf8nQO4UjkrDrhLdFEZUn_lD5g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVHXORXQJYI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
