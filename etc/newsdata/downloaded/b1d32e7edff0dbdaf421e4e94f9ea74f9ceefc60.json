Mr Johnson has called for a general election, which will be discussed Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity \u2013 a great pity \u2013 that this has in my view all been planned,\u201d Mr Soames told the BBC. \u201cThis is exactly what they wanted and they will try to have a general election which is what they wanted.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced,\u201d Mr Johnson wrote in an affectionate biography of the prime minister in 2014. Johnson\u2019s opponents want to avert Britain from leaving the EU without an agreement in place to regulate trade, border security and other critical issues,\u201d Kevin Sullivan and Karla Adams from The Washington Post have reported.\n\n\u201cAnalysts say a so-called no-deal Brexit could be economically damaging and lead to food and medicine shortages. Johnson has dismissed those predictions as fearmongering.\n\n\u201cJohnson also said that any delay from the 31 October deadline would disrupt progress on negotiations with the European Union over an exit deal. And he said it would undercut the government\u2019s negotiating position.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "In 1939 when\u00a0England declared war against Germany,\u00a0Winston Churchill was invited back from political exile to serve as a first lord of the admiralty and later prime minister in the war against Adolf Hitler.
