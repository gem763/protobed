For people with bipolar disorder who have mixed episodes, this can be a common experience.\n\nA mixed episode is when a person living with bipolar experiences depression and mania at the same time. Although having a manic episode and a depressive episode at the same time may sound confusing, it\u2019s actually pretty common. About 40% of people with bipolar disorder will experience a mixed episode at least once in their life.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s tricky explaining how you\u2019re feeling during a mixed episode \u2014 that\u2019s where music can come into play. We listen to music when we\u2019re sad, when we\u2019re happy or when we\u2019re angry. Music can even help us explain what mixed episodes really feel like.\n\nThat\u2019s why we asked members of our bipolar disorder community to share one song that perfectly describes their mixed episodes. Below you can read what they shared with us.\n\nRelated:\u200b Why Sleep Is Essential for Me as Someone With a Mental Illness\n\nHere are the songs our community shared with us:\n\n1. \u2018Lithium\u2019 by Nirvana\n\n\u201c\u2018Lithium\u2019 by Nirvana since the lyrics go back and forth when it comes to feelings.

It\u2019s the song I feel perfectly describes who I am and my life in music. It\u2019s not even necessarily just the lyrics but parts of the song make me feel like I\u2019m walking through life dragging my corpse through the day and it kind of transitions to feeling like I\u2019m on a merry-go-round, like a speed up version of bipolar disorder. I always listen to it with headphones and the lights off. It\u2019s good when I feel alone in the world because the musician is bipolar as well.
