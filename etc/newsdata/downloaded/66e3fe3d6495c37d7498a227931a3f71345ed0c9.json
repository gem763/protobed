The data didn\u2019t differentiate between luxury single-family homes and luxury condo prices.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Hockney\u2019s \u2018Sur la Terrasse\u2019 Could Net $45 Million at Christie\u2019s\n\nThe numbers were pushed so high by some notable super-prime sales, according to another report released Thursday from Corcoran.\n\n\n\nThey included the $99.13 million sale of an oceanfront mansion by billionaire businessman and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team Frank McCourt. The house was reportedly bought by hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are seeing high-net-worth buyers coming in early in what is anticipated to be a long period of rising property values, specifically because of SALT,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\n\n\nIn Fort Lauderdale, the median sale price for luxury single-family homes rose 30% to $2.1 million in the third quarter, according to Douglas Elliman.\n\n\n\nPrices in Fort Lauderdale were skewed higher by a surge in sales of larger sized homes, the report said. The average square footage of luxury homes sold in the third quarter in the city was 4,741, a 15.3% increase from the same time last year.\n\n\n\nElsewhere along the coast, Boca Raton saw its median sales price for luxury single-family homes increase 33% to $2.2 million. In the village of Wellington, they jumped 66.7% to $1.42 million and in Coral Gables median prices were up 10.6% to $3.5 million.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117786?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
