That\u2019s President Donald Trump\u2019s explanation for why talks to get North Korea to give up its nuclear program haven't been going anywhere.\n\nIt was indeed Bolton\u2019s idea that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un follow the model of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up his nuclear program entirely in 2003. But the great flaw in that example, as the North Koreans often note, is that NATO-backed rebels deposed and killed Gaddafi eight years later.\n\nNow Trump is saying that Bolton, by raising the Libyan example, \u201cset us back very badly\u201d in negotiations with North Korea. \u201cWhat a disaster,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Kim Jong Un for what he said after that. He wanted nothing to do with John Bolton.\u201d\n\nNo doubt Bolton\u2019s hard-line advice on Kim was deeply offensive to the man whom Trump has come to respect, even to \u201clove.\u201d And it would seem that in a contest between Kim and Bolton, Kim was the winner.\n\nSo Bolton\u2019s advice on North Korea was one more big reason for Trump to dump him as national security adviser, especially after the North called for long awaited working level talks with the U.S. later this month\u2014on its own terms. But it\u2019s unlikely Kim will quit taunting the United States, and even less likely that talks will persuade him to give up his nukes and his missiles, which he showed two years ago have the technical ability to hit American cities.\n\nNorth Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui had barely announced the regime\u2019s vision of U.S.-North Korean negotiations before two short-range projectiles\u2014which Trump says he doesn\u2019t see as a problem\u2014soared aloft. In fact they were like exclamation points emphasizing Kim\u2019s hard line. According to Pyongyang\u2019s Korean Central News Agency, Kim even gave \u201cfield guidance\u201d to the test firing of a \u201csuper-large multiple rocket launcher.\u201d\n\nChoe\u2019s statement about the \u201cwillingness to sit with the U.S. side for comprehensive discussions\u201d might have seemed like a breakthrough after the North\u2019s failure to return to talks, a promise made during Trump\u2019s photo op with Kim on the North-South line at Panmunjom at the end of June. But even sans Bolton, there\u2019s still a problem of personalities.\n\nKim\u2019s not a fan of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo either. North Korea accused both Bolton and Pompeo of persuading Trump to walk out of his February summit with Kim in Hanoi. They had advised the president the North needed to do much more than offer a vague promise to shut down its aging nuclear complex at Yongbyon while maintaining its nuclear program at other sites.\n\n\u201c North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has dubbed Pompeo the 'poisonous plant of American diplomacy.' \u201d\n\nFor the moment, Pompeo may appear secure at State, and there\u2019s talk he might take over Bolton\u2019s dossier as well, but Pyongyang thinks Pompeo should go, too, and has said so in no uncertain terms. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has already dubbed him the \u201cpoisonous plant of American diplomacy.\u201d\n\nVice Foreign Minister Choe\u2019s statement on new negotiations, as distributed by KCNA in English, made it clear the North, a.k.a. the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, is not budging on the nuclear program that the U.S. insists it has to abandon. As long as the U.S. sticks to the same old \u201cworn-out scenario,\u201d ran the official English version, \u201cthe DPRK-U.S. dealings may come to an end.\u201d\n\nLike a stern teacher addressing a recalcitrant student, Choe said she believed the U.S. had better come up with something more to North Korea\u2019s liking\u2014all geared to \u201cthe calculation method acceptable to us.\u201d\n\nIn Pyongyang\u2019s view, the U.S. has to agree to a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach under which North Korea refrains from testing its nukes and long-range intercontinental missiles while the U.S. removes sanctions.There is no hint that other \u201ccalculations,\u201d including on-site inspections, would be negotiable.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea is not taking positive steps and not making positive noises,\u201d says Leif-Eric Easley, international studies professor at Seoul\u2019s Ewha University.\n\n\u201c A U.N. panel of experts warns North Korea's short-range launches 'increase the effectiveness of the entire ballistic missile program.' \u201d\n\nThe biggest problem with the step-by-step approach is that North Korea has been building ever more nuclear warheads since its last, and biggest, nuclear test two years ago this month. The North conducted its last long-range missile test two months later but is known to be working on missiles with which to fire warheads at distant targets, including the U.S.\n\nA United Nations panel, in a report for the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 30, warned of the North\u2019s success developing short-range ballistic missiles powered by solid fuel that could be fired with virtually no warning. The report, citing \u201cclear progression\u201d to \u201csolid propellant,\u201d said the North\u2019s goal is to power intercontinental ballistic missiles with solid rather than liquid fuel, which takes hours to pump into the ICBMs and makes them vulnerable to discovery in time for countermeasures.\n\nImportantly, while President Trump insists the short-range launches do not breach his understanding with Kim, the U.N. panel of experts concludes that they are a \u201cnew class of short-range ballistic missile\u201d which \u201cincrease the effectiveness of the entire ballistic missile program\u201d including, in addition to the solid fuel development, \u201cmobility through the use of different types of transporter erector launcher and the capacity to penetrate ballistic missile defence systems.\u201d\n\nYet for all this, Trump continues to appear unperturbed by what\u2019s happening on the Korean Peninsula, and he gave a rather measured welcome to the prospect of working-level U.S.-North Korean talks, saying simply \u201chaving meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAs for Poisonous Plant Pompeo, he said Sunday on ABC that Trump would be \u201cvery disappointed if Chairman Kim doesn't return to the negotiating table or conducts missile tests that are inconsistent with the agreements that they made when the two of them were together these three times.\u201d\n\nAll of which leads Leif-Eric Easley to see one of two scenarios:\n\nThe first is the U.S. and North Korea \u201cmake an interim deal so North Korea can get economic benefits and Trump can claim a victory before the next election.\u201d Second, \u201cTrump will claim progress, hoping North Korea doesn\u2019t test an ICBM or nuke before the election\u201d while Kim waits it out, looking for a post-election deal regardless of who wins.\n\nEither way, one reality remains. North Korea is a nuclear weapons nation, like it or not, and intends to remain so regardless of either the pressure of sanctions or the bait of economic blessings as promised by Trump.", "description": "As new working level talks loom, Bolton was right to worry.
