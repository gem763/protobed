The original picture showed Trudeau with a painted brown face at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party held by the West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver in 2001. He was teaching at the private school.\n\nThe second picture was of Trudeau wearing blackface at a high school talent show where he performed the song, \"Day-O.\"\n\nAnd, in a third instance, a video showed Trudeau wearing blackface, waiving is arms and sticking his tongue out.\n\nTrudeau thought the scandal was behind him but it turns out Canadian voters haven't forgotten. Protestors wearing blackface showed up at an event in Ontario on Friday, TMZ reported. They even had signs saying, \"We're Aladdin Too! Orillia Blackface Club Welcomes Trudeau.\"\n\nJustin Trudeau's Met By Protesters in Blackface https://t.co/cR1gnHsOcD \u2014 TMZ (@TMZ) October 18, 2019\n\nTo make matters even worse for Trudeau, last week, two little girls asked him why he painted his face black.\n\n\"Um, it was something I shouldn't have done because it hurt people,\" he said. \"It's not something you should do and that is something that I learned. It's something I didn't know back then but I know it now. And I'm sorry I hurt people.\"\n\nAs must as Trudeau wants to sweep this under the rug and pretend it didn't happen, it's not going to go away. He didn't just have one photo of him in blackface surface. He had two photos and a video. If he thinks voters are going to look past his past judgement, he's mistaken. And this is going to continue to bite him in the butt.", "description": "Uh oh..10/20/2019 19:17:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/222/bed91087-7019-4315-a2c5-79d76448dbcd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
