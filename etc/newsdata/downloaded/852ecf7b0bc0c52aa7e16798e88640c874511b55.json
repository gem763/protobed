As Ken (William Roche) makes an announcement about his upcoming birthday plans, there\u2019s a surprise in store for him as Norris (Malcolm Hebden) and Emily (Eileen Derbyshire) make a surprise return!\n\nNorris was last seen on the cobbles earlier in the year but was only on the street for a brief amount of time, and soon left with Emily\u2019s niece Freda (Ali Briggs) after announcing he was divorcing Mary (Patti Clare) so he could marry Freda. Emily was last seen on the street in 2016 and left to go to Peru to see her nephew.\n\nKen tells Daniel and Sinead that he\u2019s changed his mind and won\u2019t be going to Italy for his birthday after all as he can\u2019t leave them at such a difficult time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaudia\u2019s (Rula Lenska) understanding as to why Ken can\u2019t come away so Audrey (Sue Nicholls) suggests celebrating Ken\u2019s birthday at home rather than Italy. When Claudia mentions her plans for a party although Ken feels this may be inappropriate given Sinead\u2019s situation, Daniel disagrees.\n\nAfter Daniel and Sinead meet with the oncologist who says her cancer isn\u2019t responding to treatment and she only has a few weeks to live, in a state of shock Sinead\u2019s insistent they must attend Ken\u2019s 80th birthday party. Unaware of the news, at the party Ken\u2019s thrilled to see Norris there and touched when Emily skypes him from Edinburgh!\n\nThe happiness of Ken\u2019s birthday celebrations will soon come to an end when Sinead has to break the news to family and friends that she only has weeks to live, it\u2019s certainly set to be another emotional episode.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A big Corrie treat!", "authors": ["Calli Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/09_10_coro_ken_norris_1st_ep_06-f1eb_1570221039.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
