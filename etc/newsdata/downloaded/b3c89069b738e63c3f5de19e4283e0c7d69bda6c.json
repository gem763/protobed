April 2 was the Hornets' last home league success, a 4-1 win over Fulham.\n\nWatford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure blazed a good chance over the bar just two minutes in\n\nFans endured a damp squib as Watford chased their first Premier League victory of the season\n\nWill Hughes came on inside the first 10 minutes when he replaced the injured Tom Cleverley\n\nMATCH FACTS AND LEAGUE TABLE WATFORD (3-5-2): Foster 8; Cathcart 6, Dawson 6, Kabasele 6; Janmaat 5.5, Doucoure 6.5, Cleverley 5 (Hughes 10, 6.5), Chalobah 6 (Gray 57, 5), Masina 5 (Foulquier 73, 6); Deulofeu 6.5, Pereyra 5.5 Subs not used: Gomes; Prodl, Mariappa, Quina Booked: Dawson, Deulofeu, Doucoure, Hughes, Pereyra Manager: Quique Sanchez Flores 5 BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Ramsdale 7; Smith 6.5, S Cook 7, Ake 6.5, Rico 7; Fraser 6.5, Lerma 6.5, Billing 6, Danjuma 6 (H Wilson 61, 6); King 6, C Wilson 6 (Solanke 74, 6) Subs not used: Boruc; Francis, Mepham, Kelly, L Cook Booked: C Wilson, Rico, Billing Manager: Eddie Howe 6 Referee: Mike Dean 6 VAR: Andre Marriner Man of the Match: Ben Foster Season at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing Huddersfield and Fulham had in common last season is that they went down and now the dark clouds of relegation hang heavy over Watford.\n\nTheir winless state is almost unique in English football. You have to delve down to Corinthian Casuals of the Isthmian League Premier Division - the seventh level of the pyramid - to find another team without a league victory this season.\n\nIt's that grim and the omens are equally as bleak. They have now gone 10 matches at the start of this Premier League season without anything in the win column.\n\nThe last time this happened, at the beginning of the 2006-07 season, they ended up 20th and last, some 10 points adrift of safety.\n\nOne small glimmer of light is that they won game 11, so Chelsea beware next weekend.\n\nHere the Hornets were left grateful to 36-year-old keeper Ben Foster, who made crucial saves to deny Philip Billing, Diego Rico, Arnaut Danjuma and Ryan Fraser to leave Bournemouth frustrated.\n\nBut they have still only scored five times in this season's Premier League and that, really, tells you everything you need to know.\n\nThe draw means the Hornets will go at least seven months without a Premier League home win\n\nWatford keeper Ben Foster denied Bournemouth winger Arnaut Groeneveld from close range\n\nThe former England stopper had to be alert to keep Brad Smith from scoring for the Cherries\n\nStill, manager Quique Sanchez Flores remains phlegmatic about their chances of survival.\n\n'I am confident and realistic too. I know they deserve to win in games before, but football is very capricious sometimes so you need to wait.\n\n'But at the moment we are creating something that I hope is solid for the future.\n\n'We had very clear attempts today so we don't need to be worried about that. The moment we stop creating opportunities, then we should be worried.'\n\nIn that regard, the hamstring injury Danny Welbeck suffered in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Tottenham couldn't have come at a worse time, especially with talisman Troy Deeney still sidelined.\n\nSanchez Flores decided to leave recognised striker Andre Gray on the bench here and played Roberto Pereyra alongside Gerard Deulofeu up top.\n\nAnd, unlike their last home match against Sheffield United, when Watford played a very conservative 5-3-2 and strangled their creativity, they raced out of the blocks.\n\nBournemouth keeper Aaron Ramsdale denied Gerard Deulofeu with a fine second-half save\n\nThe visitors climbed to eighth in the table after failing to hit the net away for a third straight trip\n\nBournemouth's travelling fans saw Steve Cook hit the woodwork during an action-packed start\n\nRamsdale saved Hughes's strike from distance in a second half littered with wayward shooting\n\nInside the first minute, Gerard Deulofeu's angled drive skidded off the soggy surface and Bournemouth keeper Aaron Ramsdale parried it out.\n\nThe ball couldn't have fallen more perfectly to Abdoulaye Doucoure, only 12 yards out, but he got it all wrong and skied his effort into the stand.\n\nWatford continued to pour forward and Deulofeu saw a wicked inswinging corner bounce back off the post.\n\nBut they quickly ran out of steam and were thankful to Foster for keeping them level at half-time. The former England stopper turned Billing's 20-yard effort around the post before making an even sharper save to deny Rico's half-volley.\n\nHome boss Quique Sanchez Flores watched his side struggle to break the deadlock in the rain\n\nEddie Howe survived a soaking and has now seen his men lose just once in eight league games\n\nThose two saves required cat-like reflexes but his third, on the stroke of half-time, was all down to bravery, getting down to block at the feet of Danjuma after Joshua King's cross from the right.\n\nAnd Foster's final decisive act came in second-half stoppage time, punching out Fraser's angled shot as Watford were left clinging on having controlled long spells.\n\nSteve Cook also came inches away from snatching the points for Bournemouth when a first-half header from Fraser's corner cannoned back off the bar.\n\nWatford threatened less often, but Bournemouth keeper Aaron Ramsdale saved well from Deulofeu and Will Hughes after the break.\n\n'Given our expectations we're disappointed we haven't won,' said Cherries boss Eddie Howe. 'But it's another clean sheet in a difficult game away from home.\n\n'Ultimately we weren't ever in total control of the game, it was end-to-end at times. We looked dangerous in moments and created a lot more this week.'", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD AT VICARAGE ROAD: The wait goes on for Watford and it's becoming more uncomfortable with each passing week.
