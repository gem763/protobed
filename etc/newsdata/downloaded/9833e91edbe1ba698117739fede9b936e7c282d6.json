OOPS!!\"\n\n\"Ouch,\" one person commented.\n\nWhile another joked: \"Did he finish or what?\"\n\nGaga, who is performing her Enigma show in Vegas, hasn't commented on the fall, but it seems she handled it like a pro and it's business as usual.\n\nThe star, 33, did show off her brutal post-show ritual though.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nIn a series of three pictures, she's seen sitting in an ice bath, taking a dip in a hot bath then lying down for a nap in a suit packed with more ice.\n\nShe said: \"Post show routine: ice bath for 5-10 min, hot bath for 20, then compression suit packed with ice packs for 20.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
