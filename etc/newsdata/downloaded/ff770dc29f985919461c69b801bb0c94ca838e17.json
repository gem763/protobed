For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nIf you\u2019ve been on the hunt for a deal on the Bose QC35 Series II wireless noise-canceling headphones, Drop (formerly Massdrop) is selling them for $289 for a limited time. These usually sell for $349, and are worth considering if Bose\u2019s new (and excellent) $399 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are a little too expensive.\n\nWhile these have been bested in the sound quality department by the Sony 1000X M3, the QC35 II headphones still hold their own when it comes to effectively canceling out noise, and unlike Sony\u2019s headphones, these can seamlessly switch between two paired devices.\n\nOne thing to note about this model is that there have been reports of degraded noise cancellation effects following a recent software update. Some claim to have noticed a difference after updating, while others have not, so you may want to hold off on allowing a firmware update through Bose\u2019s mobile app until the dust settles.\n\nSpeaking of the Sony 1000X M3, those are $280 on Drop right now. This is about as cheap as they currently come if you\u2019re looking for them new. If you demand excellent sound quality, these are worth considering over the Bose mentioned above, however the 1000X M3 headphones aren\u2019t without flaws. These don\u2019t switch between devices paired over Bluetooth like the QC35 IIs, and many other modern Bluetooth headphones, and the touch controls can be very fiddly \u2014 especially in cold weather, as a few of us at The Verge have realized. However, Sony may have issued a fix in units that were recently manufactured, per Reddit.\n\nDrop is offering an exclusive discount to Verge readers on wired headphones it made in collaboration with Sennheiser. They\u2019re called the HD 6XX headphones, and you can get them now for $199 instead of their original $220 price. The discount will apply automatically at checkout.\n\nThe HD 6XX headphones are a rebranding of Sennheiser\u2019s HD 650 headphones, though they\u2019re cheaper and just as good. They\u2019re open-back headphones, the big benefit of that type of build being a more natural, expansive sound. You can wear these in public, though you may not want to, since open-back also means two-way sound leakage. You\u2019ll get the outside sounds in your ears, and your office mates will be able to hear your music if it\u2019s turned up loud enough. Like most studio-friendly headphones, the HD 6XXs lack any inline controls for adjusting volume or switching songs.\n\nThe Bose SoundWear Companion is $149 at B&H Photo, which is half off of its usual $299 price. If this is your first time hearing about the SoundWear Companion, it\u2019s a neckband filled with speakers that fire sound up toward your ears. In our review, Chris Welch said it\u2019s \u201ca fun, quirky gadget that sounds downright terrific for what it is,\u201d but the use cases are somewhat limited. They\u2019re not great for wearing in public, but they may be a good fit for driving or using with a mobile VR headset\n\nAmazon is hosting a post-Prime Day 2019 deal for Twitch Prime members (requires Amazon Prime). For $15, you can pick from Fallout 76, The Last of Us, or The Sims 4, then you\u2019ll receive a $15 credit to your Amazon account that you can use on a separate purchase.\n\nThe steps to redeem the deal are a little more complicated than just adding a game to your cart. If you haven\u2019t already done this step, you\u2019ll first have to link your Amazon Prime account to Twitch. To do that, click this link. Once you do that, go to Twitch\u2019s homepage, then select the crown icon in the upper right corner of your display to access your account\u2019s loot notifications. Lastly, click on the Post Prime Day free game offer to redeem the deal.", "description": "Today is a great day to invest in some new headphones, like Bose\u2019s QC35 II, Sennheiser\u2019s HD 6XX, or Sony\u2019s 1000X M3. There are other deals, too, like a promo that can get Twitch Prime members a $15 Amazon credit.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z902Xu3Ai1b9N1VrUT-Y0guyKeg=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6689699/bose1_2040.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-23"}
