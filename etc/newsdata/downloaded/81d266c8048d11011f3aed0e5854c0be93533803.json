How do we say no to other candidates in the race who may request debates focused on an issue they've made central to their own campaigns?\" Perez wrote.\n\nYesterday, Jay Inslee told CBS News, \"There are 14 other candidates who have said they want a debate on this. Is the party going to blacklist that 14?\" He added, \"We're going to hope the party will change its mind. Otherwise, we will pursue other options we can make after talking to other candidates.\"\n\nTwo of those candidates, former Vice President Joe BIden and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, signed on to the idea of holding a climate-specific debate in the past week.\n\n\"I'm glad he is calling for it,\" O'Rourke said in an interview with CBS News last week, \"I think it makes a lot of sense. I'd love to find a way that the DNC can incorporate this idea into their debate process.\"\n\nClimate change activists are continuing to put public pressure on candidates as Greenpeace this week hoisted a large \"2020 Climate Scorecard\" outside the window of a Biden campaign event. Inslee had the best grade, followed by Sen. Cory Booker and then Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nFor now, however, Inslee said he is focusing on the first Democratic presidential debate later this month in June. The governor said his debate prep is \"going well\" but added that it's \"challenging\" condensing his more than 200-page book into a 60-second pitch.\n\nNicole Sganga contributed to this story.", "description": "Some Democratic National Committee members are hoping to put more pressure on the national chairman to hold climate change debate", "authors": ["Eleanor Watson", "Jack Turman", "Bo Erickson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/13/9ec6adef-4e2e-4089-976b-c5fc721fea3b/thumbnail/1200x630/fb20d0366ed6f7699388eb135e3fe61f/gettyimages-1154846987.jpg"}
