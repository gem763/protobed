Read on for our revised verdict!\n\nJesus Christ. Has it really been seven years since I reviewed the original Zinger Pie? I've clearly been doing this shit for way too long. But you probably don't want to hear about my existential crisis, so let's get stuck into the taste test.\n\nTakeaway Truth: KFC Zinger Pie Takeaway Truth is an occasional Lifehacker feature where we compare marketing images against what you actually get served. Today: KFC's Zinger Pie. Read more\n\nThe KFC Zinger Pie does exactly what it says on the (pie) tin: it's a chicken pie marinated in KFC's signature Zinger spices and filled with gravy.\n\nAs we noted during the initial launch, a KFC pie is such an ingenuous concept we can't believe it's not a permanent fixture on the menu. Alongside chocolate with peanut butter and Fillet O Fish with Peri Peri sauce (try it!), it's one of the best food combos out there. Add some KFC hot chips and you basically have a shepherd's poultry pie with secret herbs and spices.\n\nKFC has taken an \"if it ain't broke\" approach to the Zinger Pie - it tastes pretty much exactly as we remember. The pastry is crisp and flaky with a deliciously soft underside. Despite this, it remains sturdy enough to avoid becoming messy. You could potentially eat this thing one-handed while driving. (But maybe don't.)\n\nThe pie does a good job of showcasing KFC's signature Zinger chicken - the meat is reasonably chunky and has a good heat kick. The abundance of gravy-based sauce actually leaves a spicier aftertaste than a Zinger burger. This is great for fans of spicy food, but patrons with delicate palates may need to pair this with an icy soft drink.\n\nThe KFC Zinger Pie contains 21.9g of fat, 50.8g of carbohydrates, 1176mg of sodium and 25.4g of protein. Interestingly, the new version has a slightly higher kilojoule count than its 2013 ancestor: 2103KJ vs 2068kj.\n\nIn other words, KFC just flipped the bird at everyone trying to make fast food healthier. For this, we salute them.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not the only thing that has changed. The price has arguably leapfrogged inflation - jumping from $3.95 in 2013 to a far less palatable $5.95 in 2019. That's pretty steep for a modestly sized fast-food pie.\n\nOn the plus side, you can score a combo with a small fries for $5 until 4pm. This means you're getting more food for less money. Go figure.\n\nBecause of the price change, we're docking the KFC Zinger Pie one point compared to what its predecessor got. That still leaves it with a bloody commendable 8/10. Would eat again. (Incidentally, if I review the KFC Zinger Pie in 2026\u202c, you have permission to kill me.)\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nThe KFC Zinger Pie is available nationally now.", "description": "Longtime Lifehacker readers may remember our original KFC Zinger Pie review from 2013.
