He needs 45 per cent support, or 40 per cent support with a 10 percentage point lead, over the nearest rival to avoid a runoff vote on Nov. 24.\n\nThe result would mark turn leftward in South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years.\n\nFernandez leaves a polling station after casting his vote in Buenos Aires on Sunday. (Agustin Marcarian/Reuters)\n\nThe largely peaceful election was dominated by concerns over rising poverty, soaring inflation and a sharp depreciation of the local currency.\n\nMacri, an ally of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the world stage, was elected president in 2015 as Argentines rejected a successor chosen by former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who is running as vice-president on the Peronist ticket with Fernandez. The two are not related.\n\nThe country is bitterly divided over the likely return to power of Fernandez de Kirchner, who is currently facing trial for directing a far-reaching scheme to collect bribes from businesses in exchange for government contracts. She has denied any wrongdoing and remains a powerful if divisive figure in Argentina.\n\nFernandez de Kirchner was considered part of the \"pink tide\" of leftist governments that arose in the region in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nFormer President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who is running as vice-president with centre-left Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez, arrives to vote in Rio Gallegos, Argentina, on Sunday.

Chile continues to operate under an emergency that led most of the country's supermarkets to close to defend themselves from a wave of looting.\n\nIn both Ecuador and Chile, protests that began in opposition to price hikes on fuel and public transit quickly escalated into widespread disturbances.\n\nTrudeau is expected to visit Santiago, Chile, epicentre of the disturbances, in his first foreign trip since winning re-election, in order to attend the APEC Summit from Nov. 16-17.", "description": "Incumbent Argentinian President Mauricio Macri\u00a0conceded\u00a0defeat in the country's presidential election to Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5337624.1572227931!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1183856517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
