Snapchat blew past earnings expectations for a big beat in Q3, as it added 7 million daily active users this quarter to hit 210 million, up 13% year-over-year. Snap also beat on revenue, notching $446 million, which is up a whopping 50% year-over-year, at a loss of $0.04 EPS. That flew past Bloomberg\u2019s consensus of Wall Street estimates that expected $437.9 million in revenue and a $0.05 EPS loss.\n\nSnap has managed to continue cutting losses as it edges towards profitability. Net loss improved to $227 million from $255 million last quarter, with the loss decreasing $98 million versus Q3 2018.\n\nCEO Evan Spiegel made his case in his prepared remarks for why Snapchat\u2019s share price should be higher: \u201cWe are a high growth business, with strong operating leverage, a clear path to profitability, a distinct vision for the future, and the ability to invest over the long term.\u201d Snapchat\u2019s share price had closed down 4% at $14, and had fallen roughly 5% in after-hours trading as of 1:30pm pacific despite the earnings beat.\n\nThat\u2019s partially because of the high cost of Snapchat\u2019s growth relative average revenue per user. While it notes that it saw user growth in all regions, 5 million of the 7 million new users came from the Rest Of The World, with just 1 million coming from the North America and Europe regions. That\u2019s in part thanks to better than expected growth and retention on its reengineered Android app that\u2019s been a hit in India. But since Snapchat serves so much high-definition video content but it earns just $1.01 average revenue in the Rest Of World, it has to hope it can keep growing ARPU so it becomes profitable globally.\n\nSome other top-line stats from Snapchat\u2019s earnings:\n\nOperating cash flow improved by $56 million to a loss of $76 million in Q3 2019, compared to the prior year.\n\nFree Cash Flow improved by $75 million to $(84) million in Q3 2019, compared to the prior year.\n\nInterestingly, Spiegel noted that \u201cWe benefited from year-over-year growth in user activity in Q3 including growth in Snapchatters posting and viewing Stories.\u201d Snapchat hadn\u2019t indicated Stories was growing in at last the past two years, as it was attacked by clones including Instagram Stories that led Snapchat to start shrinking in user count a year ago before it recovered.\n\nSince Stories viewership is critical to total ad view on Snapchat, we may see analysts insisting to hear more about that metric in the future.\n\nThe other major piece of Snapchat\u2019s ad properties is Discover where total time spent watching grew 40% year-over-year. And rather than being driving by just a few hits, over 100 Discover channels saw over 10 million viewers per month in Q3. With Instagram\u2019s IGTV a flop, Discover remains Snapchat\u2019s best differentiated revenue driver, and one it needs to keep investing in and promoting. With Instagram trying to compete more heavily on chat with its new close friends-only Threads app, Snapchat can\u2019t rely on ephemeral messaging to keep it special.\n\nLooking forward, in Q4 Snap is estimating 214 to 215 million daily active users and $540 million to $560 million in revenue\n\n214 to 215 million in Q4, which implies a sequential increase in DAU of 4 to 5 million. In terms of our financial guidance, we are guiding to a range of between $540 million and $560 million for revenue in Q4. For Adjusted EBITDA in Q4, we are guiding to a range of between breakeven and positive $20 million, which would mark our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA.", "description": "The Snap-back continues.
