It's on a knife edge. It's touch and go. All of the above. The Government is attempting to win support of 19 Labour MPs to get its Brexit deal approved in Parliament tomorrow but it has emerged two ministers are on \"resignation watch\" over Boris Johnson's EU agreement. It could be a potentially fatal blow to getting MPs to back the draft exit. One of the ministers who might resign was described as a \"senior Cabinet minister\" by a Eurosceptic source, Chief Political Correspondent Christopher Hope understands. So how does this affect the chances of getting the deal approved in the crucial vote? Here is a reminder of the numbers needed. And Daniel Capurro outlines the four key groups Mr Johnson needs to woo to get his Brexit deal the go-ahead.\n\nMPs might want to note this snap polling by YouGov when making their decision on the deal. It suggests two in five people want Parliament to vote to accept Mr Johnson's agreement - while 24pc said they don't and 35pc said they don't know. This is what Telegraph readers have said about the deal. Harry Yorke outlines the six possible outcomes of tomorrow's ballot. Many people still seem amazed we have reached this point at all - including the world's media. Here's how newspapers across the globe reacted to Mr Johnson's deal.", "description": "If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here and try our Audio Briefings on WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Chris Price", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213323003-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
