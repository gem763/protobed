ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019\n\nIt goes on to add: \u2018I understand that viewers are important, numbers mean business and high engagement suggests success, but are there really no other ways to achieve it?\u2019\n\nIt was then announced, via Piers Morgan\u2019s own social media, that they would be \u2018debating whether I [Piers] should be fired\u2019 live on GMB and the TV show put a poll up on Twitter asking if he should \u2018stay or go\u2019. The poll has been voted on 37,722 times so far \u2013 with 66 per cent of respondents saying Piers should stay.\n\nPeople are calling for Piers to step down \u2013 but he won\u2019t leave without putting up a fight first (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nSo, what\u2019s the latest on the debate and will Piers Morgan be leaving Good Morning Britain?\n\nIs Piers Morgan leaving Good Morning Britain?\n\nSo far over 13,000 people have backed the campaign calling for Piers to be sacked from his role on GMB presenting alongside Susanna Reid.\n\nHowever, the polarising presenter took to Twitter yesterday to reveal that a rival petition had been set up, calling for Piers\u2019 job to be saved because of: \u2018his common sense approach to life.\u2019\n\n\u2018There is now a rival petition to save me on @GMB,\u2019 Piers wrote. \u2018Thank you Margaret Lowry! Please sign it if you wish to repel the snivelling snowflakes & keep me in my job,\u2019 the provocative pundit tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPiers later joyfully revealed the results of the rival campaign: \u2018The petition to #SavePiers has reached 10,000 signatures & just overtaken the petition to have me fired. Took just 3hrs. See you on @GMB tomorrow & thank you, my p-p-p-p-people!\u2019\n\nThe rival petition currently has nearly 28,000 signatures this morning and continues to surpass the original petition calling for him to be sacked.\n\nPiers has disclosed that his Good Morning Britain contract runs out on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s been no indication at this stage that ITV will actually take action against the media star by not renewing his contract.\n\nPlus, based on Piers\u2019 tweets urging his fans and followers to sign the petition supporting him and in favour of him keeping his job hosting GMB, it appears that he isn\u2019t keen on leaving the show anytime soon either.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV1 from 6am to 8.30am.\n\nMORE: Piers Morgan will debate whether he should be fired from Good Morning Britain as petition calls for his removal\n\nMORE: Piers Morgan mocks Greta Thunberg as she loses out on Nobel Peace Prize", "description": "A staple on Good Morning Britain three days a week, could Piers Morgan now be leaving the show after a petition called for him to be fired?", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_87776921-e1569928250389_1571043812.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
