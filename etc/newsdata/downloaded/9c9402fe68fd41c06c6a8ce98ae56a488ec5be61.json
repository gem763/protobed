I think it is the same for my own personal position, I can't see so.\n\n'What we'd do is as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader.\n\n'I'm still of the view now that whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman. We've got to have a woman leader.\n\n'If you look at the new youngsters that have come through, they are fantastic.'\n\nFailure to win an election is often terminal for the leaders of the UK's main political parties.\n\nMr Corbyn did not face widespread calls to quit in the wake of the 2017 general election after Labour secured a much-higher-than-expected 40 per cent of the overall vote, just shy of Theresa May's 42.4 per cent of the vote.\n\nMr Corbyn has twice blocked attempts by Boris Johnson to trigger an early election but has said that once a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out he will allow the PM to go to the country.\n\nMr McDonnell told Mr Campbell he believed Labour can win a majority as he rejected the suggestion that the party could be forced to work with the Lib Dems or SNP in order to form a government.\n\nHe said: 'Well, I think we can win a majority, but if we go into a minority government situation, there will be no deals, we'll just lay out our programme and they either support it or they don't.\n\n'If they don't support it we'll go back to the country and it will be interesting, if they did, to see how they argue against a real living wage, investment in public services, restoration of trade union rights, tackling climate change. How can they argue against that?'\n\nMr McDonnell also said that his preference remained to hold a general election before a second Brexit referendum.\n\nHowever, he suggested he would be perfectly happy with a referendum being held first.\n\nHe said: 'If it was a general election first or a referendum first, it doesn't matter.'", "description": "John McDonnell today said he and Jeremy Corbyn will quit as shadow chancellor and Labour leader if the party loses the next general election.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19590922-0-image-a-33_1570801949399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
