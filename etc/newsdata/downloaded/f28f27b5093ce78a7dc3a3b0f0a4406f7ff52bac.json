A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe surge in prices is the natural knee jerk reaction but the path ahead and ability to sustain at elevated levels remains dependent on the duration of the outage, the ability to meet export commitments through domestic drawdowns, demand elasticity at higher prices as well as government and agency policy,\u201d said Michael Tran, managing director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.\n\nThe attack on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility, came from the direction of Iran, and cruise missiles may have been used, according to a senior U.S. official.\n\nTrump also said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nRISK PREMIUM\n\nIn the wake of the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s key oil facilities, S&P Global Platts said concerns about supply security in the Middle East have increased and the risk premium in the global crude market is expected to rise.\n\nANZ Research also said in a note that the market would price in \u201ca sizable global geopolitical risk premium\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny expectation that the market had about the U.S. easing sanctions on Iran following President Trump\u2019s dismissal of John Bolton will quickly dissipate. This should see Brent crude test the $70 per barrel mark in the short term,\u201d ANZ Research said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined products after attacks on Saturday, consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note.\n\nSaudi Aramco will likely buy significant quantities of gasoline, diesel and possibly fuel oil while cutting liquefied petroleum gas exports.\n\nU.S. gasoline futures jumped 11%, while U.S. heating oil futures rose about 6.5% at the open.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Aramco has told one Indian refinery there will be no immediate impact on oil supplies as it will deliver crude from other sources and has adequate inventory, a source with the refinery said.\n\nOther Asian buyers such as Thailand have also said the attack would have no immediate impact on oil imports.", "description": "Oil prices retreated on Monday after hitting their highest since May at the open, on fears over supply disruptions following an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities on Saturday that cut more than 5% of global oil supply.", "authors": ["Jane Chung", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430287107&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0RV", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
