We\u2019re asking for justice, honesty, ethical government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we want socialism or communism: We want fewer private enterprises, more state,\u201d he said, adding that Pinera\u2019s proposals \u201care going to ruin the budget to subsidize private enterprises.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Drop in violence \u2013\n\nIn an initial burst of violence, metro stations were destroyed, supermarkets torched and looted, traffic lights and bus shelters smashed, and countless street barricades erected and set alight.\n\nAuthorities deployed some 20,000 police and soldiers in Santiago, using tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators.\n\nSecurity forces have been blamed for five of the 19 protest-related deaths. Social media have lit up with accusations of torture and abuse.\n\nThe United Nations said on Thursday it was sending a team to investigate the allegations.\n\nSerious incidents and arrests have decreased in recent days compared with the beginning of the protests.\n\nBut the violence has still been the worst since Chile returned to democracy after Pinochet\u2019s right-wing dictatorship.\n\nAnd the protests show no sign of abating.\n\nAs demonstrators passed by the presidential palace in central Santiago, they hurled insults at Pinera and the military.\n\nWhile the mass street movement appeared organized, it still lacks recognizable leaders and was mostly roused through social media.\n\nRegular media has also found itself a target of protesters\u2019 ire with via leaflets calling for people not to turn on their televisions.\n\nEarlier on Friday, cars and trucks took part in a protest against highway tolls, moving at snail\u2019s pace as they clogged highways and formed long caravans on roads leading out of the capital city.\n\nLuis Leiton, a participating taxi driver, said the toll system was expensive and abusive.\n\n\u201cIf this is not resolved with concrete measures, this nation that has risen up is going to keep protesting,\u201d Leiton told AFP.\n\n\u2013 APEC summit still on \u2013\n\nThe latest demonstrations came after a two-day strike on Wednesday and Thursday arranged by Chile\u2019s largest and most powerful trade union, although in Santiago business continued as usual for the most part.\n\nThe national human rights institute \u2014 INDH \u2014 said 584 people have been injured, 245 by firearms, and 2,410 detained during the protests.\n\nSoldiers have been guarding Santiago\u2019s metro stations as three of the seven lines \u2014 which usually carry three million people per day \u2014 have reopened.\n\nThe government said on Thursday that next month\u2019s APEC trade summit in Santiago would go ahead despite the protests.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are among those expected to attend the November 16-17 meeting to discuss ending their trade war.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Almost a million people took to the streets of Santiago for\u00a0what was believed to be Chile\u2019s\u00a0largest-ever march\u00a0on Friday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/da8401_people-protest-in-santiago-on-25-week-violence-protests-started-close-million-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
