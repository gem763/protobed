(\u201cOld Town Road\u201d has spent nearly four months at number one.)\n\nTwitter also posted a video on its music account, Twitter Music, starring the young rapper and meme impresario, in which he grabs Jack Dorsey\u2019s badge and becomes CEO for the day. His first act? Firing @Jack. His second? Demanding an edit button, and then firing a roomful of engineers when they didn\u2019t begin typing fast enough.\n\nThe two-minute clip was fun, and funny; honestly, seeing someone ask Twitter for something its users have been demanding for years, and the company has stubbornly refused to deliver, was cathartic. I enjoyed it! Until I remembered that Twitter doesn\u2019t listen to its users, really, when it comes to anything more serious than an edit button.\n\nThe fact that harassers, abusers, and other bad actors seem to flourish on the platform without consequence is demoralizing, to say the least, and not only because users have been clamoring for some kind of decisive action for years. (Also, if they can\u2019t give Lil Nas X an edit button what hope have we for change?)\n\nLongest running #1 hits in Billboard Hot 100 history (weeks):\n\nOld Town Road 17\n\nOne Sweet Day 16\n\nDespacito\n\nI Will Always Love You 14\n\nI'll Make Love to You\n\nMacarena\n\nCandle in the Wind 1997\n\nWe Belong Together\n\nI Gotta Feeling\n\nUptown Funk\n\nEnd of the Road 13\n\nThe Boy Is Mine \u2014 chart data (@chartdata) July 29, 2019\n\nWhen Lil Nas X sat down with Dorsey, the CEO told him \u201cyou\u2019re walking into a super stressful job.\u201d That is true: it\u2019s hard to please everyone. Dorsey is uniquely aware of that, because it must be loud standing at the other end of the megaphone he founded, testifying before Congress and combatting prominent conservatives alleging censorship and persistent bias. Though, of course, I\u2019m sure Lil Nas X would be up for it; he understands the internet better than almost anyone (as is very clear from his Twitter account, which is brilliant).\n\nAt the end of the video, Lil Nas X was pressing paninis for the staff he\u2019d just fired. Everybody got a cowboy hat, and they all popped streamers. It was joyful, a break from the unrelenting tragedies the internet makes easily visible. Just yesterday there was a mass shooting at a garlic festival in California, and another at a party in Brooklyn. Twitter, naturally, was the best place to keep up with the news.", "description": "The two-minute clip was fun, and funny; honestly, seeing someone ask Twitter for something that users have been demanding for years, and the company stubbornly refusing to deliver, was cathartic.
