McLaurin was limited in practice Thursday.\n\nBrandon Scherff was also listed as questionable. The Pro Bowl guard did not practice this week after suffering an ankle injury in Monday\u2019s loss to the Chicago Bears.\n\nIn both cases, the Redskins will have to see how McLaurin and Scherff respond in pregame warmups to determine their availability.\n\n\u201cTerry and Brandon will probably come down to an hour before the game, see how they\u2019re doing,\u201d said coach Jay Gruden. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a good workout in before the game and see where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nIf McLaurin can\u2019t go, Gruden said Robert Davis or Kelvin Harmon could start opposite of Paul Richardson. He also mentioned moving slot receiver Trey Quinn to the outside and having Steven Sims start inside.\n\nThe Redskins will be without tight end Jordan Reed (concussion) and center Chase Roullier (knee), the latter of whom is a notable absence on the team\u2019s offensive line.\n\nWith Roullier out, veteran Tony Bergstrom will likely get the start at center. If Scherff can\u2019t go, then either rookie Wes Martin or Ross Pierschbacher would play right guard.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple different options there if Scherff can\u2019t go,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping Scherff can \u2014 nobody is going to try and get himself ready quicker and better than Brandon Scherff will, so I\u2019m still holding out hope for Brandon.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
