Photo: Courtesy the retailer\n\nI discovered Lao Gan Ma by accident. I was in Chinatown\u2019s Hong Kong Supermarket looking for the chilli oil they use at Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, a reddish-orange blend packed with dried chillies and spices. But I was at a loss. All of the jars and bottles looked similar, and because I tend to trust the opinion of the masses in large, busy supermarkets, I grabbed a jar of the stuff that was most popular, one with a sticker of a not-quite-smiling Asian matriarch (gan ma means \u2018godmother\u2019 in Chinese). There were only three remaining on the shelf.\n\nIt turned out not to be the chilli oil used at Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles \u2014 it was better. I actually don\u2019t know if it should be called a chilli sauce at all. It\u2019s thick and crunchy, a texture it owes to an abundance of dried chillies that are fried and crushed. It\u2019s more like a chilli topping. There\u2019s also the addition of fermented soybeans (which add a nice bit of funk), some Sichuan peppercorn for a mild tingling sensation, and \u2014 this is important \u2014 some MSG for even more umami. It\u2019s spicy, to be sure, but not Elmhurst-Thai spicy: It\u2019s balanced the way Sriracha is, only with more crunch and oomph.\n\nNow, I\u2019m addicted to the stuff. I probably go through a jar a week and need at least five stashed in my pantry or I will panic a bit. I\u2019ve made whole meals out of spicy chilli crisp on rice or spicy chilli crisp on scrambled eggs. I order sad take-away lo mein that is only edible if I perk it up with my happy crispy sauce. I\u2019m not alone in my adoration for spicy chilli crisp. Danny Bowien of Mission Chinese Food offers a cheffy dupe for it in his cookbook. Lucky Peach\u2019s 101 Easy Asian Recipes calls it a pantry staple.\n\nWhile you could always look for it in an Asian supermarket, it\u2019s not something most are guaranteed to carry (or carry enough of, something I\u2019ve learned the hard way many times). Do yourself a favor and buy it online.\n\nLao Gan Ma Chili Sauce \u00a34 at Amazon Buy\n\nMore Strat-approved spicy condiments\n\nHot Long Calabrian Peppers Grub Street writer Hugh Merwin says these Calabrian crushed peppers \u2018taste like sunshine, but have none of the lasting punitive effects of sunburn. Up front they tend to be sweet, with a bright and mild sting that gives way to a vegetal finish. If you\u2019re not quite ready to commit, smaller sample-size jars of whole Calabrian peppers, which look like toy chillies and are pizza-slice ready, are also available.\u2019 [Editor\u2019s Note: The brand recommended by Merwin is not available in the UK, so we recommend this similar variety.] \u00a36 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
