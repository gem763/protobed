But Packham\u2019s zookeeper girlfriend, Charlotte Corney, and stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, have since acquired miniature poodle puppies named Sid and Nancy.\n\nChris Packham has revealed he's been nursing a secret heartache. His miniature poodle Scratchy has sadly passed away. 'He was the light and epicentre of my universe,' Packham says\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve got big paws to fill,\u2019 says Packham. \u2018They are relatives of Itchy and Stratchy. I\u2019m bonding with them, but I don\u2019t know if they have helped me. It\u2019s too early to ask that question.\u2019\n\nIn his 2016 memoir, Fingers In The Sparkle Jar, Packham, 58, who has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, revealed that he has endured depression throughout his life and experienced suicidal thoughts after losing an earlier pet, a one-year-old dog called Fish.\n\nHe said it was only his beloved Itchy and Scratchy who saved him from taking his own life: \u2018They loved me, so I couldn\u2019t do it,\u2019 he wrote in the book. \u2018They kept me alive . . . I owe them my life. I always will.\u2019\n\nPackham frequently described Itchy and Scratchy as the loves of his life. \u2018We always had a very close bond, the three of us,\u2019 he said. \u2018We were like peas in a pod.\n\n\u2018It was a mutual love affair, very much so. We always shared our space and our food and our time.\u2019\n\nThe naturalist also revealed he wants his ashes to be mixed with those of his beloved pets.\n\nHe explained: \u2018Our ashes are going to get all mixed together and thrown out in the woods in a favourite spot in the New Forest so that we can be something together.\u2019\n\nLottie Moss gets it off her chest...\n\nWaifish Kate Moss once admitted she considered having a boob job because she hated being so \u2018flat- chested\u2019 \u2014 but decided against it, declaring: \u2018Can you imagine?\u2019\n\nLottie Moss, 21, confirms she has had surgical breast implants\n\nHowever, her model half-sister, Lottie, has taken a different direction and confirms that she has had surgical implants.\n\n\u2018I did my boobs and I\u2019m very happy with that,\u2019 says the 21-year-old Calvin Klein mannequin.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to spend money on yourself and you\u2019ve got to treat yourself, and this is one of those little treats that women like to do.\u2019\n\nLottie reveals she has also had lip fillers. \u2018I told my family about my boobs, but I didn\u2019t about my lips.\n\n\u2018With boobs, my mum [Inger] always knew that I felt uncomfortable and so it was very easy to say that I was going to get them done.\n\n'She was like: \u201cFor sure, I wish I\u2019d got mine done.\u201d\n\n\u2018My lips were actually something that I slightly regret.\n\n'I did it because I was following the crowd. I didn\u2019t need it.\u2019\n\nCelebrity photographer Rankin, who snapped the Queen at Buckingham Palace for her Golden Jubilee in 2002, says she remains his favourite subject to shoot.\n\n\u2018The Queen was good, she was very, very funny, takes the p*** out of you mercilessly and has a good sense of humour,\u2019 he tells me.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s brilliant to photograph, but I only got four minutes with her, so I don\u2019t know her that well.\u2019\n\nPlaying with Keeler? Not for me, says Suchet\n\nHercule Poirot actor David Suchet expresses regret that he turned down the role of politician John Profumo in the 1989 movie Scandal.\n\n\u2018It was the first major film role I was offered,\u2019 he says of the part played by Sir Ian McKellen. \u2018I had a conscience.\n\n\u2018I thought: \u201cJohn is still alive. I would be depicting him doing all these things with [19-year-old model] Christine Keeler. This isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nSo I turned it down. In the end, I said no, and they were very, very upset with me. They were very angry.\n\n\u2018A friend of mine later said: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get in touch with [John]? He might have said: \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018I did not get started for a long time \u2014 and I often wonder if it was because of that.\u2019\n\nPyschotherapist Annabel Giles, former wife of Ultravox singer Midge Ure, was unimpressed by a minute\u2019s silence for mental health on ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\n\n\u2018So, BGT thinks we\u2019re all watching in silence, rather than slagging off or praising the acts? Or even that we\u2019re not watching alone?\n\n\u2018Nice idea, good intention, but loneliness abounds and one minute of silence isn\u2019t going to do it. Some people have the TV on to drown the roar of loneliness.\u2019\n\nWill\u2019s costume is all at sea\n\nHello sailor! Pop star Will Young pushed the boat out at his weekend concert in Southend by dressing up as an ocean liner as he performed two songs, Who Am I and Joy.\n\nNeither song has obvious nautical references nor did he explain his choice of outfit.\n\nWill\u2019s wardrobe has previously been all at sea and he has talked about his passion for dresses and skirts.\n\nHe said: \u2018Men can occupy a dress and skirt and actually end up looking more masculine. I promise.\u2019\n\nWill Young pushed the boat out at his weekend concert in Southend by dressing up as an ocean liner as he performed two songs, Who Am I and Joy\n\nShe\u2019s Hollywood royalty, but Oscar-winning actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has an alien sense of humour \u2014 as far as husband Michael Douglas and their two children are concerned.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of British comedy where I\u2019m literally rolling on the floor and the family wonder what I\u2019m laughing at,\u2019 reflects Zeta-Jones, 50.\n\nBut she may have an ally in father-in-law, Kirk Douglas, now 102, who, she says, professes bewilderment that Michael picked up a Golden Globe for his role in Romancing The Stone. \u2018He says [to Michael]: \u201cYou\u2019re not funny. Make me laugh!\u201d\u2019\n\nSol will be missing his alfresco pizza\n\nPizzeria to Chelsea society, La Delizia \u2014 where Freddie Windsor wooed his wife Sophie Winkleman \u2014 is facing a crisis after being ordered by the local council to remove its outside tables.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a tiny restaurant,\u2019 owner Michele Damiano tells me.\n\n\u2018Inside, I\u2019ve got 15 tables and outside four. This will slash my income,\u2019 adds Damiano, who has had tables on the pavement for the past 33 years.\n\nOne regular has ruled the council offside \u2014 England football legend Sol Campbell. \u2018It\u2019s a place for people from all walks of life \u2014 from locals to royalty,\u2019 Sol assures me. \u2018The council should reconsider.\u2019\n\nMadden\u2019s kept hanging about\n\nBodyguard star Richard Madden became the nation\u2019s heartthrob when he showed off his athletic physique playing brawny protection officer David Budd in the BBC thriller.\n\nNow the actor, who is tipped to be the next James Bond, seems to be learning to fly.
