At least the phrase \u201cuseful idiot\u201d is highly politically charged.\n\nFirst, stooge. A stooge is someone who serves merely to assist others, often doing unpleasant work, and doing so without complaint. To be clear and fair, a stooge has little choice. Someone who does the dirty work for the boss of a gangster group, for example, is a stooge.\n\nIt is a derogative term.\n\n\u201cUseful idiot\u201d, on the other hand, is a more derogative term still. It is an idiom, meaning the term cannot be interpreted literally. An idiot, by definition, is someone who is low in general intelligence. Useful idiot, therefore, sounds more or less like an oxymoron \u2013 a self-contradictory description \u2013 because a stupid person cannot be very useful per se.\n\nHowever, if you understand its origin and context in which \u201cuseful idiot\u201d is used, you will understand why someone is described as a useful idiot, who describes them thus and when.\n\nSo, let\u2019s cut to the chase and go straight to the point. \u201cUseful idiot\u201d is originally \u201ca citizen of a non-communist country sympathetic to communism who is regarded (by communists) as naive and susceptible to manipulation for propaganda or other purposes\u201d (The Oxford English Dictionary).\n\nFor example, during the cold war, especially during the height of McCarthyism, many American artists were accused of being useful idiots of the Soviet Union because their views or artistic works were considered as sympathetic to the Soviet cause. The Soviets were, of course, archrivals of America politically, America being a capitalist country.\n\nToday, politicians still use this term to describe anyone who serves the purpose of their own political opponents either willingly or unwittingly \u2013 especially unwittingly, \u201cidiot\u201d implying that they are fools or that they are being fooled by their opponents. For example, if a Republican Party member says anything that sounds similar to what the Democrats have been espousing, he or she may be accused of being a useful idiot of Democrats.\n\nAnd, vice versa, a Democrat who supports a Republican initiative may equally likely be accused of being such an idiot.\n\nIdiot or no idiot, just remember that \u201cuseful idiot\u201d is a political jargon and therefore should best be reserved for describing politicians themselves.\n\n\u201cUseful idiot\u201d, by the way, is not dissimilar to the Chinese cold-war terminology of \u201crunning dog\u201d.\n\nRunning dog?\n\nNever mind, just know that it\u2019s a term that\u2019s equally politically charged and equally derogative.\n\nNow, recent media examples of people who are accused of being useful idiots (whether they deserve the accusation depends on your political view):\n\n\n\n1. Nearly a year after the presidential election, the scandal over accusations of Russian political interference in the 2016 election has gone beyond Donald Trump and reached into the nebulous world of online media. On November 1, Congress held hearings on \u201cExtremist Content and Russian Disinformation Online.\u201d The proceedings saw executives from Facebook, Twitter and Youtube subjected to tongue-lashings from lawmakers like Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who howled about Russian online trolls \u201cspread[ing] stories about abuse of black Americans by law enforcement.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the most chilling moment of the hearings, and the most overlooked, Clint Watts, a former U.S. Army officer who had branded himself an expert on Russian meddling, appeared before a nearly empty Senate chamber. Watts conjured up a stark landscape of American carnage, with shadowy Russian operatives stage managing the chaos.\n\n\u201cCivil wars don\u2019t start with gunshots, they start with words,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cAmerica\u2019s war with itself has already begun. We all must act now on the social media battlefield to quell information rebellions that can quickly lead to violent confrontations and easily transform us into the Divided States of America.\u201d\n\nNext, Watts suggested a government-imposed campaign of media censorship: \u201cStopping the false information artillery barrage landing on social media users comes only when those outlets distributing bogus stories are silenced: silence the guns and the barrage will end.\u201d\n\nThe censorious overtone of Watts\u2019 testimony was unmistakable. He demanded that government news inquisitors drive dissident media off the internet and warned that Americans would spear one another with bayonets if they failed to act. And not one member of Congress rose to object. In fact, many echoed his call for media suppression in the House and Senate hearings, with Democrats like Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Jackie Speier agreeing the most vehemently. The spectacle perfectly illustrated the madness of Russiagate, with liberal lawmakers springboarding off the fear of Russian meddling to demand that Americans be forbidden from consuming the wrong kinds of media\u2014including content that amplified the message of progressive causes like Black Lives Matter.\n\nDetails of exactly what transpired vis a vis Russia and the U.S. in social media in 2016 are still emerging. This year, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published a declassified version of the intelligence community\u2019s report on \u201cAssessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,\u201d written by CIA, FBI and NSA, with its central conclusion that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow\u2019s longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there is ample evidence that Russian-linked trolls have attempted to exploit wedge issues on social media platforms. But the impact of these schemes on real-world events appears to have been exaggerated. According to Facebook\u2019s data, 56 percent of Russian-linked ads appeared after the 2016 presidential election, and another 25 percent \u201cwere never shown to anyone.\u201d The ads were said to have \u201creached\u201d over 100 million people, but that assumes that Facebook users did not scroll through or otherwise ignore them, as they do with most ads. Content emanating from \u201cRussia-linked\u201d sources on YouTube, meanwhile, managed to rack up hit totals in the hundreds, not exactly a viral smash.\n\n...\n\nBefore he emerged in the spotlight of Russiagate, Watts languished at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, earning little name recognition outside the insular world of national security pundits. Based in Philadelphia, the FPRI has been described by journalist Mark Ames as \u201cone of the looniest (and spookiest) extreme-right think tanks since the early Cold War days, promoting \u2018winnable\u2019 nuclear war, maximum confrontation with Russia, and attacking anti-colonialism as dangerously unworkable.\u201d\n\nDaniel Pipes, the arch-Islamophobe pundit and former FPRI fellow, offered a similar characterization of the think tank, albeit from an alternately opposed angle. \u201cPut most baldly, we have always advocated an activist U.S. foreign policy,\u201d Pipes said in a 1991 address to FPRI. He added that the think tank\u2019s staff \u201cis not shy about the use of force; were we members of Congress in January 1991, all of us would not only have voted with President Bush and Operation Desert Storm, we would have led the charge.\u201d\n\nFPRI was co-founded by Robert Strausz-Hup\u00e9, a far-right Austrian emigre, with help from conservative corporations and covert funding from the CIA. From the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Strausz-Hup\u00e9 gathered a \u201cPhiladelphia School\u201d of Cold War hardliners to develop a strategy for protracted war against the Soviet Union. His brain trust included FPRI co-founder Stefan Possony, an Austrian fascist who was a board member of the World Anti-Communist League, the international fascist organization described by journalists Scott Anderson and Jon Lee Anderson as a network of \u201cthose responsible for death squads, apartheid, torture, and the extermination of European Jewry.\u201d True to his fascist roots, Possony co-authored a racialist tract, \u201cThe Geography of Intellect,\u201d that argued that blacks were biologically inferior and that the people of the global South were \u201cgenetically unpromising.\u201d Strausz-Hup\u00e9 seized on Possony\u2019s racialist theories to inveigh against anti-colonial movements led by \u201cpopulations incapable of rational thought.\u201d\n\nWhile clamoring for a preemptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union\u2014and acknowledging that their preferred strategy would cause mass casualties in American cities\u2014Strausz-Hup\u00e9 and his band of hawks developed a monomaniacal obsession with Russian propaganda. By the time of the Cuban missile crisis, they were stricken with paranoia, arguing on the pages of the New York Times that filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was a Soviet useful idiot whose film, Dr. Strangelove, advanced \u201cthe principal Communist objectives to drive a wedge between the American people and their military leaders.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Strausz-Hup\u00e9\u2019s fanaticism cost him an ambassadorship, as Sen. William Fulbright scuttled his appointment to serve in Morocco on the grounds that his \u201chard line, no compromise\u201d approach to communism could shatter the delicate balance of diplomacy. Today, he is remembered fondly on FPRI\u2019s website as \u201can intellectual and intellectual impresario, administrator, statesman, and visionary.\u201d His militaristic legacy continues thanks to the prolific presence\u2014and bellicose politics\u2014of Watts.\n\n- McCarthyism Inc.: Hyping the Russian Threat to Undermine Free Speech, TruthDig.com, November 13, 2017.\n\n\n\n2. Representative Hakeem Jeffries said on Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report should be made public, explaining that there are several options that the conclusions could point to, including the chance that the president is \u201cjust a useful idiot\u201d who has been taken advantage of.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know whether Donald Trump is either A) a legitimate president, B) a Russian asset, C) the functional equivalent of an organized crime boss,\u201d Jeffries, a Democrat representing New York, said on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation. \u201cOr D) just a useful idiot who happens to have been victimized by the greatest collection of coincidences in the history of the republic.\u201d\n\nMueller officially concluded his investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, submitting his final report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday. Although several close Trump associates have been indicted, convicted or pleaded guilty in the probe, none of the charges have been for conspiring with Russia. With no new indictments planned by Mueller, Trump\u2019s supporters have harshly criticized some Democratic leaders who have said for months that there is evidence of collusion.\n\nWhile Barr has maintained that he will publicly release as much of the report as is allowed under legal regulations, Democrats have urged for all findings to be made public. Several prominent Democratic lawmakers are also pushing for impeaching the president, regardless of the Mueller report's findings. But Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said earlier this month that she doesn\u2019t currently support impeachment.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,\u201d Pelosi said, although she added that she believes Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d in many ways to be president.\n\nJeffries backed Pelosi\u2019s position in his Sunday interview, saying that most Democrats share the speaker\u2019s position.\n\n- TRUMP COULD BE 'USEFUL IDIOT' WHO HAS BEEN VICTIM OF 'GREATEST COLLECTION OF COINCIDENCES,' CONGRESSMAN SUGGESTS, Newsweek.com, March 24, 2019.\n\n\n\n3. As if inspired by Donald Trump, Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign shouted \u201cfake news\u201d at TV news on Sunday with a letter calling on the networks to stop booking Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWritten by Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn and deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield and first disclosed by Politico\u2019s Michael Calderone, the letter denounced the networks for allowing Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, \u201cto spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump.\u201d Specifically, the campaign objected to Giuliani\u2019s spurious claims about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden engaging in \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine. The campaign insisted that fact-checking Giuliani in real-time or disputing his wild assertions was insufficient. He must be banished from the airwaves.\n\nOn the surface, a Giuliani ban sounds like a good idea. Early in the Trump administration when the president thought his legal team wasn\u2019t adequately defending him, Trump plaintively asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d\u2014referring to his former say-anything, do-anything personal attorney, a ruthless operator who worked for Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. Trump seems to have finally found his contemporary Cohn in Giuliani, who relishes his role as the most unreliable of unreliable narrators in Trump world. Like Cohn, Giuliani will say anything in service of his client, whether that means energetically contradicting the Trump team\u2019s collusion denials or reversing himself inside a single paragraph when asked if he instructed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to ban Giuliani from the shows for truth-bending, shouldn\u2019t we have to do the same for the other prevaricators who peddle Trump and his talking points on television? Just this last Sunday, an entire squad of Trump dissemblers visited the shows to spread mounds of cock-and-bull for their man. While these mounds might not be as mighty or as stinky as the ones Giuliani spews, they are malarkey just the same. Here\u2019s a brief serving:\n\nOn CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, hosted by Margaret Brennan, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump as being based on \u201chearsay.\u201d But legal experts agree that the memorandum of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump leans on the Ukrainian is completely admissible non-hearsay.\n\nOn the same network\u2019s 60 Minutes, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said with a straight face that the Trump-Zelensky conversation produced evidence of \u201ctwo leaders having admiration, not intimidation.\u201d McCarthy aped Giuliani\u2019s technique of filling the air with chaff when he accused correspondent Scott Pelley of adding a word to what Trump said to Zelensky. (Pelley got the Trump quotation\u2014\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d\u2014absolutely right.) Then, when Pelley asked McCarthy how the president\u2019s defense would roll out, McCarthy played stupid, saying, \u201cThe defense of what?\u201d Pelley had to answer, \u201cWell, there\u2019s an impeachment process.\u201d\n\nJake Tapper, the host of CNN\u2019s State of the Union, came close to losing his Cronkite cool in the face of a swarm of falsehoods advanced by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on behalf of the president. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d Tapper responded to Jordan\u2019s erroneous account of the Biden-Ukraine story. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that Biden called for the prosecutor to be fired to protect his son,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d\n\n...\n\nThe Biden campaign fails to understand that there is news value in having not just humbug artists like Giuliani on their shows, but also charlatans and beguilers like Graham, McCarthy, Jordan and Miller. When forced to spar with critical news anchors, their lies become transparent and diluted. In his recent appearances, Giuliani has been a shvitzing, manic mess, plotting out imaginary treacheries and schemes by the president\u2019s political opponents. Graham comes off like the president\u2019s useful idiot. McCarthy looks like he\u2019s in over his head, and Jordan sounds like he should be sized for a straitjacket.\n\n- Who's Afraid of Rudy Giuliani?
