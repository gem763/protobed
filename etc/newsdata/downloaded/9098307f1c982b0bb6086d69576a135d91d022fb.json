Africa\u2019s youngest leader quickly announced dramatic reforms and \u201cAbiymania\u201d began.\n\nIn a move that caused surprise in the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region, he said Ethiopia would accept a peace agreement with Eritrea, ending one of Africa\u2019s longest-running conflicts.\n\nThe improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea, one of the world\u2019s most reclusive nations. But Ethiopia\u2019s reforms appear not to have inspired any in Eritrea, which has since closed border posts with its neighbor.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Greta Thunberg has been passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize, which instead was awarded to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1158938411-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
