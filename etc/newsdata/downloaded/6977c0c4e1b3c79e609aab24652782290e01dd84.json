Earlier this week, Brussels announced that it was taking to Poland to court over a new disciplinary regime for judges that allegedly threatens their independence; a move slammed by the Polish government as a \u201cpolitical act\u201d.\n\nThis too has increased fears in Brussels that Poland is now following in the footsteps of Hungary. The Hungarian government has challenged what it regards as the orthodoxy of liberal democracy in Europe by promoting the concept of a nation state bound together by traditional Christian values and culture.\n\nBut that concept, according to its critics, also has little time or tolerance for anything or anybody that questions or fails to conform to it, and as a consequence has helped roll back democracy in the Central European country, they claim.\n\nYet despite all the fears and misgivings, both at home and abroad, over Law and Justice, the party remains popular in Poland, as the opinion polls attest.\n\nAlong with presiding over one of Europe\u2019s most successful economies, Law and Justice has employed a successful \u201ccarrot and stick policy\u201d, says Piotr Kaczynski, a political commentator and blogger on Polish affairs. The carrot, in this case, is social spending, while the stick has come in the form of demonising its critics as people who are against Poland.\n\nLavish social spending programmes and a promise to almost double the minimum wage by 2024 have proved to be a particular hit, and has helped foster the image of Law and Justice amongst its supporters as a party that brings tangible changes to their lives.\n\nEchoing Hungary, Law and Justice has also promised to defend the country\u2019s Christian tradition. Speaking earlier this month Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party\u2019s leader, claimed an opposition victory would bring to power \u201cthose who want simply the radical destruction of the moral and cultural order in our country, with all its fatal consequences\u201d.\n\nWhile this message in the past was tailored to appeal to the elderly people who make up a significant chunk of Law and Justice voters it now has a resonance with younger voters. A poll published last month in Super Express, a Polish tabloid, indicated that 45 per cent of 18-24-year-olds intend to vote for Law and Justice or a far-Right coalition.\n\nIn the pamphlet-strewn office of Law and Justice\u2019s youth wing, 25-year-old Michal Szpadrowski believe the party appeals to the young because it offers an identity to a generation not defined by the struggle against communism.\n\n\u201cWe were searching for some new values, some personal identification with our country,\u201d said Mr Szpadrowski. \u201cWe were looking for a new identity that we could share with our peers in Europe and one that would make us proud of our country. Law and Justice encourages young people to be proud of their country. Young people feel the government is with them and that they don\u2019t have to feel inferior about their country.\u201d\n\nHe also dismisses allegations that Law and Justice is undermining democracy or attacking the free press as unfounded. \"No journalist has been arrested and you can broadcast what you want,\u201d he argued.", "description": "The prospect of Law and Justice winning a second term in office has got Lukasz Lipinski worried.", "authors": ["Matthew Day", "Daniel Hannan", "Jacob Rees-Mogg"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212744004-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWxBGFlOUcUmFsyFms10hB_IluF4a99fyqLO_rGemLvE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
