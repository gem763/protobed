At that time, the president's decision to appoint Mr Bolton came as a surprise.\n\nHe remained an unapologetic cheerleader of the 2003 Iraq war, which the US president himself once lambasted as \"a big mistake\". Mr Bolton was praised, however, by conservative admirers as a straight-talking foreign policy \"hawk\".\n\nWhy is he leaving?\n\nMr Trump announced Mr Bolton's departure in a tweet, writing that his national security adviser's services were \"no longer needed\". But Mr Bolton quickly fired back, writing on Twitter that he had actually offered his resignation, but Mr Trump had told him \"let's talk about it tomorrow\".\n\nMr Bolton's exit follows and argument with Mr Trump over the administration's peace talks with the Taliban.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters: \"[The president] didn't like a lot of his policies, they disagree.\"\n\nAccording to White House sources, the National Security Council - which advises the president - had become a separate entity during Mr Bolton's tenure.\n\nA former senior Trump administration official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that Mr Bolton did not attend meetings, and followed his own initiatives.\n\n\"He's running his own show,\" said the official.\n\nTime in post\n\nOne year, four months.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDan Coats - Director of National Intelligence - mid August 2019\n\nAs director of national intelligence, Mr Coats oversaw all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA.\n\nBut his assessments were routinely contradicted by President Trump, who has been critical of intelligence agencies. In January, the president called his intelligence chiefs passive and naive in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Mr Coats would step down in mid-August and that he would nominate the Texan congressman John Ratcliffe to replace him.\n\nWhy is he leaving?\n\nIn his resignation letter to the president, Mr Coats said America's intelligence community had become \"stronger than ever\" during his two-and-half-year tenure.\n\n\"As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Coats, a former senator and diplomat, said in February the president had asked him to stay in the post, yet their differences on foreign policy appeared irreconcilable at times.\n\nTime in post\n\nTwo and a half years.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nAlexander Acosta, Labour Secretary - 12 July 2019\n\nWhile announcing his resignation, the former US attorney from Florida said he felt the \"right thing was to step aside\" so his past controversies would not overshadow the administration's accomplishments.\n\nMr Trump, who stood next to Mr Acosta while he spoke to reporters, noted: \"This was him, not me.\" He said Mr Acosta was \"a great labour secretary\".\n\nMr Acosta was sworn in as labour secretary in April 2017 - the first Hispanic appointee to the Cabinet. He was chosen for the role after Mr Trump's first choice, fast-food billionaire Andrew Puzder, withdrew.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Acosta had been defending his role in a 2008 plea deal that saw a light sentence for financier Jeffrey Epstein after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges. Epstein was charged in July with new sex trafficking charges related to that case.\n\nTop Democrats had called on Mr Acosta to resign for engaging in \"an unconscionable agreement\" with Epstein.\n\nMr Acosta said he negotiated the deal to ensure Epstein did not walk free, and that he was happy about the new case moving forward.\n\nTime in post\n\nJust over two years.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nSarah Sanders, White House Press Secretary - 13 June 2019\n\nPresident Trump announced that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders would be stepping down in a tweet, later praising her to reporters as a \"warrior\".\n\nShe started out as deputy press secretary before replacing Sean Spicer in the top post after a chaotic few months.\n\nDuring her tenure, she was accused of lying to journalists.\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nMrs Sanders will return to her home state of Arkansas.\n\nThe mother-of-three said she was looking forward to spending more time with her children.\n\nPress briefings became increasingly rare during her tenure as Mr Trump took charge of his own messaging.\n\nTime in post\n\nNearly two years.\n\nRod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General - 30 April 2019\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nRod Rosenstein eventually submitted a resignation letter, effective from 11 May, after months of rumours about his departure.\n\nIt came shortly after the release of the report into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election - an investigation he oversaw.\n\nReports say he specially timed his departure to allow for Robert Mueller's probe to wind down first.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nHis relationship with the president was always publicly fraught - with the lawyer frequently coming under fire on Mr Trump's Twitter feed.\n\nThere were even reports in 2018 that Mr Rosenstein at one point planned to secretly record the president in order to justify his removal under the 25th amendment of the US constitution.\n\nDespite this, Mr Rosenstein's resignation letter paid tribute to Mr Trump.\n\nIn it, Rosenstein said he was \"grateful\" for the opportunity to serve under him and even signed it off borrowing his campaign slogan of \"America first\".\n\nTime in post\n\nJust over two years from his confirmation.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen, Homeland Security Secretary - 7 April 2019\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nKirstjen Nielsen became Homeland Security Secretary in December 2017.\n\nHer sprawling department, responsible for domestic security, covers everything from borders to responding to national emergencies.\n\nShe faced criticism for enforcing some of the most controversial elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, such as the separation of children from their migrant parents at the Mexican border.\n\nIn a resignation letter she said it was the \"right time for me to step aside\".\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nThere have been tensions between her and the president for months, who blamed her for a rise in migrants at the Mexican border.\n\nDays earlier President Trump withdrew his nominee to lead another key department dealing with immigration, saying he wanted to go in a \"tougher direction\". It is widely thought he wants someone \"tougher\" at Homeland Security too.\n\nTime in post?\n\n14 months.\n\nBrock Long, administrator of Fema - 13 February 2019\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBrock Long was appointed administrator of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency by President Trump in April 2017 and confirmed by the Senate two months later.\n\nFema is responsible for co-ordinating the response to disasters and in his tenure he oversaw 220 of them. He was quickly battered by two hurricanes. Harvey hit Texas with catastrophic effect in August 2017, while Maria a month later devastated Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US.\n\nHe was one of those who bore heavy criticism for the response afforded to Puerto Rico.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nHe tweeted that it had been a \"great honour\" to serve his country and that it was \"time to go home to my family\".\n\nHe praised the president for \"unprecedented support\".\n\nMr Long was investigated last autumn for using government vehicles to commute from his home in North Carolina to Washington.\n\nTime in post?\n\n21 months from confirmation.\n\nJim Mattis, Defence Secretary - 20 December 2018\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe departure, scheduled for February, was announced in an evening tweet by the president.\n\nIn his social media post, Mr Trump said General Mattis would retire \"with distinction\" at the end of February, but did not name a successor.\n\nA distinguished former Marine Corps general, Gen Mattis had held the post since Mr Trump took office.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nThe move came just one day after the president controversially announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria.\n\nAlthough not referring directly to that, in his resignation letter Gen Mattis said the president had the right to have a defence secretary \"whose views are better aligned\" with his.\n\nThe two had diverging public views on a number of subjects, including Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nTime in post?\n\nBy the time he leaves, just over two years.\n\nRyan Zinke, Interior Secretary - 15 December 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nA former Navy SEAL, Ryan Zinke was picked to lead the agency that oversees federal land, including national parks such as Yosemite and Yellowstone.\n\nHe is a former congressman for Montana, where he was raised near Glacier National Park.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nPresident Trump tweeted that Mr Zinke would be leaving the administration at the end of 2018. He did not offer any further details as to the reasons for his departure and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired.\n\n\"Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Zinke has been under a number of investigations for his conduct in office. They include a land deal in Montana involving Mr Zinke and the chairman of oilfield services Halliburton, Politico reported.\n\nTime in post?\n\nAlmost two years.\n\nJohn Kelly, Chief of Staff - December 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe retired Marine general was initially nominated to oversee Homeland Security before Mr Trump promoted him to chief of staff in July 2017, replacing Reince Priebus.\n\nHowever, on 8 December Mr Trump announced that Gen Kelly would leave his post by the end of the year.\n\nWhy is he leaving?\n\nBy December 2018 his relationship with the president was said to have deteriorated, with some reports saying the pair were no longer on speaking terms.\n\nEarlier in the year Mr Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an \"idiot\" after the quote was included in a book by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward.\n\nTime in post\n\nAbout one year, five months. (He was previously Homeland Security secretary from January to July 2017.)\n\nJeff Sessions, Attorney General - 7 November 2018\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThe Alabama Republican was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, in early 2016.\n\nDuring the campaign, he became one of Mr Trump's closest national security advisers and, in government, was a supporter of the president's policies on immigration and law enforcement.\n\nWhy was he fired?\n\nMr Sessions became a frequent target of the president's ire as soon as he stepped aside, in March 2017, from the investigation over alleged Russian collusion with Mr Trump's campaign. The recusal allowed his deputy Rod Rosenstein to oversee the inquiry, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAt various times, Mr Trump publicly belittled Mr Sessions as \"beleaguered\", \"VERY weak\", and \"DISGRACEFUL\". But Mr Sessions reacted to most of the insults in silence.\n\nUS media reported that Gen Kelly had called Mr Sessions to say the president wanted him to step down. Mr Trump did not speak to Mr Sessions himself, and announced the departure on Twitter.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Sessions made clear the decision was not his own, saying: \"Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation.\"\n\nWATCH: How Trump-Sessions relations soured\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, nine months\n\nNikki Haley, Ambassador to the UN - 9 October 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe former governor of South Carolina was the first non-white woman to be appointed to Mr Trump's cabinet, and the first female, minority governor of her state.\n\nShe had limited foreign policy experience prior to her role as US envoy and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during his campaign.\n\nTrump names former critic as UN envoy\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nIn a news conference with Mr Trump, Mrs Haley announced she was stepping aside after a \"rough\" eight years as governor and envoy.\n\nShe will be leaving her post at the end of 2018, but said she did not yet know what her next steps would be.\n\nMrs Haley said she wanted to make sure Mr Trump's administration \"has the strongest person to fight\" for the US at the UN.\n\nWhile accepting her resignation, Mr Trump thanked her and said she did a \"terrific job\", making the role \"very glamorous\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, eleven months\n\nScott Pruitt, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency - 6 July 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe lawyer served as the attorney general of Oklahoma from 2011 - 2017.\n\nHe had sued the EPA, the agency which he presided over, a number of times in his role as the state's attorney general.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nDonald Trump announced that Mr Pruitt had resigned due to \"unrelenting attacks\" on himself and his family.\n\nSince taking office Mr Pruitt has been mired in series of scandals concerning his spending habits and alleged misuse of office, and is the subject of at least a dozen investigations into his conduct.\n\nAs the head of the EPA, he angered many liberals and environmentalists by severely curtailing the agency's activities and repealing many measures designed to protect the environment.\n\nThe long list of Scott Pruitt controversies\n\nWhile accepting Mr Pruitt's resignation, Mr Trump tweeted that he had done \"an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, four months, 19 days\n\nDavid Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA doctor, he had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama.\n\nPresident Trump had hailed him as \"fantastic\" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nDonald Trump announced that Mr Shulkin was resigning and that the president's personal doctor, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, would replace him.\n\nMr Shulkin had come under fire for alleged improper behaviour by department staff on a trip to Europe in 2017, including his own acceptance of tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. He denied wrongdoing but agreed to reimburse the government for his wife's air fare for the trip.\n\nMr Shulkin won praise from veterans' groups, but his lack of action on privatising the Veterans Health Administration had angered conservatives.\n\nIn parting, he condemned the \"toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive\" environment in Washington.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFourteen months\n\nHR McMaster, National Security Adviser - 22 March 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nA lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive.\n\nHe replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.\n\nTime magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he \"might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker\".\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Trump reportedly disliked his \"gruff and condescending\" manner and staff said the two never \"gelled\".\n\nGen Kelly, White House chief of staff at the time, also had little positive to say about him.\n\nTime in post?\n\nThirteen months.\n\nRex Tillerson, Secretary of State - 13 March 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nPresident Trump announced on Twitter that his secretary of state was leaving his position and being replaced with CIA director Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe dramatic shake-up came during a delicate time for diplomatic relations, with direct talks agreed in principle with North Korea.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Trump thanked him for his service and wished his family well.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nThe news came just after Mr Tillerson cut short a trip through Africa, with a statement saying he returned a day early because of schedule demands in Washington.\n\nMr Tillerson reportedly disagreed with a number of the president's policies, including his recently announced proposal to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.\n\nMr Trump reportedly believed Mr Tillerson was \"too establishment\" in his thinking, US media reports.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFourteen months.\n\nGary Cohn, Chief Economic Adviser - 6 March 2018\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe former president of the Goldman Sachs bank was appointed as head of the National Economic Council as Mr Trump took office, so becoming the president's top economic adviser.\n\nIn his time at the White House, he helped push through sweeping reforms on taxes, one of the most significant policy achievements of the administration.\n\nBut the two were not reported to be close, and rumours of Mr Cohn's departure continued to swirl.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nA staunch globalist, Mr Cohn had reportedly vowed to quit if Mr Trump pressed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US.\n\nAccording to US media, Mr Cohn initially planned to resign after Mr Trump blamed \"both sides\" for violence at a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFourteen months.\n\nHope Hicks, White House Communications Director - 28 February 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nMs Hicks served as Mr Trump's press secretary and handled media requests during his campaign.\n\nShe became his fourth director of strategic communications for the Trump White House after Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just 10 days in the job.\n\nThe fashion model-turned-spokeswoman previously worked as a publicist for Ivanka Trump's fashion label before entering politics with Mr Trump's bid for the White House.\n\nWho is Trump's media director?\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nHer resignation came a day after she testified to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told \"white lies\" for her boss.\n\nHer departure came only weeks after another top aide to Mr Trump, Rob Porter - with whom Ms Hicks was reported to have been in a relationship - quit amid allegations by two ex-wives of abuse.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix years in the Trump Organization, and three years with Mr Trump during his campaign and presidency.\n\nRob Porter, White House Staff Secretary - 8 February 2018\n\nMr Porter, who had been described as Mr Trump's \"right-hand man\", resigned after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional abuse.\n\nOne woman said he had kicked her during their 2003 honeymoon, and punched her in the face whilst on holiday a few years later.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Rob Porter, pictured holding the document for President Trump, was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives\n\nHe denies all the accusations.\n\nExplaining Trump's Rob Porter problem in three simple ways\n\nWhy did he quit?\n\nThe White House, and Gen Kelly in particular, were feeling increasing pressure to dump Mr Porter after the accusations of violence were first published in the Daily Mail.\n\nQuestions quickly arose over how early Gen Kelly had been made aware of the accusations by the FBI, and whether that was why Mr Porter was forced to operate with only an interim security clearance.\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year.\n\nAndrew McCabe, FBI deputy director - 29 January 2018\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAndrew McCabe resigned as deputy director of the FBI, where he served under current director Christopher Wray and former FBI director James Comey.\n\nHe was reportedly forced to step down ahead of his official retirement date in March, according to CBS News. His resignation came a week after a report that Mr Trump wanted him out.\n\nThe career agent became the FBI's acting director for nearly three months after the president sacked Mr Comey. He returned to his post after Mr Wray was appointed.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nThe attorney has faced repeated criticism from President Trump, who claims his ties to Democrats made him partial in the ongoing Russia investigation.\n\nHis wife, Jill McCabe, ran a failed Democratic bid for a state senate seat in Virginia in 2015, during which she received $500,000 (\u00a3355,000) from a political action group allied with Hillary Clinton - a move which Mr Trump apparently found unforgiveable.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTwo years as FBI deputy director, including a year under Mr Trump's administration.\n\nTom Price, health secretary - 29 September 2017\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe former Georgia congressman was a long-standing opponent of the Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare.\n\nMr Price was confirmed by the Senate along party lines, amid allegations of insider trading while he worked on healthcare laws - which he denied.\n\nAs health secretary, Mr Price was involved in President Trump's repeated failures to push through bills repealing Obamacare.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nAn analysis of transport spending by Politico discovered that Mr Price had, between May and late September, spent more than $1m on flights.\n\nSome $500,000 of that was on military flights approved by the White House, but private charter flights made up at least $400,000 where commercial flights were available. Mr Trump said he was \"not happy\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nAlmost eight months.\n\nSteve Bannon, chief strategist - 18 August 2017\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSteve Bannon joined the Trump campaign after leading the right-wing Breitbart News website, which rose to prominence through its attacks on mainstream Republicans, as well as those on the left.\n\nThe website helped to elevate the so-called \"Alt-right\", which critics label a white supremacist group.\n\nLike other aides to Mr Trump, he made his fortune as an investment banker, but later turned to financing film and television programmes such as the popular 90s sitcom Seinfeld.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nSome of Mr Trump's most influential advisers, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been pushing for his departure for months.\n\nHis firing came amid a public backlash to Mr Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which an anti-racist protester was killed by a 20-year-old man with Nazi sympathies.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFired one year after being named campaign chief.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, communications director - 31 July 2017\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThe brash, Wall Street bigwig has known President Trump for years, and defended him in TV interviews.\n\nWhile in the job, he appeared to accuse then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him.\n\nMr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nAlthough he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's outbursts may have cost him any post alongside Gen Kelly, who was replacing Reince Priebus as chief of staff.\n\nMr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Gen Kelly was sworn-in.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTen days (although his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus 15 days.)\n\nReince Priebus, chief of staff - 28 July 2017\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority.\n\nHe grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played key roles.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nPresident Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak.\n\nThe announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix months.\n\nSean Spicer, press secretary - 21 July 2017\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nMr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration.\n\nOver the course of his time behind the podium he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nUnlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president.\n\nHe stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix months.\n\nJames Comey, FBI director - 9 May 2017\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.\n\nHe was criticised first by Democrats for the timing, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought.\n\nThe president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nThe Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation.\n\nHowever Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a \"showboat\" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking of the \"Russia thing\" when he made the decision to sack him.\n\nTime in post?\n\nThree years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump.\n\nMichael Flynn, national security adviser - 14 February 2017\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nTechnically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president.\n\nHis departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\n\nMr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nIt is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak.\n\nTime in post?\n\n23 days.\n\nSally Yates, acting attorney general - 31 January 2017\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMs Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order.\n\nWhy was she sacked?\n\nA White House statement said Ms Yates had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States\".\n\nIt also described her as \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration\".\n\nTime in post?\n\n10 days. She previously served as deputy attorney general from May 2015 until January 2017.\n\nPreet Bharara, New York federal prosecutor - 11 March 2017\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nIt is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on.\n\nAt the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nMr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard.\n\nBut there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSeven years, seven months. Less than two months under Mr Trump.\n\nPaul Manafort, Trump campaign manager - 19 August 2016\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPaul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it.\n\nHe was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a statement wishing him well.\n\nBut a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US.\n\nTime in post?\n\nThree months.", "description": "Donald Trump's old catchphrase was \"you're fired\" - and his senior team has had a very high turnover.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1562F/production/_99799578_tv005710117.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
