One of the largest camps, al-Hawl camp in Syria\u2019s northeastern Hasakeh province, is home to about 73,000 people, many of them families of Isis members who emerged from the group\u2019s last bastion in Syria. Tens of thousands of fighters and other members of the group are held in detention centres across northern Syria and in Iraq.\n\nIn Syria, the centres are controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which spearheaded the fight against Isis in eastern Syria.\n\nWith a $25m bounty on his head, al-Baghdadi is the world\u2019s most wanted man, responsible for steering his chillingly violent organisation into mass slaughter of opponents and directing and inspiring terror attacks across the globe and in the heart of Europe.\n\nIsis was defeated in Iraq in 2017, while in Syria, it lost its last territory in March, marking the end of the extremists\u2019 self-declared caliphate.\n\nDespite these battlefield defeats, sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in both Iraq and Syria.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appears to claim in audio recording that Isis is still carrying out attacks", "authors": ["Associated Press In Beirut"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fefe69b7e4b7058409e1212cccf60fce9002f55/137_0_2838_1703/master/2838.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c4489ab0caa9061e195ba6d6e1a6830", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
