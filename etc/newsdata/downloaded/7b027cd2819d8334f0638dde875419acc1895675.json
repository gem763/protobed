Bush and Barack Obama, but he must keep up the pressure, particularly on Huawei, amid signs of a thaw in the trade war.\n\nMinority Leader Charles E. Schumer said China is trying to \u201cdodge a conversation\u201d about national security by narrowing the scope of talks to trade alone.\n\nThe Trump administration blacklisted Chinese telecom firm Huawei over fears the company\u2019s 5G equipment could be used for espionage or to disrupt U.S. networks \u2014 a charge the firm denies.\n\nMr. Schumer said this is no time to relent.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has shown some strength on this issue, but then he often backs off. We\u2019ve got to be tough on Huawei, very tough on Huawei. That\u2019s the best way to teach China that they can\u2019t sell whatever they want here in America and not let us sell in China,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, you\u2019ve been tougher on China than President Bush or Obama,\u201d he added. \u201cI give you some credit for that, but it will all come to naught unless we actually take action. Don\u2019t let Huawei sell here, don\u2019t let Huawei get the components, made in America, that they need to continue to threaten both our economic and national security.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war presents a balancing act for Democrats. They agree that China must change its trade practices and stop swiping intellectual property, though they\u2019ve criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt-force use of tariffs, saying they\u2019ll harm American consumers and farmers.\n\nMr. Trump has authorized bailout payments to farmers hurt by the trade war.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump said he expects China to buy a number of U.S. farm products, one day after the countries exchanged goodwill gestures by easing tariff threats.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nFor weeks, Mr. Trump accused Beijing of reneging on a mid-summer deal to buy farm products in exchange for a freeze on tariffs.\n\nTensions boiled over in August, with China cutting off agricultural purchases and Mr. Trump threatening bigger levies on Chinese goods this fall.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump said tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 25% to 30% on Oct. 15, instead of the Oct. 1. He said the gesture of \u201cgood will\u201d would spare the communist Beijing government embarrassment as it celebrates the 70th anniversary of its founding.\n\nEarlier in the day, China said it would waive tariffs on more than a dozen American goods, ranging from seafood to pharmaceutical drugs, ahead of October trade talks in Washington.\n\nMembers of Congress, including Mr. Schumer and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, say the administration cannot budge on Huawei, however.\n\nMr. Cotton has offered legislation that would give Congress the power to disallow waivers that any administration might grant to U.S. companies attempting to do business with Huawei.\n\nMr. Cotton, Mr. Schumer and House members asked the Defense Department on Thursday to release an updated list of any companies that are \u201cowned or controlled\u201d by the Chinese military and operating in the U.S.\n\nThe list is required by a 1999 defense bill, they told Defense Secretary Mark Esper in a letter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
