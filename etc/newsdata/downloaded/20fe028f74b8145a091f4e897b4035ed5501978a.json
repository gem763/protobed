You're reading the CBC Arts newsletter, and if you like what you see, stick around! Sign up here, and every Sunday we'll send you a fresh email packed with art, culture and a metric truckload of eye candy, hand-picked by our small and mighty team. Here's what we've been talking about this week.\n\nHi, art lovers!\n\nI'm going to blow your mind right now, I know, but that first \"F\" in TIFF doesn't stand for \"fashion\" or \"free swag\" or even the most relatable option: all-out, mind-crushing \"FOMO.\" It's for capital-F \"Film,\" pals, and before I get into the usual grab bag of links, I need to give you a preview of something coming soon to CBC Arts.\n\n\n\nStarting next week, watch for video panels featuring some of the film industry's finest: folks involved with some of the buzzier titles appearing at TIFF and beyond, including The Goldfinch, Just Mercy, The Lighthouse and Ford v Ferrari.\n\n\n\nWe've teamed up with the Directors Guild of Canada to produce this series of talks. It's called Meet the Makers, and Amanda Parris and Johanna Schneller (remember The Filmmakers?) are hosting. They'll moderate discussions on a bunch of different aspects of the craft, things like directing, sound editing, production design, documentary filmmaking. And about that last panel: Ellen Page is on board to chat about her directorial debut, There's Something in the Water.\n\n\n\nAs for your batch of weekend links, let's shift gears from movies to books. Who's read the first excerpts from Margaret Atwood's The Testaments? (Or are you one of the lucky jerks who managed to score an early copy by mistake?) The author was on both The Current and The Next Chapter to talk about this sequel to The Handmaid's Tale \u2026 which has already been picked up by Hulu for development. This is what happens when you try to write a novel with the help of AI. And this is what happens when you try to write a book with Prince.\n\nAnd because we promised you eye candy\n\n(Instagram/@witenry)\n\nTime to go shopping for office supplies. Again. (Van Gogh's Starry Night by \"object arranger\" Adam Hillman.)\n\n(Tumblr/Stationery Compositions)\n\nOr maybe it's just time to organize my desk \u2026 so it looks as satisfying as absolutely everything on this blog.\n\n(Instagram/@realfuturepunk)\n\nApple announced a release date for the iPhone 11 this week, but I'm still holding out for this '80s version.\n\n(Instagram/@paperorgan)\n\nAnd because paper: That's a paper organ, and it works! (It's powered by a balloon.) The artist who designed it is Wolfram Kampffmeyer.\n\nYou've got to see this\n\nSuper photos of dogs (that are also pretty super) - Hang with Jess Bell and a pack of happy doggos. Jess is a Toronto artist whose passion for action-packed animal photography started the day she brought home an \"eight-week-old ball of fluff\" \u2014 her furry best friend, Cohen.\n\nAll the movies we can't wait to see at TIFF - If you see someone from CBC Arts camped out in a rush line, it's because they're desperate to catch one of these flicks. Truth.\n\nAbsolutely everything you need to know about that free TIFF event I was yammering about - Remember? It was that thing from just a few blurbs ago? Here's a complete rundown of the event. (The official double-barrelled title: DGC Ontario's Meet the Makers: Visionaries at TIFF.)\n\nFollow this artist\n\n(Instagram/@reikan_creations)\n\nRaku Inoue (@reikan_creations) - What do you mean fall is coming? I'm desperately clinging to summer, and so is our September profile pic. Montreal's Raku Inoue used real plants and flowers to make that design.\n\nGot questions? Typo catches? Story ideas?\n\n\n\nWe're just an email away. Send us a note, and we'll do our best to get back to you.\n\n\n\nAnd if someone forwarded you this message and you like what you've read, here's where to subscribe for more.\n\nUntil next week!\n\nXOXO, CBC Arts", "description": "All that plus the week's top stories and a heap of eye candy.", "authors": ["Leah Collins Is The Senior Writer At Cbc Arts."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5276119.1568044691!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/there-s-something-in-the-water.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
