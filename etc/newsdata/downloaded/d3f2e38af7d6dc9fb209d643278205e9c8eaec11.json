She also quote-tweeted a Hollywood Reporter article about an upcoming Trump fundraiser in Beverly Hills during the week of the Emmys and asked for a name of attendees to be published.\n\n\"Many in our country have been infected with 'Trump derangement syndrome,'\" a \"Fox & Friends\" anchor said, before describing Messing's tweet and suggesting that she and her \"Will & Grace\" co-star Eric McCormack, who also tweeted about the Hollywood Reporter article, couldn't handle \"diversity of thought.\"\n\nRead more: Debra Messing says politics and addressing controversial issues are 'part of the DNA' of 'Will & Grace'\n\nA few hours later, the president tweeted about Messing.\n\n\"I have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC's failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me 'Sir.' How times have changed!\" Trump wrote.\n\nDonald Trump and Debra Messing were both photographed at the 2003-2004 NBC Upfront event.
