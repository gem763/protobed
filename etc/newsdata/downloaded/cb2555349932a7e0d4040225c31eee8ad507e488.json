He always converts his penalties, I am very happy for him, as he is working so hard every day.\n\n\"Naturally, it was not positive when Giampiero Ventura was the Italy coach, but he has slowly become first choice in that midfield.\n\n\"It certainly helps that he plays for Chelsea, because it's a very intense style of football in England and he learned a lot both from Maurizio Sarri and Frank Lampard.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhen asked about Jorginho's future, however, Santos appeared to suggest he could be open to returning to Italy, and refused to rule out a move in the near future.\n\nHe added: \"I think Jorginho can do very well at the Euros and, why not, also at the next World Cup. As for a return to Serie A, anything is possible, and he will always feel the desire to come back home.\u201d", "description": "The midfielder joined the Blues in 2018 and has become a crucial part of the first team despite a difficult start at Stamford Bridge", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572785.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TOPSHOT-FBL-EURO-2020-ITA-GRE-QUALIFIER.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
