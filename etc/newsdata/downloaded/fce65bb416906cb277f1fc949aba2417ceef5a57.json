That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.\u201d\n\nLast month, House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into the president following revelations that he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nLast week, Trump stood before reporters outside the White House and on camera called for China to investigate the Bidens as well, which Biden said was a sign that the president considers his office \u201ca free pass to do whatever he wants, with no accountability.\u201d\n\nHowever, when it comes to Trump\u2019s attacks, Biden said the president is waging a losing battle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this time, it won\u2019t work, because the American people know me \u2015 and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump\u2019s lack of integrity any day of the week.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens, Trump has relentlessly maligned his rival in tweets, press conferences and campaign ads, two of which CNN is now refusing to air because of their \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims.\n\nDespite the persistence of Trump and his Republican allies who have continued to support him, Biden made clear in his op-ed that he will not be deterred.\n\n\u201cPlease know that I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
