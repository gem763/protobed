People were very critical of me, and I\u2019ll be honest, I never really respond to it \u2013 I do care what people think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But when I know the whole deal and everything, it\u2019s like, come on guys. Give me a break \u2013 I knocked myself out, dude. Now let me see you walk down the street \u2013 let alone pick up a 320lbs dude \u2013 when you\u2019re knocked out.\n\n\u2018I think for me, what the Ziggler match did, was reaffirm my own self-confidence, not for anyone else. But I just needed to go out there and go through the motions, and know, man, just \u2019cause you stumble once, [it] doesn\u2019t define you.\u2019\n\nGoldberg admits Undertaker bout got under his skin (Picture: WWE)\n\nGoldberg felt the Ziggler match built his confidence (Picture: WWE)\n\nGoldberg \u2013 who appeared in the crowd during last week\u2019s star-studded Friday Night SmackDown debut on Sky Sports and Fox \u2013 revealed he is \u2018hyper-critical\u2019 of himself in the ring, and so getting to redeem himself so quickly after the divisive match meant a lot.\n\nHe added: \u2018Unfortunately I was defining myself by whether it be a move or a night or a match. The fact of the matter is, I\u2019m extremely hyper-critical of myself and that\u2019s what\u2019s made me the person that I am.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a blessing and it\u2019s a curse. I\u2019m never happy, but I\u2019m always striving to be better than anybody else\u2026 [The Ziggler match] helped me out a lot, it really did.\u2019\n\nFriday Night SmackDown airs every week at 1am on Sky Sports.
