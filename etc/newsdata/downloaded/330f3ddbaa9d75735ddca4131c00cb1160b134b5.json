The poisoned version quickly spread into the larger mediasphere.\n\n\u201cAnother Elizabeth Warren Lie About Elizabeth Warren?\u201d tweeted Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who \u2014 credit where due \u2014 does have proven expertise on the subject of lying.\n\nAD\n\nThe right-wing Federalist agreed \u201clie\u201d was the right word with its headline: \u201cRecords Show Elizabeth Warren Lied About Being Fired For Being \u2018Visibly Pregnant\u2019.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn embedded video kept it even simpler: \u201cWarren Lied.\u201d\n\nBefore you knew it, Fox News, in its wisdom, had jumped in. The chyron: \u201cWarren Facing New Credibility Questions.\u201d\n\nFox anchor Dana Perino assembled some pundits to consider it \u2014 among them Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary under George W. Bush, who framed it as a troubling \u201ccharacter issue\u201d for Warren. This gave Fox a chance to revisit Warren\u2019s earlier blunder over claiming significant Native American ancestry.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s one of the jobs of the press to scrutinize presidential candidates \u2014 to \u201cscrub\u201d them, in the journalistic lingo.\n\nAD\n\nElizabeth Warren is no different, liberal darling though she is.\n\nAs the Free Beacon\u2019s Johnson told Vox, \u201cfoundational myths\u201d spun on the campaign trail deserve skepticism: \u201cIt seems to me that these sorts of claims, whether it\u2019s Democrats or Republicans making them, warrant scrutiny.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFair enough. And Warren\u2019s campaign seemed to have made a tactical mistake by not responding immediately, though they were given the opportunity by the Free Beacon,according to its story.\n\nIf Warren had shot back as cannily to this as she did to the recent absurd report that she\u2019d had an affair with a 24-year-old Marine (she wittily tweeted out an image of her alma mater, the University of Houston and their mascots, the Cougars), she could have swatted this away.\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next day that some much-needed perspective began to emerge, thanks to a CBS News report.\n\nIt included crucial context that would have been ever-so-helpful in the initial piece, like this interview with a retired Riverdale teacher, Trudy Randall:\n\n\u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt also included an interview with Warren about why the board originally renewed her contract and even gave her a provisional pass on some other training she needed to continue as a speech pathologist:\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was pregnant, but nobody knew it,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck, and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nThe CBS piece also takes on another aspect of the Free Beacon\u2019s story \u2014 that Warren in 2007 explained her departure from teaching without mentioning being fired. She told CBS that going into elective politics caused her to become more open about that aspect of her past \u2014 and, in effect, to air the workplace discrimination that was rampant then and has never fully disappeared, despite being outlawed in the late 1970s.\n\nAD\n\nIt all seems to track: There is no big controversy here. No apparent lie and no \u201ccharacter issue\u201d that should unduly concern the voting public.\n\nIf there is a scandal here, it\u2019s how \u2014 in the bad-faith media world \u2014 narrowly presented facts without sufficient context can do unfair harm.\n\nThey can and will be weaponized, falsely regurgitated and twisted beyond recognition.\n\nThe only thing missing from this mini-saga is President Trump\u2019s custom-made insult. Stand by for that.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan\n\nAD", "description": "A conservative publication\u2019s report lacked context but gave valuable political ammunition to the right.", "authors": ["Margaret Sullivan", "Media Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J5CGBQI5Xn_2dw0uExUX_bWU0dA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NBYOYYHIPEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
