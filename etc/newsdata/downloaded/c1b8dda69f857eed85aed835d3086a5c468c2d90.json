Women cannot be un-radicalized | Moira Donegan", "language": "en", "text": "The backlash to #MeToo was always going to begin in earnest with Al Franken. A famous celebrity and well-liked politician in the Democratic party, the harassment accusations that were made against him by eight women were met with skepticism and disdain by liberal Americans who had previously been supportive of the movement, but were unwilling to see it come for one of their own.\n\nIn July, these Americans were cheered by a New Yorker article by Jane Mayer, an investigative reporter with a history of tackling powerful figures on the right, which aimed to exonerate Franken. Uncharacteristically for the accomplished Mayer, the article was incompletely and credulously reported. It poked significant holes in the account of one Franken accuser, the radio host Leeann Tweeden, but did nothing to cast doubt on the other seven accusers. Instead, the piece dismissed their allegations with hand-waving assurances from Franken allies that they were sure he hadn\u2019t meant any harm. Despite its failures of argument and reporting, the article accomplished its desired goal: conventional wisdom among middle-class liberals shifted to seeing Franken not as a man held responsible for his own actions, but as the victim of a nefarious plot at the hands of overzealous feminists.\n\nWhat regrets about a hasty, high-profile #MeToo resignation reveal| Laura Kipnis Read more\n\nIt has often been observed that in sexual misconduct cases, a woman\u2019s word is not given equal weight to a man\u2019s. Sometimes it takes dozens of women\u2019s testimony to be given the weight of one man\u2019s \u2013 think of the case of Bill Cosby, in which 60 women came forward with similar allegations of drugging and sexual assault, and the comedian still needed to be tried twice. Mayer\u2019s attempt to exonerate Franken took on an inverse logic: that even if there are many women accusing a man, only one of those women need have her credibility cast into doubt for all of their testimonies to be cast aside.\n\nAfter the Mayer piece was published, legacy media publications took up the task of publishing other, similarly skeptical or damning pieces on the #MeToo movement. Unusually powerful in shaping conventional wisdom among their broad readership, these publications have begun depicting the #MeToo movement as an excessive and emotional moral panic that victimized men, rather than a political movement for women\u2019s safety and dignity.\n\nPublications have begun depicting the #MeToo movement as an excessive and emotional moral panic that victimized men\n\nDays after the New Yorker published Mayer\u2019s piece, the New York Times broadcast an uncommonly aggressive interview with Kirsten Gillibrand, then a 2020 presidential hopeful and one of the more than 30 senators who called for Franken\u2019s resignation. Gillibrand was tasked with responding to Mayer\u2019s piece, and in the interview, the normally soft-spoken and accommodating Michael Barbaro pressed Gillibrand with uncommon antagonism, asking if she was responsible for Franken\u2019s downfall and whether her actions \u2013 hers, that is, not Franken\u2019s \u2013 had hurt the Democratic party. Gillibrand, who had been widely blamed for Franken\u2019s resignation, admirably stood her ground. But it wasn\u2019t enough to save her campaign. She dropped out of the presidential race just days later.\n\nMeanwhile, the New Yorker followed up its Mayer piece with a lengthy interview on its Radio Hour podcast with Jeannie Suk Gersen, a legal academic from Yale. Tasked with grappling with what host Joshua Rothman called \u201cambiguous\u201d #MeToo cases \u2013 Rothman cited instances involving Louis CK, in which the comedian is said to have masturbated in front of less powerful female industry insiders without their consent, but claimed that these women cast doubt on their own unwillingness by failing to flee \u2013 Suk Gersen claimed that the notion of consent was inherently ambiguous, even arbitrary.\n\nArguing against affirmative consent laws, Suk Gersen explained this stance by claiming that consent is arbitrary because desire is inherently unknowable. Her argument grants sex a mystical and unknowable quality that it does not quite have, and waves away with a \u201cwho-can-say\u201d faux profundity all of the pain and injustice of sexual assaults like those perpetrated by CK. The interview partook of a victim-blaming logic that attempts to use the richness of sexuality as a weapon against women seeking sexual justice.\n\nTaken together, the pieces are evidence of a growing backlash in mainstream legacy media against #MeToo, a backlash that will privilege those who wish to roll back feminist gains and delay feminist ends. Backlash politics are nothing new \u2013 Susan Faludi wrote about the phenomenon in her 1991 opus Backlash, which described the wave of antifeminist reaction that emerged in the 1980s following the second-wave feminist movement. Anti-feminism of the backlash variety, she says, comes cloaked in the rhetoric of reasonableness and respectability \u2013 even those who see themselves as feminists are often drawn to it. \u201cThe backlash is not a conspiracy,\u201d she writes, \u201cwith a council dispatching agents from some central control room, nor are the people who serve its ends often aware of their role \u2026 for the most part its workings are encoded and internalised, diffuse and chameleonic.\u201d The feminist philosopher Kate Manne deftly described this phenomenon of \u201creasonable\u201d anti-feminism when she said: \u201cThe misogynist\u2019s bullying feels like a moral crusade, not a witch-hunt.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the backlash could be thought of as a return to familiar social and intellectual habits, habits that subvert justice but which are comforting to the powerful. Among these habits are that of depicting women as incompetent and untrustworthy, of thinking of men as honorable and incapable of meaning any harm, of thinking of feminists as unreasonable, and their calls for men to think more about the emotions, rights and desires of women as unreasonable, even totalitarian. These are familiar habits to a lot of people, including people who think of themselves as good and socially conscientious, people who read the New York Times, or vote Democratic, or have a stack of New Yorkers in their living rooms. As they partake in the backlash, deriding women who come forward for doing so, doubting that these women were really unwilling, and heaping sympathy upon men who have been accused, they will think that they are being just, being nuanced, being sensitive of the vagaries and doubts that emerge when trying to do what\u2019s right \u2013 even as they give all the benefits of all their doubts to men, and not to women.\n\nThis emerging backlash will present a challenge to the feminist movement that has emerged in the #MeToo era, but it is not a new challenge, or a surprising one: anti-feminist reaction follows every feminist movement with the certainty and regularity of the tides. \u201cThe anti-feminist backlash has been set off not by women\u2019s achievement of full equality but by the increased possibility that they might win it,\u201d Faludi said. \u201cIt is a pre-emptive strike that stops women long before they reach the finish line.\u201d But the #MeToo movement has radicalized a generation of women, making them keenly aware that they do not have to silently suffer from sexual violence, or meekly accept the indignities of sexual harassment. Un-radicalizing these women, and making them accept an anti-feminist future, would be as impossible as to un-cook an omelette, or un-ring a bell.", "description": "The backlash was always going to start with Al Franken \u2013 anti-feminist reaction follows every feminist movement with the certainty and regularity of the tides", "authors": ["Moira Donegan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd095e6b46cc36964162bb32c61508ae475077f9/0_178_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0910245d9e48489c5ea1b696bed88046", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
