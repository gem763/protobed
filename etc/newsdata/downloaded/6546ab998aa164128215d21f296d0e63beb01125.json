There were a record number of deals in 2018, representing more than $100 billion in total value.\n\nIncreasing public anger over surprise bills caused lawmakers in September to launch an investigation into the practices of private equity firms and surprise billing. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent letters to KKR & Co., Blackstone Group and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe requesting information and documents related to the firms\u2019 ownership of private physician staffing and emergency transportation companies \u2013 which can lead to surprise bills.\n\n\"Evidence indicates that these physician staffing firms charge significantly higher in-network rates than their counterparts, thereby driving reimbursement upwards as they enter into staffing arrangements with hospitals,\" lawmakers wrote. \"We are concerned about the increasing role that private equity firms appear to be playing in physician staffing in our nation\u2019s hospitals, and the potential impact these firms are having on our rising health care costs.\"\n\nTRUMP TO RETIREES, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TAX-ADVANTAGED MEDICARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\nHOW MUCH THE WRONG HEALTH CARE PLAN CAN COST YOU\n\nAccording to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in every six Americans were surprised by a medical bill after receiving hospital treatment in 2017 \u2013 despite having insurance.\n\nBut is private equity to blame?\n\n\u201cSurprise bills are a problem, but they\u2019re a problem independent of whether it\u2019s private equity that has purchased the physician practices or the management company,\u201d David Hyman, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, told FOX Business. \u201cEven if we prohibited private equity firms from any involvement in this market, doctors would still have the same incentives to send surprise bills under some circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, private equity bought up physician practices because those practices can engage in surprise billing.\n\n\u201cI think people are suspicious that the private equity firms will sort of push this further than the doctors would on their own, but suspicion and evidence are two different things,\u201d Hyman said.\n\nOn the other hand, private equity investment might actually increase innovation and advance technologies in the sector.\n\nLawmakers have introduced legislation to protect patients from surprise medical billing, which moved out of committee in July.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCombating rising health care costs has become a focal point among lawmakers \u2013 as a number of 2020 Democratic candidates propose transitioning to a \u201cMedicare-for-those-who-want-it\u201d or Medicare for All system. Proponents of each of those plans argue it will decrease the number of uninsured Americans and lower overall healthcare costs for consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump recently unveiled a plan to expand Medicare Advantage plans, which are offered by private insurers.", "description": "Public anger over surprise bills led lawmakers to launch an investigation into the practices of private equity firms.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/iStock-Nurse-practitioners.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
