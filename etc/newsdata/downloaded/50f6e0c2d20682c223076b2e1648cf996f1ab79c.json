Moving is done on a rail system like rollerblades.\n\nThe move went very smoothly at a top speed of 12 metres per hour. Just before 13h GMT (15h CEST), the lighthouse arrived at its a new location.\n\nIt has been there, in the same spot, in 120 years \u2013 but over time the ocean has moved closer to the lighthouse \u2013 so close that the lighthouse is in danger of collapse.\n\nTherefore, the 1,000-tonne lighthouse will be moved today \u2013 70 metres into the country from the shore, with help from hydraulic jacks and tailor-made rollerblades.", "description": "One of the Danish west coast's major tourist attractions, Rubjerg Knude Fyr, is being relocated.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/13/98/1000x563_cmsv2_9737ab73-8f6a-50b5-84d2-00eb321ee3b0-4251398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
