Elijah Cummings Dead at 68", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., June 12, 2019. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Elijah E. Cummings (D., Md.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, died on Thursday morning, according to his spokeswoman.\n\nCummings was 68 years old. His death was a result of \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d said the spokeswoman without going into further detail.\n\nAs head of the House Oversight committee, the congressman was a key figure in the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. He deemed Trump\u2019s efforts to stymie the impeachment investigation \u201cfar worse than Watergate.\u201d\n\nIn July of this year, Cummings attacked President Trump over conditions in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities on the border with Mexico. Trump responded by calling Cummings\u2019 district a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live,\u201d attacks that were deemed by some as racist. Cummings\u2019 district has a $58,000 median income and is the second-wealthiest majority-black district in the nation.\n\nCummings served in the House starting in 1996, when he won a special election after his predecessor resigned to become the chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. His district encompassed most of West Baltimore and some outlying suburbs.\n\nCummings was born and raised in Baltimore, the son of sharecroppers who moved to the city to improve their living prospects. He worked as an attorney as well as serving in the Maryland House of Delegates before being elected to the House.\n\nIn 2015, after Baltimore resident Freddie Gray died in police custody, Cummings delivered Gray\u2019s eulogy and proceeded to walk through the streets with a bullhorn as riots erupted, appealing for calm.", "description": "His death was a result of \"complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\" said his spokeswoman without going into further detail.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Lee Edwards", "Kevin D.
