These unethical, ruthless people \u2014 to breed these dogs and sell them for big bucks \u2014 that\u2019s my big regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are just breeding for the money,\u201d he added. \u201cUnscrupulous breeders are crossing poodles with inappropriate dogs simply so they can say they were the first to do it.\u201d\n\nConron added that the majority of labradoodles he has encountered have some sort of health or behavioral problem. \u201cI find that the biggest majority [of labradoodles] are either crazy or have a hereditary problem,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he knew almost immediately that breeding the labradoodle was a mistake and did his best to stop it from catching on.\n\n\u201cI realized what I\u2019d done within a matter of days,\u201d Conron told ABC. \u201cAnd I went to our big boss at the time and I said to him, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve created a monster. We need to do something about it to control it. We need to put a patent on the name to stop people from getting on the bandwagon.'\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Gizmodo", "description": "", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1094083532.jpg?fit=1024%2C687", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
