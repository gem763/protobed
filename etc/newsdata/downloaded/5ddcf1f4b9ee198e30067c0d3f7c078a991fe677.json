Several legislators were ejected from the chamber and cries of \u201cCarrie Lam, step down!\u201d were heard.\n\nLam\u2019s speech was expected to focus on affordable housing\u2014the lack of which has helped fuel the raging discontent behind five months of anti-government protests. Her failure to give the address marks a sharp deterioration of Hong Kong\u2019s already fractious politics.\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterward, democratic lawmaker Tanya Chan said: \u201cI really urge [Lam], if she can\u2019t govern Hong Kong, and has no determination to govern Hong Kong, and no ability or even capability of administrating Hong Kong, to please step down. This is the only way we can have a good future, the only way Hong Kong can go forward. Please, please Carrie Lam, please don\u2019t let us suffer anymore. Please go.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She is such a puppet on strings being played by Beijing.\u201d\n\nFearing disruptions, the Legislative Council issued an amber alert prior to the the meeting, effectively barring the public from observing the proceedings and placing restrictions on the movements of lawmakers\u2019 staff within the building.\n\nA small group of protesters from the radical League of Social Democrats gathered outside the legislature beforehand. \u201cThe deep-rooted problem is that power lies in the hands of a small group of people, and that power is abused,\u201d said party figurehead and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung to assembled reporters. He repeated a demand for Lam to hold an independent probe into alleged police brutality, calling it \u201cthe most important thing at this moment.\u201d\n\nMinutes before Lam\u2019s address was due to begin, democratic lawmakers inside the legislative building held up placards showing an image of Lam with bloodied hands and began chanting, \u201cHold the police accountable!\u201d\n\nLam\u2019s address comes at a time of sky-high political tensions in Hong Kong. More than 2,500 people have been arrested, and hundreds injured, since protests erupted over a controversial, but now withdrawn, extradition bill in June. Early demonstrations quickly escalated into a rebellion against Lam\u2019s Beijing-backed administration,. Many protesters are demanding full democracy and self-determination or even independence for the former British possession, which was retroceded to China in 1997 after 156 years of colonial rule.\n\nIn recent weeks, protesters have become increasingly violent, smashing government offices and mainland-Chinese owned businesses, paralyzing the city with sustained attacks on the subway system, and detonating, police say, an improvised explosive device. Police arrested two men Wednesday at an apartment where explosives were found.\n\nA high school student has also been arrested for slashing a policeman on the neck with a box cutter during a protest, and police have wounded two young protesters in separate shootings.\n\nIn an attempt to quell the protests, the government two weeks ago invoked emergency powers to ban the wearing of masks at public gatherings, but the measure has sparked even greater fury.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing says it will respond forcefully if the U.S. Congress passes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The measure allows for sanctions on Hong Kong officials who are held to be working against the enclave\u2019s \u201cfundamental freedoms and autonomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of behavior has grossly interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs and is openly adding support to the opposition forces and radical forces in Hong Kong,\u201d an official at the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reportedly stated.\n\nLam\u2019s administration voiced its \u201cregret\u201d at the passage of the act through the House of Representatives.\n\nChina\u2019s President Xi Jinping has also threatened Hong Kong\u2019s separatist movement, saying, \u201cAnyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones. And any external forces backing such attempts at dividing China will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Hillary Leung / Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Pro-democracy lawmakers forced the adjournment Wednesday morning of the annual policy address by Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1176121122.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C8256px%2C4322px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
