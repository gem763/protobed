European markets also recorded a positive session.\n\nE-mini futures for the S&P 500, which are electronically traded futures contracts that are one-fifth the size of standard S&P 500 futures, were firm on Monday, extending their positive momentum from last week.\n\nStrong results from companies including Intel also boosted sentiment in equities market. More than 81 percent of US companies have beaten expectations so far this earnings season, despite concerns about the trade war.\n\nInvestors are waiting now for earnings from the likes of Alphabet Inc , Apple, Facebook and Exxon.\n\nActivity later in the week will be dominated by the US Federal Reserve, which markets expect is all but certain to lower interest rates at the Wednesday meeting of its Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC).\n\n\"The outcome of the FOMC policy meeting will most likely draw the largest market reaction,\" Richard Grace, Sydney-based chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank told Reuters.\n\n\"We also think the risk is the FOMC will articulate a pause,\" for future rate decisions, Grace added.\n\n\"That means the 27.6 percent pricing for an additional 25 bps cut in December will quickly evaporate, sending US yields and the US (dollar) higher.\"\n\nThe Bank of Japan meets on Thursday. On Friday, indicators for Chinese and US manufacturing will be released.\n\nIn currencies, the US dollar index was unchanged at 97.822 against a basket of six major currencies. The Japanese yen was a tad lower at 108.72.\n\nThe United Kingdom's pound was barely changed at $1.2824 compared with its Friday close. This was after the European Union agreed to London's request for a Brexit deadline extension, but set no new departure date.\n\nThat gave the country's divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for a snap election.\n\nEarlier, sources told Reuters the 27 EU countries that will remain after Brexit hope to agree on Monday to delay Britain's divorce until January 31 with an earlier departure possible.\n\nThe euro was also little changed at $1.1083.\n\n\"It feels like the calm before a potential storm, where the event risk heats up with political twists and turns, key economic data and central bank meetings,\" Chris Weston, Sydney-based strategist at Pepperstone told the Reuters news agency.\n\nOil prices climbed, supported by optimism on the trade front and by falling US crude stocks.\n\nUS crude rose 6 cents to $56.71 a barrel, while Brent crude oil gained 5 cents to $62.08.", "description": "Gains in Asia follow Wall Street's approach to near record highs after progress in trade talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/5/24/80350a7e0b804eb1967c2f1a1840f7ba_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
