Tabacoff clarified to The Daily Beast that he is \u201cworking as a consultant with a few clients.\u201d\n\nSince leaving Fox News shortly after O\u2019Reilly\u2019s April 2017 firing, Tabacoff has kept a relatively low profile. Although he is a veteran of Fox\u2019s decidedly right-wing primetime programming, his Twitter account resembles the views of a #Resistance liberal\u2014highly critical of President Trump with retweets of Never-Trump Republicans and liberal figures like historian Kevin Kruse.\n\nTabacoff isn\u2019t the first ex-Fox News executive Ruddy has brought over to the Newsmax fold. Earlier this year, Ruddy hired Michael Clemente\u2014the first Fox News executive to exit the network in 2016 following founder Roger Ailes\u2019 firing over sexual-misconduct allegations\u2014to serve as the CEO of Newsmax TV. Several months later, Clemente reportedly stepped down and moved into a \u201cconsultancy role.\u201d\n\nAnd Newsmax has also made use of O\u2019Reilly himself\u2014despite his infamous firing from Fox\u2014often as a featured guest, occasionally airing his \u201cNo Spin News\u201d broadcasts, and having him serve as an analyst during State of the Union coverage. And Ruddy has suggested he would like to bring on other ex-Fox News stars like Megyn Kelly, whom he described as \u201ccontroversial\u201d but a \u201cproven cable news ratings leader\u201d following her exit from NBC late last year.\n\nBeyond executive hirings, Newsmax is certainly staffing up in recent weeks as it continues to battle for right-wing viewership. Since late August, the company has posted eight job openings, including such key editorial positions as news director, producer, TV booker, technical director, and executive producer.\n\nWhile Newsmax\u2019s bottom-scraping Nielsen numbers would suggest Fox News isn\u2019t overly concerned with the upstart channel, it hasn\u2019t stopped Fox from forbidding its stars from appearing on Newsmax programming. Earlier this week, during an interview with Trump-boosting radio host Sebastian Gorka, weekend host Jeanine Pirro revealed that Fox brass told her she \u201ccannot do Newsmax.\u201d\n\nAnd Newsmax, of course, seized upon that news, running Facebook ads about Fox\u2019s prohibition on its right-wing star from appearing on another conservative outlet. Such a move is undoubtedly part of the fledgling channel\u2019s ongoing attempt to woo potentially disgruntled, decidedly pro-Trump Fox viewers.\n\nTrump has recently escalated his public criticism of Fox News for not displaying undivided loyalty to him and his agenda. For the crime of giving even remotely fair coverage to 2020 Democratic candidates, the president has encouraged his supporters to \u201cstart looking for a new News Outlet\u201d because Fox \u201cisn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Ruddy\u2014who is often quoted in the media as the president\u2019s friend and confidant\u2014has made it known that he envisions Newsmax as the truly pro-Trump option. \u201cThere is a growing disenchantment with Fox News and we are definitely seeing a rise in viewership with Newsmax,\u201d Ruddy told The Hollywood Reporter last month after a series of anti-Fox tweets from the president.\n\nRuddy has claimed that Newsmax reaches more than 70 million households and will top 80 million by the end of the year. At the same time, while Newsmax has purportedly widened its reach, Trump has largely ignored the network in favor of One America News, another overtly pro-MAGA outlet.\n\nThe president has seemingly embraced OANN as a slight to Fox News, live-tweeting their commentary and insisting that \u201cwhenever possible, I turn to @OANN,\u201d as he wrote last month. In fact, since taking office, Trump has tweeted about One America News on 15 separate occasions.\n\nMeanwhile, in that same period, the president has only tweeted about Newsmax once\u2014in a tweet last month that also tagged OANN and Fox & Friends.\n\n\u2014Andrew Kirell contributed reporting.", "description": "As Trump bashes Fox News for insufficient loyalty, Newsmax seeks to woo disgruntled Fox viewers.
