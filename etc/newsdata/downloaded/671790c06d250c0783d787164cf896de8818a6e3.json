He took a seat in a lower-tier box to the left of home plate. Five wounded veterans are among those watching the game with the president.\n\nTrump's entourage includes two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Florida's Marco Rubio. Also in the group is congressman Kevin Brady of Texas.\n\nHis arrival was not shown on in-stadium video monitors, but fans near the president turned and took pictures of him.\n\n___\n\n7:55 p.m.\n\nWashington-based celebrity chef Jose Andr\u00e9s got a big cheer when he lobbed the ceremonial first pitch ahead of Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park.\n\nAndr\u00e9s is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's immigration policies and his administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. He was chosen by the team to toss the first ball. Andr\u00e9s, a native of Spain, pumped his fist after the ball barely crossed home plate on the fly.\n\nTrump is attending Game 5, the first time he has been to Nationals Park since he took office. He planned to arrive after the game began to minimize disruption to fans trying to enter the stadium. The stands were full of red towel-waving fans before the first pitch despite enhanced security at entrance gates that included explosive-sniffing dogs, Secret Service officers and Transportation Security Agency employees.\n\nSgt. Major Bob McDonald of the U.S. Army Chorus sang the national anthem.\n\n___\n\n6:20 p.m.\n\nMax Scherzer says he can't lift his right arm and needed help from his wife to get dressed because of a muscle spasm and pinched nerve in his neck.\n\nScherzer was scratched as the Washington Nationals' starting pitcher for Game 5 of the World Series against the Houston Astros. Joe Ross will take his place.\n\nScherzer says his neck spasms started over the last few days and he got treatment in an effort to be ready to pitch. But he says he woke up Sunday morning and couldn't get out of bed. He had to fall out of bed and push himself up with his left arm.\n\nThe three-time Cy Young Award winner had a cortisone shot in hopes of being ready for a possible Game 7.\n\nScherzer says he texted Ross to let him know he would be starting.\n\n\"I'm as disappointed as I possibly can be not to be able to pitch tonight. It's Game 5 of the World Series,\" Scherzer said. \"I've pitched through so much crap in my career that that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\"\n\n___\n\n5:36 p.m.\n\nRookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez was back in the Astros' starting lineup for Game 5 of the World Series against the Washington Nationals.\n\n\u00c1lvarez, who hit 27 homers in 87 regular season games, was batting sixth and playing left field. He was the designated hitter in Games 1 and 2 but was benched as the series moved to the NL ballpark.\n\nCatcher Robinson Chirinos, who homered in Games 3 and 4, was benched for the Astros. Martin Maldonado was behind the plate with Gerrit Cole pitching in a repeat of the Game 1 battery.\n\nWith scheduled starter Max Scherzer scratched for Washington with spasms near his neck, his preferred catcher Kurt Suzuki was on the bench for the second straight night. Suzuki has a right hip flexor injury, but manager Dave Martinez said he would be available for Game 6. Yan Gomes started at catcher.\n\nShortstop Trea Turner led off for Washington, followed by right fielder Adam Eaton, third baseman Anthony Rendon, left fielder Juan Soto, second baseman Howie Kendrick, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, left fielder Victor Robles, Gomes and pitcher Joe Ross.\n\nFor Houston, George Springer led off and played center field, followed by second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve, right fielder Michael Brantley, third baseman Alex Bregman, first baseman Yuli Gurriel, \u00c1lvarez, shortstop Carlos Correa, Maldonado and Cole.\n\n___\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nWashington pitcher Stephen Strasburg could tell it was a big game by the pooches.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was set to attend Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park. As part of protocol, the clubhouses were swept as a precaution.\n\n\"I think everybody is excited. It's the president of the United States,\" Strasburg said.\n\n\"So there's obviously beefed up security,\" he said. \"So usually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse are these nice Labs that are super friendly. And today there was a German shepherd that I didn't really feel comfortable petting.\"\n\n___\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nNationals pitcher Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start in Game 5 of the World Series because of spasms near his neck.\n\nWashington manager Dave Martinez made the announcement 3\u00bd hours before the first pitch Sunday night.\n\nJoe Ross was scheduled to start in place of Scherzer. Gerrit Cole starts for Houston, with the Series tied 2-2.\n\nMartinez said Scherzer felt the spasm near his neck and trapezius muscle on his right side Saturday and woke up Sunday and texted the team trainer that \"he was really hurting.\"\n\nMartinez said Scherzer was \"locked up\" and \"he was in a bad place.\"\n\n\"He's very upset,\" Martinez said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
