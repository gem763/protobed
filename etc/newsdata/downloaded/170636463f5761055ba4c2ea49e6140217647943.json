Lloyd Bentsen was re-elected in 1988.\n\nA Democrat has not won a statewide race since 1994.\n\nDemocrats, though, are hoping momentum is on their side following the 2018 midterm elections in which former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke put up a stronger than expected challenge against Sen. Ted Cruz, and Democrats flipped a pair of House seats.\n\nDemocrats see more opportunities in 2020 following a series of House GOP retirements, and are even dreaming about the prospect of taking down Republican Sen. John Cornyn, which political handicappers see as a long-shot.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
