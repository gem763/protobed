Clarence Smoyer, the tank\u2019s gunner, spotted the enemy\u2019s gun barrel pointed his way the instant before he pulled the trigger.\n\nThe shell slammed into the German tank, followed by two more quick rounds in a remarkable one-on-one battle that was immortalized on film by an Army cameraman.\n\nThe duel knocked out the Panther, achieved a measure of revenge for the deaths of other U.S. soldiers in another tank minutes earlier and brought the end of World War II a little bit closer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smoyer, the last living member of the American tank crew, collected a Bronze Star for his heroism that day. Three more Bronze Stars were awarded posthumously to fellow crew members in his Pershing tank during a ceremony at the National World War II Memorial. An Army color guard saluted, a military band played and an immaculate Sherman tank was rolled onto the Mall for good measure.\n\n[Battered World War II hero of Bastogne gets a new home]\n\nThe medals \u2014 which already had been given to the Pershing\u2019s commander and the cameraman who risked his life to get the battle footage \u2014 now make the Pershing\u2019s men perhaps one of the most decorated tank crews of the war. The belated citations honor their teamwork during the battle on March 6, 1945, and reflect the perseverance of author Adam Makos, who tells the crew\u2019s story in his book \u201cSpearhead.\u201d\n\nThe medals are perhaps a testament, too, to the enduring power of the moving image. Besides getting the tank duel on film, Sgt. Jim Bates, a cameraman with the 165th Photo Signal Co., captured the moment a few minutes earlier when the same Panther had hit a Sherman tank a few blocks away and its mortally wounded commander bailed from the hatch.\n\nAfter the battle was over, Bates also recorded a portrait of the victorious American crew, including Smoyer, who wore a shy smile. Smoyer, 96 now and walking gingerly with a cane, acknowledged the honors with the same smile and a shaky salute.\n\n\n\nSmoyer, 96, stands in front of a Sherman tank near the National World War II Memorial. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt was just a great, great honor and a very big surprise,\u201d Smoyer said afterward of his medal. \u201cI\u2019m wearing it for all those who lost their lives.\u201d\n\nHis Bronze Star and the ceremony had been kept a secret worthy of D-Day among friends and family until Smoyer was dropped off at the memorial on the way to what he thought would be a book signing.\n\nA crowd of perhaps 100 people was waiting, including graying war buddies, his tank crew\u2019s family members, some military brass and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who had championed the medals under a law that allows for belated nominations.\n\nOther crew members honored Wednesday included Pvt. Homer L. Davis of Morehead, Ky., the Pershing\u2019s bow gunner; Pfc. John DeRiggi of Scranton, Pa., whose duty was to load the tank\u2019s gun; and Tech. Cpl. William McVey of Jackson, Mich., the tank\u2019s driver. The tank\u2019s commander, Staff Sgt. Robert Earley, received his Bronze Star soon after the battle.\n\nJohn DeRiggi, 66, who accepted the Bronze Star on behalf of his late father, said his father seldom discussed his wartime experience and its lingering effects on him until shortly before his death at the age of 83 in 2005.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of him,\u201d DeRiggi said. \u201cMy father actually suffered quite a bit. Part of his face was actually ripped up by shrapnel, and some of it they couldn\u2019t get out [because] it was too close to his eye. So he lived without complaining but had some issues after the war. He was just always my hero.\u201d\n\n[Bedford, Va., lost 20 men on D-Day. The town honored their service.]\n\nMakos tracked down Smoyer after a college friend, Peter Semanoff, had suggested looking into his story. Semanoff had grown up in Smoyer\u2019s hometown and heard tales of the soft-spoken gunner\u2019s bravery. On Wednesday, Semanoff, now an Army major, pinned the Bronze Star, along with its \u201cV\u201d for valor, to Smoyer\u2019s jacket.\n\nMakos, the ceremony\u2019s emcee, drew on his book to recount the dramatic battle for what was then Germany\u2019s fourth-largest city and a key gateway to the Rhine River. Many German soldiers, sensing that the war had been lost, surrendered without a fight. But others were willing to fight to the death, including the crew of the Panther that was lurking in a street near the city\u2019s Gothic cathedral as a line of American tanks approached.\n\nWhen 2nd Lt. Karl Kellner, finding his way blocked by debris, halted his Sherman tank within the Panther\u2019s range, the Germans opened fire.\n\nThe shell ripped into the Sherman, killing two crew members and shearing off Kellner\u2019s left leg. Kellner tumbled out of the hatch. Other soldiers rushed to help, including Sgt. Andy Rooney, a Stars and Stripes reporter who went on to become a well-known and irascible commentator for CBS News. The soldiers tried to save Kellner\u2019s life using a tourniquet from a shirt sleeve but without success.\n\nSmoyer\u2019s crew, hearing the radio traffic about the clash, knew that it fell to them to try to knock out the Panther, Makos said. Their Pershing tank, a model recently introduced to the battlefield, was better armed than the Shermans.\n\nEarley, the commander, scouted the Panther on foot, with the cameraman\u2019s help, before they rolled forward into combat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just sitting there like he owns the place,\u201d Earley told Smoyer, according to Makos\u2019s book.\n\nSmoyer swung the 15-inch gun into position. Makos said Smoyer knew the first shot mattered most. If he missed, his fellow crew members \u2014 men he regarded as family \u2014 might die. He often psyched himself up, saying to himself, \u201cDon\u2019t miss, don\u2019t miss.\u201d\n\nAs McVey goosed the engine, the tank rolled forward and Smoyer let loose. What he did not know \u2014 and Makos learned later \u2014 was they also had a bit of luck on their side: For an instant, the Panther\u2019s commander mistook the new American tank for one of his own, and his moment\u2019s hesi\u00adta\u00adtion proved costly.\n\n\u201cThat was close,\u201d Smoyer was quoted as saying.\n\nJoe Caserta, an attendee Wednesday who had been inside another tank that day 74 years ago, said he was glad Smoyer and the others received their medals. He also recalled what it was like to stifle one\u2019s fears whenever he climbed into a tank and jumped off into battle.\n\n\u201cOnce we jumped off, you were scared and you wondered whether you were going to make it another day,\u201d said Caserta, 97, of Ocean City, N.J. \u201cBut once you\u2019re in battle, the fear leaves you for a while, and you don\u2019t realize it until you made it back.\u201d", "description": "Deadly battle in the shadow of Cologne\u2019s Gothic cathedral had been captured on film.", "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/H_Bv4johMyzCUq0u9LMEceHai4w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SW6PO6G2IAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
