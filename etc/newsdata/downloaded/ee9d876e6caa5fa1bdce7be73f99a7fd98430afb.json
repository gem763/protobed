Jeff Flake \u2014 a frequent GOP critic of Trump \u2014 was \"better\" than Romney.\n\nRomney has long had a strained relationship with Trump. But in recent days, he\u2019s become one of the president\u2019s most vocal Republican critics for seeking foreign help to dig up dirt on a political rival.\n\nAs Trump looks to maintain GOP support in the face of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, Romney\u2019s criticism represents a potentially dangerous crack in party unity.\n\nOn Friday, Romney denounced Trump\u2019s \u201cbrazen and unprecedented\u201d calls for Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden as \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" Romney wrote on Twitter.\n\nRomney has yet to respond to Trump's tweets, and he\u2019s typically shied away from engaging in a tit-for-tat with the president.\n\nOver the years, Trump and Romney have been allies and enemies. Romney sought Trump\u2019s endorsement in his presidential campaign against Barack Obama but was a fierce critic of Trump during the 2016 election.\n\nTheir relationship stabilized somewhat after Trump won the presidency. Romney was in the running to be Trump\u2019s secretary of State and he later received Trump\u2019s endorsement in his 2018 Senate run \u2014 though Trump tried to keep Orrin Hatch from retiring in a bid to keep Romney out of Washington.\n\nThe two have also clashed over Trump\u2019s response to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Trump\u2019s behavior detailed in the Mueller report and trade policy, among other areas.\n\nNow Trump is facing perhaps his greatest crisis as president and while the vast majority of Republicans are sticking by him, Romney\u2019s criticism is surely only going to enrage him further.\n\nTrump's move to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating Biden and his son Hunter is at the center of the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats are issuing a series of subpoenas and are already obtaining damaging evidence, including text messages suggesting the White House was withholding military assistance until Ukraine launched a probe into Trump\u2019s political adversaries.\n\nIf the House does pass articles of impeachment, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate will take up the matter in some form, and Romney could be a critical player.\n\nTwenty Senate Republicans would be needed along with every Democrat to convict Trump and remove him from office. For now, that\u2019s clearly a long shot. But if more Republicans join Romney, Trump could be in trouble.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b1/d8/1625cdbf42108d6b50349d25057c/19105-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
