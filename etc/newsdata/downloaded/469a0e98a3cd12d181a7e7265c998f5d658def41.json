U.S. demand is also robust, he said.\n\nStrong demand in China is a welcome sign for Apple, which Ives has called the \u201cposter child\u201d of the trade war.\n\nTrump in July shot down CEO Tim Cook\u2019s request that Apple be shielded from the tariffs, saying the tech giant should make its products in the U.S. The tariffs, which were scheduled to hit products like iPhones and MacBooks on Sept 1., were delayed until Dec. 15 to give holiday shoppers some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple last week announced three new iPhones (iPhone 11, iPhone Pro, iPhone Pro Max), upgrades to several products and said its streaming service would cost $4.99 a month, undercutting its rivals.\n\nIPhone launches have generally been a positive catalyst for Apple shares, which have gained nine out of 13 times in the 60 days following such an event, according to an analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nApple shares settled at $214.17 on Sept. 9, the day ahead of the iPhone 11 launch. They finished at $220.70 on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIves has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating and $245 price target \u2013 14.4 percent above where shares settled Tuesday.", "description": "IPhone 11 demand is huge in China.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/apple-china-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
