Last week, Canberra\u2019s Michael Matthews travelled to Yorkshire hoping to replicate that feat, having placed second in 2015 and third in 2017.\n\nTreacherous English conditions turned the race into an epic, pushing the best riders in the world to breaking point. As Matthews and his seven Australian teammates fought for the rainbow jersey, Guardian Australia was along for the ride.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be war\u201d\n\n6.10pm, Saturday: Police Treatment Centre, Harrogate\n\nAustralia\u2019s technical director Brad McGee is holding court. In the lounge room of a grand rural residence converted into a rehabilitation centre for police, but occupied this week by several national teams, the Australian riders have gathered. A television screen in the corner shows a weather map, with heavy rain forecast. \u201cWill I need a raft?\u201d quips time trial world champion Rohan Dennis.\n\nWorld time trial champion Rohan Dennis has contract terminated Read more\n\nThe banter stops as a late-arriving team member is chastised. The mood instantly switches, with McGee\u2019s expression becoming stern. \u201cBoys,\u201d begins the former Olympic gold medallist. \u201cOur objective is to win.\u201d Over the next hour and a half, McGee, performance director Simon Jones, technical analyst Dr Eric Haakonssen and Australia\u2019s eight riders forensically dissect the 285kms standing between them and glory. \u201cOur ideal scenario is Michael Matthews sprinting to victory with seven guys leading him out,\u201d says McGee. He pauses, and then chuckles: \u201cThat might not happen.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Coach Brad McGee speaks addresses a team meeting before the race starts. Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian\n\nMatthews is among the favourites, after recently outsprinting the other primary contenders in Canada. The Australians want to control the race from the start, and Dennis is told to ride hard on the front. \u201cWe\u2019re going for the Team Sky look,\u201d says Mitch Docker; the British outfit was infamous for its conspicuous dominance of the peloton. \u201cIt is important, visually,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe discussion is lively, each rider offering their perspective and occasionally injecting humour. A major concern is information \u2013 unlike World Tour racing, national teams are not permitted to communicate by radio. Instead, Australia are deploying a traffic light system: at each feeding opportunity, staff members handing out bottles will wear coloured strips of material. Green means \u201call good\u201d, yellow is an instruction to \u201cbe careful\u201d and red indicates \u201ccrisis\u201d, McGee explains.\n\nOnce the tactics are agreed, each rider is asked to summarise their role. Nathan Haas, Jack Haig and Simon Clarke are Matthews\u2019 key lieutenants \u2013 it is imperative all three are still in play late in the race. \u201cIt is going to be us eight guys against 200,\u201d says Haas. Focus eventually turns to Matthews, who has remained mostly silent. \u201cBehind us will be mayhem,\u201d he says. \u201cI need all of you. It is going to be war.\u201d\n\nFinally, the meeting concludes. \u201cEat well, sleep better,\u201d McGee instructs his charges. The menu is carbohydrate-heavy, featuring pasta, rice and potatoes. \u201cBon appetite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is better \u2013 it is a race we can control\u201d\n\n6.50am, Sunday: team bus, en route to Leeds\n\nThe team rises early, with breakfast \u2013 toast, cereal, eggs and yet more pasta \u2013 served from 5.30am. The mood is subdued, with the riders mentally preparing for the toughest day of their season. As the bus departs for the start-line, word arrives that heavy rain overnight has necessitated a significant course change. Several climbs have been removed, with two additional laps of the final circuit around Harrogate added.\n\n\u201cI think this is better,\u201d Haas says. \u201cIt is a race we can control.\u201d The others seem indifferent, although a few grumble about technical difficulties trying to update the course on their on-bike race computers. Once the commotion subsides, the riders return to their individual preparations \u2013 adding numbers to their kits, cleaning cleats, imbibing espressos from the bus\u2019s coffee machine. Matthews speaks to his wife on FaceTime; Haig consults Haas about apartment renovation plans in Andorra.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Matthews inspects his on-bike race computer on the team bus. Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian\n\nThe bus is greeted in Leeds by several family members \u2013 team captain Rory Sutherland\u2019s two children have brought along an inflatable boxing kangaroo, wearing a world champion\u2019s jersey. Technical director Jones, a Briton who has been credited with overhauling Australian cycling since joining from Team Sky, is delighted by the kangaroo and disappears with it onto the bus.\n\nThe team\u2019s support staff, all employees of Australian-registered World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, busy themselves preparing bikes, bottles and nutritional supplies. Mitchelton-Scott provided the team bus, as many other World Tour teams have for their respective nations. The blend of club and country offers an odd aesthetic; Australia\u2019s riders even have different helmets, reflecting the various sponsors of their trade teams.\n\n'Like riding into a lake': world cycle champions saturated in Yorkshire Read more\n\nMcGee has a final chat with his squad, but there are no rousing words of motivation. \u201cThis does not change anything for us,\u201d he says of the late course revision. \u201cIf anything it plays to our strengths.\u201d Outside the bus, Jones, having returned the inflatable kangaroo, exudes an aura of calm. \u201cThere is no point telling them what to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have to do it.\u201d\n\nThe race rolls out 10 minutes behind schedule. McGee follows in the team car, while support staff scatter to different points of the route to offer bottles, feed bags and information. On the team bus, Jones has a live stream on one phone and is providing updates to the team WhatsApp group on another. Once an initial breakaway has formed, the commentator advises that, right on schedule, \u201cDennis moves to the front.\u201d Jones reacts with a yell that reverberates around the bus: \u201cGame on!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Australia\u2019s hydration supplies in Yorkshire. Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian\n\nThe rain becomes heavier; the conditions are so bad that the helicopters which usually provide television footage have been grounded. \u201cThis is going to be such an epic day,\u201d says Jones, with boyish enthusiasm. Earlier, McGee had been unperturbed by the weather. \u201cThese blokes don\u2019t care,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s rainy, put a jacket on. If it\u2019s windy, put your head down. These are hardened, battle-ready bike riders. The weather is not an issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the mighty have fallen\u201d\n\n12.57pm, Sunday: team car, on-course with 124kms to go\n\nAs the peloton enters the Harrogate circuit after four hours on-course, Dennis becomes the first Australian rider to abandon. \u201cWe are on track,\u201d says McGee. \u201cWe completed the first half to plan, and the stage is set for a big finish.\u201d\n\nThe team car convoy is ordered by UCI\u2019s country rankings; Australia, in ninth, are well behind the back of the peloton. McGee makes up for his lack of visuals by monitoring a live feed and the WhatsApp group \u2013 an impressive feat of multi-tasking as he speeds around the winding circuit \u2013 while a mechanic in the backseat relays orders to staff via radio. At one point McGee\u2019s concentration is interrupted by a phone call from his son in Australia. \u201cI\u2019m just a little busy right now,\u201d he offers apologetically.\n\nThe downpour is unceasing. \u201cIt has not stopped raining all day,\u201d says McGee, dry inside the team car as his riders endure the conditions. Despite the adverse weather, the circuit is lined with spectators. \u201cIt is like a Tour de France day in July,\u201d the coach observes. \u201cExcept it\u2019s wet and they have their wellies on.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The windscreen wiper of the team car works overtime. Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian\n\nMore Australians drop as the kilometres tick down, but McGee is unconcerned. \u201cWe are burning them in the right order.\u201d Suddenly the coach spots Clarke on the road ahead, distanced from the back of the peloton. \u201cFuck,\u201d he yells. Clarke\u2019s departure from the race with 40kms remaining was not part of the plan. \u201cI got a hunger flat,\u201d the rider explains through the car window. McGee regains composure: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a few cards here.\u201d\n\nWhen Haas drops a kilometre later, just two Australians \u2013 Matthews and Haig \u2013 remain in the front group. The team\u2019s prospects have swiftly diminished, but while the duo is in the race a medal is still possible. \u201cIt is pretty much all mental from here \u2013 you just have to back yourself,\u201d says McGee.\n\nWith three laps to go the race has become a battle of attrition, and barely a quarter of entrants have survived. When two riders attack, McGee ponders changing the colour scheme from yellow to red, but decides to keep it at \u201cbe careful\u201d. A trio then launches from the peloton to join the breakaway. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he spits, after the escapees establish a 30-second advantage. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers to bring it back.\u201d McGee is visibly deflated. \u201cThere is nothing we can do but sit and hope that another country chases.\u201d\n\nHaig cracks with 18kms to go, while highly-rated Mathieu van der Poel suddenly falls back from the breakaway. The favourites are dropping like flies; Julian Alaphilippe is another to go. \u201cHow the mighty have fallen,\u201d says McGee, stunned by the number of big names who will not be making it to the finish. When Matthews loses contact with the chase group, with several kilometres remaining, Australia\u2019s medal hopes are extinguished.\n\nMads Pedersen wins men\u2019s elite road race at sodden world championships Read more\n\nThe race is ultimately won by an unheralded 23-year-old Dane, Mads Petersen. Watching the sprint finish on the tiny screen in the team car, McGee is in disbelief. \u201cThis sport, hey? Brilliant, isn\u2019t it.\u201d Matthews rolls across the line in 24th place. Of the eight Australians who began the race in Leeds almost seven hours earlier, he is the only one to finish.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that for team culture?\u201d\n\n4.38pm, Sunday: team bus\n\nBack on the bus, the team are enjoying post-race pizza as they swap notes about a tough day in the office. \u201cThat was,\u201d Haas says, \u201can experience.\u201d After completing his media duties, Matthews arrives looking shell-shocked and immediately heads for the shower. He emerges from the steam 10 minutes later, still bearing a vacant expression. \u201cI tried to attack on the last lap, and all of a sudden I was going backwards rather than forwards,\u201d he says.\n\nOnce the bus arrives back at the accommodation, McGee immediately starts debriefing. Most of the riders have a beer in hand, for some their first alcoholic beverage of the year. The team take turns reflecting on their individual performances, in the order they exited the race, before others add commentary. Docker does not mince his words: \u201cIt was fucking brutal.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The steamy shower room on the team bus. Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian\n\nThe tone is broadly positive; the riders feel there was little they could have done differently. McGee encourages constructive criticism, listening intently as Clarke outlines the challenges they faced receiving food from the roadside. \u201cIs there a way we can do that better next year?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe team ponder how to overcome the conditions. \u201cEvery single person was cold,\u201d says Haig. \u201cIt is not a coincidence that a Scandinavian won.\u201d McGee suggests \u201cthere\u2019s no preparing for a day like that\u201d, but Jones is more pensive. \u201cYou can say it is down to the weather, but that\u2019s merely a problem we haven\u2019t solved,\u201d he says. \u201cYet.\u201d\n\nJust like the prior evening, attention finally switches to Matthews. \u201cI want to say thank you,\u201d he says. \u201cLast night we outlined a plan, and today we executed.\u201d Matthews may not be a typical leader, but his teammates are transfixed. \u201cIt was miserable out there today, but I did not hear one person complain. We stuck together \u2013 how\u2019s that for team culture?\u201d\n\nThe other riders applaud, but Matthews is not finished. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win, but we tried our best. Win, lose or draw, we have had an awesome day.\u201d", "description": "Guardian Australia was granted exclusive access to Australia\u2019s male riders during the 2019 Road World Championships in Yorkshire", "authors": ["Kieran Pender"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b6e97a818bf3cfd69b3bc3c8dd43cb786e364e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bca002815fb0d996db31ef121b2f7d28", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
