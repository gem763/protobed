Especially because she considers herself an activist first. Before joining Castro\u2019s campaign, she worked for years at the Center for Reproductive Rights, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and served as Castro\u2019s senior policy adviser when he was secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Rupert is also a writer and a lawyer, and lives in San Antonio with her two cats. Here\u2019s how she gets it done:\n\nOn her morning routine, with pets:\n\nAt home in San Antonio, I have two cats. It\u2019s not so much meditation or anything, but in the morning when I wake up, they\u2019ve surrounded me, so I have to pet them for a little bit. Their names are Crispin and Cuomo. I really like speeches, so I named Crispin after the Saint Crispin\u2019s Day speech [from Henry V], and then Cuomo after Mario Cuomo, because I really loved his speech in 1984 [at the Democratic National Convention].\n\nThen I get on the phone with my sister and her wife, who live in Chicago. They call me and put me on speakerphone and get ready for their day like I\u2019m in the room. We work in very different areas, but as black women in leadership roles, a lot of times we\u2019re dealing with similar issues. In addition to just being my sisters and best friends, I have that built-in support network.\n\nOn putting out fires:\n\nEvery day, there are the things I know are going to happen: I\u2019m going to have a conversation with the candidate. I\u2019m going to meet with our COO to talk about the budget. I\u2019m going to have some meetings with some version of our department heads. But the stuff that you don\u2019t know, that\u2019s always going to be the thing that takes up most of your day. It\u2019s the rapid response, the thing you don\u2019t have any control over. Every day there\u2019s going to be a new emergency, so you want to try and keep your desk clear so you can deal with it.\n\nOn accepting the job of campaign manager:\n\nFor a lot of reasons, I thought I couldn\u2019t get into politics. It\u2019s not the most visible profession if you don\u2019t know how to get into it. When I met the candidate, I realized, \u201cWow, there are politicians who approach politics the way I, as an activist, approach wanting to center justice, and wanting to talk about who\u2019s not at the table.\u201d Even so, when he asked me to run his campaign, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this. Have you thought this through?\u201d But I was his senior policy adviser, and he wanted to run a substantive, policy-driven campaign. He felt like my impulse to go toward the issues was actually exactly what he wanted.\n\nI almost want to say he took a chance on me, but the thing is, he doesn\u2019t treat it like he was taking a chance. He treats it like he looked around and saw the person he wanted running this campaign, and because of that confidence, I feel like I\u2019m able to get up and do it every day.\n\nOn telling people what to do:\n\nI definitely have those moments in managing where I have to say to myself, \u201cWait a minute \u2026 I\u2019m actually not asking a question. Just do this.\u201d We have a lot of women on our team, and women of color, so I try very hard to model certain behaviors, because I know that there are other people, like me, who have been socialized professionally to not be so comfortable giving orders, and I would like to empower them. My leadership style is very collaborative. I ask a lot of questions. I say, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m leaning, but I\u2019m not married to the idea. What do you think?\u201d But at the end of the day, I have to make the call. Being able to say, \u201cYes, I want to hear people who disagree with me. I hear you. I hear you. I\u2019m making the call,\u201d is a learned behavior, but I feel like I\u2019m getting there.\n\nOn talking about race:\n\nWhen I was younger, growing up in Joshua Tree, California, I had this sense of wanting race to be the least salient thing about me. When you\u2019re that age, all you really want is to be just like everybody else. It wasn\u2019t until college at UC Santa Barbara that I feel like I got comfortable talking about race and the role that race played in my life, and as I started talking about it and getting comfortable with it, I enjoyed it. I felt like it was sort of a secret I had been keeping, and as soon as I said it out loud, I realized it was not a secret worth keeping. It\u2019s actually really important. When people feel comfortable talking about race, we\u2019re better off.\n\nOn telling identical twins Juli\u00e1n and Joaquin Castro apart:\n\nI did mix them up once. The congressman [Joaquin] was at an event he wasn\u2019t originally supposed to attend. He came late, so I just looked at him in the corner of my eye and thought, that obviously has to be the secretary [Juli\u00e1n]. He was starting to leave, and I was like, \u201cWhere are you going? We are meeting after this.\u201d So I just went over and grabbed him and was like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And then I realized it wasn\u2019t him \u2026 He just made fun of me. The great thing is, the congressman has now grown a beard to make it easy on all of us. So that helps. Although after the last debate, the congressman came into the spin room and still so many people said, \u201cGreat debate, Mr. Secretary.\u201d He was like, \u201cI literally have a beard. You just saw him without the beard.\u201d\n\nOn getting her candidate into tonight\u2019s debate:\n\nWhen we found out we were through to debate number three, that was such a such an incredible morning. My sister actually called me. She woke me up, and was like, \u201cHow did I find out about this thing on the internet?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m finding out through you!\u201d And then I got the text message from the secretary. He does not use emojis. I wish I could get him to use emojis.\n\nHaving a candidate like the secretary on the stage opens the conversation immensely. I see in real time the value of diverse teams. Something comes up, and we have more confidence that things won\u2019t get missed, because there are a lot of perspectives in the room. I would venture to guess that we probably have more conversations than most campaigns historically, about, wait a minute, are we getting this right? And if we say this, is that a pretty exclusive statement? There have been so many times where I\u2019ve drawn on my own experience. There\u2019s a level of comfort that I probably wouldn\u2019t have if there were all the usual suspects in a political room.", "description": "As a young black woman leading the only Latinx Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s campaign, Maya Rupert is a trailblazing political strategist \u2013 with cats.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/11/post_it_HIGID_maya.w1200.h630.jpg"}
