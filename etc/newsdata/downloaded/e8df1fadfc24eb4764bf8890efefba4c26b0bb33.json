Before the introduction of measles vaccines in the 1960s there were, on average, 85 deaths from the disease each year in England and Wales. MMR was introduced in 1988 and has proved so effective that between 1999 and 2019 there were only four deaths.\n\nMumps can cause deafness, brain swelling and meningitis. Rubella generally presents as a mild rash in children, but if it\u2019s caught early in pregnancy, a woman has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her foetus which can cause severe birth defects or death.\n\nThe MMR jab is given as part of a NHS childhood vaccination schedule that starts from the age of eight weeks and goes up to 14 years. The age at which children have each vaccination varies, but as well as MMR, the schedule includes rotavirus (a common cause of diarrhoea and sickness), whooping cough, meningitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, polio and HPV (human papillomavirus, linked to cervical cancer).\n\nMMR is given in two stages, first at one year old and then a booster jab at three years and four months. The vaccine contains weakened versions of measles, mumps and rubella viruses, along with water and preservatives for better storage and to hold the components together. Two brands of MMR are available on the NHS \u2013 Priorix and MMRVaxPro (which contains porcine gelatine).\n\n\u2018Once you\u2019ve been vaccinated, your immune system develops memory antibody cells,\u2019 explains Dr Nicky Longley, a consultant in travel medicine and infectious diseases at University College London. \u2018Next time it comes into contact with the infection, those memory cells are ready to divide and produce an army of immune cells fighting the infection and preventing it from invading your body and making you ill.\u2019\n\nHOW EFFECTIVE IS MMR?\n\nA single dose protects 93 per cent of people against measles, 78 per cent against mumps and 97 per cent against rubella. The recommended two doses of the vaccine increase the rate of protection to 97 per cent for measles and rubella, and 88 per cent for mumps. You may still catch one of these diseases after being vaccinated but it\u2019s very unlikely and, if you do, it will be a much milder version.\n\nProtection against measles and rubella lasts for many decades; protection from mumps gradually declines (lasting on average 27 years) so many adults may not be immune.\n\nWHY DO EXPERTS SAY IT\u2019S SAFE?\n\nAnti-vaxxers claim the triple vaccine is too much of an assault on a young child\u2019s immune system. But, according to Dr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, it works because if the vaccines were spread out, children would be vulnerable for longer.\n\n\u2018A child\u2019s immune system is designed to fight off lots of germs every day,\u2019 he says. \u2018The amount of challenge that it faces from the combined vaccine is very small in comparison and puts no extra strain on it.\u2019 Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, says there is no evidence the triple vaccine is too much for a child\u2019s body. \u2018You cannot overload your immune system,\u2019 he adds. \u2018And the MMR involves just two visits (rather than six if each vaccine was given separately) \u2013 fewer needles for your children.\u2019\n\nDebbie Roscoe, 57, and her daughter Ellie, 24. Ellie almost died from measles last year because Debbie chose for Ellie not to have the full MMR jabs as a child\n\nWHY DOES IT MATTER IF MMR IMMUNISATION RATES DROP?\n\nInfectious diseases are easily passed from person to person and entire communities can rapidly become infected. If a high enough proportion of a community is protected by immunisation, it stops the disease circulating because the number of people who can be infected is so small. This is called herd immunity. Herd immunity is important because it protects people who cannot be vaccinated - some of the most vulnerable people in society, including children who are too young to be vaccinated and people with a compromised immune systems. By vaccinating your child, you\u2019re not only protecting them but also protecting the most vulnerable in your community.\n\nThe World Health Organisation advises that 95 per cent of children need to be receive the MMR jab in order to stop the diseases spreading. \u2018This is particularly important for measles as it is so contagious,\u2019 says Dr Brown. \u2018In an unvaccinated community, each person with measles would on average pass the disease on to 12 others. That\u2019s why ensuring a high vaccination rate is critical to stopping the spread of this disease.\u2019\n\nHOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE IT?\n\nThe uptake of MMR in the UK is well below the recommended level of 95 per cent to achieve herd immunity \u2013 with an uptake of 90.3 per cent in 2018/19. This is lower than in many other European countries. Recent NHS vaccine statistics for England showed that last year only 86.4 per cent of children receive two doses of MMR by the age of five.\n\nIn the past few years, measles and mumps rates have risen rapidly in the UK - and all over the world. The number of cases across Europe soared from about 5,000 in 2016 to 84,000 in 2018. The US is suffering its worst measles outbreak for 27 years. The WHO lists vaccine hesitancy \u2013 delaying or avoiding jabs - as one of its top ten global health threats.\n\nMeasles cases have soared, with the disease striking 991 children last year \u2013 treble the 2017 total. Official figures analysed by the Mail reveal that across Europe only France has more children without protection against the disease\n\nWHY ARE SOME PARENTS SHUNNING THE VACCINE?\n\na major issue is not being able to get a GP appointment at a convenient time, says Dr Jonathan Kennedy, a global public health expert at Queen Mary University of London. \u2018In a recent survey by the Royal Society of Public Health, the \u201ctiming, availability and location of appointments were identified as barriers to vaccination\u201d,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s also a problem with demand for vaccines as a result of concerns about safety,\u2019 he adds. \u2018In the same survey, one in five parents thought MMR was likely to cause unwanted side-effects and one in ten decided not to vaccinate their child with MMR, the majority due to concerns over safety.\u2019 MMR can potentially cause redness, pain or swelling at the site of the injection, a fever (about one in 15 children) or a short-lived rash (around one in ten). Extremely uncommon side-effects include severe allergic reactions and seizures.\n\nWHAT ABOUT MMR AND AUTISM?\n\nSome parents believe the triple jab can cause autism. The root of this lies in a paper published in 1998 in the Lancet medical journal by Dr Andrew Wakefield. The British gastroenterologist had looked at 12 children with autism, identifying eight whose parents said their children\u2019s behavioural symptoms had developed within two weeks following the MMR jab. The paper had a major impact but Wakefield was struck off in 2010 by the General Medical Council for acting dishonestly and irresponsibly in the way he conducted his research. His paper was retracted by the Lancet.\n\nHOW DO WE KNOW THE MMR DOESN\u2019T CAUSE AUTISM?\n\nAT least ten major studies have shown there is no link between the MMR and autism. The most recent, published earlier this year, involved over 650,000 children and found not only no evidence of a connection, but that this was true even among children considered at heightened risk of autism.\n\nSHOULD MMR BE MANDATORY?\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock says there is a \u2018very strong argument\u2019 for making vaccinations for children compulsory.\n\nAccording to Dr Kennedy, the UK would not be the first country to consider this. \u2018In 2017, the Italian government announced that unvaccinated children would not be allowed to attend school,\u2019 he says. \u2018The following year, France increased the number of mandatory vaccines from three to 11.\n\n\u2018In the US, where parents can claim exemptions from compulsory vaccination for medical, philosophical or religious reasons, some states have moved to limit or eliminate non-medical exemptions.\n\n\u2018Data suggests that mandatory vaccination legislation is effective,\u2019 he adds, pointing to Italy and France, where vaccine uptake has increased uptake.\n\nBut Dr Brown says compulsory vaccination is a blunt tool and there is no evidence that it would increase immunisation rates. \u2018There are concerns that it could increase current health inequalities and alienate parents with questions on vaccination,\u2019 he warns.\n\nWHAT IF MY CHILD MISSED OUT ON THE MMR JAB?\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to catch up. Older children and adults who missed out can get the jab free on the NHS.", "description": "Before the introduction of measles vaccines in the 1960s there were, on average, 85 deaths from the disease each year in England and Wales.", "authors": ["Hilary Freeman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19511234-0-image-a-31_1570658411370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
