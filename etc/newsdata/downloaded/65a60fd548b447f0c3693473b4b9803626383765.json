The ideas usually started from sparks somewhere in the community\u2014maybe from a teacher or newspaper reporter, a librarian or rec-center staffer, a young entrepreneur, a city worker, a lawyer, an artist, or a neighborhood parent. Everyman or Everywoman.\n\nThe ideas might be for a way to seize an opportunity, solve a problem, suggest a collaboration, or enhance a service. They are simple: the kind of thing that once you hear about it, you\u2019re likely to say Of course! Or Why didn\u2019t I think of that!\n\nThe background issues these are addressing are not always grandiose, like climate change. But they have far-reaching, positive potential. They don\u2019t require gearing up teams and processes. You can \u201ctry this at home\u201d and be likely to replicate it much more easily than you could a lab experiment.\n\nWe would like to share these Big Little Ideas, starting here, in a series we\u2019ll call, yup, Big Little Ideas. We hope you like them, will be inspired by them, copy them, and will send us information about the Big Little Ideas that you\u2019ve seen as successes (or even failures) in your hometowns. Please email us here: ourtowns@theatlantic.com.\n\n* * *\n\nIn 2009, the Nashville Public Library (NPL) and the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS), inspired by then Mayor Karl Dean, began a collaboration whereby student ID cards double as library cards. Every student from grades 3\u201312 in the MNPS system automatically owns a card to the public library. Teachers do, too. They call the project Limitless Libraries. (An aside: When I asked Mayor Dean about the idea, he immediately pointed out that this was a team effort, not just his. He was that kind of mayor.)\n\nWhat did this idea mean? First, the compulsory student ID placed the public library on the radar of every student in Nashville\u2014surprising new terrain for many students and their families. It also put access to the library\u2019s (age-appropriate) holdings and programming easily into the hands of the students, flattening any bumps that lay between students and resources. Students (and teachers) can request material from the library to be delivered and returned to their school libraries, where they study or work every day. The collaboration also moved school libraries into a bigger, more powerful citywide system, making it easier and less expensive to purchase their own materials.\n\nHas it worked? The NPL system has purchased over $7 million of materials for the school system, provided schools with borrowable technology like laptops and iPads, and even 3D printers. They have also introduced $4 million worth of architectural changes into school libraries, modernizing them into state-of-the-art areas for reading, collaborating, and maker-spaces. The idea moved from a pilot program in 2009 into all MNPS school libraries by 2017. In the 2017-18 school year, the program served over 90,000 students, teachers, and librarians and saved the MNPS half a million dollars.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration launched a program that quickly got library cards to more than a million students in 60 communities. It was called the ConnectED Library Challenge. You can read all the details of this nationwide effort, plus a how-to guide here.\n\nThe program has grown to more than 100 libraries and is called the Leaders Library Card Challenge, led by the Urban Libraries Council and supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. You can read about it here.\n\nOne of the beauties of this big little idea is that communities can tailor their efforts to their own wants and needs. For example, in 2014, Chattanooga eliminated the library membership fee for Hamilton County residents, making up the shortfall from its city budget. In Denver, the My Denver card includes students\u2019 free use of the city\u2019s rec centers and swimming pools. Milwaukee linked school IDs to virtual library cards, eliminating the need for physical cards for library use. Many libraries are eliminating late fees for students\u2019 overdue books or give them a way to work off their fines by attending programs or volunteering at the library. Staff from the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, Ohio visit every kindergarten in the 22-district school system to sign up kids for a child-only library card.\n\nAnd for those who are looking for an even Littler Big Idea, you might take inspiration from Arkansas teacher and school bus driver Julie Callison, who stocks her bus with a bucket of books for kids to read during the rides to and from school.\n\nMore from this series", "description": "", "authors": ["Deborah Fallows"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2019/09/shutterstock_1135482086/facebook.jpg?1569789711", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
