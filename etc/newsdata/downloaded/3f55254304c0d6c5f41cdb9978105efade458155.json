Let\u2019s enjoy the few years, or months, we have left.\n\nYour thought for the day: Imagine how differently these clips would be received by the public in a world where the Terminator movies didn\u2019t exist. Why, we\u2019d greet them as wondrous achievements. The start of a golden age for humanity even! Imagine humanoid robots being sent into raging infernos to rescue trapped people. Imagine them helping senior citizens go about their day. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the gee-whiz factor in watching them move so gracefully. \u201cThis is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d the Internet would cry in unison.\n\nInstead, everyone\u2019s reaction is the same: \u201cTrump needs to drone the people who are making these things while there\u2019s still time.\u201d\n\nBetween this and the news that Google may have made a breakthrough on quantum computing, I\u2019d say the coming election is probably the last one we\u2019ll ever need to worry about. After that we\u2019ll either be liquidated en masse or reduced to senescent lotus-eating as every industry in the country becomes fully automated. Cheers to the future, mates.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Endgame.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/br.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
