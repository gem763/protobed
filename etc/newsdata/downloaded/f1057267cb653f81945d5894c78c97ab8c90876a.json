But the top deals currently waive interest for up to 29 months.\n\nInterest freeze: An extended 0 per cent interest term can help borrowers clear their debts quicker\n\nThose with short to medium-term debts can use such offers to finally get out of the red, while those with much more to repay can look to these cards to provide a lower cost alternative to their existing debts.\n\nBut beware: there are caveats to consider and barriers to overcome when applying for such cards (see box) below.\n\nMany balance transfer cards also come with a 0 per cent period for new purchases as well.\n\nAvoid the balance transfer credit card traps\n\nThe crucial thing to remember is that card companies aren't providing cheap credit as a favour.\n\nThey want you to not clear debts during the 0 per cent period and spend more on the card, which makes them money.\n\nAvoiding falling into this trap is the key to balance transfer success.\n\nRemember, you are trying to repay your debts, not build up more. So think hard before buying anything else with credit.\n\nWork out how much you need to repay each month in order to clear the debt in time and set up a direct debit.\n\nBeware, pay late or spend beyond your limit and you could have the 0 per cent promotion whipped away.\n\nThis is Money has compiled a selection of the best deals currently available in the balance transfer market.\n\nThis page is kept updated throughout the year - bookmark it for the very latest developments.\n\nLongest balance transfer credit card deals\n\nLONGEST INTEREST-FREE BALANCE TRANSFER CREDIT CARDS Provider\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-free term on balance transfers\n\nInterest-free term on purchases\n\nTransfer fee\n\n\n\n\n\nAPR\n\n\n\nExtra info\n\n\n\n\n\nHalifax 29 months 3 months 3% 19.9% Balances must be transferred within the first 90 days.

In theory, those with the best credit ratings are the most likely to be approved for a card as they will have a history of paying off debt on time and have a stable income. It is more probable that those with poor credit ratings will be rejected. Those who are refused should bear in mind that applying for a number of other balance transfer cards in a short space of time will worsen their credit rating. Many card providers will not allow you to transfer balances from another of its own products, so you should identify the best deal for you outside of your existing providers before making an application. Some providers meanwhile may only accept your application if you already hold a current account with them. There are other restrictions you will also have to satisfy, such as having a minimum level of income (generally \u00a310,000- \u00a320,000 ). And to take advantage of introductory 0 per cent offers, you may have to transfer your balance within a specified time-frame. Most credit card providers increase handling fees after the first 60 or 90 days.\n\nCompletely 'free' balance transfer deals\n\nFor those confident they can pay off their credit card debts in a shorter time frame getting a balance transfer card with a lower handling fee, but lower interest-free period, can limit the extra charges on your debt.\n\nCompetition is tight though and there are a handful offering no handling fees at all with 0 per cent promotions just over two years.\n\nMarket leaders:\n\nThe Sainsbury's Bank 20-month balance transfer credit card with no handling fees on transfers made within three months. It also offers 0 per cent interest on spending within the first three months. It comes with an APR of 20.9 per cent.\n\nSantander's Everyday credit card doesn't quite make the top spot, however it has one advantage over longer rivals, it doesn't restrict the fee-free transfers to the first 60 or 90 days.\n\nYou can transfer a balance from another card free from handling fees for the duration of its 0 per cent interest offer - which lasts 18 months. You also get 3 months free purchases. The standard interest rate is 18.9 per cent.\n\nBest low rate balance transfer credit cards\n\nPeople who have racked up substantial credit card debt which is unlikely to be paid off within two years or who prefer to sidestep teaser rates can plump for cards which offer lower rates of interest.\n\nInterest rates on these deals have jumped in recent months, however there are still some decent no-frills deals to be found.\n\nRemember depending on how high your debts are you could also consider consolidating debts into a loan, particularly with borrowing rates at record lows at the moment.\n\nIf you choose a low rate credit card, you can currently find deals offering rates of 9.9 APR per cent.\n\nLloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland all offer cards with an APR of 9.9 per cent offering no-fee balance transfers if you shift your debts to them within the first 90 days.\n\nRemember these deals are reserved for those with tip-top credit ratings and even if you are accepted you could be offered a higher interest rate of 16.9 APR per cent.
