Jonas testified that Zuma drove him to the meeting.\n\n\"Firstly, I was not chosen. I decided to put the meeting together because there is a number of things being said in the background.

I have been in meetings where everyone is known to each and there are strangers in the issue but the common motive is to solely solve the issue.
