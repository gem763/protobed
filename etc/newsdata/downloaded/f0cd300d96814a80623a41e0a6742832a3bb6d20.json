The note sent out to missions from the Venezuelans, and reviewed by Fox News, appealed for allies to come out in force and be ready to vote against any US proposal to challenge the credentials of the regime.\n\nIt read in part: \u201cThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the United Nations must inform hereby of the intention of a group of delegations to request a vote in the General Assembly Hall in the afternoon of this coming Friday, 27 September 2019, to object the participation of and prevent H.E. Ms. Delcy Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez, Vice-President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, from addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe memo pleaded with allies to come and oppose any attempt to stop the speech and support Venezuela \u201cin the General Assembly of the United Nations as its delegation does, both in the relevant procedural and substantive votes there may be at the time.\u201d\n\nVenezuela has descended into economic and social ruin, with conditions worsening as Maduro has been engaged in a tug-of-war for power with Juan Guaido, the U.S.-recognized president since elections this year. Its population has since been dogged by malnutrition, disease and violence, as well as accusations that the government is engaged in money laundering and supporting terrorism.\n\nIn his address to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that 4 million people have fled the country, which he called \"one of the largest displacements in the world.\"\n\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, pulled no punches on the deteriorating situation in Caracas. In his speech to the General Assembly, he called Maduro \"a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people, while Cubans plunder Venezuela\u2019s oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule.\u201d\n\nIsaias Medina, a former Venezuelan U.N. diplomat who resigned in protest against the policies of the Maduro regime, told Fox News on Saturday that \"yesterday's gaslight performance by the criminal Chavista regime...is clear evidence that the U.N., in accordance with the current practice of cooperation with regional organizations, must consider the importance and unavoidable consequence of the 2019 [Organization of American States] resolution to reject Maduro\u2019s illegitimate regime, as it should also reflect the U.N. membership on the grounds of human rights violations, and ongoing crimes against humanity in breech of the principles of the U.N. Charter.\u201d\n\nAT UN, TRUMP SLAMS MADURO AS 'CUBAN PUPPET' WHILE VENEZUELAN REPRESENTATIVE CASUALLY READS BOOK\n\nMedina said the \u201cdiplomatic walkout was a sign of what many other members think but are still bound under interests other then human rights.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. mission to the U.N. said that the regime's \"lies and deceit\" corrupt the U.N. charter.\n\n\"We gather to solve the world\u2019s problems, not stand by while Maduro starves the people of #Venezuela,\" the mission said in a tweet. \"That\u2019s why we joined other nations to walk out...when Maduro\u2019s crony took the stage.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRodr\u00edguez, in her speech, claimed that she came on \u201cbehalf of the only Venezuela,\u201d a reference to a rival delegation of diplomats that opposition leader Guaido sent to the annual gathering of world leaders. She condemned U.S. sanctions \u201cfocused on strangling the Venezuelan economy\u201d but made little reference to years of hyperinflation, power outages and food and medicine shortages that have led the the mass exodus. She also later told reporters that the number cited by Guterres of how many had fled was \"a lie.\"\n\nThe regime, meanwhile, is reported to be on the roster to join the U.N.'s controversial Human Rights Council next month -- a move that would likely be seen as vindication by the U.S. for its decision last year to leave the body, in part because of the roster of countries with poor human rights records who sit on the council.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "In a week where President Trump and his administration shined the spotlight on the humanitarian crisis brought on by Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, a number of diplomats\u00a0led by the U.S. walked out Friday during a speech by Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez.", "authors": ["Ben Evansky"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/21/694940094001_6075379789001_6075372045001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
