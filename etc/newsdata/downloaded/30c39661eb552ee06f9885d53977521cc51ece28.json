Photograph: Twitter\n\nSilva captioned a photo on Twitter believed to be of Mendy as a child next to an offensive image on Sunday with the caption: \u201cGuess who?\u201d The image was of the logo for the Spanish confectionery company Conguitos. The tweet was later deleted.\n\nThe FA is aware of the post and, if the game\u2019s governing body decides to investigate further, then Silva, who scored a hat-trick in City\u2019s 8-0 victory over Watford on Saturday, could face a fine or a ban.\n\nThe Portugal international later tweeted: \u201cCan\u2019t even joke with a friend these days... You guys \u2026\u201d, for which he was heavily criticised on the social media platform.\n\nMendy and Silva are very good friends and have played with each other since 2016, first at Monaco and then, from 2017, at Manchester City. Mendy did not seem to be offended by the tweet, replying with three smileys, an emoji with clapping hands and the words \u201c1-0 for you will see\u201d.", "description": "The FA is looking into a tweet Bernardo Silva posted in reference to his team-mate Benjamin Mendy on Sunday", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e479ceeb53dd0a6ae62db90d44da4972498046b/413_0_3549_2129/master/3549.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce90b4a29c6f51eb575ac51a7f2362bb", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
