We only didn't know when,' said Mr Guzik.\n\nA closer examination of Borisov's orbit soon confirmed its origins as being outside of our solar system \u2014 and cementing its place in history as our second-known visitor from interstellar space.\n\nThe researchers studied Borisov using both images taken by the William Herschel Telescope on the island of La Palma in Spain and the larger Gemini North Telescope which is on built atop the dormant volcano of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\n'We immediately noticed the familiar coma and tail that were not seen around 'Oumuamua,' said Dr Drahus.\n\n'This is really cool because it means that our new visitor is one of these mythical and never-before-seen \"real\" interstellar comets,' he added.\n\nFurther observations allowed the team to determine that the comet has reddish colour, a dust-dominated form and a solid nucleus around 0.6 miles (1 kilometre) in diameter.\n\n'Make of this what you will, but based on these initial characteristics, this object appears indistinguishable from the native Solar System comets,' said Mr Guzik.\n\nWith their initial study complete, the researchers are now hoping to perform a more detailed analysis of 2I/Borisov.\n\n'The comet is still emerging from the Sun's morning glare and growing in brightness. It will be observable for several months, which makes us believe that the best is yet to come,' said paper co-author Waclaw Waniak, also of the Jagiellonian University.\n\n'We can safely say that research on this body will be transformative for planetary astronomy and a milestone for astronomy in general,' added Mr Guzik.\n\nThe full findings of Mr Guzik and colleagues' study was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe second ever-known interstellar object to visit our solar system \u2014 the comet 2I/Borisov, pictured \u2014 came from a twin star system 13 light years away, experts found\n\nWHAT IS 2I/BORISOV? 2I/Borisov is a comet that came from outside the solar system. It is believed to have a core that is around 0.9\u20134.1 miles (1.4\u20136.6 kilometres) in diameter. The comet was spotted by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov from Crimea's MARGOT observatory on August 30, 2019. It will make its closest pass to the Sun on December 8, 2019 \u2014 but will not get close to any of the planets in the solar system. 2I/Borisov will leave the solar system in the direction of the constellation of Telescopium. According to Polish researchers, it likely originated from the binary red dwarf star system Kruger 60. The comet is only the second interstellar visit to have been spotted. The first was the cigar-shaped asteroid 1I/'Oumuamua, which was detected on October 19, 2017.\n\nAstronomer Piotr Dybczy\u0144ski of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, Poland, and colleagues extrapolated back the course that 2I/Borisov likely took before it arrived in our solar system.\n\nIts projected trajectory passes through a binary red dwarf star system that scientists refer to as Kruger 60, which lies 13.15 light years from the Earth.\n\nWhen 2I/Borisov traversed that system, around one million years ago, it passed within just 5.7 light years from the centre of Kruger 60.\n\nWhen it did so, it would have been moving at just 2.13 miles per second (3.43 kilometres per second).\n\nAccording to the researchers, this relatively slow speed and proximity to the binary star system indicates that the comet likely originated from there, rather than having merely passed through Kruger 60 from elsewhere in the cosmos.\n\n'If you have an interstellar comet and you want to know where it came from, then you want to check two things,' University of Maryland comet expert Ye Quanzhi, who was not involved in the present study, told Live Science.\n\n2I/Borisov's projected trajectory passes through a binary red dwarf star system (pictured here with the comet) that scientists refer to as Kruger 60, which lies 13.15 light years from the Earth\n\n'First, has this comet had a small pass distance from a planetary system? Because if it's coming from there, then its trajectory must intersect with the location of that system.'\n\n2I/Borisov's 5.7 light year clearance with Kruger 60 counts as small for such considerations \u2014 despite being almost 357,000 times bigger than the separation between the Earth and the Sun \u2014 Dr Ye explained.\n\n'Second, usually comets are ejected from a planetary system due to gravitational interactions with major planets in that system,' he added.\n\nAt one time, 2I/Borisov would have orbited the twin stars of Kruger 60 much like comets orbit the Sun in our system \u2014 until another planet's influence knocked it flying off into space\n\n'This ejection speed has a limit. It can't be infinite because planets have a certain mass,' Dr Ye said, noting that a planet's mass determines how hard it can eject a comet out into interstellar space.\n\n'Jupiter is pretty massive, but you can't have a planet that's 100 times more massive than Jupiter because then it would be a star.'\n\nThe interstellar visitor was first identified by Crimea-based amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov, who spotted the comet using a telescope on August 30. Pictured, the trajectories of comet 2I/Borisov and 1I/'Oumuamua as they passed through the solar system\n\nFor astronomers, the appeal of investigating interstellar visitors like 2I/Borisov and 1I/'Oumuamua comes in the potential to study pieces of solar systems beyond our own in far closer detail than would otherwise be possible.\n\nFor example, anything scientists learn about Comet 2I/Borisov has the potential to shine light on the make-up of its home star system Kruger 60.\n\nA pre-print of the second article, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, can be read on the arXiv repository.", "description": "Software made at Poland's Jagiellonian University that was designed to scan data on newly-discovered asteroids and comets for interstellar visitors identified comet Borisov on September 8, 2019.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19695218-0-image-a-40_1571061807886.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
