It said the flag recalls \u201chistoric scars and pain\u201d for the people of South Korea, China and other Asian countries that experienced Japan\u2019s wartime military aggression, similar to how the (swastika) reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II.\u201d\n\nThe ministry said it also pointed out that FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, has banned the flag in international matches.\n\nWe \u201cemphasized that the use of the rising sun flag during the Tokyo Olympics would be a direct violation of the Olympic spirit promoting world peace and love for humanity, and that the IOC should have the Tokyo organizing committee withdraw its (current) stance on the flag and prepare strict measures to prevent it from being brought to stadiums,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nTokyo\u2019s Olympic organizing committee didn\u2019t immediately react to South Korea\u2019s request to the IOC to ban the flag at the games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Korea has formally asked the International Olympic Committee to ban the Japanese \"rising sun\" flag at next year's Tokyo Games, calling it a symbol of Japan's brutal wartime past and comparing it with the Nazi swastika.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
