The report was written by more than 100 scientists from 30-plus countries, and is the third such paper published by the IPCC over the past year (an August report focused on protecting land, and one last October found time was rapidly running out to avoid catastrophic warming).\n\n\u201cEach year that we delay action, ocean waters warm and become more acidic. This fuels hurricanes, kills coral reefs, and threatens the safety and livelihoods of the 40% of the world\u2019s population who lives within 60 miles of the coast,\u201d Miriam Goldstein, a director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement this week. \u201cTo protect the ocean\u2019s natural ability to store carbon, to feed billions of people across the world, and to save ocean ecosystems, we must substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe report, which focuses on the ocean and the cryosphere, or the frozen parts of the planet, comes amid worldwide calls for dramatic climate action. More than \ufeff4 million people around the globe staged mass climate strikes in thousands of cities last Friday, spurred by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, and many more are expected to step out again on Sept. 27.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, center, takes part during the Climate Strike, on Sept. 20, 2019 in New York.\n\nAt the same time, the planet is still far from meeting its climate goals set out in the landmark Paris Climate Agreement. In fact, global carbon emissions reached a record high in 2018, which was also the fourth hottest year ever recorded. Within the United States, the federal government under President Donald Trump has eviscerated many of the nation\u2019s premier environmental laws and withdrawn the country from the Paris deal in favor of a rapid expansion in fossil fuels and development.\n\nThe IPCC noted that while some of the most dire impacts of climate change may not come for several decades, many are already being felt in the oceans and ice caps and are almost sure to take place by 2100 if global emissions remain unchecked. Researchers said they were \u201cvirtually certain\u201d the oceans had warmed unabated since the 1970s, spurring acidification that has impacted biodiversity and harmed coral reefs. A widespread shrinking of the cryosphere has left large stretches of land uncovered by ice for the first time in millennia. And sea level rise is accelerating dramatically as all that ice melts.\n\n\u201cThe science is both chilling and compelling,\u201d Taehyn Park, a global climate political advisor with Greenpeace East Asia, said in a statement. \u201cThe impacts of human-made carbon emissions on our oceans are on a much larger scale and happening way faster than predicted. It will require unprecedented political action to prevent the most severe consequences to our planet.\u201d\n\nAll of these dramatic effects are projected to continue, the IPCC warned, if human-caused climate change continues.\n\nResearchers also warned that coastal communities were the most vulnerable to many \u201cclimate-related hazards, including tropical cyclones, extreme sea levels and flooding, marine heatwaves, sea ice loss and permafrost thaw.\u201d Around 680 million people currently live in areas that would be impacted by such hazards, which the UN noted often have the least capacity to deal with climate change.\n\nThe IPCC has been ringing its warning bells loudly for years. In last year\u2019s October report, the agency warned that the world was rapidly running out of time to address climate change and keep the planet from warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Any warming beyond that benchmark, researchers say, would unleash the worst impacts of the phenomenon. At the time, the chair of the body called the report \u201cone of the most important\u201d ever produced by the IPCC.\n\nTo avoid those threats, the planet would need to aggressively phase out fossil fuels by mid-century and remove carbon dioxide and other gases from the atmosphere from then on. In August, the IPCC doubled down on its findings, saying the world needed to see dramatic transformations to land management and food production as well.", "description": "Hundreds of millions of people in coastal areas would be threatened if climate change continues unabated, the UN's climate body warned.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8b057721000034005c600e.jpeg?cache=qkrvnu4n1u&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
