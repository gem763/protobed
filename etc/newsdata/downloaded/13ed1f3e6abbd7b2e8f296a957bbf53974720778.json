Bakke, which allowed race to be considered in college admissions.\n\n\u2018NOT THERE YET\u2019\n\nSFFA had contended that while Asian-American applicants to Harvard often outperformed on academic measures, stereotyping caused many to receive low scores on \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings.\n\nThose ratings are designed to reflect admission officers\u2019 assessments of how applicants might contribute to the Harvard community.\n\nHarvard denied the charge, saying its use of race in admissions was not a factor in the personal ratings.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice sided with SFFA, saying Harvard significantly disadvantaged Asian-Americans and had not seriously considered race-neutral approaches to admissions.\n\nIt has also probed whether another Ivy League school, Yale University, also discriminates against Asian-Americans.\n\nBurroughs, who ruled nearly a year after a non-jury trial, agreed with Harvard that the university had no \u201cworkable and available race-neutral alternatives\u201d to ensure a diverse student body while preserving its high academic standards.\n\nShe also said Harvard\u2019s program was not perfect, and that the school could improved bias training for admissions officers, maintain clear guidelines on using race in admissions, and do a better job of flagging race-related disparities in its ratings.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Philosophy students cheer as they receive their degrees during the 368th Commencement Exercises at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., May 30, 2019. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nThe judge concluded by noting Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s prediction in a 2003 decision upholding an affirmative action program at the University of Michigan that such policies would likely not be needed within 25 years. Conservatives have often criticized that prediction.\n\nDiversity at Harvard and other schools \u201cwill foster the tolerance, acceptance and understanding that will ultimately make race-conscious admissions obsolete,\u201d Burroughs wrote.\n\nShe said people will eventually view race as \u201ca fact, but not the defining fact and not the fact that tells us what is important, but we are not there yet. Until we are, race conscious admissions programs that survive strict scrutiny will have an important place in society.\u201d", "description": "Harvard University's undergraduate admissions program does not discriminate against Asian-American applicants, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday, rejecting a lawsuit brought by opponents of affirmative action and backed by the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436006249&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903EN", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
