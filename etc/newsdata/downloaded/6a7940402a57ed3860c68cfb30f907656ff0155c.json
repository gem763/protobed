The last December election resulted in a Labour government \u2013 the first ever \u2013 under Ramsay MacDonald. Defeated opponents bemoaned it as 'a national misfortune'.\n\nAlmost century later, there could hardly be a more fitting way to describe the grim prospect of Mr Corbyn as prime minister at the head of a quasi-Marxist cabal dedicated to revolutionary political change.\n\nA Corbyn government would be the most Left-wing in British history, with fears it would plunge the country into chaos and mark a radical departure from our democratic traditions of continuity and moderation.\n\nObsessed with greater state control, Mr Corbyn would preside over a government machine that would be both authoritarian and inefficient. Indeed, the great risk is that Britain would become a European version of failing Venezuela, scarred by economic meltdown and social upheaval.\n\nJeremy Corbyn will be hoping that history repeats itself. The last December election resulted in a Labour government \u2013 the first ever \u2013 under Ramsay MacDonald\n\nFollowing Mr MacDonald, Labour governments were led by heavyweights such as Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson \u2013 who, whether or not you agreed with them, were major statesmen.\n\nMr Corbyn, by comparison, is a political pygmy. Intellectually mediocre (two Es at A-level), incapable of mastering complex subjects, he has been a rabble-rousing far-Left activist for all his adult life. The picket line and protest march are where he belongs, not Downing Street.\n\nThis is a man who, until elected Labour leader, had never sat on the front-bench, nor held a job in the commercial world.\n\nAged 70, he shows distressing signs of frailty. He's had serious eye problems. On Saturday, he was fast asleep on a morning train to Scotland.\n\nHe would probably be replaced within two years \u2013 possibly by fellow revolutionary, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell\n\nIndeed, it is doubtful that Mr Corbyn would last long in office. He would probably be replaced within two years \u2013 possibly by fellow revolutionary, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who is a far cleverer, more ruthless operator. Despite his carefully cultivated avuncular image, Mr McDonnell is a sinister figure with a record of supporting the Irish Republican movement, calling for a woman Tory MP to be lynched and once described his pastime as 'fermenting [sic] the overthrow of capitalism'.\n\nThe cast-list of other probable ministers in a Labour Government is equally terrifying. The thought of them holding the levers of power sends a shudder down my spine. Diane Abbott, whose partisanship is matched only by her mathematical ineptitude, would surely be a disaster in the position of home secretary.\n\nBusiness spokesman Rebecca Long-Bailey \u2013 known to her critics as Rebecca Wrong-Daily \u2013 has scant confidence among the business world.\n\nEven worse is the prospect of the sanctimonious, duplicitous Tom Watson as deputy PM. After the gross misjudgment he has shown in his crusade against Press freedom and his shocking promotion of the conspiracy theory about an Establishment paedophile ring, Mr Watson should be in the political wilderness.\n\nDiane Abbott, whose partisanship is matched only by her mathematical ineptitude, would surely be a disaster in the position of home secretary\n\nEven without the personnel, Labour's policies are dangerous. With reckless spending plans and socialist dogma, Mr Corbyn could drag the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Taxes would soar, businesses could be crippled, bureaucracy would inevitably balloon, and with the engine of capitalism hampered, poverty would most likely spread.\n\nIgnoring the lesson of history that wealth creation should be encouraged, Labour wants to set a 45p income tax rate on salaries above \u00a380,000, while those earning more than \u00a3123,000 would face a 50p rate.\n\nMeanwhile, in what would amount to an unprecedented raid on the private sector, Labour proposes to grab \u00a3300billion of shares in 7,000 companies and transfer their ownership to workers.\n\nIn a similar spirit of confiscation, tenants would be given the right to purchase the homes they inhabit from landlords. Just as ruinous are Labour's doctrinaire plans for mass nationalisation, starting with the railways and utilities. The Confederation of British Industry estimates this could cost taxpayers almost \u00a3200billion.\n\nEven worse is the prospect of the sanctimonious, duplicitous Tom Watson as deputy PM\n\nComrade Corbyn would also allow trade unions to flex their muscles, as Tory restrictions would be lifted and free them to hold the country to ransom.\n\nThe paralysing, strike-bound days of the Winter of Discontent could be back with a vengeance, with Corbyn crony Len McCluskey, the militant boss of the Unite union, holding sway in Downing Street.\n\nThe picture is bleak on every front. And that's even before Mr Corbyn advances the agenda of identity politics espoused by so many in the party.\n\nIn the name of equality, Britain could become a test-bed for class, race and gender wars. Indeed, Labour's culture of intolerance \u2013 reflected in the rancorous rows over anti-Semitism \u2013 could swiftly be translated to the national stage.\n\nAgainst this background, there would be little respect for Britain's identity since Comrade Corbyn and his acolytes disdain patriotism and nationhood. That's why a Labour government \u2013 whose MPs and membership are overwhelmingly pro-Remain \u2013 would see Brexit abandoned.\n\nIt would also mean a savage reduction in defence spending, as well as Britain's possible withdrawal from Nato and the abolition of our independent nuclear deterrent.\n\nPutting Mr Corbyn, a lifelong unilateralist and anti-Western terrorist sympathiser, in charge of our defences and Armed Forces would be like putting an arsonist in control of the fire brigade.\n\nAn arsonist, I should stress, whose party would, in all likelihood, rule in Downing Street for five years thanks to the Fixed Term Parliament Act.\n\nThe next few weeks are crucial for Britain's destiny.", "description": "LEO MCKINSTRY: Jeremy Corbyn will be hoping that history repeats itself.
