The game is unfolding on Australia\u2019s terms after a solid but far from flawless display in the field proved enough to expose England\u2019s frailties with the bat. Rory Burns once again made a decent start, and once again Joe Root chipped in, but neither made the Smithian contribution demanded of them, leaving the scoreboard on the dreary side once the all-too common collapse occurred. Some early evening biff from Jos Buttler put some smiles on some faces but it served only to remind England followers what they were missing when the Ashes were still there to be won.\n\nFrustratingly, considering the state of the series, little new was gleaned from yesterday\u2019s action to add to the planning for future contests. The dismissals of Joe Denly and Jonny Bairstow in particular were agonisingly predictable.\n\nAustralia can take heart from Mitch Marsh\u2019s show stealing performance with the ball. They can now look forward to almost three full days during which Steve Smith has the freedom to play merry hell with all sorts of records.\n\nI\u2019m around for the next hour or so to keep this show on the road, but when play begins Geoff Lemon will step into the breach. If you want to share your thoughts with the world during the next hour or so you can send them to me on Twitter or by email.", "description": "Over-by-over report: The final Test of the 2019 series continues at the Oval.
