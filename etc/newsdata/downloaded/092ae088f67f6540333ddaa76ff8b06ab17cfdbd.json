The Stars won for the first time in four home games.\n\nDallas coach Jim Montgomery was cautiously optimistic after his team\u2019s third win in 11 games (3-7-1) this season.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re rounding into form,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still only two games where we\u2019ve played the right way. We have to continue to build on it.\u201d\n\nVladislav Namestnikov scored his team-high fourth of the season with 1:12 left to spoil Khudobin\u2019s bid for his ninth career shutout.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of work, to be honest,\u201d Khudobin said. \u201cThe guys played really well. But it\u2019s a tough game to play just because you don\u2019t see a lot of work.\u201d\n\nAnders Nilsson saw plenty of work, stopping 41 shots for the Senators, who have lost four straight (0-3-1).\n\n\u201c(Nilsson)\u2019s been outstanding,\u201d Ottawa coach D.J. Smith said. \u201cHe was our best player tonight. I thought we wasted his effort here tonight. It\u2019s a real bright spot for us that he\u2019s playing the way he is.\u201d\n\nFaksa scored in a first period in which Dallas outshot Ottawa 17-9.\n\nThe Stars had an excellent chance during the first minute when Miro Heiskanen picked up a rebound in the slot, but he shot wide right. They didn\u2019t score until 1:02 left in the first when Faksa redirected Taylor Fedun\u2019s shot from the right point past Nilsson.\n\nDallas made it 2-0 lead with 9:16 left in the middle period, 1 second after Ottawa had killed the first penalty of a 5-on-3 power play. With Stars surrounding the net, the puck went off Nilsson to Jamie Benn in front of the net and to Pavelski, who knocked it in from the left of the net. It was only the third for Dallas in 32 power plays, including one in each of the last two games. Entering the game, the Stars\u2018 power play ranked 28th in the league.\n\nThe Stars had a third power play in the period, highlighted by another good chance for Heiskanen. His drive from high in the slot went over Nilsson and squarely off the crossbar.\n\nNOTES: The Senators own the NHL\u2019s worst success rates on the power play (4 percent) after failing to score on their two chances. \u2026 Khudobin was scheduled to start even before No. 1 goalie Ben Bishop had to deal with his home damaged by a tornado Sunday overnight. Bishop was in uniform next to the Stars\u2018 bench for the game. The tornado blew the roof off a house owned, but up for sale, by Dallas C Tyler Seguin where he no longer lives. \u2026 Nilsson\u2019s highest saves total this season was 52 in a 3-2 shootout loss at Vegas on Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlames: Return home to begin a three-game homestand on Wednesday against Detroit.\n\nStars: Play the second in a four-game homestand vs. Anaheim on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas Stars fans expected to see plenty of goals this season from Joe Pavelski, signed as a free agent after a 38-goal season for San Jose.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/senators_stars_hockey_36239_c0-98-2347-1467_s1200x700.jpg?9c94e82d234e9ba49613e20327169a8d1a77558a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
