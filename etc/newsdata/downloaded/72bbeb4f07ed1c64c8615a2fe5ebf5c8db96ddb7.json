He adopted this date in order to move on with his life.\u201d\n\nMr Franklin added: ''Stalin decided to release us because the German's were bombing Moscow and he wanted us to train and fight wherever it was necessary.\n\n\"And so I decided to take a trip to England.\n\n\"I never expected to get out of Russia. The hunger was so bad I never thought it was possible to experience something like it.\"\n\nMr Franklin eventually settled down in Bury St Edmunds, Cambridgeshire, and has lived there ever since.\n\nHe married the love of his life, Pamela Brewster in October 1949, before opening his own antique restoration business.\n\n(Image: James Linsell-Clark/ SWNS)\n\nHe said: \"I opened up my own restoration business restoring old and antique things which I enjoyed very much.\"\n\nMr Franklin added: ''My step-sister and my family all went separate ways and I still don't know where anyone is.\n\n\"I never saw them again. That's how it is, war. You lose everything that is dear to you. It doesn't give a happy life to anybody.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thinks he might receive a letter from the Queen to celebrate his 100th birthday, he wasn't sure he would get one.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think I will get one but if I do it will be the biggest and most enjoyable recognition if I did it get it.\n\n\"I love my country and I did whatever I could to serve it, and I'm very proud of that.\"\n\nAlthough he'll soon be celebrating a three-figure birthday, Mr Franklin think's he not doing too bad for someone who's almost 100.\n\nHe said: \"I've still got a drivers licence - I'm so lucky to have such good health.\"", "description": "John Franklin lost all his documents when his home was flattened by bombs in World War 2 but he always suspected his new papers were incorrect", "authors": ["Maria Jacovou", "Lorraine King", "Image", "James Linsell-Clark", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20749211.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_FRANKLIN_100_11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
