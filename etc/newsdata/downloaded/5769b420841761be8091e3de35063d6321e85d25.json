There\u2019s no robot sitting in the pilot seat and pressing buttons while the real pilot takes a nap.\n\nA modern automatic flight-control system is made of three main parts: a flight-monitoring computer, several high-speed processors, and a series of sensors placed on different parts of the plane.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: Autopilot isn\u2019t as \u201cauto\u201d as you might think. There\u2019s no robot that sits in the pilot seat and mashes buttons while the real pilot takes a nap. It\u2019s just a flight-control system that allows a pilot to fly an aeroplane without continuous hands-on control.\n\nBasically, it lets a pilot fly from New York to Los Angeles without white-knuckling the controls for six straight hours. But how does it actually work? Kind of like a polar bear. A polar bear\u2019s core temperature sits at about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. It is so well insulated against the frigid Arctic cold that it often overheats. When that happens, its body reacts by releasing excess heat through its hairless parts, like its nose, ears, and feet. The polar bear\u2019s body temperature returns to a comfortable 98.6, and it\u2019s free to hunt seals another day. That cycle is called a negative feedback loop, and it\u2019s the same way an autopilot functions.\n\nA negative feedback loop is a self-regulating system that reacts to feedback in a way that maintains equilibrium. Generally, it uses a sensor to receive some sort of data or input, and the system uses that data to keep functioning in a preset way.\n\nFor the polar bear, that preset is body temperature. For an aeroplane, it\u2019s lateral and vertical movement. A modern automatic flight-control system is made of three main parts: a flight-monitoring computer, several high-speed processors, and a series of sensors placed on different parts of the plane. The sensors collect data from the entire plane and send them to the processors, which in turn tell the computer what\u2019s what.\n\nAFCSs come in three different levels of complexity. There are single-, two-, and three-axis autopilots, based on the number of parts they control. Single-axis controls the ailerons, which are these guys. They make the plane do this. Single-axis autopilot is also called the \u201cwing leveler\u201d because it controls the roll of the plane and keeps the wings perpendicular to the ground. Two-axis handles everything the single-axis does, along with the elevators, located here. They move the plane like this. And three-axis juggles those two plus the rudder. That one there is in charge of this movement. Then the computer tells the servomechanism units what to do. Servos are the little instruments that actually move the parts. All of these pieces come together to make sure your plane stays in the air, where it belongs. But they don\u2019t just work on their own.\n\nThe success of the autopilot depends on the knowledge of the actual human pilot.\n\nGreg Zahornacky: Autopilots are dumb and dutiful, meaning this: that if you program them incorrectly, they will kill you.\n\nNarrator: Dumb and dutiful are the \u201ctwo Ds of automation,\u201d according to Earl Wiener, a former US Air Force pilot and an aviation scholar. He once described autopilot as, \u201cDumb in the sense that it will readily accept illogical input; dutiful in the sense that the computer will attempt to fly whatever is put in.\u201d It\u2019s crucial, and I cannot emphasise this enough, that you know how to fly a plane before you use an autopilot. Step one is inputting a flight plan. And step one is also where things could start going wrong.\n\nTo get from New York to LA, a pilot needs a route. That route translates to a flight plan, and that flight plan gets punched into the computer and logged into the database. If the pilot doesn\u2019t know what the heck they\u2019re doing, then they can end up programming the autopilot to fly the plane upside down or to spell out \u201cI\u2019m a Bad Pilot\u201d in the sky. If they correctly navigate step one, step two is simply turning on the autopilot. The system executes the flight plan and takes over from there.\n\nZahornacky: That will stay operational until such time as they tell it or turn it off. But it is capable of flying the aircraft essentially from takeoff all the way to touchdown and including touchdown.\n\nNarrator: But you can\u2019t just tap it and nap it. It\u2019s the ABCs of autopilots: Always be checking. Because autopilots can and do fail. Sometimes it\u2019s user error when entering the flight plan. Sometimes it\u2019s a sensor or servo malfunction. Either way, this is when it becomes very important that an inflatable toy isn\u2019t flying the plane.\n\n\u2013 Why is it doing that?!\n\nZahornacky: If it\u2019s not doing what I expect it to do, I\u2019m gonna disengage the autopilot. I\u2019m gonna go back to hand-flying the aircraft and say, OK, this is what I want you to do. I\u2019m gonna rebuild it again.\n\nNarrator: The good news is autopilot will never take over a plane, \u00e0 la HAL. Worst case, the pilot turns it off and on again or pulls the circuit breaker if that doesn\u2019t work and reprograms it to behave itself. Worst-worst case, the pilot just has to fly the plane themselves.\n\nZahornacky: So, I am a very large proponent of hand-flying that aeroplane to keep your skills high because, you know what, you\u2019ve gotta go through a check ride at least once a year.\n\nNarrator: A check ride is a practical test regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration that US pilots must pass to get their licenses. And most airlines require yearly check rides to make sure their pilots can actually fly.\n\nZahornacky: \u2018Cause if it\u2019s on autopilot all the time, how can you keep your skills sharp?\n\nNarrator: There\u2019s a reason we still have pilots flying planes and haven\u2019t handed the yoke over to robots. As advanced as the technology is, an autopilot is not auto enough to think for itself, which means it\u2019s not smart enough to fly a plane by itself, and that\u2019s another thing autopilots have in common with polar bears.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
