The Berkshire resident said that after visiting the Edinburgh Castle, they saw the museum and decided to go in.\n\n\u201cWhile making our way through the floors we got to the thermal imaging camera room,\u201d she said. \u201cAs all families do, we entered and started to wave our arms and look at the images created.\u201d\n\nBut while posing for the camera, Gill \u201cnoticed a heat patch (red in color) coming from my left breast. We thought it was odd and having looked at everyone else they didn\u2019t have the same. I took a picture and we carried on and enjoyed the rest of the museum.\u201d\n\nAfter the vacation, Gill came across the image while looking at photos from the trip and again noticed the odd heat patch.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ken Jeong on Breast Cancer Awareness Month: \u2018Most Important Thing\u2019 After Wife\u2019s Battle\n\n\u201cAt this point, I searched on Google to see what this could mean and I saw a lot of articles about breast cancer and thermal imaging cameras,\u201d she said. \u201cI made an appointment with the doctor and as it turns out I do have breast cancer, thankfully really early stages.\u201d\n\nGill has had two surgeries since the discovery, and has one more planned to prevent the cancer from spreading in her body.\n\nGill said that her walk through the Thermal Camera \u201cchanged her life,\u201d and expressed gratitude to the museum for helping her catch her breast cancer in early stages.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to say thank you: without that camera, I would never have known,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the intention of the camera but for me, it really was a life-changing visit. I cannot tell you enough about how my visit to the Camera Obscura changed my life.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Mom of Two Shares Her Breast Cancer Battle: \u2018Getting That Mammogram Saved My Life\u2019\n\nThe museum\u2019s general manager, Andrew Johnson, said on the World of Illusions website that they did not know the Thermal Camera had the \u201cpotential to detect life-changing symptoms in this way,\u201d and said that the team was \u201creally moved\u201d after hearing Gill\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that Bal noticed the difference in the image and crucially acted on it promptly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wish her all the best with her recovery and hope to meet her and her family in the future.\u201d\n\nWhile thermal imaging was a surprise success for Gill, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that it\u2019s no substitute for getting a mammogram, and warns against using thermography as those who use it \u201cmay miss the chance to detect cancer at its earliest stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThermography has not been shown to be effective as a standalone test for either breast cancer screening or diagnosis in detecting early stage breast cancer,\u201d the FDA\u2019s website says.", "description": "Woman's Breast Cancer Detected by Tourist Attraction's Thermal Camera", "authors": ["Ashley Boucher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aYLV2RHPCA5E_xatyPai8g--~B/aD0yNzAwO3c9MTE3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1ea257d4af3dd444446a9ab79522b6a9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
