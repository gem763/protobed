Beats is today introducing the Solo Pro, a $299.95 set of wireless headphones that add noise cancellation to the on-ear form factor shared by the company\u2019s long line of previous Solo headphones. These are, for all intents and purposes, the Solo 4 Wireless, but they\u2019ve been rebranded to match the Powerbeats Pro (and iPhone 11 Pro and every other tech product that now has \u201cpro\u201d tacked on to its name). The new headphones, Beats\u2019 first on-ears with active noise cancellation, will ship on October 30th.\n\nBeats wireless headphones are ubiquitous and seemingly everywhere. The company claims its Solo lineup represents the most popular headphones in the world, with over 30 million sold. And the Solo Pros are now the flagship consumer model that the company hopes you\u2019ll start seeing on city streets, on mass transit, at the gym, on the heads of celebrities, and anywhere else you usually spot the Beats logo. The company considers the Solo Pros to be part of a \u201cnext generation\u201d of products led by the superb Powerbeats Pro from earlier this year.\n\nThe Solo Pros clearly take after the Solo 3s in appearance, but Beats says they were essentially redesigned from scratch. Some changes are obvious: the metal sliders are now exposed and part of the aesthetic so your hands aren\u2019t always touching plastic. Beats is confident the aluminum sliders won\u2019t move accidentally and will maintain the necessary tension for a good seal and optimal noise cancellation.\n\nThere\u2019s no power button, as the Solo Pros automatically power on when unfolded and power down when folded and stowed in their case. Also, they only come in a matte finish; the glossy, cheap-looking options are gone. Color choices include black, ivory, gray, dark blue, light blue, and red. (The latter three are a limited edition run in partnership with Pharrell Williams.)\n\nThe synthetic leather ear cushions have been redesigned \u201cafter extensive testing with users\u201d for a soft, comfortable, and secure fit on as many ears as possible. There\u2019s no more inner seam, and Beats increased their surface area by 70 percent \u2014 even though you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell by looking at them. Beats also paid close attention to the clamping force, allowing the Pros to be worn for hours without causing any head pain. That\u2019s the hope, anyway.\n\nBeats has also made a conscious effort to make the Solo Pros more sweat resistant. Solos were never pitched as workout headphones, but they\u2019ve become popular gym companions regardless. It\u2019s good to see Beats embrace this. The headphones are also pretty rugged; I saw them get twisted and contorted, but they didn\u2019t break or come away with any damage.\n\nNoise cancellation is activated with the press of a circular button at the bottom of the left ear cup, right where the 3.5mm line out used to be on previous Beats headphones. That\u2019s completely gone now. So if you want to use these headphones over a wired connection for higher-fidelity audio, you\u2019ll need to buy an adapter that plugs into the Lightning port. Not ideal. Beats has not been spared from Apple\u2019s phasing out of the headphone jack.\n\nBeats has brought its \u201cPure ANC\u201d adaptive noise cancellation technology from the Studio 3 Wireless headphones over to the Solo Pros. But since the Studios have an over-ear design, the company had to make some adjustments to tuning and its noise cancellation algorithms.\n\nPure ANC efficiently detects and blocks ambient noise \u2014 not only on an airplane, but also in a noisy caf\u00e9 or a busy office. Pure ANC also evaluates fit and adjusts for leakage caused by hair, earrings, different ear shapes, and movement of your head as you go about the day. Additionally, it simultaneously checks what you\u2019re hearing while noise canceling is applied against the original music content to ensure impressive audio fidelity.\n\nAccording to Beats, the Solo Pros take an audio snapshot of the acoustics of your environment and attempt to cancel out frequencies of common disturbances. Internal mics automatically adapt the effect if you\u2019re wearing glasses, earrings, or something else that might impact the fit of the headphones against your ears \u2014 even if that\u2019s just your hair. And then the headphones compare the noise-canceled waveform against the original file to optimize sound quality and make sure NC isn\u2019t introducing unwanted audio artifacts. This processing is possible because of Apple\u2019s H1 chip, which also allows for hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice commands and instant pairing with Apple devices. Another thing worth noting: the Beats Pro support the audio sharing feature introduced in iOS 13.1, letting you listen to the same music or movie / TV show as someone else wearing AirPods or the other Beats headphones that offer this feature.\n\nUnlike other headphone makers, including Bose and Microsoft, Beats doesn\u2019t let you adjust the level of noise cancellation on these headphones. It\u2019s either on or off. When ANC is enabled, the Solo Pros can hit up to 22 hours of battery life (on both iOS and Android). If you\u2019re somewhere quiet and don\u2019t need the noise-canceling feature, they can run for up to 40 hours on a charge. Unfortunately, the Solo Pro headphones still charge over Lightning instead of USB-C. But you know what? Anything\u2019s better than Micro USB. They still have the Fast Fuel feature, which provides three hours of battery life on a 10-minute charge.\n\nSince noise cancellation can be isolating, Beats also built a transparency mode into the Solo Pros. With another tap of that bottom button, you can hear your surroundings piped into the headphones clearly \u2014 and the company has tried to make that audio sound as natural as possible. These ambient modes can sometimes come off as tinny or overly processed, but Beats wants it to sound like you\u2019re not even wearing headphones when transparency mode is activated. (Bose had similar ambitions with its Noise Canceling Headphones 700.)\n\nAs for how they sound, Beats says the Solo Pros \u201cbuild upon Solo 3 Wireless\u2019 award-winning sound profile with an evolved acoustic platform to drive improved performance.\u201d They still have 40-millimeter drivers, but the company has reengineered them for \u201cexceptional frequency response with lower total harmonic distortion.\u201d I came away satisfied after a brief time testing them. Our review of the Solo 3s described Beats\u2019 modern sound signature as \u201cmore grown-up, restrained, and more tasteful now\u201d \u2014 and that remains true of the Solo Pros. They\u2019re a little warmer and more refined than their predecessors as well.\n\nBeats also says the two beam-forming microphones, which work in tandem with a speech-detecting accelerometer, result in excellent voice call quality, which has been another focus of competitors recently.\n\nAre these new Beats headphones worthy of the \u201cPro\u201d moniker just for adding noise cancellation and an improved build quality to the Solo 3 Wireless formula? Who knows. Maybe. Naming aside, I think those improvements \u2014 plus subtle improvements to fit and sound quality \u2014 will be enough to make them a hit. Pretty soon, these might be the new headphones you start seeing just about everywhere.\n\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge", "description": "Beats is introducing the $300 Solo Pro headphones, which add noise cancellation to the on-ear form factor shared by the company\u2019s long line of previous Solo headphones.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWu5Dt388xJyYldBeT03gcM8E-0=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19285431/cwelch_191001_3705_0004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
