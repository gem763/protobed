The organization now sells bands reading \u201chearts, not parts,\u201d along with the original slogan, as well as shirts, flags and pronoun pins to medical offices, universities and corporations such as Amazon and Spotify.\n\n\u201cWe are by trans, for trans, helping trans,\u201d Giles said.\n\nThe group opened an office in Orem this summer and hosted the state\u2019s first transgender Pride festival in September. The office\u2019s location was intentional, aimed at helping fill a local gap in services for transgender people.\n\n\u201cFor me, personally, it was that trans resources - or LGBTQ resources, period - are lacking seriously in Utah County,\u201d Giles said.\n\nCreating a space just for transgender people gives them a place to go where they can play games or watch a movie without having to worry about defending their identity or explaining their pronouns, Genderbands board member D Porter said.\n\nThe organization has awarded grants for six surgeries and plans to fund four in its next application cycle, which opens Nov. 1 and closes Dec. 31. The number of surgeries it funds every year depends on funds and donations.\n\nSo far, the group has only funded double mastectomies, also known as top surgery, for transmasculine people, but leaders are looking at expanding into transfeminine surgery grants.\n\nA double mastectomy averages from $6,000 to $10,000, and while many insurance companies cover the procedure, that\u2019s not an option for everyone, Giles said.\n\nAnd for Giles, the procedure has been life changing.\n\n\u201cI can go on hikes and take my shirt off,\u201d Giles said. \u201cI still fear discrimination and violence, but I am a lot more comfortable.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Herald, http://www.heraldextra.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A project that started as a way for one transgender person to pay for gender-confirmation surgery has grown into a Utah-based nonprofit helping others who can't afford the procedure.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/transgender_nonprofit_03782_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
