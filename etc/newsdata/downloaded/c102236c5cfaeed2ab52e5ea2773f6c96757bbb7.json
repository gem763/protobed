America is great again. We have record low unemployment, the market is doing amazing, we have exited endless foreign wars, and I\u2019ve stopped other countries like China from taking advantage of us in trade deals. We passed massive tax cuts and drug prices are down for the first time ever. I\u2019m not one of these lifetime politicians.
