He's not good enough,' said Carragher on Sky Sports.\n\n'If he's that good, he's got a year to go in his contract, you'd pay money for him. People keep saying maybe on a free transfer... you'd have anyone on a free transfer.\n\n'This summer he wanted to go, he made it known, he said it publicly, and no one came in for him.\n\n'I think Eriksen has been fantastic for Spurs but he's not better than Spurs. He might go to PSG, he might go to another club, but he won't make any of them better.'", "description": "With less than 12 months to run on his contract, it appears that the 27-year-old is nearing the end of his north London stay, but Carragher believes he  isn't good enough to seal the move he craves.", "authors": ["Harry Slavin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20276016-0-image-a-76_1572261649745.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
