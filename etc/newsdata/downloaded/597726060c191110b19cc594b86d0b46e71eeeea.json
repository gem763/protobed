Currently, only the names and job occupations of the bride and groom's fathers are listed.\n\nTherefore, the Duchess of York will become the first royal mother-of-the-bride to be listed on a wedding certificate.\n\nThe age-old law was altered earlier this year in order to allow opposite sex couples to enter into civil partnerships which were first introduced back in 2005 for same sex couples.\n\nNews of Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi's engagement was announced by Princess Eugenie via Instagram on Thursday (September 26).\n\nThe 29-year-old posted a series of photographs of the happy couple alongside a statement from the pair: \"We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement.\"\n\n\"We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can't wait to be actually married. We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will stand us in great stead for years ahead, full of love and happiness.\"\n\nThe engagement ring was handcrafted by British designer Shaun Leane at his atelier in Mayfair and co-designed by the groom.\n\nThe royal made her first public appearance with her now fianc\u00e9 in March at a gala at the National Portrait Gallery in London. The pair have been dating since last September, but have been friends for a number of years.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Her daughter is engaged to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi", "authors": ["Danielle Fowler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C4cpmV.Q4cHN.7c9UPGflA--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/fca24c3f054611176cfc464ae4b9b202", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
