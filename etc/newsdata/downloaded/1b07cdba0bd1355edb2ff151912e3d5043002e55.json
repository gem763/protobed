Schiff says he's 'flattered' by Trump's attacks over Ukraine inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump and Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and one of the Democrats\u2019 point people on impeachment, got into a war of words Thursday.\n\nMoments after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified about his handling of a whistleblower complaint against Trump, Schiff told reporters on Capitol Hill that it was \u201chard to imagine a more serious set of allegations than those contained in the complaint,\u201d which deals with the president\u2019s attempts to enlist the government of Ukraine in gathering damaging information about Joe Biden, his potential political rival.\n\nSchiff said his committee would continue to investigate the president through a 14-day recess scheduled to begin on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe need to look into the allegation that this may not be the only communication of a potentially corrupt character that was shielded by this classified information computer system, abused for that purpose,\u201d Schiff said, referring to allegations that records of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were sequestered on a super-secure server rather than the one ordinarily used for such purposes.\n\nRep.

I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. And I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have tried to keep the focus off the investigation, and public attention on the absence of an explicit quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky. Schiff\u2019s remarks indicate he believes the offer was implicit.\n\nDemocrats have also begun to make the argument that seeking help for his reelection from a foreign government is an impeachable offense by Trump, whether or not it was part of an explicit exchange.\n\nAs Schiff spoke to reporters, Trump took to Twitter, where he echoed the criticism from many Republicans that Schiff and the Democrats were concocting a story to damage his presidency.\n\nAdam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019\n\nSeconds after the tweet appeared, Schiff, who was still answering questions from reporters, was asked to respond to it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always flattered when I\u2019m attacked by someone of the president\u2019s character,\u201d Schiff responded.\n\nAs Schiff\u2019s exchange with the press concluded, the New York Times reported that Trump told staff members that he wanted to learn the identity of the person in his administration who provided whistleblower information about his call with Zelensky, saying that person was \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d Schiff, in turn, responded with a tweet of his own.\n\nThe President\u2019s suggestion that those involved in the whisteblower complaint should be dealt with as \"we used to do\" for \"spies and treason\" is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation.\n\n\n\nAll Americans must denounce such witness intimidation. https://t.co/cTQQXdbGsa \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 26, 2019\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the president engage in a war of words.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y0o_TxZtlosVC2FEVPVRHg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f7d2d620-e086-11e9-9fd7-79dd79b86b20", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
