We have an undertaking from his lawyer and family that he is receiving counselling and will continue with this course of therapy. We believe this is the most balanced way to deal with the situation.\"\n\nShe said that the clubs were shared spaces, and that they had taken action in accordance with the rules to make them safe.\n\n\"We cannot control the behaviour of individuals, but we can take action when their behaviour contravenes our rules. Our sanctions are applied uniformly, regardless of age, race or religion.\"\n\n\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Virgin Active has withdrawn its sexual assault complaint against a member who was filmed apparently masturbating at its Stellenbosch facility.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8907/d77564b6eab44a7d897b15f40b40314c.png", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
