Compressors pose a serious health risk, especially when in such close proximity to a dense residential area. There\u2019s also a history of catastrophic accidents at similar Compressors that could paralyze traffic, devastate our waterfront, and put residents at serious risk.\n\nPhillips was there to protest the construction of a natural gas compressor station. According to police, Phillips stood on the escalator with a large cloth protest sign that read \u201cTime to Escalate.\u201d At one point, police told Phillips that he would be arrested if he did not move off of the escalator. After he refused to comply, Phillips was arrested.\n\nA Facebook video captured the moment that Phillips was arrested by Boston police.\n\n\u201cOur hope was to highlight this issue and really put pressure on the DEP to do the right thing,\u201d one member of Phillips\u2019 protest group said in a comment, \u201cwhich is denying the remaining permits to protect this community from this toxic compressor station.\u201d\n\nIn a short interview with Campus Reform, Phillips said that he did not blame the police officers for doing their job.\n\n\u201cThey were doing their job. And they have a job to do. And I was breaking the law. They asked me to comply with them, and I declined,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI told them very clearly that \u2018I\u2019m choosing to remain here, and I\u2019m not going to move until you tell me that I\u2019m going to be arrested, but then I won\u2019t resist arrest.\u2019\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Boston University Professor Nathan Phillips was arrested last week during a climate change protest event.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boston-University-Environmental-Protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
