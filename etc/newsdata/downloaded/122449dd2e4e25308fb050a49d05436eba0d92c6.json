But we can see it and we will get there. \u2014 British PM Boris Johnson's Everest metaphor\n\nOne increasingly likely scenario, at this stage, is that the EU will give in-principle approval to a deal - if the two sides reach one - but won't fully commit unless Britain's parliament also does so. Mr Johnson will then convene his special Saturday sitting of parliament - still not set in stone - to get that approval.\n\nAfter that, the deal would either be inked at another special EU summit next week, or else Brexit would be delayed for two or three months to nut out the details.\n\nEvery one of those steps, however, is a pretty big hurdle to clear, both logistically and politically.\n\n\"The question is whether the negotiators will be able to bridge the remaining gaps in advance of tomorrow's [European] Council,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nArlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is critical to Mr Johnson's hopes of getting a deal through Britain's parliament, indicated on Twitter that her party hadn't yet signed up to Mr Johnson's deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support,\" she said.\n\nShe may be one of the few British politicians privy to the details. Mr Johnson called his cabinet together on Wednesday afternoon (early Thursday AEDT), but media reports suggested he didn't brief them on the deal - because it wasn't ready yet.\n\nHe then addressed a meeting of all Conservative Party MPs, but reportedly only to urge them to trust him and stay calm.\n\nThe Prime Minister reportedly used an Everest metaphor, telling his MPs: \"We are at the Hillary step and we can see the summit, but it is shrouded in cloud, but we can see it and we will get there.\"\n\nMost of his MPs are keeping their powder dry, even though two dozen or so hardcore eurosceptics will need plenty of persuading to accept a Brexit deal along the lines being leaked out piecemeal.\n\nMr Johnson will need the full support of all his own MPs, plus the 21 MPs he expelled from the Conservative Party, plus the DUP, plus at least a handful of Labour rebels.\n\nOpposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn has reportedly threatened to expel any MP who votes for Mr Johnson's deal, adding to the pressure on Saturday's special sitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParliament may complicate Mr Johnson's plans by making any approval of the deal conditional on holding a referendum to endorse it (with \"Remain\" as the other option).\n\nThe negotiations over the Irish border seem to have settled on the idea that Northern Ireland will be put in a kind of 'one country, two systems' arrangement: it would be a de facto part of the EU customs union and single market, but legally part of Britain.\n\nThis has complex consequences for tax, trade deals and enforcement, all of which are being frantically combed over in Brussels.\n\nThe DUP may or may not go along with this, but seems to be holding out even harder for a formal mechanism by which Northern Ireland can vote to escape this arrangement. Ms Foster's complaint is that Belfast would have no say over EU rules applying to the province.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson's push towards a Brexit deal, and/or his big-spending promises on health, police and education, seem to be doing him some good in the opinion polls.\n\nThe latest YouGov poll, issued on Wednesday, put his Conservative Party on 37 per cent, streets ahead of Mr Corbyn's Labour Party on 22 per cent and the europhile Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent. The Brexit Party has dropped to 11 per cent, and the Greens are on 5 per cent.\n\nMr Johnson wants to hold an election as soon as possible, hoping to convert the hopelessly hung parliament into a chamber with a solid Conservative majority. But he doesn't have the numbers in the House of Commons to pass a dissolution motion - at least not until Brexit is in some way resolved.", "description": "PM Boris Johnson is still scrabbling frantically for a deal that can pass the EU summit on Thursday and Britain's parliament on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2198%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_241%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e8797e8635b0c10e0ec3ebe428b738c3ae7e241b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
