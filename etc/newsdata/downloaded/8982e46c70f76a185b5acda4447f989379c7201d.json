The mission, which will be Ms Koch\u2019s fourth and Ms Meir\u2019s first, is expected to last five-and-a-half hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US space agency had originally planned an all-female spacewalk in March \u2013 which included Ms Koch and fellow astronaut Anne McClain \u2013 but had to cancel it because of a shortage of medium-size suits.\n\nSpacesuits are made of many interchangeable parts \u2013 designed to accommodate astronauts with widely varying body sizes. Body measurements of each astronaut are taken and plotted against the size ranges available for each spacesuit component. The suits are then assembled \u2013 usually four months prior to flight.\n\nAstronauts Christina Koch (left) and Jessica Meir (right) pose for their official Nasa portraits (Nasa)\n\nWhile there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\n\nThe scheduled spacewalk sees Ms Koch and Ms Meir venture outside the ISS wearing medium-size suits to replace the faulty device, known as the battery charge-discharge unit (BCDU), which has been in operation since 2000. It failed to activate after new lithium-ion batteries were installed on the space station last week.\n\nThere have been 227 spacewalkers since the first spacewalk in 1965. Only 14 women have performed spacewalks, always accompanied by men.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMs Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September. Both are members of Nasa\u2019s Astronaut Class of 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman \u2013 with an expected total of 328 days in space.\n\nGearing up for Friday\u2019s spacewalk to help the ground teams repair one of the battery channels with @Astro_Christina. . . . first spacesuit selfie, check!\u2714\ufe0f Photos will be much more spectacular once we pass through the hatch.
