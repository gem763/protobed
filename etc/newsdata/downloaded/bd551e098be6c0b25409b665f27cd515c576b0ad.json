Other times, one platform so thoroughly dominates the discussion that there\u2019s hardly anything else to talk about.\n\nThe past couple weeks have been the latter kind. And the company sucking up all the oxygen, of course, is Facebook.\n\nFrom the leaked all-hands audio promising to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d in a fight against a breakup of the company, to the controversy over the company\u2019s decision not to fact-check paid political advertising, to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s big speech about speech, Facebook has sat at the center of the conversation about tech and politics.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re growing a bit tired of that conversation, I regret to say that today doesn\u2019t look to be any different.\n\nFacebook came out of the gate this week with a suite of updates designed to bolster the company\u2019s defenses against election interference. The updates include new products, such as Facebook Protect, a set of enhanced security measures for the accounts of candidates and their campaign workers. It includes new labels for false content and for publishers whose governments have editorial control over them, such as Russia Today. And it includes new tools for understanding candidate ad spending, including a dedicated tracker for US presidential candidates and some new APIs for researchers.\n\nSeparately, the company announced that it has disrupted four new networks of shady accounts originating in Iran and Russia, bringing the total of deceptive networks it has eliminated to more than 50.\n\nThese are all good things, and Facebook sought to cast them on Monday as moves that only a company of its vast size and wealth could accomplish. From Mike Isaac\u2019s write-up of today\u2019s news (and accompanying press call) in the New York Times:\n\nIn his conference call on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook had become better able to seek out and remove foreign influence networks, relying on a team of former intelligence officials, digital forensics experts and investigative journalists. Facebook has more than 35,000 people working on its security initiatives, with an annual budget well into the billions of dollars. \u201cThree years ago, big tech companies like Facebook were essentially in denial about all of this,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at Graphika, a social media analytics agency. \u201cNow, they\u2019re actively hunting.\u201d\n\nI hope the company is successful in this hunt, and I\u2019m also unsettled that so much seems to rest on whether it is.\n\nElsewhere, Zuckerberg himself continues to absorb criticism from many corners. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s daughter Bernice didn\u2019t like his speech, or the mention of her father. Neither did the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Jillian C. York, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s director for international freedom of expression, said that talk of free speech amounted to \u201cempty words\u201d \u2014 and that exempting political ads from fact-checking had effectively created \u201ca separate and higher tier for those whose words have more power to harm than those of ordinary citizens.\u201d\n\nOne group that does seem to have been mollified by last week\u2019s speech? Conservatives, reports Will Oremus:\n\nThe conservative pundit Ben Shapiro called the Facebook chief\u2019s address \u201cquite good\u201d and his interpretation of free speech \u201cactually correct.\u201d The conspiracy-peddling men\u2019s rights activist and alt-right blogger Mike Cernovich praised it as \u201ca direct rejection of the media\u2019s demand for control over the minds of billions.\u201d House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, one of the right\u2019s most outspoken Facebook critics, found the speech \u201ca heartwarming reminder that free expression is the best business model in the world.\u201d\n\nIt has certainly been a good business model for Facebook.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Facebook introduced a bunch of tools to protect against election interference and broke up four networks of deceptive pages. All in all, a good Monday.\n\nTrending sideways: Zuckerberg recommended several hires to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign. Two of them are now on staff. The move has raised questions about whether Zuckerberg has tacitly endorsed Buttigieg. (Zuck says no.)\n\nTrending down: Google moved to cancel a talk about unionization at its office in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nTrending down: Anti-vaccination campaigns have continued to succeed on Facebook despite being officially banned.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 A G7 report warned that cryptocurrencies like Libra raise antitrust concerns and shouldn\u2019t be permitted until regulatory risks are addressed. These comments, from a group of major Western economies, mark yet another blow to Facebook\u2019s plans to launch its own global currency, according to Hannah Murphy at The Financial Times:\n\nThe creation of a global stablecoin could \u201clead to significant market concentration\u201d due to \u201cthe strong network effects that initially spurred their adoption, the large fixed costs needed to establish operations at scale and the exponential benefits of access to data\u201d, the report explained. This would be the case particularly if the currency was \u201cbased on a proprietary system, as this could be used to prohibit entry or increase barriers to entry to such system\u201d, it said.\n\nIn an attempt to quell some of these concerns, Facebook said it would consider releasing a family of stablecoins backed by various national currencies, rather than a synthetic stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies. David Marcus\u2019 concession here strikes me as the most serious sign yet that Libra is in trouble. (Andrea Shalal / Reuters)\n\nStill: central bankers are coming around to the idea of digital cash, thanks to Facebook\u2019s Libra. The cryptocurrency is seen as more viable than Bitcoin, since it is backed by real financial assets and has a built-in user base. (Alastair Marsh / Bloomberg)\n\nChina\u2019s planned cryptocurrency could have a serious advantage over Facebook\u2019s Libra: its ability to track and surveil users. Chinese consumers already pay for everything using their phones. Now, the government could have direct access to their financial information (Raymond Zhong / The New York Times)\n\nFacebook is working on an initiative to prevent minors from being groomed and exploited on its platforms after it introduces end-to-end encryption.

(Cecilia Kang and Mike Isaac / The New York Times)\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign is pouring resources into its digital operation, while Democrats lag behind.

(Bijan Stephen / The Verge)\n\nComparing China\u2019s efforts to shut down political protests in Hong Kong with India\u2019s attempts to quell unrest in Kashmir shows that flooding social channels with propaganda is likely more effective than shutting down the internet.

Among other things, he joked about protesters wearing masks that liken President Xi to Winnie the Pooh \u2014 a forbidden comparison in China. (Billie Thomson / The Daily Mail)\n\nRight-wing media outlets are gaming Google search results by creating tons of content related to popular search terms like \u201ccrisis actor\u201d and \u201ccollusion hoax.\u201d These terms then end up in conservative talking points and speeches, leading to an even more polarized internet. (Francesca Tripodi / Wired)\n\nA pro-independence group in Catalonia is leveraging Twitter and Telegram to organize massive protests and spread the word out about a new app they\u2019ve developed, exclusively for members and supports. Catalonia is a semi-autonomous region in Spain that\u2019s fighting for independence. (Laurie Clarke / Wired)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 A series of deaths at Amazon warehouses have sparked outrage from workers and their families. In September, a 48-year-old Amazon warehouse worker died from a heart attack at work. The company is now considered one of the most dangerous employers in the United States, according to Michael Sainato at The Guardian.\n\nThe incident is among the latest in a series of accidents and fatalities that have led to Amazon\u2019s inclusion on the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health\u2019s 2019 Dirty Dozen list of the most dangerous employers in the United States. The report cited six Amazon worker deaths between November 2018 and April 2019, and several news reports over the past few years that have detailed dangerous working conditions.\n\nTwitch is testing out a \u201cwatch party\u201d feature, which lets streamers screen Amazon Prime movies and shows that their followers can watch along with them (assuming they also have a subscription).

But if you want to keep it secret, you should never offer this much detail about it to someone profiling you in a magazine ... especially not if Ashley Feinberg is within earshot.\n\nNot all of his five sons have public Twitter accounts, and some of them, like the dreaded Tagg, have too many followers to possibly dig through. Romney\u2019s oldest grandchild, Allie Romney Critchlow, however, has just 481 followers, making digging through them an annoying-but-not-impossible feat. As I scrolled, while focusing on the ones that appeared to make an effort to conceal their real identities, one in particular caught my eye. Reader, meet Twitter user @qaws9876, otherwise known as Pierre Delecto.\n\nAsked about Feinberg\u2019s findings, Romney said only: \u201cC\u2019est moi.\u201d\n\nWhich is such a Pierre Delecto thing to say.\n\nTalk to us\n\nSend us tips, comments, questions, and free speech rants: casey@theverge.com and zoe@theverge.com.", "description": "It\u2019s disrupting deceptive networks and rolling out new products \u2014 but will they be enough?
