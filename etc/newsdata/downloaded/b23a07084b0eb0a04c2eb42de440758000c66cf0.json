His disability is only a small part of who he is \u2013 it doesn't hold him back,' she told FEMAIL.\n\nRecalling the horror of her son's accident, Kate said it had the potential to be fatal.\n\n'Knox's grandfather told him to sit and wait in the car while he finished mowing a short strip of grass, but he got scared and went behind the mower to speak to him - that's when he was inadvertently run over and trapped underneath,' she said.\n\n'The accident was nobody's fault, it was just one of those unfortunate things.'\n\nIncredibly, Knox's life was saved when his boot was forced off his foot and wedged in the blade.\n\nHe was rushed to the nearest hospital where doctors treated his arm along with deep lacerations and a fracture on his right leg.\n\nAfter four weeks in recovery, Kate was eager to ease Knox back into normal life as soon as possible, and steadily enrolled him in a variety of hobbies from swimming to representative rugby union.\n\nSince then, Knox has appeared in a variety of campaigns and TV programmes.\n\nHe was selected to cover the 2018 Invictus Games as a junior reporter for the ABC, and swam competitively for New South Wales in the 2019 School Sports Australia Championships earlier this year.\n\nKnox recently had a photo shoot with fellow amputee Harriet who lost her hand in a boating accident last year.\n\nEarlier this year, Knox swam in the 2019 School Sports Australia Championships and continues to play representative rugby union\n\nKnox recently posed for a photo shoot with fellow amputee Harriet (right) who lost her hand in a boating accident last year\n\nKnox (pictured with mum Kate) is passionate about challenging stereotypes about people with disabilities\n\nKate said Knox is passionate about raising awareness about young people with disabilities.\n\n'He thinks if kids are educated from a young age, it will make a huge difference,' she said.\n\n'People need to be aware of disability and talk about it - negative attitudes must be changed. People of all abilities should be celebrated!\n\n'Advertising should reflect the world we live in, and all forms of diversity should be represented. If more people with disabilities were included in advertising, it would challenge stereotypes and misconceptions about them,' she said.", "description": "Australian boy Knox Gibson's life changed forever when he lost half his arm in a freak lawnmower accident aged four.
