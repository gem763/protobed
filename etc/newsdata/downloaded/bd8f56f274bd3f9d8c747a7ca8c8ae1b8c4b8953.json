To qualify, each player must be started in at least 50 percent of Yahoo leagues. Speaking as an accountability advocate, I will post results, whether genius or moronic, the following week using the scoring system shown here (Thresholds \u2013 QB: 18 fpts, RB: 13 fpts, WR: 11 fpts, TE: 10 fpts). If you\u2019re a member of TEAM HUEVOS, reveal your Week 3 Lames in the comments section below.\n\nGoff may need multiple mulligans in Cleveland\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJared Goff, LAR, QB (56 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $31)\n\nMatchup: at Cle\n\nVegas Line/Total: LAR -3, 50\n\nThe antithesis of weaponless Miami, Los Angeles features an arsenal full of nukes \u2014 Brandin Cooks, Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods. Heck, even the ARTHRITIC KNEE!!!, Todd Gurley, has stiff-armed this loudmouth and performed admirably. Also operating behind a robust offensive line, Goff should be at least ranked inside the top-15.\n\nYet he\u2019s not remotely close.\n\nBut picking up where he unfortunately left off, the well-compensated passer hasn\u2019t earned his paycheck. Against average defenses, Carolina and New Orleans, he posted 234.5 pass yards per game, two total touchdowns and 7.0 yards per attempt. His QB19 ranking in adjusted completion percentage over that stretch is equally bland. Whether the increased pocket pressure (43.8% of dropbacks), defensive scheming, or both are to blame, Goff\u2019s days as a sure-fire QB1 are behind him, at least for now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis week, planted behind the likes of Jimmy Garoppolo (vs. Pit), Andy Dalton (at Buf) and Matthew Stafford (at Phi), Goff is undependable. CB Denzel Ward has been picked on (12-7-123-0 allowed), but his surrounding DBs have executed well. Collectively, the Browns have surrendered 8.1 pass yards per attempt. However, it\u2019s hard to imagine them getting buried in the doghouse for a second time at home.\n\nFearless Forecast: 254 passing yards, 1 passing touchdown, 1 interception, 13.2 fantasy points\n\nPatriots to walk all over injury-plagued Jets, Bell\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell, NYJ, RB (99 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $29)\n\nMatchup: at NE\n\nVegas Line/Total: NE -22.5, 43.5\n\nWrenched ankles. Immobilized legs. Mono. The rudderless Jets \u2014 warning signs flashing \u2014 are already hurtling toward the earth. Bell, exasperated after Monday\u2019s manhandling dished out by the Cleveland Browns, may already be mentally broken. Now awaits vaunted New England, a heavy favorite with zero weaknesses on either side of the ball. Bell is probably yearning for his \u201cfat\u201d days back on South Beach.\n\nThe pricey veteran has been worth every penny thus far. Outside of a costly fumble late against Cleveland, he\u2019s accumulated a mammoth workload, totaling an exhaustive 54 touches through two games. His superficial 3.4 yards per carry isn\u2019t pretty, but he\u2019s avoided a league-high 20 tackles, scored once and piled up 3.08 yards after initial contact. For all intents and purposes, he\u2019s a proven commodity trapped in an otherwise polluted situation. Still, those who selected him in Round 1 have to be pleased with the early results, unlike the overexcited dude in your league who boastfully drafted James Conner.\n\nBell\u2019s workload will remain exhaustive, which bodes well for him to sustain long-term RB1 value. This week, however, Bell will be on the short end of a lopsided war. The Patriots, thanks in large part to the run-snuffing play of LBs Jamie Collins and Dont\u2019a Hightower, have allowed just 2.6 yards per carry to RBs. Bell is sure to work up a lather as a receiver in a game with a 22.5-POINT SPREAD, but he may need a ridiculous amount of touches to sniff 100 combined yards.\n\nFearless Forecast: 18 carries, 58 rushing yards, 6 receptions, 35 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 12.3 fantasy points\n\nMixon to find little operating space in Buffalo\n\nJoe Mixon, Cin, RB (67 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $19)\n\nMatchup: at Buf\n\nVegas Line/Total: Buf -6, 44\n\nA football field on fire (e.g. Nissan Field) \u2014 that\u2019s the perfect analogy for how Mixon\u2019s 2019 has started. For fantasy players who sank high draft capital into the supposed workhorse back, they\u2019re hopeful the raging inferno will be quickly smothered with more than a Home Depot extinguisher. Optimism, however, isn\u2019t hanging in the air.\n\nJoe Mixon, a popular Round 2 pick just weeks ago, has dragged down all who have trusted him through two games. (Photo by Ian Johnson/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nMixon is a talented rusher with the patience, vision, and versatility to regain value loss. But his dismal analytics profile and a leaky offensive line, a unit which lost starting left guard Michael Jordan to a knee injury last week, substantially reduce his rebound potential. Cincinnati\u2019s unsparing defense and a garden-variety ankle sprain have only exacerbated the rusher\u2019s problems.\n\nThough it\u2019s allowed 4.6 yards per carry to RBs, Buffalo is an under-appreciated defensive squad. Le\u2019Veon and Saquon Barkley compiled banner weeks against the Bills, but the front boasts above-average personnel. DEs Jerry Hughes and Shaq Lawson have done a laudable job stamping out the run, each posting a run-stop percentage of 10.0-plus per Pro Football Focus. Bypassing him for Matt Breida (vs. Pit), Carlos Hyde (at LAC) or Royce Freeman (at GB) isn\u2019t reckless.\n\nFearless Forecast: 15 carries, 47 rushing yards, 3 receptions, 14 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 7.6 fantasy points\n\nAdams to pack it in against Denver, Harris\n\nDavante Adams, GB, WR (98 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $30)\n\nMatchup: vs. Den\n\nVegas Line/Total: GB -8, 42.5\n\nTough early season scheduling combined with underperformance usually cranks the absurdity dial in Fantasyland. Take Adams, for instance. Blessed with unwanted encounters with the Bears and Vikings Weeks 1-2, the fantasy first-rounder fell into a snake pit, hauling in 11 catches for 142 yards and zero touchdowns. It\u2019s understandable production given the competition, but for individuals with no time for mediocrity or possessing the foresight for better days, the receiver was traded off for the likes of John Ross, Tom Brady, and Mark Andrews. Yes, for real.\n\nAfter this week, bargain shoppers will be able to acquire him for a six-pack of Schlitz.\n\nIt\u2019s another difficult mano-a-mano matchup for one of the game\u2019s premier producers. Chris Harris, who did a brilliant job shadowing Allen Robinson last week (4 TGTs, 2-13-0 allowed), is likely to chase the All-Pro receiver. Through two games, the DB has conceded only 0.87 yards per snap and 47 yards on five receptions. Adams will presumably lure his customary 7-10 targets, but another unremarkable output could be on tap.\n\nFearless Forecast: 5 receptions, 67 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 9.2 fantasy points\n\nBrowns\u2019 Landry unlikely to be unleashed against Rams\n\nJarvis Landry, Cle, WR (50 percent started; Yahoo DFS: $17)\n\nMatchup: vs. LAR\n\nVegas Line/Total: LAR -3, 50\n\nIf you would\u2019ve told me only a few weeks back that Baker Mayfield would be QB19 through tilts against Tennessee and the Jets, my face would\u2019ve resembled Odell Beckham\u2019s when asked a post-game question in espa\u00f1ol. Given the upgraded weapons, play-calling continuity, and experienced gained, Mayfield\u2019s sluggish start is nothing shy of mystifying. His bendable offensive line is a culprit (28.6 sack%), but his ineffectiveness under pressure (40.4 passer rating) and general decline across the board (QB28 in adjusted completion percentage) are alarming.\n\nTo help deflect persistent incoming heat, Mayfield needs to get Landry more involved underneath. Barely a footnote through two weeks, the slot man has caught just seven passes (on 14 targets) for 99 yards. The end zone, painfully so, also remains elusive, a failure which is sure to endure.\n\nLandry\u2019s matchup this week isn\u2019t the friendliest. His slot assignment, Nickell Robey-Coleman, is one of the best interior defenders in the biz. Targeted six times through two games, he\u2019s allowed a 76.4 passer rating and 0.43 yards per snap to his assignments. You can do better.\n\nFearless Forecast: 4 receptions, 39 receiving yards, 0 touchdowns, 5.9 fantasy points\n\nBONUS LAMES (Over 50% started)\n\nRB: Kerryon Johnson, Det (Phi -7; $18) \u2013 Matt Patricia needs to put his stupid pencil to use. It\u2019s criminal how underused Johnson is. He\u2019s played on 56.9 percent of Detroit\u2019s snaps, netting 56.9 percent of the opportunity share. It\u2019s baffling. Deceptively powerful, smooth in his cuts and multidimensional, he\u2019s forced a missed tackle on 25.0 percent of his early season touches. He deserves 18-20 grips per game, yet Darrell Bevell and Patricia blindly trot out Ty Johnson or some other deadbeat. On what will surely be another 15 or so touches, Kerryon is a fringy RB2. His opponent, Philadelphia, has conceded only 2.9 yards per carry to RBs. Feed the man. (FF: 13-43-2-25-0, 8.8 fpts)\n\nRB: Leonard Fournette, Jax (Ten -1.5; $18) \u2013 Not even the facial/chest hair powers of Gardner Minshew can rescue Fournette from wallowing in mediocrity. Averaging a somewhat useful 90.5 total yards per game, the constant underachiever has yet to cross the chalk and has netted a sad 2.36 yards after contact per attempt. Tennessee is an overlooked defense which has taken opponents to task in the early season. The Titans have given up 5.1 yards per carry to RBs, but that number was largely inflated by a breakout run from Jordan Wilkins. In a hideous low-scoring affair, Fournette is more FLEX than must-start RB2. (FF: 14-49-4-23-0, 9.2 fpts)\n\nRB: James Conner, Pit (SF -6.5; $28) \u2013 The rusher claims he\u2019s \u201cgood to go\u201d for this week\u2019s contest against unblemished San Francisco, but it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s must-start material. Thus far Conner has seen a stacked front 38.1 percent of the time, the third-highest mark among RBs. Mason Rudolph is a capable backup, but that number could increase if the Steelers\u2019 passing attack deteriorates. Early on, the Niners have given up 3.5 yards per carry to RBs. Banged up and inefficient through two games (2.14 YAC/att), he\u2019s a middle RB2 at best. It\u2019s possible this week Jaylen Samuels and Benny Snell become more involved. (FF: 13-46-3-12-0, 7.3 fpts)\n\nTE: Jared Cook, NO (Sea -4.5; $13) \u2013 Going from Drew Brees to Teddy Bridgewater isn\u2019t a step-down, it\u2019s equivalent to tumbling down an entire flight of stairs. The promoted backup is essentially a game manager and not much more. His 7.2 pass yards per attempt and mostly pedestrian numbers as the starter in Minnesota state the case. C.J. Uzomah and Vance McDonald logged success against Seattle, but given the upheaval at QB, it\u2019s unlikely Cook finishes inside the position\u2019s top-12 this week. (FF: 4-46-0, 6.6 fpts)\n\nDST: Jacksonville (Ten -1.5; $11) \u2013 Is this a showcase game for CB Jalen Ramsey? Disgruntled over Doug Marrone\u2019s bullheaded want to zone, the elite corner could soon be on a one-way ticket out of Jacksonville. How motivated he performs is anyone\u2019s best guess, but already burned for two TDs this year, he is indeed likely being misused. Throw in A.J. Bouye\u2019s questionable status, the Jags\u2019 struggles containing the run, and their zero turnovers forced in two games, it smudges what appears to be an exploitable matchup. (FF: 17 PA, 365 YDSA, 2 SCK, 0 TO, 4.0 fpts)\n\n#TEAMHUEVOS PICKS OF THE WEEK\n\nEach week one fortunate guest prognosticator will have a chance to silence the Noise.
