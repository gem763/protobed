Checks in 2019 are as much as 18% lower due to the impact of \"extremely low COLAs\" over the past decade.\n\nOverall, the group says Social Security benefits have lost 33 % of their buying power since 2000.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe cost of living adjustment for 2018 was 2%, but it was largely perceived to be offset by increases in Medicare costs.\n\nThere was a 0.3% increase in 2017 and no adjustment the year prior.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe benefit increase will begin for Social Security beneficiaries in January and for Supplement Security Income recipients on Dec. 31.", "description": "For a recipient earning the average monthly benefit, checks will increase by about $23.54 per month in 2020.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/retirement-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
