Trump\u2019s former Press Secretary and White House Communications Director slid into an adult-sized cow print vest and slid across the dance floor with partner Lindsay Arnold in some fabric boots during Dancing With The Stars\u2019 Disney-themed show. And truly, what other moment have we as a nation been hurtling toward, if not this one?\n\nSpicer and Arnold hoofed it to a cover of (what else?) Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend In Me.\u201d While normal human eyes might find his dancing abilities lacking, tonight marks the first time President Trump has explicitly tweeted for the American people to vote for Sean Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, so he\u2019ll probably stick around for a while. Definitely seems like there should be a rule against a sitting President calling for the nation to take action, but once again, our Constitution fails us. Either way, no matter how politically divided the country might be, at least we can all agree on one thing: Sean Spicer did not deserve a 7 for that dance. Are the judges kidding us? Have they lost their sweet minds?", "description": "Former Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer dressed as Toy Story cowboy Wood while appearing on Dancing With The Stars.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/14-Sean-Spicer-Toy-Story-DWTS.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
