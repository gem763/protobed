Nobody is bigger than the club. There should be both a humbleness and an arrogance.\n\n\"Ole has brought a lot of the discipline back. Whatever manager we have has to buy into that philosophy and Ole is a walking, talking version of that. Let's play this out with Ole in terms of the cultural reboot.\n\n\u201cIt [appointing Solskjaer permanently] wasn't pivotal to it [finishing top four] one way or another. I want to take a long-term view \u2014 Ole was hired with the long-term view that he will be successful.\"\n\nWoodward also pointed to winning the Premier League as United's primary aim - with any success on the continent a bonus.\n\n\u201cWe have to win the Premier League,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI view the Premier League as the focus, that's the biggest test, the benchmark. You can roll a dice in the Champions League, you need luck to win that, but we have to win the Premier League.\n\n\u201cWe need to do well commercially to do well on the pitch, we also need to spend what we get more consistently than we have been doing, but we're on much firmer ground with recruitment.\n\n\u201cI understand the scrutiny; it's part of the job. We have to do everything we possibly can to get back to winning the Premier League. We're not successful until we do. Second is not success - we have to win the Premier League.\n\n\u201cDespite some of the narrative around the club at the moment, I feel that we are on the right track to get back to that point [winning the league] but we are going to have to be patient.\u201d", "description": "The Red Devils chief insists the current Old Trafford boss is the right man to implement the club's long-term vision", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671865.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-FBL-ENG-MAN-UTD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
