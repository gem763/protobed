The department argued that if the grand jury testimony is released to the House Judiciary Committee, it \"cannot be recalled, and the confidentiality of the grand jury information will be lost for all time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wasn't a surprise to most observers, though it has been argued that the White House may be overreaching.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell initially ruled Friday that the Justice Department was required to produce the material because it could contain evidence that affects the impeachment inquiry. In her ruling, she noted the White House's refusal to comply with the investigation only strengthened the Democrats' impeachment arguments.\n\nThe Justice Department also asks for a stay of the order in part because the House could, with a simple majority vote, decide to publicize the grand jury materials. pic.twitter.com/ClRqIObbRK \u2014 Todd Ruger (@ToddRuger) October 28, 2019", "description": "As expected, the Justice Department is appealing a federal judge's order that the department must hand over previously withheld grand jury evidence from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference by Oct. 30, as the House conducts its impeachment", "authors": ["Tim O'Donnell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
