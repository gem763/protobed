While there are some pushing for heavy-handed government regulation, there\u2019s evidence the market is working and social media companies are responding.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, along with its multimedia news outlet The Daily Signal, has a significant presence on all of the major social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. These platforms have helped Heritage reach millions of people across the globe with its timely policy research and analysis on conservative public policy issues.\n\nHeritage\u2019s digital leadership was recently recognized by the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, which ranked The Heritage Foundation as the No. 1 think tank for \u201cBest Use of the Internet\u201d in its annual \u201cGlobal Go-To Think Tank Index.\u201d The index is the largest, most comprehensive database of more than 8,100 think tanks globally, and ranks them in multiple categories. According to the index, 3,750 journalists, policymakers, public and private donors, and functional- and regional-area specialists participate in the process.\n\nFounded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is the nation\u2019s most broadly supported public policy research institute, with more than a half-million members. Its mission is to develop and promote public policy solutions that advance free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional values, and a strong national defense.", "description": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Several leaders from The Heritage Foundation will attend this week\u2019s White House Social Media Summit with President Donald Trump.
