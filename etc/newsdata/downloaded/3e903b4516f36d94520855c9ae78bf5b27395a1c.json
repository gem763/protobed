He received medical treatment and continued.\n\nWales pressed for an equaliser and Bale claimed it in injury time.\n\nTottenham defender Ben Davies beat Mateo Kovacic and found Bale inside the box who cooly placed his shot across Livakovic for his 33rd international goal.\n\nBarcelona playmaker Ivan Rakitic replaced Kovacic for the second half.\n\nWales forward Kieffer Moore, who scored on his international debut in the midweek draw at Slovakia, caused Croatia\u2019s defence trouble in the air throughout.\n\nThe only negative came on 57 minutes after he was shown a yellow card for a challenge on Liverpool centre-back Dejan Lovren.\n\nBale\u2019s Real teammate Luka Modric was substituted due to injury with a leg problem while the Welsh winger himself seemed to struggle through the closing moments with an issue himself.\n\nThe draw leaves Wales\u2019 qualifying destiny out of their own hands heading into the final two rounds of games next month.\n\nBut wins away to Azerbaijan and at home to Hungary would be enough for a top-two spot, as long as Slovakia do not beat Croatia.", "description": "Cardiff (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Gareth Bale claimed a point for Wales as they drew 1-1 with World Cup runners-up Croatia on Sunday which left their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/cf6e80_gareth-bale-scored-his-33rd-wales-goal-as-drew-croatia-bale-on-target-as-wales-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
