Georgia have a reputation for being fierce scrummagers \u2013 Eddie Jones brought the side in to train against England\u2019s forwards during the last Six Nations \u2013 and will no doubt look to target Welsh vulnerabilities in this area. Still, with an abundance of talent at their disposal and a world-class mentality to match, this has got a Wales win written all over it.", "description": "Wales\u00a0open their Rugby World Cup campaign against Georgia\u00a0on Monday, with Warren Gatland\u2019s men eager to make the strongest possible start to the competition.
