[exposing] serial abusers and a cabal of powerful interests hell-bent on covering up the truth, at any cost.\"\n\nHowever, ahead of its release, The Daily Beast reported reported Dylan Howard -- a former top editor for the National Enquirer -- has attempted to have the book quashed in court, and is also allegedly warning booksellers against stocking the expose.\n\nIn response to the alleged threat, a person close to Farrow told Fox News they are \"confident in the facts Ronan has asserted in the book.\"\n\nMSNBC'S MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY\n\nCiting \u201ctwo knowledgeable sources,\u201d the Beast reported on Wednesday that Howard has retained high-powered law firms on three continents \u201cin an apparent campaign to suppress Farrow\u2019s book.\u201d The report indicates that Farrow\u2019s book is expected to detail the Enquirer\u2019s efforts to \u201cpurchase and suppress damaging stories,\u201d but Howard hopes the book never sees the light of day.\n\nFamed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told the Beast that Howard\u2019s efforts to mute Farrow\u2019s book are \u201cunlikely to succeed in the U.S., where First Amendment protections are robust and judicial precedent frowns on prior restraint\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s another story\u201d in countries with more libel-friendly laws \u2013 which is why firms such as Kravet & Vogel in New York, the Tweed firm in London, and McLachlan Thorpe Partners in Sydney, Australia have been enlisted by Howard.\n\nIt appears Howard wants to silence Farrow wherever possible, but the source close to the author doesn\u2019t feel the legal action will amount to much.\n\n\"Mr. Howard\u2019s threats will not deter good journalism,\" the source close to Farrow added.\n\nThe official website of publisher Little, Brown still lists the scheduled release date of Oct. 15 for \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nFarrow, Howard and the National Enquirer did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.\n\nHoward isn\u2019t the only media honcho apparently dreading the book that is expected to expose the tactic of burying damaging stories. In 2017, Farrow -- who worked at NBC at the time -- was one of the prominent journalists who exposed the serial predation of now-disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose downfall helped ignite the #MeToo movement.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nFarrow drew a lot of attention for publishing his work in The New Yorker instead of with his then-employer NBC News. The Peacock Network has long claimed that Farrow\u2019s reporting, as presented to them, was not up to snuff but the celebrity scion\u2019s work ultimately appeared in the New Yorker and won the coveted Pulitzer Prize -- but Farrow is expected to tell his side of the story in \"Catch and Kill.\"\n\nCritics have long pondered if NBC didn\u2019t expose Weinstein because the the network was aware of former \u201cToday\u201d co-host Matt Lauer\u2019s own sexual-misconduct issues. Lauer was fired by NBC weeks after Farrow\u2019s reporting on Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cThe question of Lauer\u2019s improprieties looms large over NBC\u2019s editorial decision to pass on Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Vanity Fair wrote in a 2017 story headlined, \"Everybody Knew.\"\n\nSeveral industry insiders have told Fox News that many NBC employees are bracing for a slew of negative headlines they expect to come from Farrow\u2019s closely guarded book. Rich McHugh, a former producer at NBC News who worked directly with Farrow, told Fox News in 2018 that he faced resistance from \"the very highest levels at NBC\" when it came to reporting Weinstein\u2019s misconduct.\n\nThe New York Post reported last month that Farrow\u2019s book will include \u201cfresh claims of sexual harassment\u201d against Lauer. The Daily Beast also reported that Lauer has also lawyered up as the release date for \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d approaches.\n\nLittle, Brown did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Ronan Farrow plans to go ahead with the publication of his latest expose detailing allegations of misconduct from powerful Hollywood and media figures, despite threats from an ex-National Enquirer editor, a source close to the author told Fox News.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
