Now all five of us sleep in here.\u201d Ikram Ullah gestures into a room on the ground floor of a shared house in East Ham. A single and double bed wedged together cover most of the floor. His baby son\u2019s cot, along with a wardrobe and a chest of drawers, cram into the remaining space.\n\nThe 42-year-old\u2019s daughters, aged five and four, huddle together at the end of the bed playing games on an iPad. His four-month-old son sleeps soundly in his cot. Noreen, Ikram\u2019s wife, perches on the edge of the bed, apologising profusely that she can\u2019t even offer to make a cup of tea.\n\nJust over a year ago, the family had been renting the whole house. Having lived in Britain for a decade, Ikram owned his own business selling cars and was generating an annual turnover of \u00a3160,000. His UK-born daughters had their own bedrooms. The couple were looking to buy a home, and were excited to be expecting their third child.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut their lives were transformed when, in 2018, Ikram\u2019s application for indefinite leave to remain was refused due to minor amendments to his tax records. He was stripped of his right to work, leaving the family with no income. As the months went on, they had to sell the children\u2019s toys, and eventually scale down to renting just a single room \u2013 just to be able to eat.\n\n\u201cMy kids are suffering,\u201d says Ikram. \u201cI can\u2019t buy food for them. I go to Tesco after 4pm and buy reduced expired food, which I\u2019ve never done before. I used to buy a lot of things for them before 2018. But then I had to start selling. I sold all of their toys so that I could feed them.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

They prance around on the two beds and excitedly exhibit the few toys and possessions they have been able to keep, speaking in perfect English as they show off their drawings on the wall. But their father says they are beginning to understand what is happening.\n\nThe Ullah family has the support of their local MP, who has tried to raise their case with the Home Office a number of times, but received no meaningful reply. Stephen Timms, of the Labour Party, said the family\u2019s suffering was \u201cunquestionably\u201d part of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr Ullah has been refused leave to remain because he once made a correction to his tax affairs, which thousands of people do every year, and it\u2019s done and it\u2019s finished and that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d the MP said.\n\n\u201cBut the Home Office has dug that out and is now using it as a basis of refusing what otherwise would be his permission to carry on living and working in the UK.\n\n\u201cIt is a very, very hostile environment that\u2019s been created for people who are simply earning a living, contributing to the economy, getting on with their lives.\u201d\n\nIkram says the family will be eating the plain bread of what is meant to be a pizza base for dinner. He gets out a plastic bag of the flat breads, which he explains were given to him for free by the local pizza takeaway owner.\n\n\u201cWe are not criminals. I thought the UK was known for human rights, but I look at my kids in this situation and I feel like they are treated worse than animals. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI have been the target of this hostility and my children are paying the price each and every minute of their lives. I live with this every day and I am hopeful to get justice one day.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAn appeal has been lodged in this case and is pending. It would therefore be inappropriate to comment at this time.\u201d\n\nYou can donate towards helping Ikram and his family here.", "description": "\u201cThis used to be my children\u2019s toy room.
