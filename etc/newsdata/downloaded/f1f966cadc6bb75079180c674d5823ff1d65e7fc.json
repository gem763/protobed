Now, at 25, the musician has won This is Money's fantasy share picking game\n\nAs a teenager Anthony Pepler took part in a student investor challenge and his school team reached the regional final.\n\nIt gave him the bug for investing and he decided he\u2019d like to start buying shares for real.\n\n\u2018So I walked into the bank as a 16-year-old to see if I could\u2019, he says.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, it didn't work out. They said: \"This request is most irregular,\" and told me to come back when I was 18. I thought about it and said \u201calright then I'll return in a few years\u201d.\u2019\n\nAt the age of 18 he returned and bought his first shares - now seven years later, the 25-year-old musician and composer, has won This is Money\u2019s Fantasy Share Picking game.\n\nAnthony, of Bournemouth, Dorset, scooped the \u00a320,000 jackpot after topping the league in our 12 week-long game, run in partnership with Fidelity, and celebrating This is Money\u2019s 20th anniversary.\n\nHe joins the 12 weekly winners who scooped \u00a3500 prizes for the best performing fresh share pick each week.\n\nAmong them, we had a family who were all playing against each other and saw mum, dad and son manage to score a best share pick of the week (and those all-important bragging rights); the player who won thanks to early-bird share picking at 6.37am on a Saturday, and another who said: \u2018I\u2019ve never had shares or considered it but saw the competition and thought I\u2019d give it a go.\u2019\n\nIn the game, playing under the name BigTradeBull, our overall winner Anthony adopted a high frequency buying and selling tactics that delivered a cumulative performance figure of 1,336 per cent.\n\nIn his real life investing he takes an in-depth approach, looking at both the big picture of what is going on in the world and zooming in on individual company details.\n\nHe says: \u2018Mostly, I spend my days working on music late into the night. This gives me a good opportunity to scour the market checking up on stock indexes and commodity prices to see what's going on while I work.\n\n\u2018I find it to be the quickest way to get to know if something is going on in the world as every price tells a story.\u2019\n\nWhen looking at individual shares, he uses a combination of technical analysis and charting, along with investigating a company\u2019s fundamentals and results, to look for undervalued stocks and any potential catalyst for a rise in the share price.\n\nThe tools he taps into include the range a share price has been trading between, the volume of trades, indicators such as the relative strength index \u2013 and whether directors have been buying or selling stock in the company they work for.\n\nTo investigate companies\u2019 finances, he reads through recent years\u2019 results and RNS releases and checks for solid, well-run businesses that are exceeding market expectations.\n\nAnthony also says that he has tried to draw an influence from the writings of the world\u2019s famous investors and traders.\n\nHe says: \u2018Most of my decisions made when I'm looking for a particular stock or investment are based around the lessons of Jesse Livermore, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett.\n\n\u2018Livermore when looking for growth and momentum, and Graham and Buffet when searching for value.\n\n\u2018Combining the two groups I look to come up with a combined set of data showing the technical and fundamental merits of each pick.\u2019\n\nOne of the toughest things for any investor is knowing when to cash in your gains, or cut your losses, and Anthony says he makes the call based on whether he originally invested for high growth or value.\n\nWith a high-growth momentum investment he looks to sell if the trend falls away, but if it is a value opportunity he is more patient.\n\n\u2018Selling is a lot harder than buying. I think human emotion plays a bigger part here if it's allowed to\u2019, he says.\n\n\u2018When it comes to value investing, I'll have done a lot of research to try and understand why the stocks trading cheaply. As a result, I'm willing to tolerate a bit more volatility before eventually selling. For this type I set a target which I think represents fair value.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Thanks for holding the game, it's been a brilliant opportunity and a lot of fun.\u2019\n\nThis was a short-term game, but to grow your wealth think long-term\n\nThroughout the fantasy share picking game, players could get the lowdown on what was going in the markets and some pointers on the companies reporting that week from Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director, at Fidelity Personal Investing, in her weekly Stock Watch videos.\n\nWe asked Emma-Lou what investors could learn from the share picking game, which ran over a short period, whereas investing should be a long-term endeavour.\n\nEmma-Lou said: \u2018When it comes to timing we certainly picked an incredibly volatile period in which to run this game, with political and economic uncertainty of the like we haven\u2019t seen for many years.\n\nIndeed that level of uncertainty will have been enough to put many people off investing, but as the winners show, out of adversity came great opportunity.\n\n\u2018This was a short-term game and we know that the best way to really grow your money is through long-term investment in the stock market. But if you look at what can be achieved, even over a very short period of time, and during one of the most turbulent economic and political periods in recent times, then that should be heartening for all investors - whether novice or battle worn.\n\n\u2018Looking at the winning portfolios, two other key takeaways also emerged. The first is that as we always bang on about, diversification is a great way to ride out the inevitable volatility that you will encounter as an investor in the stock market.\n\n\u2018Having a varied range of investments means that when you have a losing stock or two in your portfolio, you\u2019ll also more than likely to have some winners.\n\n\u2018The second is that backing a hunch can pay off. Fortune favours the bold, or so we\u2019re told, and sometimes sticking to your guns, even in the face of what looks like adversity, can pay dividends.\u2019", "description": "As a teenager Anthony Pepler took part in a student investor challenge that got him hooked on the stockmarket, now he has won the \u00a320,000 in our share picking game.", "authors": ["Simon Lambert For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
