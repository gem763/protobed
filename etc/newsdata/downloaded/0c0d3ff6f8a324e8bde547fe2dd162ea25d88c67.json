CGC, -8.51% , WEED, -8.71% that gives that company the right to buy Acreage as soon as cannabis restrictions in the U.S. have been lifted.\n\nSee also: Canopy Growth\u2019s remaining CEO talks about pot company\u2019s shake-up, and the search for his replacement\n\nThe analyst assigned a C$23 ($17.26) stock price target to Green Thumb.\n\n\u201cWe like management\u2019s focused strategy on executing in markets where the company believes it has a strategic advantage, as demonstrated by its strong positioning in markets such as Pennsylvania and Nevada,\u201d Grey wrote. \u201cIn addition to strong top-line trends, the business model has now inflected to profitability, which margins we expect to expand as the company scales the business.\u201d\n\nRead now: Aurora Cannabis stock sinks after analyst says it\u2019s time to \u2018sell\u2019\n\nGreen Thumb reported margins of 52% in the second quarter, a 580 basis point improvement over the year-earlier period. The company is expecting to maintain margins above 50% in the future and is targeting EBITDA margins \u2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 of 25% to 30%, said Grey.\n\nCannabis Watch: For all of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nThe analyst placed an $8 price target on GrowGeneration, which he views as an attractive ancillary play in the industry as a hydroponics retailer in the U.S. with a strong top-line story. The company is on track to double revenue for a fourth straight year through organic store growth and tuck-in acquisitions.\n\nRead: Wall Street\u2019s latest billion-dollar pot company had a half-ton of bad weed returned as it was going public\n\n\u201cWhat is more, with GrowGeneration\u2019s 9% EBITDA margin in the second quarter, we believe the company has proven its ability to grow the business while generating profit, with further margin enhancement opportunity via gross margins (private label opportunity) and SG&A (scale and ERP (enterprise resource planning) system).\u201d\n\nRead now: This woman in cannabis made an early bet on the sector that has paid off\n\nGrey placed a C$26 price target on Village Farms, describing it as an attractive investment opportunity as a leading cultivator in the Canadian market via its joint venture Pure SunFarms.\n\n\u201cHaving demonstrated its ability to grow at scale the past two quarters, while putting up best in class margins \u2013 we believe VFF will benefit from the growing Canadian market (which market estimates we take up herein), particularly with the recent receipt of its packaging license,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAdditionally, we see the US CBD/Hemp opportunity as upside to our numbers.\u201d\n\nThe ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -1.75% was last down 0.6%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% was up 0.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.19% was up 0.1%.", "description": "Alliance Global Partners initiated coverage of four cannabis companies on Thursday and assigned a buy rating to all four stocks, namely Acreage Holdings...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD346_Cannab_ZG_20190205111347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
