Former Presidents Obama and Clinton joined other top Democrats to eulogize Cummings, who died on Oct. 17 at the age of 68.\n\nTrump has offered praise for Cummings following his death, though the president had a decidedly rocky relationship with the Democratic lawmaker until shortly before he died. Cummings chaired the House Oversight and Reform Committee and was a key figure in sprawling congressional investigations into the president and his administration.\n\nThe president lashed out at Cummings over the summer, accusing the top Democrat of neglecting his home district, which includes much of Baltimore. Trump described the majority-African American city as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,\u201d remarks that drew accusations of racism.\n\nTrump offered praise for Cummings the day of his death and ordered that flags at the White House and on all U.S. public grounds and military posts be flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for his memory and public service.\n\nThe president's remarks at the historically black college on Friday came days after he withstood broad criticism for comparing House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nTrump used his remarks Friday to tout his administration\u2019s achievements for African Americans, noting his efforts on criminal justice reform and the record-low unemployment rate among African Americans.", "description": "President Trump offered his \u201cwarmest respects\u201d to the family and friends of the late Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldhbcu_102519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
