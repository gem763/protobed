Trump should be investigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\" Biden told reporters in Des Moines shortly after arriving at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual Democratic fundraiser. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. And he\u2019s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me ... Ask the right questions.\u201d\n\nThe comments by the former vice president are the latest in a back-and-forth between Biden and Trump related to Trump's reported discussions with the Ukrainian president, a whistleblower complaint involving Trump, and Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nExplaining the Trump, Biden, Ukraine story: What to know about the Trump-Congress standoff over a whistleblower complaint\n\nMultiple news outlets reported this week that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing that community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader.\n\nLawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.\n\nFormer Vice-President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden arrives for the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in Water Works Park on Saturday, Sept. 21, 2019 in Des Moines. More\n\nHunter Biden, however, told the New Yorker in an interview for an article published in July that he discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas producer, with his father in December 2015. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on Burisma\u2018s board of directors.\n\nAround the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue with the Vice President, according to the article. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he and his father spoke about Burisma just once.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to comment on the reported December 2015 conversation.\n\nBefore Biden's comments, Trump fired off several tweets Saturday morning, defending himself and his phone call with Zelensky as a \"fine and routine conversation.\"\n\n\"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nBiden briefly addressed supporters at a pre-steak fry rally Saturday and warned that Trump would try to murky the waters as the election cycle heats up.\n\n\u201cBe prepared for every lousy thing coming from him,\u201d Biden said.\n\nWhat has happened already\n\nThe president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.\n\nBut Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.\n\nPreviously: Joe Biden: Trump's reported effort to get Ukraine president to investigate him 'abhorrent'", "description": "Joe Biden has been in a back and forth with President Trump over a reported whistleblower complaint as well as his son's business dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6l3Ps9WniTIdPPTYi.v6Zg--~B/aD0xODMzO3c9Mjc1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/46494c0fcac7122a8937fde3e4d36dfa", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
