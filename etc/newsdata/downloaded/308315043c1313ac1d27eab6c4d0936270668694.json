Whether to compete, stay fit or socialise, 10 million people in the UK run regularly, and there\u2019s a huge demand for sportswear that raises our game.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that the market will hit \u00a317.5 billion by 2023 \u2014 and no wonder. Not only does modern running gear look good, a new breed of hi-tech sportswear promises to enhance performance, too, from energy-preserving trainers and clothing that boosts circulation to a sports bra that records every beat of your heart.\n\nAnna Maxted gave her verdict on a selection of the latest hi-tech sportswear items that claim to enhance the performance of runners (file image)\n\nBut Chris Wright, strength and conditioning coach at Loughborough University, warns that some of the promises of greater speed, less fatigue, and happier joints sound too good to be true \u2014 and may well be. While people rave about lightweight trainers, running shoes that suit your physiology will ultimately give you the edge, he says.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s an argument that if you\u2019re carrying 10g less on your feet, you\u2019ll be able to run faster. But whether you have a high or low arch has a massive impact on your technique and any stress that might go through your joints as a result, so having shoes that support your feet in the best way possible is a priority above whether a material is lighter.\u2019\n\nAs for compression clothing \u2014 garments that fit tightly on the skin, designed to stabilise muscles and improve circulation \u2014 research published last year found it promoted better running performance, as well as decreasing muscle soreness.\n\nSo which of the latest running gear will give you a (faster) run for your money? I went the extra mile to find out . . .\n\nSpringy, speedy success\n\nUnder Armour Hovr Infinite Running Shoes, \u00a3120, underarmour.co.uk\n\nAnna was impressed by Under Armour Hovr Infinite Running Shoes (pictured) for their support and comfort\n\nThese shoes look cool and feel solid, yet their \u2018zero-gravity feel\u2019 technology translates into lots of cushion and bounce. They\u2019re so supportive and comfortable that I spring along like a mountain goat.\n\nThe shoe contains an inbuilt sensor that tracks stride length, rhythm, distance and pace if you sync it to the Under Armour Map My Run app, which is easy to use.\n\nJust wearing quality kit rather than my usual battered trainers gives me a boost, but I really do run more smoothly and speedily in these \u2014 8.5 km/hour is sustainable when often I slow to around 8 km/hour. 5/5\n\nNo-Wobble workout\n\n2XU MCS Run Compression Tights, \u00a3105, 2xu.com\n\nAnna says 2XU MCS Run Compression Tights (pictured) made her feel streamlined and compact, boosting her confidence while she ran\n\nCompression leggings are made to support key muscles and tendons used when you run, reducing the strain on your body and helping to speed up recovery.\n\nThe fabric of these leggings is light, flexible and strong. Their compression of your thighs, quadriceps and calves is designed to reduce the force of impact when your foot hits the ground, and helps to protect your knees, too. The fabric also reduces muscle oscillation \u2014 it holds muscles in alignment with bones and joints, so they move more efficiently \u2014 and the graduated compression helps to return oxygenated blood to the muscles faster, all aiding performance.\n\nWhen I run in these, I appreciate what this means. Nothing wobbles. I feel streamlined and compact, which gives me the confidence to increase my pace. 5/5\n\nPower past fatigue\n\n2XU Compression Long-Sleeve Top, \u00a370, 2xu.com\n\nAnna says 2XU Compression Long-Sleeve Top (pictured) is great for outdoor workouts but she nearly baked alive wearing it on the treadmill\n\nThis top uses strong compression fabric to support your biceps and triceps, forearms and stomach muscles, but mostly I feel the pressure in my upper back muscles, pulling my shoulders back but not restricting movement.\n\nIt encourages good posture and the firm support reduces muscle oscillation, which lessens soreness and fatigue. (To compare, I wear a normal top on my next run and feel like a jelly). My only mistake was wearing it on a treadmill. I nearly baked alive. But for a park run in brisk weather, it speeds me on my way. 4/5\n\nA marathon-winner\n\nNike Vaporfly 4% Flyknit running shoe, \u00a3209.95, nike.com\n\nAnna claims Nike Vaporfly 4% Flyknit running shoe (pictured) feel light, yet solid and powerful while running\n\nPeople keep winning marathons in these shoes \u2014 so often, in fact, that some claim they give an unfair advantage. Sounds good to me. Their uppers are a single piece of material in a thin, but tough, knit-effect, and each sole is a foam and carbon-fibre plate.\n\nWhen I run in them, the shoe feels exquisitely light, yet solid and powerful. The sole is designed to propel you forward, and I do feel thrillingly fleet of foot. There\u2019s less grip in the heel than I\u2019m used to, but they\u2019re springy, and I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m exerting myself until I hit 9.5 km/hour \u2014 astonishing for me.\n\nMy husband is dazzled by them and impresses me by bending the sole of my fashion trainer (pliable as a hairpin), then trying to bend the Vaporfly \u2014 impossible.\n\n\u2018This is an athlete\u2019s shoe!\u2019 he cries. And I agree. 5/5\n\nSack the sock coach\n\nSensoria smart socks, around \u00a3200 (plus shipping from Germany), mindtecstore.com\n\nSensoria smart socks (pictured) pairs with your phone to give you tips while running\n\nThese socks are upsettingly expensive, even if they do come with a Bluetooth microelectronic sensor. This turns out to be a small plastic tile 1cm thick that clips into the sock, connecting to textile pressure sensors.\n\n\u2018You look like you\u2019re on parole,\u2019 says my 15-year-old son.\n\nThe sensor logs speed, distance, calories, stride and form, pairing up with your phone as you run and giving audio tips en route. (Apparently I \u2018heel strike\u2019 \u2014 meaning I land on my heel instead of the ball of my foot.)\n\nThe socks supposedly withstand 25 washes, after which a new pair will cost approximately \u00a339. 3/5\n\nE-bra to beat the best\n\nMyzone Sports Bra, \u00a344.99, and MZ-3 fitness tracker, \u00a3129.99 (plus shipping from the U.S.), myzone.org\n\nAnna says Myzone Sports Bra (pictured) wasn't consistent in the readings it gave from her run\n\nThis lightweight sports bra pairs with a fitness tracker that logs your heart rate, calories, effort level and time spent exercising.\n\nTo use it, you download the Myzone app and connect the sensor via Bluetooth. You can also connect and compete with other users.\n\nIt sounds great, but frustratingly my tracker kept switching off \u2014 announced by three annoying beeps that stopped me in my tracks.\n\nEven when the tracker stayed on and, post-exercise, uploaded six readings of my heart rate per minute, it wasn\u2019t consistent. It registered 94 bpm at one point, 0 bpm at another.\n\nThat said, it was impressively thorough, and the data revealed I could have run harder and faster \u2014 so I will. 2/5", "description": "Anna Maxted gave her verdict on a selection of the latest hi-tech kit aimed at runners.
