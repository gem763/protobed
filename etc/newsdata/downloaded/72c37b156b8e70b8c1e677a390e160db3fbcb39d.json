That particular proposal isn\u2019t something we\u2019d be in favor of,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows, former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told The Washington Times. \u201cIf they move forward with that plan the Freedom Caucus would not be in support of it.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is a bloc of about 30 of the most staunchly conservative Republicans in Congress.\n\nAnother lawmaker from the group, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, was concerned that President Trump would alienate his base if the administration adopts that approach.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jump because the Democrats want you to jump,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cWhat you ought you to be doing is consciously asking \u2014 does this enforce or does this empower law-abiding citizens?\u201d\n\nConservative members contend a better approach to addressing gun violence lies in shoring up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and investigating why people fail to pass the test.\n\nThe tentative proposal Republicans are considering, which the president has not yet weighed-in on, also drew a red flag from the National Rifle Association.\n\n\u201cThis missive is a non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental health system and the prosecution of violent criminals,\u201d said Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan was optimistic, however.\n\nWhile lawmakers on both sides of the aisle wait for the president to make a decision on what he might endorse, the Ohio Republican is confident it won\u2019t be on background checks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president is going to go that direction. I think he\u2019s gonna defend people\u2019s Second Amendment liberties,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration took the first step in testing a potential position for Mr. Trump and the Republicans on Wednesday, as Attorney General William P. Barr met with lawmakers and floated an idea to expand background checks to all commercial sales, including gun shows.\n\nSenators were left needing more details about how that proposal would work, but felt it was a good starting point.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he was withholding his decision on whether or not to support the idea until he saw the details.\n\nAsked about the appetite among House Republicans for background checks generally, Mr. McCarthy focused on other proposals such as the ban on bump stocks and efforts to bolster the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\nBut Democrats are holding out for universal background checks, which would apply to private sales.\n\nAsked if Democrats could back something like Mr. Barr\u2019s idea, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pointed out that the White House made it clear that Mr. Trump hadn\u2019t signed off on it yet.\n\nShe also pointed out that one of the summer\u2019s deadly shootings occurred because of a \u201cstraw purchase\u201d \u2014 when someone buys a gun for someone who can\u2019t pass the background check \u2014 which doesn\u2019t appear be addressed by the proposal.\n\nHowever, some conservative Democrats, like Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Anthony Brindisi of New York, would be open to approaches like the one floated by Mr. Barr \u2014 seeing it as at least some progress.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a great step towards making a dent in the gun violence we have in our country right now,\u201d Mr. Brindisi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
