(AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Doug Jones walked into a recent town hall and declared he was ready for whatever his constituents wanted to throw at him. But first, he wanted to address the biggest news from Washington: The House impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I'm not making a judgment about where we are on any of this because it's too early,\" Jones said, not waiting to be asked. He noted his potential role as a juror if the issue lands in the Senate.\n\nAlready considered the Senate's most endangered Democrat, the senator is facing the uncomfortable possibility of having to vote on removing the president from office while running for reelection in a state where Trump won 62% of the vote. Whatever Jones decides, if it comes to that, he's going to make lots of Alabamians mad.\n\nJust the prospect of an impeachment trial and vote is throwing partisan accelerant on a race Jones had wanted focused on safer, bipartisan economic issues.\n\n\"It's another drum for (Republicans) to beat in a very red state,\" said political scientist Glen Browder, a former Democratic congressman who was part of the moderate Blue Dog coalition.\n\nJones won his seat in a 2017 special election after his opponent, Roy Moore, was accused of sexual misconduct. Republicans consider his victory a one-off and have been eager to take the seat back. The key, they believe, is to make sure Alabama voters remember Jones' party affiliation.\n\nRepublicans made clear Tuesday that they see impeachment as an opportunity.\n\n\"We are all watching and will hold him accountable if he joins his party trying to upend our constitution,\" Alabama Republican Party Chairwoman Terry Lathan said Tuesday in a news conference called to needle Jones on impeachment, one of several Republicans held around the country aimed at Democrats in Trump territory. \"Alabamians love President Trump and they love a fighter.\"\n\nTo be sure, Jones is not alone in feeling pressure. If the Democratically led House votes to impeach Trump, forcing a trial in the Senate, a vote on whether to convict will be a moment of truth for senators from both parties. Republicans in tough races, like Cory Gardner, Susan Collins and Thom Tillis, will also be forced to make a decision certain to be viewed as picking a side. The fiercely partisan climate has left little middle ground.\n\nBut few of his colleagues face the hurdles that Jones does. He is the only Democrat elected to a statewide seat, winning his 2017 race by about mere 22,000 votes out of 1.3 million cast. While much of the country saw blue surges in the 2018, Democrats running statewide in Alabama topped out at about 40% of the vote.\n\nJones has been preparing to run as a moderate emphasizing issues that cut across party lines \u2014 health care, such as the disappearance of rural hospitals in the state, and agriculture. He's focused on economic issues of concern to some traditional Republican voters, cautioning about how tariffs are threatening the state's aerospace industry, automobile workers and farmers.\n\n\"The record I want to emphasize to folks is that I am there for them,\" Jones said in an interview last month. \"I am not there for a president. I am not there for any of the Democrats. I am there for the people of this state.\"\n\nAn impeachment trial in the Senate would make it harder to keep that focus away from the partisan warfare.\n\n\"It's really going to suck all the air out of the room. Good luck trying to have a substantive debate on health insurance.... especially if you're getting these televised hearings in the House or a trial in a Senate,\" said David Hughes, a political scientist at Auburn University in Montgomery.\n\nAs the impeachment battle lines have been drawn, Jones has tried to cast himself as above the fray. He dismissed Republicans Tuesday for staging a \"political stunt\" about such a \"serious\" matter.\n\n\"As a U.S. senator, it is my obligation to weigh all the facts fairly before making a decision, and we don't have all the facts yet,\" Jones said, breaking from many Democrats who believe that the loose transcript of a phone call and a whistleblower report, both already public, prove Trump abused his power by asking a foreign leader for a political favor.\n\n\"What I have seen so far raises legitimate concern for our national security and there appears to be evidence of abuse of power. I hope for the sake of our country that we can find the truth together,\" Jones said.", "description": "U.S. Sen.
