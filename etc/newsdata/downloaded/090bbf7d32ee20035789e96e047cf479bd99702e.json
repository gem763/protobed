The world is watching.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Los Angeles beauty blogger Laura Lee posted footage of her cat, Boo, swiftly pushing his sister, Peach, into a pool and people love it.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570466537_1570466980.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
