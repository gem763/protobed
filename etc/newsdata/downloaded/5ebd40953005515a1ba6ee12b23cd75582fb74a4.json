These seem to be some of the earliest instances of Trump raising eyebrows with his admiration for the leader, which would later play out in public appearances like a high stakes summit in Helsinki in July 2018.\n\nRead more: Trump reportedly fawned over Putin after their meeting and told aides the Russian leader was strong, smart, and cunning\n\nAides were also reportedly taken aback at Trump promising Saudi officials a spot in the G7 and ignoring human rights abuses in the Philippines that have been waged by President Rodrigo Duterte and killed thousands, but was lauded by Trump in April 2017 as an \"unbelievable job on the drug problem.\"\n\nHowever, one official said every one of Trump's interactions with other leaders had a time limit before it would eventually devolve into an inappropriate interaction.\n\n\"You had two to three minutes max,\" one former senior administration official said. \"And then he was still usually going to say whatever he wanted to say.\"", "description": "A new report from The Washington Post says senior administration staffers came to expect Trump's inappropriate behavior.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d98b59332bf0f1f4317c308?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
