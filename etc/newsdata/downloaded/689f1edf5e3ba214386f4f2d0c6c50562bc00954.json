Chicago's Civilian Office of Police Accountability contended Rialmo overreacted and made differing statements. Investigators cast doubt on whether LeGrier swung at officers.\n\nA jury awarded a $1.05 million to LeGrier's family in a wrongful death lawsuit, but a judge reversed it, noting jurors also found Rialmo feared for his life.\n\nThe City Council awarded $16 million to Jones' family.", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) - Chicago's police oversight board has fired an officer who fatally shot two people - a teenager he said threatened him with a bat and a woman...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
