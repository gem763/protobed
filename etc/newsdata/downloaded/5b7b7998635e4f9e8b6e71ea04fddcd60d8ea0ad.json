They say fentanyl can be lethal in dosages as small as 700 micrograms. They say these pills contained more than 168,000 times that amount, enough to kill potentially thousands of people.\n\nThe drugs were seized when police recovered a stolen vehicle earlier in September. A Kentucky man was charged with receiving stolen property in that case, but no charges have been brought in connection with the drugs.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: News Journal, http://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police in Ohio say a recent drug seizure of more than 1,500 pills were disguised as the prescription painkiller Oxycodone but actually contained the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
