(Sound off in the comments, T3 defenders!) There is no Salvation. There is no Genisys. But there is a Sarah Connor \u2014 the Sarah Connor, in a returning Linda Hamilton \u2014 who is reluctantly joining forces with humanity\u2019s new great hope, Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), and the enhanced human super-soldier sent from the future to protect her (Mackenzie Davis as Grace). It takes the endoskeleton of Judgment Day and gives it the face of a border-hopping, factory-line-working Mexican woman. In her lies our mortal salvation (which will, of course, necessitate high-speed chases both on land and airborne, and a comical Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo).\n\nAs the future warrior Grace, whose body is reinforced with a subcutaneous mesh barrier and is supercharged with machine parts, Davis is the heiress to Connor\u2019s battle-hardened T2 incarnation. Muscles run down her arms like canyons and she delivers Deadpool-lite quips about \u201cfuture shit\u201d when she isn\u2019t beating the hell out of the latest AI hellbeast (Gabriel Luna) sent to eradicate her charge. It\u2019s a huge jump in production scale from the work Davis is best known for, like the prestige TV gem Halt and Catch Fire or indie films like Izzy Gets the Fuck Across Town. But the dynamic actress \u2014 who has had supporting roles in big-budget sci-fi films like The Martian and Blade Runner 2049 \u2014 has long been poised for blockbuster-level recognition. Vulture spoke with Davis before Dark Fate\u2019s official release about sidestepping the role of ingenue, the cathartic power of hitting a man with a sledgehammer on the day of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate testimony, and her thoughts on being the subject of queer desire online.\n\nI wanted to start by asking how aware you are of your status as a lesbian thirst icon.\n\nI\u2019m not very online. It does scare me. Sometimes I go on and then I go off again, cause it just feels full of \u2014 like, the good things are as bad as the bad things, you know what I mean? And I\u2019m speaking specifically about looking up stuff about myself. It just all feels dangerous.\n\nWell, when I walked out of Dark Fate one of the first things I said was, \u201cThe lesbians are not ready for Mackenzie Davis in this movie,\u201d because you are a favorite subject of queer desire online.\n\nI\u2019m so happy to be a part of it. I just think that\u2019s so cool. I feel like lesbians haven\u2019t really had their time the way gays have, but lesbians are having a time right now in such a satisfying way. I\u2019m so honored to be in any way involved or invited to participate in small doses.\n\nAcross projects like Always Shine and \u201cSan Junipero\u201d and Tully and even with this Terminator, you\u2019ve explored a wide spectrum of intimate female relationships, and I wondered if those kinds of roles were finding you or if you\u2019re the one seeking them out.\n\nI guess both. The first thing I thought when you were speaking was of a point when I was auditioning in Montreal before I moved to New York, when I was still in college and just trying to see if I could get jobs. There was a role on Blue Mountain High. It was a show about football and there was an audition for, like, a cheerleader who one of the football players loses his ring inside when he finger-bangs her. When I received that audition I was like, you know what? I never want to play someone\u2019s fucking joke. I never really wanna play someone\u2019s girlfriend, and I never really want to play somebody that\u2019s observing somebody else have a story. I don\u2019t need to be the lead of the story, but I know that I don\u2019t just want to be an actress. I want a particular version of career, and I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I made a career as the girl who gets jewelry lost inside her womb. But that\u2019s just me!\n\nOne reason your work resonates among queer women is because audiences are historically presented in film and TV with a binary vision of how women relate to one another: They\u2019re either romantically involved or it\u2019s a nonsexual friendship. In genre, sometimes those lines get blurred and you have some psychosexual narrative. But you\u2019ve played multiple roles where, in that blurred space, intimacy and affection are fluid, and that immediately becomes queered within the sort of heteronormative context in which pop art typically exists. Hence: a lesbian thirst icon.\n\nI never thought about it that way, and I think that\u2019s a really lovely consequence of not wanting to play these ingenue roles. Well, it\u2019s not necessarily that I don\u2019t wanna play an ingenue. I\u2019d love to be an ingenue. I\u2019d love everybody to think I was like a beautiful doll. But I just sort of knew that I would be incredibly bummed out all the time if I compromised this one part of myself, which has like a clear sort of feminist vision for how I want women to appear onscreen or what images I want to produce. I think in two movies I\u2019ve played a girlfriend or somebody who was part of a traditional romantic structure. And in every other thing I\u2019ve done it\u2019s been about, like, either female partnership or friendship or rivalries, and it feels totally accidental. But I do understand how it is a consequence of something I thought about when I was a lot younger. It makes me really proud.\n\nYou said once in an interview that you related to a point Ryan Gosling made about acting and how it\u2019s like turning the dials up and down on aspects of your own personality. Which of your internal dials are you most interested in turning right now?\n\nYou know how everyone has an essential emotion or something? That\u2019s like, My original cell is this. I think my original cell is loneliness. That\u2019s what drew me to a lot of things for a while, which I only kind of thought about afterwards, being forced to reflect on things. I don\u2019t know if that does it for me as much anymore. I feel like there are a lot of really great roles for women right now, and so creating strict rules about what you will and won\u2019t do doesn\u2019t feel quite as relevant as it used to \u2014 for me at least. And the loneliness thing, whether consciously or unconsciously, maybe it doesn\u2019t move me quite as much anymore, cause I just am older and my life has changed. I\u2019m like, should I really do something not in sci-fi? I guess? But I love sci-fi! There\u2019s just so many good roles that come out of it, and I don\u2019t know. Should I do something where I\u2019m playing someone\u2019s wife and see what that\u2019s like? I just want to know a bit more. Play less strong characters maybe?\n\nI love that breaking convention with the roles you\u2019ve taken so far involves playing a wife. That\u2019s your crazy experiment.\n\nOr just a different type of strength! Like, somebody who looks weak? I think a lot of the roles that I\u2019ve had have been visibly strong in some way or assertive or aggressive.\n\nWell, Grace is very conventionally strong in Dark Fate, and yet she isn\u2019t packaged like the heroines we\u2019re trained to see at this scale, like the very polished and pristine superheroes. You\u2019ve said before that the cycle of women performing and having a feminine ideal forced upon them can make for thrilling and horrifying entertainment, but this movie doesn\u2019t seem concerned with that ideal at all.\n\nAt all. Doesn\u2019t that amaze you that I genuinely can\u2019t find a male gaze in this movie?\n\nA friend of mine was very hyped up about the \u201cbutch gaze\u201d of this movie, which I thought was a very accurate term. Tim Miller doesn\u2019t shy away from your bodies, so you\u2019re not meant to be genderless drones, but he seemed entirely concerned with framing you and Linda and Natalia for your power and not for your sexual appeal \u2014 or really even for what a dude thinks women would want to see.\n\n\ufeffI know it was a real concern of Tim\u2019s \u2014 and [for] me, too, and I\u2019m sure with all of us. I was privy to conversations about me and my costuming and the way I looked. He didn\u2019t want it to be sexy, and he didn\u2019t want it to be a sweaty male version of a warrior. He was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be filtered in that way. I want her to look like a soldier.\u201d I really think we did that. And my concern was and always is, I hate the trope \u2014 especially in apocalypse movies \u2014 that the best fighters are the women that look like men. That you have to adopt really male characteristics in order to be a convincing female warrior, which I think is such a limited point of view, and also dumb. Obviously, there\u2019s a true androgyny to the way I look naturally and to the way I look in the movie, but there\u2019s such a tenderness to Grace and such a true femininity \u2014 if there is an essential feminine, whatever that thing is \u2014 to [the female characters\u2019] relationships. They are distinctly female without being feminized or going through too many layers of projection.\n\nEven the way Grace regards Dani when she\u2019s protecting her, like on the bridge or during a sledgehammer fight \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s almost maternal.\n\nThat felt different from how I\u2019m used to seeing male heroes protect women onscreen. The way Grace comes between her and danger made me think, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s how women are aware of and protect each other.\u201d\n\nWe shot that sledgehammer scene the day of, uh, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony. I always forget his name, \u2019cause I don\u2019t want to know it. And I remember just being so fucking angry and being able to scream in Gabriel\u2019s face and slam him with a sledgehammer. It was the most cathartic, lovely thing on this day where I was just like, \u201cYou ruined the world, men!\u201d I throw him down and then yell in his face in the scene, and I remember I was just so sad that day and angry, and it was just such a nice exercise.\n\nLike six men wrote this movie, and Miller directed it, so was that shift in its gaze a product of the actresses\u2019 advocacy on behalf of your characters?\n\nTim is such a collaborative person, and he\u2019s so deeply sensitive and attuned to what the truest version of a thing is, while also knowing that we\u2019re making a movie that has certain tropes and things that cater to a movie of this scale. You\u2019re not going to strip it down and have a tiny little intimate drama, but I think as far as making real the relationships and the characters and our dynamics, so much of that is just the product of rehearsal and us having the space and very willing ears to hear us say, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right. Why are they fighting in this moment? If they\u2019re fighting, we need a bigger reason so that we understand what the dynamic is.\u201d So, it wasn\u2019t a huge campaign or anything. Our relationship as it was before we started shooting changed and got a lot more nuanced. We slowly whittled away some of the parts that didn\u2019t feel quite as true to us, and found a really real dynamic of competition and rivalry, but that also had a lot of love undergirding it.\n\nLinda said she was much more forceful about standing up for Sarah Connor than she would ever typically be on set, because she wanted to make the character proud, and I wondered if that freed you up to do the same for Grace.\n\nI was so insecure making this fucking movie. I felt so uncomfortable. It was very new for me and I just wanted \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I wanted. Honestly, I wanted to believe what I was saying, \u2019cause I\u2019m not used to working in this huge arena, and it changes your acting. Before I start, I get really anxious and just think about how unbelievably disappointed everyone is going to be. I watched Mad Max: Fury Road, and I just think what Charlize did in that role was so fucking cool and cannot be beat. I was like, \u201cUggghhh I wish I was doing that!\u201d Then you work for a week and you\u2019re like, \u201cAll right. I guess I\u2019m doing it,\u201d and then you just sort of fall into something and hopefully you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re bullshitting. That\u2019s my only real concern, is that I believe what I\u2019m saying.\n\nAnd how is it being the one on the poster with the chain wrapped around your arms?\n\nIt feels like seeing an avatar. I was in London with my friend while we were there for press, and we were walking around and a bus went by with the movie on it. It\u2019s like you have a ghost self that goes and does these things, and you don\u2019t really look anything like that person or share any of their qualities, but you\u2019re like, \u201cAw, she\u2019s on a bus!\u201d So, it\u2019s weird, but then also feels so other that you can just be like, \u201cOh, look at her. Look at her doing that! She has nothing to do with me, but there she is.\u201d", "description": "Mackenzie Davis plays a cyborg-human hybrid in Terminator: Dark Fate, and the actress talks about the cathartic power of hitting men with sledgehammers and the movie\u2019s missing male gaze.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-mackenzie-davis-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
