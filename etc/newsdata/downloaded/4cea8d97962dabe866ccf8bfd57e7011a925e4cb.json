He has since been charged with assault causing bodily injury, according to ABC News\u2019 Houston station KTRK.\n\nLea Menchaca, who was sitting in the same section as Dinkins and the man he assaulted, 21-year-old Manuel Bitolas, witnessed the incident occur in the 9th inning of Sunday\u2019s game in Houston.\n\n\"[Dinkins] reached back and slammed him on the face, five times, like repeated five-time slap,\" said Menchaca. \"He's a big guy with long arms, so he just reached back and slapped him on the face.\u201d\n\nMenchaca said that Dinkins\u2019 behaviour is a constant issue for those around him at Minute Maid Park.\n\nHarris County District Attorneys Office/AP\n\n\"It gets old. Like every time someone cheers, whether it's for the Astros or against the Astros, I get nervous,\" said Menchaca. \"I don't know if this guy was going to react. It makes it unenjoyable for everyone around him.\"\n\nBitolas, who was attending the game with his mother, said that while he was cheering on the Yankees, he ended up exchanging words with Dinkins which he allegedly thought were well-humored not realizing that Dinkins was actually angry.\n\n\"I told him something and patted his shoulder and he said, 'Don't f-ing touch me,\u201d Bitolas told KTRK over the phone. \"I bent over to get my drink and he like hit me. And I was kind of surprised about it.\"\n\nAsked what through his mind hen Dinkins bgan assaulting him, Bitolas said, \u201cHe\u2019s an old man so I can\u2019t really do much.\u201d\n\nThe assault was captured on ballpark surveillance cameras, according to Nathan Beedle, Chief of Misdemeanor for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\n\"I have not seen an assault in the stands happen, which is why the allegation is so concerning,\" said Beedle. \"I would just say common sense is not to be touching anyone else period, generally. I would stick away from that, regardless of the venue.\"\n\nBitolas said that he and his mother reported the incident to nearby police officers who eventually questioned and then arrested Dinkins.\n\nBitolas also said that he and his mother left the game right after he was assaulted while the game was tied.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is not the first run in with the law that \u201cThe Judge\u201d has had.\n\nAccording to KTRK, Dinkins was indicted on a federal charge of conspiring to obtain approximately $120,000 in disaster relief funds by fraudulent means in 2012 in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike.\n\nThe Astros currently lead the Yankees by 2 games to 1 in the American League Championship Series. Game 4 is set for tonight in New York.\n\nThe winner will take on the Washington Nationals in the World Series beginning on Oct. 22.", "description": "The Washington Nationals may have just booked their first trip to the World Series but the heated series between the Astros and Yankees has spilled over into the stands.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dinkins-winged_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
