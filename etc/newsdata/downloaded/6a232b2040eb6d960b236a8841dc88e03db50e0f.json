View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190913005062/en/\n\nThe NeighborhoodLIFT program for Essex County follows Wells Fargo\u2019s announcement in June of an evolution in the company\u2019s philanthropic strategy which includes a $1 billion commitment over the next six years to address the U.S. housing affordability crisis.\n\n\u201cNeighborhoodLIFT is a great example of a housing affordability solution Wells Fargo is bringing to communities across the U.S.,\u201d said Greg White, Wells Fargo Community Bank\u2019s Northern New Jersey region bank president. \u201cThat\u2019s because nearly one-third of U.S. households spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. Through the NeighborhoodLIFT program, Wells Fargo is providing down payment assistance to hardworking families and individuals in Essex County so they can realize the dream of homeownership. This provides them with the opportunity to build wealth and live in safe, stable, and affordable homes.\u201d\n\nOverall, Wells Fargo and NeighborWorks America have teamed to implement 74 LIFT program launches across the U.S., with Essex County being the 75th. Since 2012, LIFT programs have assisted nearly 22,000 homeowners, in nearly 900 municipalities, who have purchased more than $3.36 billion in real estate supported by a total investment of $475 million by Wells Fargo. Mortgage loans made through LIFT programs are not exclusive to Wells Fargo.\n\nFree NeighborhoodLIFT event scheduled Oct. 5\n\nInterested homebuyers who want to apply for a down payment assistance grant must register beginning Monday, Sept. 16, at 9 a.m. at www.wellsfargo.com/lift to attend the free event. Wells Fargo\u2019s 75th LIFT program launch event is scheduled on Saturday, Oct. 5, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Renaissance Newark Airport Hotel, located at 1000 Spring St. in Elizabeth, N.J. New Jersey Community Capital will administer the $20,000 grants and determine eligibility. Local HUD-certified housing counselors will provide the required homebuyer education.\n\nTo reserve a $20,000 down payment assistance grant, eligible homebuyers must be pre-approved for financing with an eligible lender to purchase a home in Essex County and earn 100% or less of the area median income, which is $100,600 in Essex County for a family of four. Military service members and veterans, teachers, law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians may reserve down payment assistance grants of $22,500.\n\n\u201cThis innovative collaboration is critical to creating sustainable homeownership in Essex County,\u201d said Joanie Straussman Brandon, Northeastern regional vice president with NeighborWorks America. \u201cThe required homebuyer education classes provided by certified professionals better prepare NeighborhoodLIFT homebuyers to achieve their goal of sustainable homeownership.\u201d\n\nApproved homebuyers will have up to 60 days to finalize a contract to purchase a home in Essex County and can obtain mortgage financing from any participating lender. To reserve the full grant amount, participants buying a primary residence with the NeighborhoodLIFT program must commit to live in the home for five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to help more Essex County residents become homeowners with the support of NeighborhoodLIFT homebuyer education and down payment assistance,\u201d said Wayne Meyer, president of New Jersey Community Capital. \u201cWe are pleased to join Wells Fargo and NeighborWorks America to make homeownership more affordable, achievable and sustainable for families and individuals.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo has also committed $325,000 for up to 650 consumers to receive complimentary face-to-face homeownership counseling. Interested homebuyers may also receive a voucher at the Essex County NeighborhoodLIFT launch event that will provide in-person homeownership counseling at no charge with a participating HUD-approved housing counselor. The homeownership counseling grant program is a resource in addition to the homebuyer education required for a NeighborhoodLIFT down payment assistance grant.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), NeighborWorks\u00ae America and its network member New Jersey Community Capital today announced that the 75th LIFT program, designed to boost homeownership, will expand to Essex County, N.J., this fall.
