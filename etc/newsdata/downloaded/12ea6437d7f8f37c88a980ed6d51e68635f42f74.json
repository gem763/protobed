FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were down 0.3% at $9.37-1/2 a bushel by 0004 GMT, having firmed 0.5% on Monday when prices hit a June 13, 2018 high of $9.46 a bushel. * The most active corn futures were down 0.2% to $3.97 a bushel, having closed unchanged in the previous session after earlier hitting a Aug 12 high of $4.03 a bushel. * The most active wheat futures were down 0.4% at $5.08-3/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.2% on Monday when prices hit a July 19 high $5.15 a bushel. * Market awaits news about potential crop damage following cold weather over the U.S. Midwest in recent days. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a monthly report last week cut its forecasts of U.S. 2019/20 soybean production and ending stocks more than most analysts expected. * The government projected that stocks would fall to 460 million bushels by end-August 2020, from 913 million bushels a year earlier. * At the same time, the USDA raised its U.S. corn yield estimate, bucking trade expectations for a reduction. MARKET NEWS * The U.S. dollar rose on Monday, after two days of losses, attracting safe-haven bids, as optimism waned about a trade deal between the United States and China, and investors fretted about the ongoing twists and turns on Britain's exit from the European Union. * Oil prices lost about 2% on Monday on worries that global crude demand could stay under pressure as few details about the first phase of a U.S.-China trade deal did little to assure a quick resolution to the tariff fight. * Wall Street edged lower on Monday as uncertainties following recent U.S.-China trade negotiations clouded sentiment and investors turned their focus on the third-quarter earnings season, which begins in earnest on Tuesday.
