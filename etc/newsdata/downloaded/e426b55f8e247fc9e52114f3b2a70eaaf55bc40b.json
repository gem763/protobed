The US then pressured Germany to do they same by excluding Huawei from an auction on providing the country with gear for its 5G infrastructure \u2014 but the new security rule book shows Germany has no intention on caving.\n\n\u201cGermany\u2019s approach did not and does not foresee any clause that would exclude any one company,\u201d a senior government official told Reuters, under anonymity.\n\nThis confirms Angela Merkel\u2019s stance from earlier this year where she said Germany wouldn\u2019t single out individual vendors while toughening the security of the country\u2019s mobile networks.\n\nCredit: The White House The two leaders have different opinions on how to handle Huawei.\n\nThe new security catalog will detail higher technical and security standards which operators would need to adhere to. This is still a win for operators \u2014 many of whom are already Huawei customers \u2014 as they had warned that the ban on Huawei products could delay 5G adoption in Germany by years and cost billions of dollars.\n\nHuawei is still viewed suspiciously\n\nThe US accuses Huawei of being in cahoots with the Chinese government and argues that the company\u2019s gear might feature \u2018back doors,\u2019 which China could use to spy on other countries.\n\nAlthough Germany and some of its European counterparts haven\u2019t gone as far as the US, it doesn\u2019t mean countries don\u2019t share the same concerns on this side of the world. In fact, last week, the EU member states released a joint risk assessment report, which warned of increased security risks associated with the implementation of 5G.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t mention Huawei directly, but states that new approaches to securing telecom infrastructure are needed and mentions security challenges posed by \u201cnon-EU state or state-backed actors.\u201d\n\nSo, even though the rest of the world isn\u2019t taking the US\u2019 hard stance, it\u2019s still clear that Huawei isn\u2019t out of the woods yet.\n\nRead next: Europol: Bitcoin is the still the dark web\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency", "description": "Germany's upcoming 'security catalog' will not exclude Huawei from supplying equipment for the country's 5G mobile networks.", "authors": ["M\u00e1r M\u00e1sson Maack"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design.png&signature=13eacc99c0ca170817694a2620d84b08", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
