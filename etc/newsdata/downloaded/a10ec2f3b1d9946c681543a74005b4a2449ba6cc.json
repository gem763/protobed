For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nLawyer Alan Dershowitz claims an email buried in a mountain of just-unsealed court documents proves that one of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accusers lied when she said she was farmed out for sex with him as a teenager.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for these emails to come out for months and they conclusively prove my innocence,\u201d Dershowitz told The Daily Beast on Friday, adding that he is now asking federal prosecutors to investigate the accuser\u2019s high-profile legal team.\n\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Epstein made her a sex slave when she was just 16 years old, has also alleged that she was loaned out for sex with Dershowitz\u2014saying in a 2016 deposition that she had once performed oral sex on the Harvard Law professor in a limo in Massachusetts, alongside Epstein and a young girl.\n\n\u201cThe first time I recall having sex with Professor Dershowitz was in New York,\u201d she testified at one point in that deposition. \u201cThe last time I remember having sex with him\u2026 I believe it was on an airplane.\u201d\n\nDershowitz\u2014who helped broker Epstein\u2019s 2007 sweetheart plea deal\u2014has vehemently denied sexual contact with Giuffre, waged a public war with her attorney David Boies, and insisted that he would be cleared when the court documents were unsealed.\n\nThat unsealing happened Friday morning when a tranche of filings from a defamation lawsuit Giuffre had filed against Epstein crony Ghislaine Maxwell was made public.\n\nThe pile of paperwork contained bad news for a raft of high-profile men, from former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to New York billionaire Glenn Dubin, who were named by Giuffre as being involved in Epstein\u2019s alleged sex-trafficking ring; they deny it.\n\nBut Dershowitz claims one document in particular also poses a problem for Giuffre: a 2011 email exchange between her and a British tabloid reporter who had interviewed her about her years under Epstein\u2019s sway.\n\nIn the email, Giuffre told the Mail on Sunday reporter, Sharon Churcher, she was racing to meet a deadline for a draft of what she would later describe as a \u201cfictionalized account\u201d of what happened to her.\n\n\u201cJust wondering if you have any information on you from when you and I were doing interviews about the J.E. story,\u201d Giuffre wrote Churcher.\n\n\u201cI wanted to put the names of some of the assholes, oops, I meant to say, pedo\u2019s, that J.E. sent me to. With everything going on, my brain feels like mush and it would be a great deal of help!\u201d Giuffre added.\n\nThe emails in the court file shows Churcher responded: \u201cDon\u2019t forget Alan Dershowitz\u2026 J.E.\u2019s buddy and lawyer...good name for your pitch as he repped Claus von Bulow and a movie was made about that case\u2026 title was Reversal of Fortune. We all suspect Alan is a pedo and tho no proof of that, you probably met him when he was hanging out with JE.\u201d\n\nGiuffre\u2019s reply contained no reference to Dershowitz, just a simple, \u201cThanks again Shazza, I\u2019m bringing down the house with this book!!\u201d\n\n\u201c Don\u2019t forget Alan Dershowitz. \u201d \u2014 Journalist Sharon Churcher\n\nChurcher, who no longer works at the Mail on Sunday, declined to comment.\n\nDershowitz noted that when Giuffre finished her manuscript, there was no mention of sex with him\u2014although Giuffre did write that Dershowitz had a taste for young, beautiful women and that he once walked into a room where Epstein had just molested her.\n\nCourt papers filed by Giuffre\u2019s legal team say she began writing the manuscript on the advice of her mental-health counselor as a way to work through her trauma. She explored the idea of selling it but ultimately decided not to publish it, they said.\n\nTo Dershowitz, desperately trying to rescue his reputation as the Epstein scandal continues to intensify, the absence of allegations even in what Giuffre has described as fiction amounts to a smoking gun.\n\n\u201cIf she had sex with me, I\u2019d be highlighted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is completely exculpatory and completely consistent with what I\u2019ve been saying,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cShe made it up when she met her lawyers and heard there was a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\u201d\n\nAsked about Dershowitz\u2019s claim that the email shows Giuffre had failed to accuse him of sexual misconduct before she filed her lawsuit, Boies\u2019 firm sent a statement from his co-counsel, Sigrid McCawley, that did not directly address the issue.\n\n\u201c The denials of those accused of participating in Jeffrey Epstein's horrific sex trafficking operation are predictable. \u201d \u2014 Sigrid McCawley, lawyer for Epstein accuser\n\n\u201cThe denials of those accused of participating in Jeffrey Epstein's horrific sex trafficking operation are predictable and have long been anticipated,\u201d McCawley said. \u201cThe truth will have the final word.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cThe body of evidence amassed in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell\u2014Jeffrey Epstein's recruiter-in-chief, trainer, and sometimes, co-abuser\u2014is powerful. Some of it was unsealed by the Second Circuit; we are hopeful more will come out.\n\n\u201cThe documents and exhibits should be carefully examined for the vivid, detailed and tragic story they tell in the face of cursory, bumper-sticker like statements by those accused. Virginia Roberts Giuffre is a survivor and a woman to be believed. She believes a reckoning of inevitable accountability has begun.\u201d\n\nDershowitz\u2014who is being sued by Giuffre for defamation\u2014said that when he was first accused he went to federal prosecutors and complained but could not provide them with the Churcher email chain because it had already been sealed by the court.\n\nNow that the document is public, he said, his attorneys plan to speak with prosecutors on Monday and ask them to investigate Giuffre\u2019s lawyers for \u201cpressuring her into falsely accusing me.\u201d\n\nDershowitz also said he has no idea if Giuffre was telling the truth when she claimed his former client recruited underage girls for sex with his famous friends, like Prince Andrew and modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel.\n\n\u201cI just know she made up stories about me,\u201d he said.", "description": "The embattled Harvard Law professor says the document shows that one of Epstein\u2019s accusers concocted sex accusation against him.", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565401833/190809-connor-dershowitz-tease_fvt7el", "published_at": "2019-08-10"}
