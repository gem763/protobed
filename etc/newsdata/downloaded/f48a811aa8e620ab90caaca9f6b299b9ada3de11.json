In a scene from the film at above, Queen Ingrith, far right, welcomes Princess Aurora before her wedding to Prince Phillip. [WALT DISNEY COMPANY KOREA]\n\nThe all-powerful fairy Maleficent has returned to the Moors, the magical forest kingdom that she once ruled. Although she is still unaccustomed to showing off her feelings, her love for Aurora is as fierce as ever, stronger and thicker than blood.The first \u201cMaleficent\u201d film earned praise from fans for bringing the tale of \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d to life and presenting Maleficent\u2019s perspective: She had to cast a sleeping spell on Aurora before she had a change of heart due to her love for the princess.The film went on to become one of the most successful live-action adaptations of a Disney animated film, grossing over $750 million worldwide, thanks to Angelina Jolie\u2019s exceptional performance.Disney announced in June 2014 that there would be a sequel to the film titled \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil,\u201d with the actors reprising their roles and a new antagonist, much to the excitement of fans.In the second film, the story takes another complicated twist as Aurora, now 21, is preparing to marry Prince Phillip of the Ulstead Kingdom.Unlike the prince\u2019s father, King John, Queen Ingrith (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) despises the unknown fantastical creatures of the Moors and the fairy Maleficent. Although she doesn\u2019t approve of them, she cunningly welcomes them into her family, with the ultimate goal of starting a war to divide humans and fairies forever.Even though they play enemies in the film, Jolie admired Pfeiffer and her character so much that it was \u201chard not to smile.\u201d Instead of describing Queen Ingrith as evil, however, the actor thought that the Queen is a portrayal of \u201ca strong woman.\u201dThe actor also talked about her special connection to the actor Elle Fanning (who reprises her role as Aurora).\u201c[Elle] really is, to me, Aurora,\u201d Jolie said. \u201cHer strength is in her softness, kindness, sweetness, her love, her desire to have a husband and children and she loves to hug and smile, and all of these things these days are associated with weaker women because they [people] think of strength as being a certain kind of tough. But really, I believe the strongest person in the film is Aurora and it\u2019s is her femininity and that\u2019s Elle. She has a huge career, but she\u2019s humble and sweet - there\u2019s heart in this business.\u201dSam Riley, who plays Maleficent\u2019s trusted ears and eyes Diaval, also spoke about his character\u2019s affection for Aurora.\u201cThe appeal of Diaval is honesty, his loyalty to Maleficent and his affection towards Aurora,\u201d Riley said.\u201cHe immediately treats her as his own in the first movie, and it\u2019s a fascinating relationship that he has with Maleficent. He could, in theory, fly off somewhere into the Moors and make a nest somewhere, but something keeps him there by Maleficent\u2019s side - it\u2019s a unquestioning loyalty.\u201dBoth actors are parents themselves, which they say definitely impacted their performances in the film. Jolie\u2019s eldest son, Maddox Jolie-Pitt, entered Yonsei University in Seoul this fall.\u201cA child leaving a nest, as they say, is something - it was on my mind making the film and yet I have to say I\u2019m so happy he chose to go to school in Korea, and I know he\u2019s having a wonderful experience,\u201d Jolie added.\u201cYou\u2019re nervous for your child, but when you believe he\u2019s in the right place, you\u2019re happy, and I\u2019m very, very grateful to everyone in Korea who\u2019s making him feel at home, and [I\u2019m so] happy he\u2019s getting the education [that he needs].\u201dRiley, on the other hand, became a father since the release of the first film five years ago.\u201cI think the love you experience as a parent is indescribable, but it has also formed every role I [have] played [since],\u201d Riley said. \u201cI think it makes you vulnerable and sensitive in a way that you can\u2019t imagine until you become a parent. So it meant a lot to me watching Aurora in the scene at the end.\u201dJolie had her own reason behind returning to the film, besides the good messages in the movie.\u201cI also always wondered what Maleficent was,\u201d Jolie said. \u201cWhere did she come from? And so the idea that she was part of a tribe that was of the world and we could introduce them to the audience, that was exciting for me.\u201dIf the first film was about breaking away from stereotypes, the second film, Jolie says, is about embracing diversity.\u201c[The film] felt like a dream of how the world could be - there was strength, equality and celebration of diversity in each of us, and I love that message,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the little children. [They] may not understand what they love when they see this movie, but if they love the end, then they\u2019re taking a step forward to embracing and respecting that diversity and others.\u201dThe fantasy movie is slated to premiere in local theaters on Oct. 17.BY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/04190816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
