(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nSolar panel mandates, a dramatic and hotly debated environmental policy with roots on the West Coast, could be coming to a suburb of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMontgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) wants to introduce legislation requiring all new single-family houses \u2014 and possibly apartments and commercial buildings \u2014 to have solar panels on their rooftops starting in 2022.\n\nIf the measure is approved by the all-Democratic county council, the wealthy suburb of 1 million would be the first major jurisdiction outside California to adopt such a mandate, experts say.\n\nWhile the proposal has plenty of supporters in the liberal county, some argue that it is an inefficient way to boost renewable energy, it could detract from more significant energy-saving policies and it may slow construction as well as raise costs in a jurisdiction already gripped by a severe affordable housing shortage.\n\n[Hundreds of scientists head to North Pole to study climate change]\n\nElrich, a self-described \u201cold-fashioned progressive,\u201d was elected last year over opposition from most business groups. They considered him anti-development, in part because of his opposition to high-density projects in areas of the county including downtown Silver Spring.\n\nHe told environmentalists about the solar-panel requirement at a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d town hall on Sept. 14. In a phone interview Wednesday from New York City, where he was attending an international climate conference connected to the United Nations General Assembly session, Elrich said he intends to introduce the law in 2020 and have it take effect two years after that.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do stuff like this, you\u2019re not going to reach any climate goals,\u201d Elrich said, referring to the county\u2019s resolution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2027, and 100 percent by 2035. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve got to act. You can\u2019t just say you\u2019re going to do something.\u201d\n\n\n\nElrich plans to introduce legislation that will require all new single-family homes to have solar panels. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nHowever, the head of the Maryland Building Industry Association said the mandate would drive up construction costs and provide only minimal savings on utility bills, given that Montgomery already has stringent building codes in place to ensure that new homes are energy efficient.\n\n\u201cIf it passes, it\u2019s just going to make things more expensive,\u201d said Lori Graf, chief executive of the association. She said California, deep in the throes of its own housing crisis, should not set the example for Montgomery.\n\n[How teen girls are changing the face of environmental activism]\n\nAccording to California\u2019s Energy Commission, the mandate \u2014 which takes effect in January \u2014 will add between $8,000 and $10,000 to the cost of a home, then save an average of $80 a month on utility bills. In Maryland, installing solar panels on a home costs $12,028 to $16,272, Graf said.\n\nA recent report from the Urban Institute found that the Washington region needs to add 374,000 housing units by 2030, more than 75 percent of which must serve low- and middle-income families. It found that Montgomery must add 23,100 low-cost units, the most of any jurisdiction.\n\nElrich noted that such housing would come from apartment complexes, not single-family homes, and Adam Ortiz, the county\u2019s director for its Department of Environmental Protection, said a solar panel mandate would not interfere with that goal.\n\n\u201cSolar panels provide efficiency and cost savings over time,\u201d said Ortiz, an Elrich appointee. \u201cThis has been proven thousands of times over in Montgomery County.\u201d\n\nSeveral affordable housing advocates said it is hard to ascertain the impact on housing until they see the actual bill.\n\nGraf argued for introducing incentives rather than mandates, saying that home buyers should be allowed to choose whether they want solar panels on their roofs.\n\n\n\nMontgomery County students rally outside the Silver Spring Metro station on Sept. 20 as part of the international climate strike. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nMontgomery County Council member Hans Riemer (D-At Large) said it is likely he would vote for the bill if it was introduced, though he worried it would detract from more significant environmental policies.\n\n\u201cThis will barely move the needle,\u201d Riemer said, noting that unlike California, most of the county\u2019s new residential developments are apartment buildings and mixed-use dwellings, not single-family homes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to see this as a substitute for something that would make a real difference.\u201d\n\n[Md. officials deny permit for solar farm Georgetown U. sought to build]\n\nRiemer argued that Montgomery should focus its efforts on utility-scale solar projects, or solar farms, including placing them on land that is part of the county\u2019s agricultural reserves.\n\nHis comments touched on what Julia Pyper, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who followed California\u2019s decision closely, described as a long-standing debate among renewable energy advocates on the merits of \u201cdistributed versus large-scale solar.\u201d\n\nOrtiz, however, said that in the face of increasingly urgent climate change, all options have to be explored. For Montgomery to achieve \u201cnet zero,\u201d meaning that each building generates as much renewable energy as it needs to operate, the county would need approximately 8,700 acres of solar panels, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to make a difference, we need an \u2018all of the above\u2019 strategy,\u201d said Ortiz, whose department is reviewing the county building code and plans to recommend additional updates.\n\nDavid Blockstein, an environmental scientist based in Takoma Park, called the solar panel mandate a small but necessary step in what should be a package of drastic policy changes. While Montgomery is ahead of other jurisdictions in clean energy, he said, it is still woefully behind compared to the rate of climate change.\n\nElrich, who launched his political career in Takoma Park, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis would have been bold if we did it in 1960,\u201d he said. \u201cBold would be doing things we can\u2019t do. This, we can.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C. region\u2019s leaders face big challenges as they tackle affordable-housing shortage\n\nAs demand for solar energy grows, D.C. job training offers both employment and community results\n\nMaryland officials deny permit for solar farm that Georgetown University wanted to build\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich says he wants to require solar panels on new homes by 2022.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BqAZpAWQV9JfdFzQeeNa01t7Nqw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UM3PTLXABQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
