The union says job security and wages are key issues in the negotiations.\n\nWork-to-rule means staff will only do tasks they're explicitly required to do. Office staff won't supervise students, and education assistants will refuse to be left in classrooms without a teacher present.\n\nThere are about 55,000 school support staff in Ontario. They include clerical staff, school custodians and educational assistants.\n\nStudent safety won't be compromised, says union\n\n\"It's become harder and harder to do more with less,\" said Sherry Wallace, a former educational assistant and the president of CUPE Local 2357.\n\nThe local represents about 2,500 permanent and casual education workers in the Ottawa Catholic School Board.\n\n\"It used to be one educational assistant [for] sometimes to two three students, max. We're now looking at, sometimes, it's one educational assistant [for] five to seven,\" Wallace said.\n\nEven if its members begin work-to-rule Monday, they won't compromise the safety of any students, Wallace pledged.\n\nSherry Wallace is a former educational assistant and the president of CUPE Local 2357, which represents about 2,500 permanent and casual education workers in the Ottawa Catholic School Board. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\n'This is very challenging'\n\nUnder work-to-rule, staff won't take on extra activities for students \u2014 like leading choir practices, for example, or organizing sports \u2014 on their breaks or after school, Wallace said.\n\n\"We wouldn't be staying later, volunteering and doing the extra things that we have been doing and essentially [have been] taken for granted, unfortunately,\" she said.\n\nFor the Catholic board, all school support workers aside from custodial staff could begin reducing their workload Monday. That includes educational assistants, early childhood educators, sign language interpreters, developmental education staff, clerical staff, library technicians and some technical and central administrative staff.\n\n\"They are scared, and for so many reasons. Mostly because they don't want this to look badly on them. So that's the biggest fear,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"They love, they're very passionate about what they do. This is very challenging for them.\"\n\nGovernment focused on reaching deal\n\nThe Ford government has said it's focused on reaching a deal that keeps kids in the classroom.\n\n\"It is deeply disappointing that CUPE has decided to end talks this weekend, and proceed with a partial withdrawal of services, despite a limited number of outstanding items at the table,\" said Minister of Education Stephen Lecce in a statement Sunday.\n\nLecce said the province offered proposals to address compensation, job security and funding for additional staffing.\n\n\"We remain fully committed to resuming discussions with CUPE to reach an agreement quickly to provide predictability to parents and students. On my direction, through our mediator, we have asked for additional bargaining dates to bring everyone back to the table so that we can ensure our kids remain in class,\" said Lecce.\n\nFor the French public school board in Ottawa, the Conseil des \u00e9coles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario, custodial and clerical staff, library technicians and IT employees would be working to rule. The support staff for students and teachers inside the classroom are under a different union and wouldn't be working to rule.\n\nFor the French Catholic school board, the Conseil des \u00e9coles catholiques du Centre-Est, only custodial staff would be working to rule. This affects all the French public elementary schools and the Marie-Rivier, Ange-Gabriel and Jeanne-Lajoie high schools.\n\nThe Catholic board's other high schools, administrative offices, Acad\u00e9mie catholique Notre-Dame, \u00c9ducation Permanente, and the Centre professionnel et technique Minto will not be affected by a work-to-rule campaign.\n\nNo support workers with the Ottawa Carleton District School Board are unionized under CUPE.", "description": "Hundreds of Ottawa-area school support workers are set to\u00a0stop participating in\u00a0extracurricular activities Monday morning as part of a work-to-rule campaign after weekend contract talks failed to reach a deal.", "authors": ["Krystalle Ramlakhan Is A Multi-Platform Journalist With Cbc Ottawa.
