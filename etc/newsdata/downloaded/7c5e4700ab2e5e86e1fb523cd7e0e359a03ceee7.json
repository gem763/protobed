But Granada are only the third promoted team to ever be top of La Liga as late as this\n\nThe first cl\u00e1sico weekend has a habit of shaping the season, a glimpse of the way things are and the way they\u2019re going to be, pieces starting to fall into place. Take last year, when Barcelona beat Madrid 5-1 at the Camp Nou in Week 10, got Julen Lopetegui the sack and won the league. Or the year before when they got a 3-0 victory at the Bernab\u00e9u in Week 17 and won the league; the year before that when Madrid got an 90th-minute Sergio Ramos equaliser that felt like a winner in Week 14, held on to top spot and finished as champions; or the year before that when, in Week 12, Barcelona beat Madrid 4-0 en route to claiming La Liga. Actually, take almost every year for over a decade. Ten of the last 13 teams to win the first cl\u00e1sico won the league and 13 of the last 15 teams to come out of cl\u00e1sico weekend top went on to take the title.\n\nSid Lowe (@sidlowe) How the first Clasico tends to shape the season. Show your workings, they say. pic.twitter.com/94rzI7lAOR\n\nThis time, the team that emerged from cl\u00e1sico weekend top are: Granada.\n\nThat\u2019s Granada, the newly-promoted club whose manager insists that never mind winning the league all he wants to do is play in it. Forget success, it\u2019s about survival. Forget being first: even if it\u2019s only a few days and has got a little asterisk by it, Diego Mart\u00ednez says he\u2019s not even looking at the table and nor are his players, busy doing what their manager says as usual. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at the numbers,\u201d defender Germ\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez insisted on Sunday, lying quite a lot, let\u2019s face it, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be like this, but this is what\u2019s taken us so far.\u201d\n\nEuropean roundup: Minnows Granada top Liga, PSG hammer Marseille Read more\n\nIt has taken them further than anyone imagined and further than anyone, full stop. And just because Germ\u00e1n says he\u2019s not looking at the numbers doesn\u2019t mean no one else can: the Granada starting XI that beat Betis 1-0 on Sunday cost \u20ac6.1m. Only one of them played in the first division last season, and he only started five times. These are players, their manager says, who\u2019ve been \u201cdown in the mud\u201d. As for him, he\u2019s 38, the youngest in La Liga and he\u2019d never been in primera before, either. Their salary cap is \u20ac35.46m, only ahead of Valladolid (\u20ac32.03m) and Mallorca (\u20ac29.96m), making them the 18th poorest club and making their limit 18 times lower than Barcelona\u2019s, at \u20ac671.43m. And yet here are the numbers that matter most: they\u2019ve won six, have 20 points, and their league position is one.\n\nGranada finished week 10 top, the seventh leader this season. In part that\u2019s because this was a cl\u00e1sico weekend without a cl\u00e1sico \u2013 and, whisper it, but it was actually quite nice \u2013 but only in part. The postponement of Madrid\u2019s visit to the Camp Nou after the trouble in Barcelona and the league\u2019s determination not to let it become a political platform means Spain\u2019s big two will have a game in hand until 18 December. Realistically, they\u2019ll have already overtaken Granada by then, as might any of the top seven \u2013 currently separated by just three points \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t make this less impressive. \u201cUnthinkable,\u201d Mart\u00ednez called it.\n\nLaLiga (@LaLigaEN) There's a new leader in #LaLigaSantander... \ud83d\udc51\n\n\n\nHighlights as @GranadaCdeF beat Real Betis to go \ud83d\udd1d! #GranadaRealBetis pic.twitter.com/MLOBWKK1iU\n\nGranada\u2019s fans had started gathering at 11am. By the time the team bus arrived, soon after noon, there were thousands outside Los C\u00e1rmenes. \u201cSpectacular,\u201d the manager called it. \u201cI got goosebumps.\u201d At one end of the ground, a huge banner was unfurled, Oliver Atom and his teammates in Granada\u2019s red and white hoops. They knew a win would put them top, where they hadn\u2019t been for 46 years. They\u2019d never been there this late in a season. And they\u2019d never expected to be there again. But an \u00c1lvaro Vadillo goal means that there they are, 10 weeks in \u2013 just about the time the table gets taken seriously.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. When Granada went down in 2016-17, they won four games all season; they\u2019ve won more already this time. They collapsed in crisis back then, Tony Adams taking over for the final weeks, knowing hope had already sailed. They used 39 players from 21 countries, most of whom they didn\u2019t own. John Jiang, the owner, had bought virtually an empty shell from Gianni Pozzo: the stadium wasn\u2019t theirs, the training ground wasn\u2019t either, 13 of the squad were on loan and only 44 of 106 players across the first team, second team and under-19s belonged to them. Adams fielded a team of 11 different nationalities \u2013 if team was ever the right word.\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen fast, but things did eventually change after Antonio Cord\u00f3n, Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Monterrubio and Fran S\u00e1nchez took over the running of the club \u2013 12 of the squad are now from Andaluc\u00eda, for a start \u2013 although the legacy was not easily overcome. The former president Quique Pina was charged with money laundering and bugs were found at the stadium and the training ground, hidden inside smoke detectors. Granada finished 10th in that first season in segunda.\n\nBy the start of the second season there, they employed Diego Mart\u00ednez. By the end, they\u2019d conceded just 28 goals in 42 gamesand finished second, earning automatic promotion back to the top flight. They needed reinforcements but the league reduced their salary cap by almost \u20ac5m. \u201cThe summer was difficult; what we planned for we couldn\u2019t do,\u201d Mart\u00ednez admitted. \u201cBut we came out of it stronger, it brought us together.\u201d\n\nThey drew 4-4 with Villarreal on the opening day, which was unlike them. Next they lost 1-0 at home to Sevilla. But then it began: they won four and drew one of the next five, beating Barcelona 2-0. At the Bernab\u00e9u, they almost turned it around, losing 4-2, Mart\u00ednez gesturing for his players to keep their chins up. Two more wins followed. At Los C\u00e1rmenes they\u2019ve won four in a row, keeping a clean sheet every time. Betis became the third consecutive team to lose 1-0 there, the goal on Sunday an illustration of who Granada are: aggressive, pressing in packs, quick to rob the ball high.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Granada players celebrate after beating Betis.

A full-back who never made it beyond tercera divisi\u00f3n, Mart\u00ednez is a Galician who studied sports science at Granada University \u2013 just across the road from the training ground \u2013 married a woman from Granada and started coaching aged 25 at tiny local teams. He was eventually taken to Sevilla by Monchi, where he stayed for eight years, took the youth team to the title, won promotion with the B team, and finally worked under Unai Emery.\n\nBack in Granada he\u2019s built a group via barbecues and hiking in the hills. He takes inspiration from other coaches in other sports, like Phil Jackson, but he is a born leader, charismatic and convincing. Words are scrawled on the white board \u2013 cohesion, unity, intelligence, maturity, bravery, determination \u2013 and he talks of work, sacrifice and strength, insisting there are no stars; the group is the star. It can sound obvious, cliched, but the squad buys into it. They believe him and that makes it true.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got millions of euros but we have effort, enthusiasm and ambition,\u201d Germ\u00e1n says.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe day Mart\u00ednez took over, he said: \u201cIf I have lemons, I\u2019ll make lemonade; if I have oranges, I\u2019ll make orange juice.\u201d The team is \u201cchameleonic\u201d, he says. On Sunday he noted they have to \u201cwear a lot of different suits during every game\u201d. But, he insists, he will never ask his players to do anything they haven\u2019t worked on in training and it shows. Granada are only the third newly-promoted team ever to be top as late as Week 10. In week two, Mart\u00ednez insited his team had \u201clooked Sevilla in the eye\u201d; now they look at the rest over their shoulder. \u201cThis is like chewing gum \u2013 let\u2019s see how long we can stretch it out,\u201d Germ\u00e1n said. The run, he meant, not the position. \u201cWe know where we come from, and the table is just a quirk,\u201d Vadillo insisted.\n\nYet even if they don\u2019t stay there, even if the dream is salvation as Mart\u00ednez keeps saying and said again this weekend, well, that dream is closer. Just over a third of the way through the season, Granada are already halfway to safety. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely incredible amount, but we\u2019ve worked for them and they\u2019re deserved,\u201d he rightly insisted. Now, they can enjoy them, whatever happens next. At the final whistle, the first manager to take Granada top in almost half a century turned to where supporters leapt and cheered, barely able to believe it, and he roared, clenching his fists. \u201cYou can feel it; they\u2019re enjoying this too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe connection was tremendous, for two hours everyone forgot their problems; when fans identify with you, share your values, it\u2019s extraordinary. How nice it is to be in this situation.\u201d\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 Lega are alive!

No one has more goals than Gerard Moreno and no one has more assists than Santi Cazorla.\n\n\u2022 Osasuna were a stampede, cheered on by El Sadar, a bear pit of a home. They went one down against Valencia. But then, admittedly aided by a red card for Rodrigo, they trampled all over the visitors, racking up 30 shots \u2013 a new La Liga record, and one for every game they have now gone unbeaten at home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Oier Sanjurjo celebrates after scoring Osasuna\u2019s first.
