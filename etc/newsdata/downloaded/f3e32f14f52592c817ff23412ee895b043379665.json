Apart from joining social media platform TikTok recently, he somewhat redeemed the underwhelming live-action Aladdin, launched his own YouTube channel \u2013 which already has about 6.8 million subscribers \u2013 voices a lead character in animation Spies in Disguise coming out later this year, and even narrated the acclaimed National Geographic documentary, One Strange Rock.\n\nFriday was the opening of his latest sci-fi thriller, Gemini Man. In it, Smith plays Henry Brogan, a soldier used for special operations as a skilled sniper.\n\nIn the opening scene, with the help of a spotter, he shoots a man in a speed train from what must be a few kilometres away. This marks 72 kills for him and he\u2019s now looking for a life beyond the rifle scope, one of peace and calmness.\n\nBut the kill on the train was tampered with. The file with this person\u2019s name had been doctored to show that the elderly man was a terrorist to be extinguished. He was, in actual fact, a scientist.\n\nThe film takes on an espionage feel with black binders being read by smartly dressed white folk in trench coats, sitting on benches.\n\nIt is a bit like a Bourne movie but with a black guy who has all his memories.A few complications arise and Henry\u2019s handlers turn on him. They want him gone and they send the perfect assassin for the job \u2013 a younger version of himself.\n\nDirector Ang Lee is probably best known for his work on the absolute cinematic gem Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\n\nIf we took that and held it against this we would conclude that this man has fallen all the way off.Nevertheless, Gemini Man has its moments. There is a motorbike chase and combat sequence that\u2019s almost as inspired as some of what we saw in Crouching Tiger.\n\nWhile it praised the \u201cyouthification\u201d technique used on Smith\u2019s younger doppelg\u00e4nger, The Guardian didn\u2019t like the digital effects used in the film.\n\n\u201cThe technical effect of the film is strange ... Lee is shooting in high frame-rate, which creates a new pin-sharp clarity but at the expense of making the film look like video \u2013 or like a celluloid movie on a plasma TV when you haven\u2019t deactivated motion-smoothing.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t a terrible observation.\n\nIt seems like Lee put all his focus, and budget, on presenting the younger Smith as the main drawing card of this feature.\n\nBut the overall shots selected for the film are pedestrian at best. Gemini Man\u2019s overall look is blatantly synthetic, but not more so than techniques like shooting dry for wet as they did for films like Aquaman.\n\nIn my opinion, directors are forgetting the concept that the story is integral to a good film.\n\nAudiences are getting wiser to the tricks used and the envelope will have to be pushed even further by film creators everywhere, in order to do this.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make the fake stuff look more real. This could be done with a steely approach to writing. Remember that age-old practice? Stop sleeping on that.\n\nYou may recall a small cult classic about a gang of robbers, which took place in two rooms at an abandoned reservoir. Lee would do well to look back and make certain that the scripts he chooses to bring to life are as sharp as the Green Destiny sword in Crouching Tiger.", "description": "Gemini Man uses fancy effects to bring us a younger Will Smith, but the writing is a bit archaic, in Phumlani S Langa's opinion.", "authors": ["Phumlani S Langa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9336/c20240ad032b4c90a28dff7dc2112d13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
