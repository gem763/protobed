They also offer services like blood tests, stitching, and X-rays.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nUrgent care centers can serve as a first step in the patient journey as well by referring patients to follow-up appointments or ERs. Though they should not be used for life-threatening emergencies, urgent care clinics provide easy access to quality healthcare for times when your primary care doctor is unavailable.\n\nThe urgent care market & business model\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, the number of urgent care facilities increased from 6,400 in 2014 to 8,100 in 2018, with another 500 to 600 expected to open. Some 24/7 urgent care centers function like satellite emergency rooms, and incur similar costs, while other centers simply charge copays.\n\nJohn Normile/Getty Images\n\nGenerally speaking, an urgent care visit is a money-saver for patients. A 2016 study in the Annals of Emergency Medicine found that ER treatment costs were about 10 times more (an average of about $2,200) than in an urgent care center (about $168) \u2014 even for patients with the same diagnosis.\n\nBecause of the overlap urgent care centers have with family medicine and emergency medicine, they are typically staffed accordingly with at least one medical physician or specialist, as well as a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or radiologist available to see patients any time the facility is open.\n\nUrgent care staffing models\n\nHenry Schein Medical cites three major urgent care center staffing models:\n\nPhysician Only: The most expensive model that uses no mid-level practitioners. However, it could be the most cost effective options for new centers building their patient base.\n\nMixed Model: A balance of physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners for centers increasing in patient volume.\n\nMid-Level Model: Centers staffed entirely by mid-level staff. This option is suitable for low acuity cases, but may not be equipped to handle more complex patient needs.\n\nTop urgent care providers\n\nUrgent care clinics aren't necessarily run by traditional hospitals or health systems. In fact, 61% of urgent care clinics in Massachusetts are owned by non-hospital chains, per a 2018 Massachusetts Health Policy Commission report.\n\nSome of the largest US urgent care providers include:\n\nAmerican Family Care\n\nCity MD\n\nConcentra\n\nFast Med\n\nGoHealth\n\nHCA CareNow\n\nMedPost\n\nNextCare\n\nPatient First\n\nU.S. Healthworks\n\nUrgent care industry trends & statistics in 2019\n\nInterest in the on-demand, affordable care of urgent care clinics has been growing rapidly. According to the Urgent Care Association (UCA), the total number of urgent care centers in the U.S. reached 8,774 in November 2018 \u2014 up eight percent from 8,125 in 2017. St. Louis Urgent Cares Apple\n\nLaurel Stoimenoff, PT, CHC, CEO of UCA, says that urgent care clinics handle about 89 million patient visits each year, which includes more than 29% of all primary care visits in the US, and nearly 15% of all outpatient physician visits.\n\nAnd nearly all of those visits are more convenient and affordable than a trip to the ER; the UCA's 2018 Benchmarking Report found that more than 70% of patients waited less than 20 minutes to see a provider at an urgent care center, and nearly 94% were seen in less than 30 minutes. Overall, 85% of urgent care centers patients are taken care of in under an hour.\n\n\"Urgent care centers play an increasingly vital role in the continuum of care, providing services for a wide array of patients who may be unable to see a primary care physician for various reasons, including simply not yet affiliating with one,\" said Stoimenoff.\n\nThis is especially true of millennials, who are leading the way in driving demand and increased utilization of urgent care centers; Business Insider Intelligence research shows that nearly half of millennials (45%) do not have a primary care physician \u2014 largely due to providers' failure to create a consumer-oriented healthcare experience.\n\nAnd as Baby Boomers continue aging into Medicare, the number of Medicare and Medicaid patients seeking services at urgent care centers continues to grow, accounting for nearly 27% of all visits in 2018.\n\nMore to Learn\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence has been following the transforming landscape of digital health, including how the explosive growth of urgent care clinics is shaking up the traditional healthcare landscape \u2014 and what it means for payers, providers, manufacturers, and medical supplies distributors.\n\nOur first Digital Health Ecosystem Report explores the current healthcare ecosystem, the key trends driving digital transformation, and where the industry is headed.
