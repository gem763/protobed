REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank\u2019s (DBKGn.DE) chief executive Christian Sewing will spend 15% of his monthly net salary buying the German lender\u2019s shares starting in September, a regulatory filing showed on Monday.\n\nThe filing makes official a pledge Sewing made in July, when he announced a major restructuring of the bank.\n\nSewing said at the time he would invest a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of his fixed salary in the bank. The CEO, who is shaking up Deutsche Bank to try to revive its profitability, said in July he wanted to put his money where his mouth was.\n\nSewing will buy roughly 21,250 euros ($23,681.00) in shares around the 22nd of each month through to the end of 2022, the filing said. That would result in a total investment of around 850,000 euros, based on monthly purchases up to the end of 2022.\n\nDeutsche Bank shares hit a record low of 5.78 euros per share on Aug. 16. At 1203 GMT on Monday, Deutsche\u2019s shares were at 6.64 euros each, up 1.1%. They are down 4.7% so far this year.\n\nLast month, Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner bought nearly 1 million euros of the bank\u2019s shares.", "description": "Deutsche Bank's chief executive Christian Sewing will spend 15% of his monthly net salary buying the German lender's shares starting in September, a regulatory filing showed on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425394518&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8110P"}
