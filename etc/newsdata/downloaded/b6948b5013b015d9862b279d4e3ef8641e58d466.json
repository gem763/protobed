REUTERS/Bryan Woolston/File Photo\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s monthly strike report showed 46,000 General Motors employees were idle at the automaker\u2019s plants in Michigan and Kentucky during the October payrolls count. Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the period are treated as unemployed.\n\nThe figure published by the government is only for striking workers. The GM strike by members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union started on Sept. 16, with ripple effects on the auto industry that economists said bumped up claims for unemployment benefits early in October.\n\nThe strike depressed manufacturing output in September.\n\nDrawing comparisons with the 1998 strike at GM, economists expect the current work stoppage to cut off between 75,000 and 80,000 jobs from October nonfarm payrolls. The estimates include industry layoffs related to the GM strike.\n\n\u201cThe effects of this strike would wipe out most of September\u2019s job growth,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cThis is a crash we can see coming, but it is one that will be temporary.\u201d\n\nThe government will publish its closely watched employment report for October next Friday. Payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs in September, below the monthly average of 161,000 this year. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.\n\nWEAK DATA STREAM\n\nGM and the UAW reached a tentative deal last week. The union said workers would stay off the job while they vote on the proposed four-year contract. Voting that could end the strike was expected to conclude on Friday.\n\nAccording to a preliminary Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 90,000 jobs in October. The household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived would likely consider the striking workers as employed. Still, economists are forecasting the unemployment rate rising to 3.6% this month from a near 50-year low of 3.5% in September.\n\nThough payrolls growth is likely to pick up again, the small monthly gain could still rattle financial markets already on edge following a raft of weak data, including September retail sales, durable goods orders and manufacturing production. Collectively, these reports have cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record.\n\nThe expansion, now in its 11th year, is being hamstrung by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business confidence and weighed on business investment.\n\nA strike by public school teachers in Chicago could temper expectations for a rebound in job growth in November.\n\n\u201cIf the 25,000 Chicago teachers are still on strike next month, the bounce-back in November payrolls will look a little more muted,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.", "description": "A strike by General Motors workers should weigh on U.S. job growth in October, government data showed on Friday.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444920166&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1G9", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
