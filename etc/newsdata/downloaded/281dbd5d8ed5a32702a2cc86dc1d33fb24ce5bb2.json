Despite second-quarter revenue and EPS coming in slightly ahead of consensus estimates, but investors are concerned that the company\u2019s slowing growth could be a sign that competitors like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) will be eating into Slack\u2019s market share.\n\nSeveral analysts have weighed in on Slack since the report. Here\u2019s a sampling of what they\u2019ve had to say.\n\nSlowing Growth\n\nBloomberg Technology analyst Nico Grant said Slack\u2019s best simply wasn\u2019t good enough for the market.\n\n\u201cThe company is decelerating, and so whether we consider the revenue forecast for fiscal 2020, which was just short of the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, or if we consider the growth in the number of paid customers and large customers, but for many metrics Slack is not growing as quickly as quickly as it once did,\u201d Grant said.\n\nBarclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said the second quarter numbers may help get Slack and Wall Street on the same page.\n\n\u201cWe believe Slack and investors are still only getting used to each other, which is causing some growing pains,\u201d Lenschow wrote in a note.\n\nMKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said reports of a one-time service outage let some of the air out of an otherwise impressive quarter.\n\nView more earnings on WORK\n\n\u201cWe are willing to give a pass to a new public company as fundamentals and metrics remain solid with (surprising) baby steps towards profitability,\u201d Kulkarni wrote.\n\nBuying Opportunity\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said Slack\u2019s second quarter was solid, but market expectations had simply set the bar too high to reach.\n\n\u201cWhile Slack missed the market's expectations for a greater acceleration in billings growth in Q2, the fundamental value proposition and large market opportunity at Slack remain unchanged,\u201d Weiss wrote.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin said $8 million in customer credits related to the outage took a bite out of second-quarter numbers.\n\n\u201cWe are raising estimates slightly and maintain an upward bias based on a snapback in reliability, strong enterprise traction, and a new shared channel offering that could spark strong growth in the second half,\u201d Bracelin wrote.\n\nRatings And Price Targets\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $38 target.\n\nBarclays has an Overweight rating and $44 target.\n\nMKM has a Buy rating and $38 target.\n\nKeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $44 target.\n\nSlack shares traded around $30 per share at time of publication, down 3% after initially dropping more than 14%.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nWhat Wall Street Analysts Think About Slack's Stock\n\nWhitney Tilson: 'I Think We Are In An IPO Bubble'\n\nLatest Ratings for WORK\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Maintains Buy Sep 2019 Maintains Neutral Sep 2019 Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for WORK\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
