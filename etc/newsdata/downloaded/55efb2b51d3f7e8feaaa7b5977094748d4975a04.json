We want to be at the forefront of this state-of-the-art chip packaging technology.\"\n\nSee also:", "description": "Samsung has developed the industry's first 12-layer 3D-TSV (Through Silicon Via) technology, allowing for the stacking of 12 DRAM chips and paving the way for 24GB High Bandwidth Memory.", "authors": ["Adrian Kingsley-Hughes"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/07/3812655e-dd32-4026-9234-e57b6ea4acd6/thumbnail/770x578/abef4c07ca68e7fed032f7d72f6a87c5/2019-10-07-13-02-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
