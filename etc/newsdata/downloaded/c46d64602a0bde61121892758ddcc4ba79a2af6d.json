Presented by\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reads a statement announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on Tuesday, Sept. 24. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nHOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI yesterday: \u201cIn the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote: \u2018The times have found us.\u2019 The times found them to fight for and establish our democracy. The times have found us today, not to place ourselves in the same category of greatness as our Founders, but to place us in the urgency of protecting and defending our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. In the words of Ben Franklin, to keep our Republic.\u201d Transcript of Pelosi\u2019s remarks \u2026 Video\n\nIN OTHER WORDS \u2026 IT\u2019S HAPPENING. THE HOUSE will begin impeachment proceedings against the president for the third time in American history. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll be impeached for. We aren\u2019t sure when. We don\u2019t know what the whistleblower has on President DONALD TRUMP or how significant it is.\n\nBUT what we do know is that PELOSI and her leadership gave into a restive House Democratic Caucus, which was demanding TRUMP be held accountable for a series of what it considers brazen and illegal acts.\n\nSO, yesterday was seismic -- but it was also, in some ways, a bit meaningless.\n\nFIRST, read Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney\u2019s story, which posted Tuesday night\n\nNOW, TO UNPACK IT \u2026 AFTER A LONG DAY OF STANDING in the Capitol basement Tuesday, our colleagues Kyle and Andrew posed this very interesting question in the POLITICO corner of the press gallery: What exactly did PELOSI\u2019S statement -- that the House was launching an impeachment inquiry into TRUMP -- change? Not much at all, they argued.\n\nAT FIRST, we thought they were wrong. But after thinking about it for a minute, we decided there\u2019s a healthy bit of truth to Cheney and Desiderio\u2019s take: PELOSI\u2019S statement didn\u2019t actually change a whole lot. It was mostly window dressing.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHY: House committees have been investigating TRUMP for months. The Judiciary Committee was always readying to draft articles of impeachment. They were always trying to finish it up before 2020. An \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is just a name -- it\u2019s not an official process that the House has now begun. There will be no vote on the floor to start the impeachment inquiry process. There\u2019s no magic unleashed now that PELOSI has said she\u2019s begun an impeachment inquiry. So, in many ways, there\u2019s nothing new here.\n\nBUT AT THE SAME TIME, EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED -- POLITICALLY. The entire universe has shifted for House Democrats. For months, the leadership was trying to stave off impeachment because they thought it unwise politically, divisive and unnecessary. Now the leadership is full-bore behind it, and the entire caucus is rowing toward a process aimed at removing the president of the United States for how he handled interactions with the leader of Ukraine. Democrats finally believe they found a simple, easy-to-understand charge.\n\n-- NYT\u2019S CARL HULSE on A1: \u201cIn contrast to the murkiness of the special counsel\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, Democrats see the current allegations as damningly clear-cut.\n\n\u201cHis refusal so far to provide Congress with an intelligence official\u2019s whistle-blower complaint as required by law, coupled with the possibility that Mr. Trump dangled American military aid as a bargaining chip to win investigation of a political rival by a foreign government, strikes them as a stark case of presidential wrongdoing. They consider it egregious enough that they expect many Americans who had been cool to the idea of moving to oust the president to recognize the imperative for the House to act.\u201d NYT\n\nTHE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE now is all but guaranteed to report out an impeachment package in the next few months -- a set of articles charging the president with high crimes and misdemeanors. Our colleague John Bresnahan has been saying this for months, and our reporting shows that it\u2019s true: If the House starts impeachment proceedings -- hearings and the like, as they are -- it will end up voting on impeachment articles on the House floor. Period. So, the full House will get a chance this year to cast a vote or a set of votes about whether the president committed crimes worthy of his removal.\n\nTHERE IS SOME RISK FOR PELOSI AND HOUSE DEMOCRATS. They made a big show Tuesday of the impeachment play. If the transcript and the whistleblower report are duds and they don\u2019t have enough fresh material to justify impeaching impeach Trump, the Dems will have put themselves out on a limb with little to show for it. And if impeachment stretches into 2020 -- which most senior Democratic aides predict it will -- there\u2019s risk in that, as well. Judiciary Chairman JERRY NADLER said in a closed-door meeting Tuesday that he wanted this process to be quick, and finish by year\u2019s end.\n\nTHIS SITUATION PLAYS INTO WHAT MANY BELIEVE ARE PELOSI\u2019S STRENGTHS. Like many leaders, she\u2019s strongest when her party is united. And, perhaps for the first time in a while, they are united against this president, both in substance and in process. She has challenges here -- not least managing the process, which could grow unruly quickly. But, unlike a week ago, the entire caucus is working toward a single goal.\n\nWHAT THE LEADERSHIP IS WATCHING FOR: On Tuesday evening, much of the leadership was tired and drained. Almost to a person, they thought that Pelosi had changed the name of the process to \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d but not the substance of the investigation. We are in uncharted waters, so it\u2019s not entirely clear to anyone what will happen next.\n\n-- BIG PICTURE: The committees are going to begin funnelling all of their \u201cbest\u201d impeachment material to Judiciary, which is going to tie everything into a single package. At the beginning of this Congress, Judiciary began to hire top-notch lawyers in anticipation for an uptick in oversight, so in that sense, it is prepared. WaPo\u2019s Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade: \u201cHouse\u2019s move toward impeachment leaves gaping questions about the road ahead\u201d\n\nONE OF THE DEMOCRATS\u2019 challenges is finding an overarching message and sticking to it. This was a complaint in the Dem caucus yesterday. Rank-and-file Dems are concerned they aren\u2019t articulating a good reason why they\u2019re impeaching Trump. One of leadership and Judiciary\u2019s challenges here is to latch onto a message -- and a messenger -- and carry it through what\u2019s expected to be a long and bruising process. Some have suggested that enumerating concerns about national security should be front and center. Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle on Dem messaging concerns\n\n-- THIS WEEK: The Dems caucus this morning, the Republicans have their conference meeting and both will hold media availabilities afterwards. Predictably, both sides are in their corners. TRUMP has a press conference at 4 p.m., so everyone will be watching to see his demeanor. Everyone is looking to see what deal HOUSE INTELLIGENCE cuts with the whistleblower, who now is indicating he wants to talk to Congress.\n\nTHE TRANSCRIPT \u2026 OF COURSE, people are anxious to see the transcript the White House releases of the call between TRUMP and the Ukranian president, but Hill aides caution that it should be seen for what it is \u2014 a document released by the White House. First of all, we have no idea if the whistleblower report is solely based on that call. Second, we have no idea if there was only one call, or more. Third, we don\u2019t know if the transcript will be edited at all, let alone whether it will simply be notes rather than a word-for-word transcription. The whistleblower report -- and what the whistleblower tells Congress -- is truly important. The whistleblower\u2019s attorney says he plans to talk to Congress\n\nTHURSDAY will be quite the day. At 9 a.m., JOSEPH MAGUIRE, the acting director of national intelligence, will be on Capitol Hill testifying in an open setting. This is probably the biggest public moment so far.\n\nREMEMBER: The House is leaving Friday afternoon for a two-week recess. The next day in session is Oct. 15. This recess is not going to be canceled, our sources tell us.\n\nA message from Blue Cross Blue Shield Association: No one should have to worry about surprise bills or costly negotiations to settle them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working to protect patients with simple and predictable payments that will help keep costs down. Separate the myths from the facts. See how to end surprise bills without raising costs.\n\nHOW IT PLAYED IN THE PAPERS \u2026 NYT, two-line, double-deck headline: \u201cPELOSI WILL OPEN FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, ACCUSING PRESIDENT OF \u2018BETRAYAL\u2019 OF THE NATION\u201d \u2026 WAPO: \u201cHouse opens impeachment inquiry\u201d \u2026 WSJ: \u201cImpeachment Inquiry Begins\u201d\n\nHOW THE PRESIDENT REACTED -- \u201cTrump says impeachment drive is a plus, yet tweets with fury,\u201d by AP\u2019s Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller\n\n-- HOW HIS ALLIES REACTED, VIA NANCY COOK: \u201cIn public, Trump world is casting the Democratic impeachment inquiry as more white noise. In private, White House aides and allies say the impeachment momentum is now presenting a serious threat to the rest of President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, to his negotiating strength with world leaders and to his concentration.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WSJ OP-ED: \u201cThe Impeachment Congress\u201d\n\nGood Wednesday morning.

Giuliani \u2014 to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said.\n\n\u201cThe sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments \u2014 all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani\u2019s activities from news reports.\n\n\u201c\u2018Rudy \u2014 he did all of this,\u2019 one U.S. official said. \u2018This s---show that we\u2019re in \u2014 it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\n-- GIULIANI RESPONDS TO FOX NEWS\u2019 LAURA INGRAHAM: \u201cAnd you know who I did it at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it. And then I reported to every conversation back to them. Laura, I\u2019m a pretty good lawyer, just a country lawyer, but it\u2019s all here, right here. The first call from the State Department.\u201d Video\n\nYES, THIS IS A FAMILIAR EXPRESSION, but it makes no sense from Giuliani. He\u2019s not a country lawyer. He was born in New York, went to NYU law school and worked all his life in New York and Washington.\n\n-- NYT\u2019S ANNIE KARNI: \u201cTrump\u2019s Calls With World Leaders Are Freewheeling, but Few Have Access\u201d: \u201cWhile Mr. Trump is on a call, his national security adviser is typically either in the room with him or listening in from his West Wing office. Typically, the adviser is joined by the senior director for the head of state\u2019s region, as well as intelligence officials working from the White House Situation Room who connect the call and help to produce a rough transcript almost immediately after its conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe secretary of state can listen in if he requests, according to one former administration official. Vice President Mike Pence will also frequently join Mr. Trump on a call with a foreign leader, often at the request of Mr. Trump, according to an aide. \u2026\n\n\u201cBut the National Security Council\u2019s meticulous process of scheduling them, preparing for them, and keeping a record of them has not changed dramatically during the Trump administration. The only difference, according to four former and current administration officials familiar with the process, is the \u2018extreme steps\u2019 that have been taken to limit who can listen in on those calls or later read the transcript, for fear of leaks.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHAT DIDN\u2019T TAKE LONG \u2026 ALEX ISENDSTADT: \u201cGOP cashes in on impeachment\u201d: \u201cRepublicans are latching onto conservative outrage over the push to impeach President Donald Trump \u2014 and turning it into a 2020 fundraising bonanza. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee on Tuesday sent an array of fundraising emails inviting conservatives to donate and join the \u2018Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,\u2019 which was described as a group \u2018made up of only President Trump\u2019s most LOYAL supporters, the ones committed to fighting for him, re-electing him, and taking back the House.\u2019\n\n\u201cBy the end of the day, party officials said, the fundraising offensive had netted around $1 million. The effort demonstrates how the GOP sees the impeachment push as a tool to stoke the grievances of the Trump base and monetize the president\u2019s clashes with Democrats ahead of 2020. Party officials, who for months have been playing to Trump supporters\u2019 distaste of the left through a merchandising effort, are convinced the inquiry could turn into a cash windfall \u2014 and not just for Trump himself.\u201d POLITICO\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- MARC CAPUTO: \u201cBiden's support crumbles in early state, Florida polls\u201d: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s poll numbers are crumbling in the early nominating states that matter most. Once the dominant front-runner in the Democratic primary, Biden is now marginally trailing Elizabeth Warren in the first caucus state of Iowa and the first primary state of New Hampshire. His South Carolina firewall shows signs of cracking and he's losing his once-overwhelming lead in Florida, according to a raft of recent polling.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s descent has been months in the making, the result of continuous fire from progressives, questions about his age and stamina, a drumbeat of negative coverage over lackluster debate performances and frequent misstatements, according to pollsters and party insiders. They also point to a campaign message that at times over-emphasized attacking President Trump and his claim to be the \u2018most electable\u2019 Democrat in the field.\n\n\u201cBut perhaps the biggest factor has been the rise of Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has served up a steady diet of grassroots outreach and in-depth policy proposals that have endeared her to progressives.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTRUMP\u2019S WEDNESDAY -- The president will leave Trump Tower at 9:30 a.m. He will arrive at the InterContinental New York Barclay and participate in a multilateral meeting on Venezuela.

Michael Flynn over work the pair did for Turkish interests during the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cU.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga, who presided over the weeklong trial of Bijan Rafiekian in July in Alexandria, Virginia, ruled that prosecutors put forward insufficient proof to sustain the jury\u2019s finding that Rafiekian knowingly operated as a Turkish government agent and intentionally failed to notify U.S. officials about his work.\n\n\u201cThere is no substantial evidence that Rafiekian agreed to operate subject to the direction or control of the Turkish government,\u201d Trenga wrote as he ordered the acquittal of the 67-year-old Iranian-American businessman and former board member for the U.S. Export-Import Bank.\u201d POLITICO\n\nIRAN LATEST -- \u201cMacron Tried to Broker Meeting Between Trump, Iran\u2019s President,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Laurence Norman and Michael R.

If we seek to pursue higher goals to benefit both countries, both people, it must be planned, and talks must be based on those plans. But prior to that, we must create mutual trust, and the trust that is something that Mr. Trump took away from this framework. We had an agreement.

Sam Graves hired me for $250/month to work on his state Senate campaign. I slept in the office and showered at the YMCA in Chillicothe, Mo. My parents thought I was nuts.\u201d Playbook Plus Q&A\n\nBIRTHDAYS: Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) is 58 \u2026 Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) is 75 \u2026 Rep.

We\u2019re connecting patients to the information they need to make to make the best choices for their health care--with information on out of pocket costs, and the quality of care that doctors and hospitals provide. See how we empower consumers to get the best care at the most affordable price.\n\nFollow us on Twitter Anna Palmer @apalmerdc\n\n\n\nJake Sherman @JakeSherman", "description": "And Joe Biden's support crumbles in early state and Florida polls.", "authors": ["Follow Us On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/61/55/7bec324c40178676750c10cc50e5/190925-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
