It is the moment at which a quantum computer is able to do something that a classical computer could not.\n\nReaching that point would be significant because it would seem to prove the promise that scientists have been making for decades: that an entirely new kind of computer could be created that would allow for wholly fresh \u2013 and vastly improved \u2013 ways of dealing with data. That, in turn, could revolutionise the world.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Scientists claim to have achieved \"quantum supremacy\" Show all 17 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Scientists are excited about the possibility of achieving quantum supremacy because of what it means about the process of creating really useful quantum computers, not necessarily as an end in itself.\n\nThe phrase is also disputed for many reasons. Researchers including John Preskill, who first coined the phrase, have noted that it can give unnecessary hype around our understanding of quantum computers, and that it has an unfortunate echo of white supremacy.\n\nWhat's more, the very importance of the test is disputed, too. That's in part because it is difficult to say exactly when quantum supremacy has been reached, because researchers could discover that any given process was actually possible to complete on a classical computer all along.\n\nHow does quantum computing work?\n\nTo understand how a quantum computer works, it's important first to understand how a traditional one works. Everything from the phone in your pocket to the computer in your desk \u2013 and all the other places that computers appear \u2013 do so using the paradigm of classic computing, which has stayed strong for years but which quantum computers could compete with, if not displace.\n\nIn a traditional computer, everything in the memory is represented as a series of bits, which work as a binary system: they are either 1 or 0, on or off. Those bits can be assembled into the vast and complex information processing systems that we use every day, by stringing them together and analysing the data they together represent.\n\nA quantum computer works instead with qubits, not bits \u2013 they are no longer binary, but instead can be in a number of different states. By exploiting the unusual behaviour described in quantum mechanics, scientists are able to build quantum computers, which operate at that more complex and therefore more powerful level.\n\nJust as in a traditional computer, those qubits can be assembled into a system and used to carry out operations. In a quantum computer, that is made up of a series of quantum gates, which can in turn be assembled into a quantum circuit.\n\nThat \u2013 or a vastly longer, almost impossibly more complex version of that \u2013 is how we get to a quantum computer, which is able to exploit those various strange phenomena and use them to run operations.\n\nTheoretically, those quantum computers and their entirely new paradigm should allow scientists to conduct those operations more quickly and in new ways. It's that which leads us to quantum superiority \u2013 and to the variety of other possibilities that lie after it.\n\nWhat is Google's 'Sycamore'?\n\nGoogle's great achievement \u2013 and it is certainly not the only company to try \u2013 is to boil down that complexity into a functioning quantum computer. The successful chip wasn't the first of Google's experiments, and there are more likely to come or probably already being used already, but it is the one that will go down in history as perhaps achieving the first great landmark in quantum computing.\n\nThe Sycamore chip is a 54-qubit processor. That is relatively limited, and is one of the many reasons that the discovery is not practically useful \u2013 researchers want a 100-qubit or even 200-qubit system before they are really able to put it to the test, and see whether the dreams of quantum computing are realised.\n\nBut the big breakthrough is just how high-fidelity and fast the gates that make up the computer are. Scientists have lauded the precision with which the system works, and it is that which allowed Google to make its announcement.\n\nThe actual process that it did to prove its quantum supremacy was relatively simple in output: it just gave out random numbers. But it was the workings behind it that were such a breakthrough, since it used an algorithm that would take 10,000 years to give a similar output on a classical computer, but only 200 seconds on Google's Sycamore.", "description": "Scientists have finally claimed to reach quantum supremacy, a landmark in an industry that could change the world.
