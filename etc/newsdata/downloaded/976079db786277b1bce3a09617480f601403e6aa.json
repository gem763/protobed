I have no family in the UK so I was also thinking, \u2018How do I get myself home?\u2019.\n\n\u201cInitially when I got the letter I really wanted to leave actually because I just felt it was so hostile and evidently they just want to drive me out the country.\n\n\u201cBut all the support from strangers and the British public and people from the NHS has made me want to stay.\u201d\n\nAfter Dr Chiang\u2019s student visa expired in June, her application for a new working visa was rejected in August due to a Home Office rule which states an applicant\u2019s bank balance cannot drop below \u00a3945 in the 90 days beforehand.\n\nDr Chiang said she had more than that amount in savings and the bank account she used for the application had the correct money by the end of each month, but had dropped below for a few days in one of them.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I know I can't change things as one person, but I just wish they would look into their policies a bit more and maybe scrutinise what\u2019s actually important in letting somebody stay.\u201d\n\nDr Rinesh Parmar, vice chairman of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, told The Independent the threat to deport Dr Chiang over a \u201ctechnicality\u201d after she has studied, trained and worked in this country \u201cshows flagrant disregard for the contribution that Dr Chiang has made and continues to make to our society\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAt a time when the NHS is short of around 10,000 doctors, the threatened deportation of Dr Chiang is extremely worrying.\n\n\u201cGiving a junior doctor working in the UK just 10 days to leave the country or face prosecution is not only inhumane, but completely defies common sense.\n\n\u201cThe NHS can ill afford to lose a single doctor and we would urge the Home Office to reconsider.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are reconsidering Ms Chiang\u2019s application now that further evidence has been provided.\u201d", "description": "A junior doctor who has lived in the UK for most of her life has said she felt like packing up and leaving after being told to leave the country\u00a0or face deportation.", "authors": ["Chiara Giordano"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/21/trainee-doctor2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
