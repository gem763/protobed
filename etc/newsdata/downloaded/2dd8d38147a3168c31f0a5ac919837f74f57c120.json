Unionists are furious over the new proposals they allege weaken the territory\u2019s position as part of the United Kingdom. The question of possible extra checks and controls within the UK is highly sensitive.\n\nUnder the new protocol in the UK-EU divorce deal, Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union with the rest of the UK, which wants to pursue an independent trade policy. But, in practice, it would follow EU customs rules and remain aligned with some aspects of the EU's single market.\n\nRead more: What's in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the European Union?\n\n'No checks or tariffs'\n\nEarlier this week the Brexit minister said there would be extra bureaucracy for Northern Irish firms sending goods to the rest of the UK. His comments were slammed by opposition parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), until recently the government\u2019s parliamentary allies.\n\nOn Wednesday Jeremy Corbyn challenged Boris Johnson in the House of Commons, claiming the proposed arrangements would create \u201ca very real border down the Irish Sea\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister told the House of Saturday there would be no checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,\u201d the Labour leader said at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. \u201cYet yesterday the Brexit Secretary confirmed\u2026 that Northern Irish businesses sending goods to Britain would have to complete export declaration forms. Is the prime minister right on this, or is the Brexit Secretary right on this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United Kingdom is preserved whole and entire by these arrangements,\u201d the prime minister replied, adding that the whole of the UK would come out of the EU customs union. \u201cThere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB, and there will be no tariffs between Northern Ireland and GB.\u201d\n\nHis comments prompted a challenge outside parliament from Labour MP Stephen Doughty. \u201cSurely Johnson just misled the house there\u2026?\u201d he asked via Twitter.\n\nOn Monday the UK Brexit minister Stephen Barclay admitted before a parliamentary committee \u2013 after initially denying it \u2013 that under the new deal, firms in Northern Ireland would have to fill out export declaration forms when sending goods to Britain.\n\nOfficial confusion\n\nOther official statements on Wednesday called into question the prime minister\u2019s assertion.\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith also admitted that there would be additional bureaucracy, but insisted it would be kept to a \"minimum\".\n\nThe deal would ensure that \u201cwe get Northern Ireland\u2013GB goods flowing with absolute minimum amount of information required,\u201d he told another committee. \u201cTo have delivered a deal where Northern Ireland maintains that soft border (with Ireland), comes out of the EU, and trades NI to GB and GB to NI\u2026 almost identical to as it is today, is a big achievement.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel \u2013 questioned on who would carry out exit checks between Northern Ireland and Britain \u2013 refused to be drawn. \u201cThe situation depends on various circumstances\u2026 I\u2019m not going to speak about hypothetical situations right now,\u201d she told the Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday.\n\nThe head of the UK\u2019s Border Force \u2013 the government body which carries out immigration and customs controls \u2013 said there may be checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a minimum amount of electronic information which will have to shared on movements from west to east (Northern Ireland to GB),\u201d Paul Lincoln told the same committee, \"It is yet to be worked out in detail with the (European) Commission... in the Joint Committee process as to who will do those checks\".\n\nHowever, he added that checks may not be needed from west to east, as the situation was different for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Britain compared to those going in the opposite direction.\n\nThere will be checks \u2013 at least one way\n\nOn Thursday, the Home Office sent the committee a written clarification from Priti Patel. For goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland, she said: \"For the protection of the single regulatory zone and consumers on the island of Ireland, and to ensure that the correct tariffs are applied, we will need information... Therefore, administrative procedures including a declaration will be required, which can be completed online.\"\n\nFor goods sent from Northern Ireland to Britain, the minister said the deal allowed \"unfettered market access\". \"The UK does not, therefore, intend to carry out checks on such movements of goods. There will be a minimal administrative process which is designed to prevent, for example, trade in endangered species.\"\n\nThe committee's chair, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, tweeted to say \"Home Office confirms there will be checks on goods between GB and Northern Ireland under Govt deal\".\n\nRead more: What's in the UK government's Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nWhat do the documents say?\n\nThe government's Impact Assessment of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill indeed says \"there will be no tariffs\" (clause 251), and \"no requirement for additional regulatory checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (clause 259).\n\nHowever, the situation is not the same concerning goods moving the other way. Goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland risk tougher controls, because of the possibility that they may then cross into Ireland and enter the EU.\n\nThe Impact Assessment says no tariffs will be paid on goods moving in this direction \"unless they are deemed to be at risk of entering the EU\" (clauses 249 and 253). As for goods regulation, several clauses (260-280) set out additional measures, including checks and physical inspections on agri-foods, and \"risk-based checks on an 'adequate scale'\" on manufactured goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrexit hot potato back in EU hands as leaders ponder UK extension\n\nWhat derailed Boris Johnson's Brexit bill \u2013 and is it dead?\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "A Labour MP suggests the UK PM may have misled parliament for saying there will be no checks between Northern Ireland and Britain, under his Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/57/80/1000x563_cmsv2_755e1c90-2676-58f3-89b2-d329fb51f6a8-4255780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
