State prosecutors accepted Terrell\u2019s plea during a hearing that was previously scheduled to decide whether the gunman could face the death penalty for the killings at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\n\nTerrell had faced the charges in connection with the April 30 shooting as classmates gathered in a lecture hall.\n\nTerrell told investigators he gave up on the attack after being tackled by one of the students who died.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He told investigators he gave up on the attack on the spring semester class\u2019s last day after being tackled by one of the students who died, Riley Howell. Howell knocked the assailant down, buying enough time for the first officer into the classroom to capture Terrell, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said.\n\nWitnesses said the gunman took aim at a specific table in the classroom, but it wasn\u2019t clear if he was targeting one or more of the students in particular. The faculty member who taught the class has said Terrell was enrolled in the course but quit attending in January.\n\n\u201cI just went into a classroom and shot the guys,\u201d Terrell told reporters hours after the shooting as police officers led him handcuffed into a law enforcement building.\n\nHowell, 21, of Waynesville, and Ellis Reed Parlier, 19, of Midland, died after each was shot multiple times, their autopsies said. Those wounded were Sean Dehart and Drew Pescaro, both of Apex; Emily Houpt of Charlotte; and Rami Alramadhan of Saihat, Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of the victims objected to the District Attorney\u2019s office agreeing to the guilty plea, which effectively allows Terrell to escape the death penalty.\n\nTerrell \u201cknew he wanted to get life in prison when planning this violent act and the DA\u2019s office is rewarding him by giving him exactly what he wanted,\u201d Pescaro wrote in a detailed statement to WCCB-TV. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening and it makes me disappointed in the DA\u2019s office, the City of Charlotte, and the State of North Carolina.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Trystan Andrew Terrell also pleaded guilty Thursday to four counts of attempted murder and discharge of a firearm on educational property.", "authors": ["Tom Foreman Jr."], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19262254730164.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
