Its CEO talked to Axios yesterday about the falling stock price.\n\nEndeavor, the live events and artist representation firm led by Ari Emanuel, last night canceled an IPO that originally was to raise over $600 million, before it was later downsized.\n\nWeWork\u2026 well, you know the story there.\n\nYes, all three companies have dual-class shares. Yes, all three were highly valued by venture capital or private equity investors. Yes, all three were unprofitable for the first half of 2019.\n\nThose characteristics are also true of Datadog and Ping Identity, both of which had successful IPOs this month and continue to trade above offering.\n\nThe trio's real similarity was that each had a very complicated story.\n\nPeloton is a high-end hardware and SaaS business that produces original media content, sells apparel, and runs its own delivery logistics.\n\nEndeavor began life representing movie stars and Donald Trump, but later expanded into a massive live events business that includes the UFC and Professional Bull Riders. Plus, it's got a streaming platform.\n\nWeWork\u2026 again, it's different.\n\nAll of this comes against the backdrop of Uber, which also had a very complicated story and an IPO that emboldened short-sellers.\n\nUp next: A lot of biotech startup IPOs, but no high-growth, complicated tech unicorns.\n\n\"We're about to get a bit of a break from those sorts of deals, which I think is good for everyone,\" a top Wall Street banker told me this morning.\n\nPrivate markets follow public markets, so don't be surprised to see some valuation and/or deal size pullback for these \"hard to comp\" companies.\n\nParticularly if SoftBank fails to raise Vision Fund 2.\n\nGoodbye to egregious governance terms. Dual-class will survive, but WeWork laid a third rail for others to avoid.\n\nU.S. IPOs have still outperformed the S&P 500 in 2019, although the gap has shrunk significantly this month.\n\nOr, put another way: The sky isn't falling, but it's gotten a lot darker. And, for some, downright stormy.\n\nWhile all of this is true, I think it is a lot simpler than that.\n\nThe public markets are a lot different than the private markets.\n\nFinancial transactions in the private markets are controlled by the issuers, happen when the issuers want them to happen, and are generally auctions, particularly in the late stage markets.\n\nPublic market investors can buy and sell stocks every day based on what is attractive to them and what is not. If they feel like they missed out on something, they can get into it immediately.\n\nFor this reason, valuations in the private markets, particularly the late-stage private markets, can sometimes be irrational. Public market valuations, certainly after a stock has traded for a material amount of time and lockups have come off, are much more rational.\n\nFor the last five or six years, I have been writing here that I very much want to see the wave of highly valued and highly heralded companies that were started in the last decade come public. I have wanted to see how these companies trade because it will help us in the private markets better understand how to finance and value businesses.\n\nAnd now we are seeing that.\n\nAnd what we are seeing, for the most part, is that margins matter. Both gross margins and operating margins.\n\nIf you look at the class of companies that have come public in the last twelve months, many of the stocks that have performed the best are software companies with software margins. One notable exception to that is Beyond Meat.\n\nZoom \u2013 81% gross margin\n\nCloudflare (a USV portfolio company) \u2013 77% gross margin\n\nDatadog \u2013 75% gross margin\n\nDatadog cofounders Alexis L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c and Olivier Pomel Datadog\n\nIf you look at the same list, many of the stocks that have struggled are companies that have low gross margins.\n\nUber \u2013 46% gross margin\n\nLyft \u2013 39% gross margin\n\nPeloton \u2013 42% gross margin\n\nSome other notable numbers:\n\nWeWork gross margins \u2013 20%\n\nSpotify (down almost 30% in the last two months) gross margins \u2013 26%\n\nI believe that we have seen a narrative in the late stage private markets that as software is eating the world (real estate, music, exercise, transportation), every company should be valued as a software company at 10x revenues or more.\n\nAnd that narrative is now falling apart.\n\nIf the product is software and thus can produce software gross margins (75% or greater), then it should be valued as a software company.\n\nIf the product is something else and cannot produce software gross margins then it needs to be valued like other similar businesses with similar margins, but maybe at some premium to recognize the leverage it can get through software.\n\nBut we have not been doing it that way in the late-stage private markets for the last five years.\n\nI think we may start now that the public markets are showing us how.", "description": "Valuations in the private markets, particularly the late-stage private markets, can sometimes be irrational.", "authors": ["Fred Wilson", "A Vc"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d921a7f2e22af45b44ba2dd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
