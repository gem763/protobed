Getty\n\n\u201cI thought that the first set, I definitely was in control. In the second set, she raised her level and I wasn\u2019t able to finish the set,\u201d Gauff said.\n\nA fired up Gauff prevailed after a 12-stroke rally late in the third set to set up a break point opportunity, pumping her fists wildly and shouting in excitement in front of a packed crowd that was firmly on her side.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even see any empty seats!\u201d Gauff said of the crowd, which included retired NBA star Kobe Bryant. I don\u2019t even know how to really thank you guys. I\u2019m super honoured to be American and play in New York City.\u201d\n\nGauff will face off against 21-year-old Osaka, who also holds the Australian Open title, in the third round of the tournament on Saturday in a clash that may provide a glimpse at the future of the women\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cObviously she\u2019s an amazing player,\u201d said Gauff. \u201cShe\u2019s defending champion. She\u2019s won two slams. She\u2019s number one. She\u2019s only 21. We\u2019re both pretty young. But I\u2019m a little bit newer to the game. So I\u2019m just curious to see how my game matches up against her.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Crowd-pleaser Coco Gauff came through a tough battle with qualifier Timea Babos 6-2,\u00a04-6, 6-4 on Thursday to set up a third-round clash at the US\u00a0Open against top seed and defending champion Naomi Osaka.
