Mitt Romney, R-Utah, blasted President Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from defensive positions in Syria, and brought up the possibility that \u201cTurkey may have called America\u2019s bluff\u201d in an exchange between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cAre we so weak and inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?\u201d Romney said. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s imperative that public hearings are held to answer these questions, and I hope the Senate is able to conduct those hearings next week.\u201d\n\nThe transcript of the Oct. 6 phone call between Trump and Erdogan has not been made public. Shortly afterward, Trump, without notifying his national security staff or State Department, unilaterally ordered the small American contingent in northern Syria to abandon their positions, and Turkey began its assault three days later.\n\nRomney said redeploying the troops that protected Kurdish allies from the Turkish military left \u201ca bloodstain\u201d on American history.\n\n\u201cWe know the truth about our Kurd allies. They lost 11,000 combatants in our joint effort to defeat ISIS. We dropped bombs from the air and provided intelligence and logistics behind the lines. The Kurds lost thousands of lives. Eighty-six brave Americans also lost their lives so tragically,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt\u2019s argued that the Kurds were fighting for themselves. Of course they were. That\u2019s the nature of an alliance. We fight together, each pursuing our own vital interest.\u201d\n\nEvery American should watch this speech by Senator @MittRomney pic.twitter.com/bdv4xxBl1Y \u2014 The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) October 17, 2019\n\nA day earlier, Trump fought off criticism of his decision to clear the way for Turkish forces to enter northern Syria and battle Kurdish forces stationed there, calling the move \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get involved in a war between Turkey and Syria, especially when, if you look at the Kurds, and again I say this with great respect, they\u2019re no angels,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday as his own vice president and secretary of state headed to Turkey to try to persuade Erdogan to halt his military offensive.\n\nPerhaps the most outspoken Republican critic of the president, Romney saw Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy moves as antithetical to American values and a boon to U.S. foes.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter of American honor and promise. So too is the principle that we stand by our allies, that we do not abandon our friends. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThere are broad strategic implications of our decision as well. Iranian and Russian interests in the Middle East have been advanced as well. At a time when we are applying maximum pressure on Iran, by giving them a stronger hand in Syria, we have actually weakened that pressure. Russia\u2019s objective to play a greater role in the Middle East has also been greatly enhanced. The Kurds, out of desperation, have aligned with Assad. So America is diminished; Russia, Iran and Assad are strengthened.\u201d\n\nAP Photo/Andrew Harnik More\n\nEarlier in the day, Vice President Mike Pence announced that Erdogan had agreed to a five-day \u201cceasefire\u201d with the Kurds on terms favorable to Turkey, and Trump celebrated that news as he departed for a campaign rally in Dallas.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing outcome. This is an outcome, regardless of how the press would like to damp it down, this was something that they\u2019ve been trying to get for 10 years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou would have lost millions and millions of lives. They couldn\u2019t get it without a little rough love, as I called it.\u201d", "description": "The Utah senator delivers an impassioned speech on the Senate floor that accuses the president of betraying American values.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dDqb72hbBkVwemCGFDqqHA--~B/aD0zNTk5O3c9NTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/28073e60-f128-11e9-bafb-3df0c82edfb4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
