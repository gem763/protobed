They don\u2019t want those people out any more than we do,\u201d he said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that particularly dangerous Islamic State group fighters held by the Kurds in northeast", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/a99bfc_captured-british-islamic-state-is-fighters-el-shafee-el-sheikh-alexanda-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
