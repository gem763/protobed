'We're going to credit Brighton but today Tottenham was dreadful.\n\n'No desire, no heart there was no press, tactically they looked inept. Pochettino looked uninterested on the bench.\n\n'I think it's getting to the point where it's the end of the road for this team and this manager but it's going to be difficult because he's an asset to the club it's not like a normal situation you can let him go and get someone in.\n\n'These players aren't bad players. But as a group it's fallen apart and I think we're at the point where something has to change.'\n\nThe north London side suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat to Brighton and Hove Albion\n\nJermaine Jenas said his former club needs to freshen things up, with several key players' uncertain futures dragging Spurs down. Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have all been linked with moves away in the summer but none of those outgoings came to fruition, leaving their Spurs careers in limbo.\n\nHe said: 'I love Mauricio and really hope he stays but it stinks of that type of moment things seem really stale.
