REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nAs the European Union finalises a third delay to the divorce that was originally supposed to take place on March 29, the United Kingdom, its parliament and its voters remain divided on how or indeed whether to go ahead with Brexit.\n\nJohnson, who had promised to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d, has repeatedly demanded an election to end what he casts as a nightmare paralysis that is sapping public trust by preventing any Brexit outcome at all.\n\nAfter parliament refused Johnson his third demand for an election on Monday, he will try to force a bill through parliament on Tuesday that calls for a Dec. 12 election. It needs a simple majority in parliament.\n\nIn a move that raises the chances of a rare parliamentary success for Johnson, the opposition Labour Party\u2019s leader Jeremy Corbyn said its condition of ruling out a no-deal Brexit had been met so it would support an election.\n\n\u201cLabour will back a general election,\u201d said Corbyn, a veteran socialist campaigner. \u201cThe Labour Party loves a debate but they also love the end of the debate, and this is the end of the debate: We are going out there to win.\u201d\n\nLawmakers could bring significant changes to Johnson\u2019s bill. Opposition parties are squabbling over which day in early December is best for an election and whether to allow settled European Union citizens a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the legislation enacting Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has been put on hold, pending an election, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who oversees the government\u2019s legislative agenda in the House of Commons, said.\n\nThe first Christmas election in Britain since 1923 would be highly unpredictable: Brexit has variously fatigued and enraged swathes of voters while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major parties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nUltimately, voters would have a choice between an emboldened Johnson pushing for his Brexit deal or a socialist government under Corbyn renegotiating the deal before a referendum.\n\nIf no party wins conclusively, the Brexit deadlock will continue.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve just got to bring this to some sort of resolution. We\u2019ve had many votes in the last 12 months in parliament and I think a general election might be a way to sort it all out,\u201d one commuter, Matt Finch, 36, told Reuters outside London\u2019s Charing Cross rail station.\n\nCHRISTMAS ELECTION?\n\nWhile almost all British politicians agree that an election is needed, Johnson\u2019s opponents want to inflict maximum political damage by preventing his last-minute deal from being ratified before the poll.\n\nJohnson, in turn, is trying to shift the blame for failing to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31 on to parliament.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow this paralysis to continue and, one way or another, we must proceed straight to an election,\u201d Johnson told parliament on Monday. \u201cThis House cannot any longer keep this country hostage.\u201d\n\nSuch is the lack of trust in parliament, lawmakers are squabbling about almost everything from the sequencing of Brexit to the election date.\n\nBehind the bickering, though, Johnson is closer to an election than he has ever been in his tumultuous 3-month premiership.\n\n\u201cWe have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to 31st January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nTwo opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, want an election on Dec. 9.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seen on Downing Street in London, Britain October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t accept any jiggery-pokery from the prime minister,\u201d Ian Blackford, the Scottish National Party\u2019s Westminster leader, said. \u201cOur vote certainly can\u2019t be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, though pollsters underestimated the support for Brexit in 2016 and admit that the models they use are wilting beside the Brexit furnace.\n\nWhen Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, bet on a snap election in 2017, she lost her slender majority - a failure that ultimately prevented her from ratifying her Brexit deal and sank her political career.", "description": "Britain was heading towards a December election on Tuesday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's bet on breaking the Brexit deadlock with an early vote gained support from opposition parties.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446182915&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0ZU", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
