It went on to invest another $10.5 million in new packaging technology for its Cadbury Favourites range.\n\nThe investment has increased efficiencies so much that Cadbury can now compete on the global stage and export those chocolates from its factory in Scoresby in Melbourne's south-east to the Middle East.\n\nIf we find confidence going down a bit if consumer tighten their belts, we will get a small bump in demand. \u2014 Amanda Banfield\n\n\"We have double the capacity we had before and because we have that higher capacity our costs are lower so it opens up those export markets where typically they would have been more challenging because the cost base is higher in Australia than neighbouring countries,\" Ms Banfield said.\n\n\"This is why investing for cost-competitiveness is so important because it opens up export markets and that gives us sustainability because we are not just relying on the growth in the market here.\"\n\nGrowth in Australia, however, is strong.\n\n\"We are very positive. Snacking is a growing behaviour in developing markets. We think we will see good growth,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if economic growth and consumption is sluggish, Cadbury benefits.\n\n\"There is a slightly counter-cyclical effect where if we find confidence going down a bit if consumer tighten their belts, we will get a small bump in demand. We think it's consumers saying 'I'm not going to go out to dinner or buy the new jacket but I'll still treat myself in little ways with chocolate.\"\n\nThe Cadbury investments have also had broader economic effects than just sending profits back to Mondelez shareholders.\n\nMondelez managing director Nigel Parsons said that from an operational point of view, the company now had 1100 Australian-based suppliers supporting their business at any given time.\n\n\"Our capital investment creates flow-on employment and economic benefits with local engineers and trades extensively supporting our projects and works,\" Mr Parsons said.\n\nOne key operational aspect the government needs to help business with is energy policy.\n\nMs Banfield said that if power was lost, it took only 30 minutes before the factory stalled and \"many, many hours of lost time\" were spent on cleaning out the operation.\n\n\"Energy consistency is crucial to our operations because we are pumping molten chocolate or jelly around the factory as part of our core process. It is critical in our cooking and moulding processes and in our cooling processes. It is all dependent on reliable energy.\"", "description": "Committing to continued investment in Australia in an uncertain economic environment hasn't been easy, but Cadbury Australia boss Amanda Banfield is positive about the outcome.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.2211%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_735%2C$y_611/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a29e559c586481f5cd59c20b8d3dcd970bf53584", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
