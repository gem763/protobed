But we have put ourselves in a position to maybe win the World Cup and we are in the final.\n\n\u201cYes, we accept the criticism but we are also happy we are in a position to compete in a World Cup final which is ultimately where we want to be.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Erasmus indicated he wouldn\u2019t be willing to tweak too much with his selection and tactics given the limited time on hand to prepare for Saturday\u2019s final in Yokohama.\n\nThe 47-year-old, who made 36 appearances for the Springboks between 1997 and 2001, added that \u201cit\u2019s a bit of horses for causes\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur team selection won\u2019t be far off from what we\u2019ve been selecting the last couple of games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pretty much go with more or less the same team. We believe that\u2019s the way we can get the best out of our team and we believe that\u2019s the longevity of playing so many games in a six-day turnaround, rotating forwards and stuff like that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of horses for causes but we believe it\u2019s our most in-fit, form, best available, best combination team so there\u2019s a bit of both.\n\n\u201cWe have 160 minutes of training, 60 minutes of team training and 40 or 60 minutes of split training when we split into forwards and backs so you have two days of training sessions so not a lot will change. You can expect very much the same from us on Saturday.\u201d\n\nCoaching in his first World Cup, having taken charge of the Springboks early last year, Erasmus conceded that he felt the pressure to deliver what would be a third title for the nation \u2013 a feat which would draw them level with New Zealand\u2019s own record.\n\n\u201cOn the pressure, I\u2019ve never coached in a Rugby World Cup final, I\u2019ve never coached in a previous Rugby World Cup semi-final or quarter-final apart from the last games.\n\n\u201cSo the pressure\u2019s on, we feel the pressure, we\u2019re excited but we feel the pressure. We find out ways to handle it and try to work around it, and they have the upper-hand in terms of Eddie\u2019s experience\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to find our own ways of handling that and so far, so good. But certainly Saturday will be a big test for us to see if we can go the last step.\u201d\n\nEngland and South Africa meet on Saturday morning in what is a repeat of the 2007 final, which the Springboks won 15-6 in Paris.", "description": "South Africa\u00a0head coach Rassie Erasmus has accepted criticism of his Springboks\u2019 unattractive, attritional style of play while admitting that the side needs to improve ahead of this weekend\u2019s Rugby World Cup final with England.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/05/rassie-erasmus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
