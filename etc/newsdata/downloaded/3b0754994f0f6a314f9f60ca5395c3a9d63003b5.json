Cimabue was the father of the Renaissance. But this sale goes beyond all our dreams,\" Le Coent told The Associated Press.\n\nAn auctioneer spotted the painting in June while inspecting a woman's house in Compiegne in northern France and suggested she bring it to experts for an evaluation. It hung on a wall between the kitchen and dining room.\n\nThe woman will now receive \"the majority\" of the sale money, the auction house said.\n\nThe expected sale price had been 4 million to 6 million euros ($4.4 million to $6.6 million).\n\nLe Coent said experts were off the mark because it was the first time a Cimabue had ever gone under the hammer. \"There's never been a Cimabue painting on sale so there was no reference previously on how much it could make,\" he explained.\n\nTitled \"Christ Mocked,\" the painting measures about 10 inches by 8 inches (24 by 20 centimeters).\n\nArt experts say it is likely part of a larger diptych that Cimabue painted around 1280, of which two other panels are displayed at the Frick Collection in New York and the National Gallery in London.\n\nThe painting's discovery has sent ripples of excitement through the art world.\n\nCimabue, who taught Italian master Giotto, is widely considered the forefather of the Italian Renaissance. He broke from the Byzantine style popular in the Middle Ages and began to incorporate elements of movement and perspective that came to characterize Western painting.\n\nSpecialists at the Turquin gallery in Paris initially examined the painting and concluded with \"certitude\" that it bore the hallmarks of Cimabue.\n\nStephane Pinta, an art specialist with the Turquin, pointed to likenesses in facial expressions and buildings, as well as the painter's techniques for conveying light and distance.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
