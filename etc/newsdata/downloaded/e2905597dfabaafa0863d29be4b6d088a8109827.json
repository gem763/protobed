This is an insult pure and simple,\u201d Tukaki said in a statement. \u201cI am sick and tired of cultural appropriation and in fact all M\u0101ori are \u2013 our language is a national treasure for all of us and we need to respect it. It\u2019s not here for business to use it and profit from it as they see fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy suggestion is stick to your core business because you sure as hell don\u2019t get to trademark M\u0101ori words.\u201d\n\nIntellectual property experts said the trademark was unlikely to be approved because the language was a common greeting between all races in New Zealand, and used abundantly by businesses, government institutions and private companies.\n\nThe application would also need to pass through the M\u0101ori trademarks advisory committee, which provides advice to the commissioner of trade marks.\n\nMorgan Godfery (@MorganGodfery) marketing intern: what are we doing for m\u0101ori language week sir?\n\n\n\nair nz ceo chris luxon: trademarking kia ora\n\nIntellectual property rights expert Maui Solomon told RNZ that the airline was \u201coverreaching\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve already appropriated the koru [fern] symbol for the airline many years ago,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cAs a national airline, they\u2019re seizing national icons that\u2019s going to help promote their brand ... there should be a benefit-sharing. The obvious way to do that is for Air New Zealand to stump up with a bit of cash.\u201d\n\nAir New Zealand said the trademark application was about protecting the company\u2019s logo, and they had \u201chuge respect\u201d for the M\u0101ori language.\n\n\u201cThe word kia ora has been registered by a number of applicants to be used for a range of goods and services \u2013 dating back to 1992 \u2013 both in New Zealand and overseas,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s standard corporate practice to have all our logos trademarked and we have just started the process given Kia Ora magazine has recently been through a refresh.\u201d", "description": "Airline accused of lack of respect for indigenous language by seeking to protect image of the greeting, also the name of its in-flight magazine", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb7279219fba22a75bbf65abb4b8ae4a66a829b/0_163_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0f7becd8c232d1d3666ceb8c0da4466", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
