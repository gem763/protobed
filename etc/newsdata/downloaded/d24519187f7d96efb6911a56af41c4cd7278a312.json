(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons will be without starting cornerback Desmond Trufant and punter Matt Wile for Sunday\u2019s game at Arizona.\n\nBoth players were ruled out Friday, along with second-string cornerback Blidi Wreh-Wilson.\n\nTrufant is slowed by a toe injury, Wile is sidelined by an ailing right quad, and Wreh-Wilson can\u2019t go because of an injured groin.\n\nThe loss of Wile will force the Falcons (1-4) to switch to their third punter of the season. Matt Bosher is already on injured reserve.\n\nAtlanta is expected to activate Kasey Redfern to handle the punting and kickoff duties. He came in for a tryout Thursday at Arizona State University, where the struggling team practiced this week instead of returning home after an embarrassing 53-32 loss at Houston.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons will be without starting cornerback Desmond Trufant and punter Matt Wile for Sunday's game at Arizona.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/falcons_texans_football_57354_c0-123-3716-2290_s1200x700.jpg?9b0ea98791e207840f62b7e7193d043c86b6d7ce", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
