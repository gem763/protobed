Elizabeth Warren was next, finishing the quarter with $25.7 million on hand, and was followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who had about $23 million.\n\nMr. Buttigieg was followed by Sen. Kamala Harris, who had $10.5 million, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who was in fifth with about $9 million.\n\nThe candidates had previously disclosed the amount of money they raised in the third quarter, and Mr. Sanders led his 2020 Democratic rivals on that front as well.\n\nBut their cash on hand at the end of the month provides a more complete picture of the resources they\u2019ll have in the months ahead to spend on things like advertising and field staff in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s reelection campaign had announced Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, combined with associated fundraising entities and the Republican National Committee, was sitting on $158 million at the end of September.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
