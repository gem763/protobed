The director said it wouldn't have been produced without the streaming service Netflix.\n\n\"No, never would have gotten made, because they're not making, they don't wanna make the pictures I wanna make out there,\" Scorsese said of traditional film studios. \"It's over. It's finished.\"\n\n[The film opens in theatres on November 1, before streaming on Netflix starting November 27.]\n\nFor film fans, getting De Niro, Pacino and Scorsese together in the same project is significant. \"I always knew it that it would be a special thing, no matter what happened \u2013 that we would create something and do something together all of us,\" De Niro said. \"It was gonna be special, no matter what. You can't take that away from us. That's all. It gets a good reaction? That's even better.\"\n\nThe film is not \"Goodfellas\" or \"The Godfather,\" according to Scorsese and the actors; it's a reckoning \u2013 a taking stock of lives lived hard.\n\nPacino said he wants people to leave the theatre feeling something: \"Something comes off that is almost, you know, sort of ephemeral. It's hard to say what it is, but you feel it. It's affecting in that sense. And you don't even know why.\"\n\nDe Niro added: \"It's about getting older and what's happening, and with us. It's about that. It's about getting older, and just realistic \u2013 this is what it is.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"The Irishman\" click on the video player below:\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning \"Sunday Morning\" is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET, and is rebroadcast on Pop TV at 12:30 p.m. ET/9:30 a.m. PT. \"Sunday Morning\" also streams on CBSN beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET and repeated at 1 p.m. ET, and is available on cbs.com, CBS All Access and On Demand.\n\nBe sure to follow us at cbssundaymorning.com, and on Twitter (@CBSSunday), Facebook, and Instagram (#CBSSundayMorning).", "description": "In their first-ever joint TV interview, the director and actors talk about their first collaboration, an acclaimed mob epic about a hit man and the fate of union leader Jimmy Hoffa", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/7775104d-521e-45e1-9a19-30335ae7aa69/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8526d8074ca8c32ca7b01e925f6adbe1/martin-scorsese-al-pacino-robert-de-niro-interview-the-irishman-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
