(AP) - The unique doll collection of best-selling author Anne Rice has found a new home in Windber.\n\nUntil 2004, Rice\u2019s collection of one-of-a-kind dolls filled a three-story former orphanage in New Orleans. She had about 1,000 rare and unique dolls, some made of porcelain and some over 5 feet tall.\n\nWhen Rice moved to California, she took about 500 of her favorite dolls with her. The other 500 were left to Sue Quiroz, who served as the curator of Rice\u2019s doll collection for 15 years.\n\nQuiroz was left to find homes for hundreds of dolls.\n\nThey sat in storage and Quiroz sold some and donated others. The upkeep and storage was costing her money, so Quiroz sent out a plea to donate the dolls to somewhere special.\n\n\u201cI think (Rice) will be excited to know her dream has come true to have a doll museum,\u201d Quiroz said.\n\nThat museum will be in Windber.\n\nOver the weekend, Grand Midway Hotel owner Blair Murphy drove to New Orleans and picked up almost all of Rice\u2019s dolls. He plans to display the dolls in the Windber church he bought recently along Graham Avenue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge Anne Rice fan and I just bought that church and I\u2019m looking for new pieces to put in it. I\u2019m honored to make a permanent home for the collection,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy hasn\u2019t even seen all of the dolls or opened all of the boxes yet. He said he came back from New Orleans with 30 refrigerator-sized boxes full of dolls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a treasure chest,\u201d he said.\n\nFans of Rice\u2019s novels know that some of her dolls made appearances in her writing. A doll-shop owner appears in \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d and a doll maker appears in \u201cTaltos.\u201d\n\nQuiroz said that Rice started collecting dolls in the mid-1990s and personally selected each doll. Many came from other countries and were special ordered.\n\n\u201cWe opened doll boxes a lot,\u201d Quiroz said, laughing.\n\nShe added that the dolls are not haunted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of haunting to people when they go in to see them and they see so many. Some people are scared of dolls,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any hauntings or anything. I was there a lot late at night and gave tours. We never had problems.\u201d\n\nQuiroz said she was excited when she heard that Murphy wanted to put the doll collection in a former church for his museum.\n\n\u201cThose are unique as far as buildings go,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Anne would like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll have a good home. They\u2019ve been in boxes for years, so I think they really need to be out there,\u201d Quiroz said. \u201cThere\u2019s some beautiful dolls there.\u201d\n\nMurphy has already planned a grand opening for the museum. From 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Oct. 26, Murphy will host the museum opening with bands, ballroom dancers and a magician. It will also serve as a fundraiser for the Windber Fire Department and Windber Public Library.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really trying to do something for the community,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could end up in a university or a city, and this collection will end up in little Windber It\u2019s really magical that this was able to happen. I feel the town can be proud of it. This is their collection.\u201d\n\nQuiroz said she is happy the dolls ended up with Murphy.\n\n\u201cI know they\u2019re going to be happy because they\u2019ll be out of their boxes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I hope people come to see them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2lYlsKr\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily American, http://www.dailyamerican.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The unique doll collection of best-selling author Anne Rice has found a new home in Windber.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dylan Johnson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
