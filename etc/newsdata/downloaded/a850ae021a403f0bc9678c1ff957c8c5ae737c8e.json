The Department of Education has been a leftist tool since Jimmy Carter pushed for its creation. Under Obama, the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights was egregiously political, using and abusing regulatory powers to impose a host of mandates on colleges and universities subject to federal control. (Only the very few schools that refuse federal student aid money are free of the Department\u2019s reach.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn today\u2019s Martin Center article, Kursat Christoff Pekgoz and James Moore detail the OCR\u2019s leftist offensive under Obama. They liken it to the Ministry of Love in Orwell\u2019s 1984: \u201cThis agency was so devoted to its ideological mission that it never presented its unconstitutional rules to the American public to consult their opinion, considered itself to be a superior alternative to the criminal justice system, granted itself universal jurisdiction, threatened many colleges with financial death unless they punished constitutionally protected speech, sought to abolish the \u2018reasonable person\u2019 standard, and created a class of imitative bureaucrats in academic institutions to perpetuate an industry of victimhood.\u201d\n\nPekgoz did an analysis of all the OCR\u2019s resolution letters between 2011 and 2019 and found that they overwhelmingly favored female complainants. Supporting the \u201cwomen are victims\u201d ideology suited the Obama administration and the OCR was gung-ho.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay, but the Obama years are behind us. Unfortunately, the authors report, the current OCR has not done a complete about-face. And we must always keep in mind that with another Democratic administration, we\u2019d get a new infusion of leftist zealots in the Education Department.\n\nPekgoz and Moore conclude, \u201cUnsurprisingly, some politicians want to abolish the entire Department of Education. Representative Thomas Massie has introduced a bill to do just that. While we cannot predict whether the Department will ever be abolished, we must never cease our vigilance against our very own Ministry of Love.\u201d", "description": "In today's Martin Center article, Kursat Christoff Pekgoz and James Moore detail the OCR's leftist offensive under former president Barack Obama.", "authors": ["George Leef", "Kevin D.
