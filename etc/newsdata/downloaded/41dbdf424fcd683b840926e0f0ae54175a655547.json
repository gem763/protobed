It's located in an unincorporated area less than 10 miles (16.09 kilometers) east of downtown Kansas City.\n\nForte says deputies found more than 40 shell casings that were fired from multiple weapons.\n\nFive victims were taken to hospitals in private vehicles, two with graze wounds and the others with injuries that weren't classified as life-threatening. Forte says it's possible there were other victims who didn't want to come forward.\n\nForte says the department is \"at a standstill\" because none of the five want to cooperate. No one has been arrested.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
