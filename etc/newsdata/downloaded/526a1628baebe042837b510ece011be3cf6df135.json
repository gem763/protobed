Just put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she\u2019s going to run.\u201d\n\nMorris went on to say he believes Warren gets the nomination, which he explained would be bad news for the Democratic Party looking to take down President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think Warren will still win. And I think Trump will still beat the daylights out of her, But this Democratic process isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d he advised.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During Sunday's broadcast of \u201cThe Cats Roundtable\u201d on\u00a0New York AM 970 radio, political commentator and former Bill Clinton adviser Dick Morris weighed in | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/dick-morris-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
