He would not have had to do so if his deal had passed Saturday, even though further legislation would be required to pull the U.K. out of the EU.\n\nOliver Letwin, the architect of the amendment, and his allies were concerned that passing the deal could have allowed a no-deal Brexit to happen \u201caccidentally\u201d on October 31, if the ratification process required to make the deal law didn\u2019t happen in time.\n\nJohnson is now legally required under U.K. law to write to the EU asking for an extension until January 31, 2020.\n\nIf the EU offered the U.K. an extension of a different length, the prime minister would have to agree with it unless he persuaded parliament to reject it.\n\nThe government has indicated that it will not engage further with today\u2019s vote on the deal now that it has been amended by Letwin. The motion could no longer be a straight vote on the deal and the government will instruct its MPs to abstain.\n\nHowever, next week Johnson will press on with his attempt to pass the deal into law before October 31. The government is expected to present its Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Monday and hold the crucial second reading vote on it on Tuesday.\n\nEven if a three-month extension is granted, Brexit can happen earlier if both the U.K. and EU ratify an exit deal before then. Article 50, which sets out the rules of exit, says that a state leaves the EU \u201cfrom the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement,\u201d or failing that, the end of the Article 50 notice period.\n\nAhead of Saturday's vote, a No. 10 spokesman said that \u201ca vote for Letwin is a vote for delay.\u201d\n\nJohnson told MPs Saturday morning that Brexit was \u201crestoring sovereignty\u201d and argued: \u201cThere can no longer be any argument for further delay,\u201d he said. \u201cI am convinced that an overwhelming majority in this House, regardless of our personal views, wishes to see Brexit delivered in accordance with the referendum.\u201d", "description": "MPs to Johnson: \u2018Ask for an extension, then we\u2019ll consider your Brexit deal.\u2019", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176822688-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
