She lives in Sweden, one of the most prosperous nations on earth with wealth and modern conveniences most of the world\u2019s children can\u2019t even imagine. But she realized the world is doomed when she learned about climate change. At age 11, she revealed in a Ted Talk, she became depressed, stopped eating and talking, and fell ill. \u201cIn two months, I lost about ten kilos of weight. Later on I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, OCD and selective mutism \u2013 that basically means I only speak when I think it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough and true enough to say that the powerful political forces of the anthropogenic global warming command-and-control-junkies are using this tortured young person in an obscene display of child abuse. But look deeper \u2013 what happens when a young people by the millions believe Greta\u2019s charge that their elders have \u201cstolen\u201d their \u201cdreams and childhood?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s us she blames for killing her future \u2013 her parents and grandparents. It\u2019s no joke when this 16-year-old, her face contorted in anger, galvanizes millions of other children around the world to march as she warns the older generation as well as the dignitaries at the UN Climate Action Summit: \u201cWe are watching you.\u201d\n\nShe blames us grown-ups for the international eco-apocalypse she is convinced we are bringing down on her generation and she is furious, claiming that \u201cPeople are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money\u2026\u201d\n\nCollapsing ecosystems? Mass extinction? These are deadly, dangerously exaggerated accusations to lie at the feet of the world\u2019s older generation; accusations that can lead to ugly conflict between the generations. And her personal fury is just the beginning. Little Greta isn\u2019t sitting in her bedroom recording a podcast that will reach only 50 of her school pals. Her microphone is worldwide. Her voice is echoing, not only in the halls of the UN, but to millions of kids around the world who revere this grim little saviorette as their heroine.\n\nKids by the millions heeded her call for a global #climatestrike, emptying schools which have been indoctrinating as \u201cscience\u201d climate models that have been proven laughably inaccurate in the 13 years since the dire predictions of Al Gore\u2019s An Inconvenient Truth.\n\nThe hopelessness and misdirected anger of Greta and her millions of acolytes have consequences way beyond banning straws, steaks and SUV\u2019s. What happens when a couple of generations of children actually believe their lives will end painfully and very soon?\n\nIs their despair linked to teen suicide rates that keep climbing across America? Is this why more and more of our kids are numbing themselves out with increasingly \u201clegal\u201d and highly potent marijuana, as well as deadly opiates? Our birth and marriage rates have dropped and mere children are signing pledges vowing not to have kids. And why indeed would they have children when the world will be destroyed before their offspring are even toddlers? How long before these millions of children terrorized by climate end-of-the-world predictions act out with hunger strikes, or, God forbid, mass suicide? Or how long before they report their parents to the authorities for insufficient recycling, or too-frequent carbon-polluting airplane flights?\n\nEven in the glittering and famously leftist bastion of Aspen, Colorado, parents are becoming alarmed at what climate alarmism is doing to their kids. According to an article in the Aspen Times, several conservative parents at the School District Board meeting after the Thunberg-inspired September Global Climate Strike March, objected to their children being taught left-leaning climate politics.\n\nThough the District claimed it wasn\u2019t \u201dassociated\u201d with the march, the date was the same as the global protests. During the weeks leading up to the event, students took school time to make banners for the march and posed for a group photo. Students were prepped by the film \u201cExplorer: Bill Nye\u2019s Global Meltdown\u201d which proclaims the world will end by 2030 because of temperature increases. Over 400 middle and high school children attended the march to downtown Aspen, and upset parents said teachers also participated, even leading chants.\n\nThe parents said the schools\u2019 championing environmental stewardship is one thing, but \u201cthe doomsday prognostication created a stir with their children, who were upset and distraught.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody here can or will say the Earth is going to end in 12 years,\u201d one parent said. \u201cSo why in the hell are we telling these kids that, and basically giving them no reason to live? Why did we have a College Fair last weekend? If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s no reason to go. We shouldn\u2019t even be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat drives this agenda?\u201d another parent asked. \u201cWhat is the true agenda? Is the agenda really climate change? I\u2019d say no. The agenda is against capitalism. Climate change is a way to get there, to fight capitalism and get to the socialist narrative. Why are the teachers driving this?\u201d\n\nAnother parent said students who didn\u2019t participate were bullied, while others were made to feel uncomfortable. \u201cJust last week the mother of a high schooler told me her son had rocks thrown at him and was called a fascist for not participating in the walkout,\u201d the parent said. \u201cMy (child) came to me in tears the night before the climate event because (the child) didn\u2019t know how to feel or what to do because the school had made the picture sound so \u2018fun.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe parents \u2014 whose names the paper doesn\u2019t identify because they said their children have been distraught and in some cases bullied because of their differing opinions \u2014 said the climate change viewpoints have been extreme and don\u2019t belong in a school setting when a counterpoint is not offered.\n\nPredictably, school officials said \u201cthe community\u201d should figure out how to \u201cdialogue respectfully.\u201d Actually, the community should figure out how to banish the dangerous bogeyman of climate mythology that is seriously threatening the mental health and the futures of our kids, not the future of our planet.", "description": "Poor Greta, she\u2019s convinced she has no future.
