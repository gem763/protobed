He personally received and responded to all the customer service emails himself.\n\nDespite having no investment in the product, almost all of the company's original customers from when it was launched in 2012 kept using the product and the company ticked over $1 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nNoticing how sticky the product was with its original customers, along with an uptick in users last year, Mr Downie decided to start paying attention to the company again late last year and recruited digital strategist and former consultant to the business Stephen Neville to take on the CEO role.\n\nThe next chapter\n\nWith Mr Neville installed as CEO, the pair set about recruiting staff and managed to convince eight of the former 15 employees to leave their jobs and re-join the business more than two years after most lost their jobs.\n\n\"All of those people had an attachment to the core purpose of the business,\" Mr Neville said.\n\n\"If we'd just posted a job for a developer, well we'd have struggled because there are far bigger businesses out there now like Culture Amp and we can't compete with that.\"\n\nNow the company has 2000 customers in over 100 countries. They include eBay, Amazon, Hilton Group and Dyson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time around Mr Neville said the company would do things differently.\n\nRather than trying to expand into new areas too quickly, it would focus on its core customers - back-end web developers - but expand its horizons from small developer teams to large digital agencies. In turn, this would mean that its revenue was less lumpy and the use of its feedback tool would be more consistent.\n\n\"BugHerd's problem was that it was too niche,\" Mr Neville said.\n\n\"We've already crossed the $1 million annual recurring revenue milestone, so the next for us is $10 million and we're starting to get back to a growth level where we can double in 24 months.\"\n\nThe company is once again on the hunt for funding, hoping to raise $1 million.\n\nAs for Mr Downie, he is going to remain involved in the business, but not as closely.\n\n\"I learnt when to give it away to someone who is much better placed to run the business,\" he said. \"We made some missteps, but we're not dead.\"", "description": "Imagine being made redundant and then 2.5 years later being offered your job back.
