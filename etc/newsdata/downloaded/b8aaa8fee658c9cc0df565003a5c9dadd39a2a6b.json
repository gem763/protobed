Jeffrey Epstein liked to describe himself as a \u201cscience philanthropist,\u201d and academics liked to take his money. Among them was Joichi Ito, who stepped down on September 7th as the head of MIT\u2019s prestigious Media Lab, where a host of tech products were developed, including the E Ink used in Amazon\u2019s Kindle and Guitar Hero.\n\nIto resigned following an investigation by The New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow, which showed that Ito accepted more money from Epstein than he\u2019d previously disclosed and that he went to great lengths to conceal the source of that money.\n\n\u201cnerd tunnel vision\u201d\n\nIto isn\u2019t alone, and he won\u2019t be the last person to take money from questionable benefactors. As more of Epstein\u2019s enablers are uncovered, it\u2019s worth asking why it was so easy for him to infiltrate science in the first place.\n\nGeorge Church, a biologist best known for his work on the Human Genome Project and a professor at MIT and Harvard, admitted to meetings and phone calls with Epstein in 2014. In comments to Stat News, he said he was guilty of \u201cnerd tunnel vision.\u201d That\u2019s revealing.\n\nThe implications of taking money from Epstein were obvious to anyone who was paying attention. Epstein told multiple people that he wanted to \u201cseed the human race with his DNA,\u201d and four people \u2014 two of whom were identified as award-winning scientists \u2014 told The New York Times that he \u201cconfided to scientists and others about his scheme.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Mother Jones interview, a favorite Epstein tactic was to interrupt conversations with \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with pussy?\u201d It does not take a PhD to recognize that as hostile to women. Nellie Bowles, a New York Times reporter who met with Epstein, says that \u201chis belief system and radical misogyny were neither subtle nor hidden.\u201d\n\n\u201cNerd tunnel vision\u201d allows you to ignore that.\n\nWomen on staff at the Media Lab were concerned about the models Epstein brought with him\n\nTo repair his criminal reputation after pleading guilty to procuring a girl under 18 for prostitution, Epstein needed to launder his influence through successful academics, which mostly meant courting men in science. Women in STEM fields are paid less, promoted less, and are given fewer opportunities for prestige work. And women in these fields must contend with derogatory comments to boot. That is before the widespread sexual harassment; recent reporting on sexual harassment in the sciences only scratches the surface. Almost three-quarters of women who experience sexual harassment don\u2019t report it, and neither do bystanders who witness it, according to a survey from women\u2019s magazine Cosmopolitan. A survey found that nearly a quarter of women who worked as field anthropologists had been sexually assaulted. It\u2019s even worse for women who are black or Latina, according to the Harvard Business Review.\n\nIn Ito\u2019s case, The New Yorker\u2019s reporting reveals that women on staff at the Media Lab were concerned about the young women Epstein brought with him to meetings. \u201cWe literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they\u2019re not there by choice, we could maybe help them,\u201d Signe Swenson, a former development associate at the lab, told Farrow.\n\nPerhaps their male colleagues would have similar concerns if not for \u201cnerd tunnel vision\u201d?\n\nEpstein\u2019s victims were girls. One of his friends, Stuart Pivar, the author of Lifecode: The Theory of Biological Self-Organization, attended some of Epstein\u2019s science meetups. Here is how Pivar described the victims of Epstein\u2019s abuse, according to Mother Jones:\n\nHe did stuff with underage girls who knew what the hell they were doing. By the hundreds. If he only did one, no one would pay attention. Nor, on the other hand, did he actually rape any of them or anything like that, which happens, you know. If you want to make a list of, let us say, in the past several years, of the kind of stuff going on of sexual abuse of children and what the hell not\u2014you want to compare that with what Jeffrey did? What Jeffrey did in comparison with the kind of stuff which gets exposed every day of people who are abusing children left and right and all kinds of institutions? Jeffrey never did anything like that. Everything he had to do with these girls was complicit. And it was just interesting to the rest of the world who doesn\u2019t understand that Jeffrey was a very sick man.\n\nAlso in the interview, Pivar says, \u201cIf Jeffrey Epstein was found guilty of fooling around with one 16-year-old trollop, nobody would pay any attention.\u201d\n\nWho else has made the same calculation?\n\nI wonder how widely this attitude was shared by the men who attended Epstein\u2019s events and took his money. While most of them have noticed that accepting Epstein\u2019s company and / or cash was a slap in the face to his victims \u2014 at least, they say so in their apologies \u2014 they did go on accepting the money or coming to his parties or both.\n\nIn his first apology, Ito downplayed the amount of money he received from Epstein. The New Yorker\u2019s reporting was explosive in part because it revealed the lengths Ito went to in concealing Epstein\u2019s donations: reporting them as anonymous, for instance. It seems as though Ito recognized, on some level, that taking Epstein\u2019s money was wrong, but the risk was worth it. Who else has made the same calculation?\n\nWe\u2019ve only just begun to see how far Epstein\u2019s influence reached into the science and technology communities, but what we know so far is disturbing. Harvard University, to which Epstein donated before his guilty plea in 2008, said it hadn\u2019t taken any of his money afterward. He found other ways to donate indirectly, though, including by giving $110,000 to a nonprofit run by Elisa New. (New, as it happens, is married to Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard who publicly wondered in 2005 if women were just innately not equipped for STEM careers.) Harvard professor Joscha Bach was also funded by Epstein, though that money came through the MIT Media Lab, where he was jointly appointed as a research fellow, according to Axios. Epstein gave money to the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, which supports three Harvard social clubs.\n\nEpstein also had access to elite groups through the dinner parties where the rich and powerful rubbed shoulders. Among the attendees of a March 2011 dinner reported by BuzzFeed were Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, and Elon Musk \u2014 as well as Marissa Mayer, Anne Wojcicki, and former YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar. In the prestige racket, networks count. Epstein didn\u2019t just donate his own money; he could potentially make an introduction to more money. \u201cEpstein appeared to serve as an intermediary between the lab and other wealthy donors, soliciting millions of dollars in donations from individuals and organizations, including the technologist and philanthropist Bill Gates and the investor Leon Black,\u201d Farrow wrote in The New Yorker.\n\nEpstein also had access to these elite groups through the dinner parties where the rich and powerful rubbed shoulders\n\nIn 2010, after Epstein served his 18-month sentence, he hosted a dinner at his Upper East Side townhouse, Slate\u2019s Daniel Engber reports. Among the attendees was super-agent John Brockman, founder of Edge.org, who was also Ito\u2019s literary agent.\n\nBrockman\u2019s influence was substantial. A 1991 essay by Brockman called \u201cThe Third Culture\u201d was foundational for a now-defunct science magazine called Seed, which was aimed at bridging the gap between humanists and scientists. I was an intern at that magazine in 2006; I discovered recently, by reading court documents, that Epstein was one of the board members for its parent company.\n\nJournalist Evgeny Morozov, writing in The New Republic, says that Brockman \u201cwas acting as Epstein\u2019s PR man\u2014his liaison with the world of scientists and intellectuals that Brockman had cultivated.\u201d Brockman was also Morozov\u2019s agent. \u201cHe\u2019s been extremely generous in funding projects of many of our friends and clients,\u201d Brockman wrote Morozov, encouraging him to meet with Epstein. \u201cHe also got into trouble and spent a year in jail in Florida,\u201d Brockman added. Morozov said he\u2019d need to think about it. \u201cA billionaire who owns Victoria\u2019s Secret plus a modelling agency is a different kind of animal,\u201d Brockman wrote to Morozov. Morozov declined the offer, saying that the Victoria\u2019s Secret and modeling connections were \u201cone more reason to stay away.\u201d\n\nMorozov didn\u2019t appear to be afflicted with \u201cnerd tunnel vision,\u201d but a lot of other people were. Maybe more correctly, a lot of men were. In Engber\u2019s Slate piece, he lists some of the prominent academics who palled around with Epstein \u2014 before and after his conviction \u2014 and it\u2019s an eye-popping list of STEM celebrities:\n\nGregory Benford, George Church, Murray Gell-Mann, Stephen Jay Gould, David Gross, Stephen Hawking, Danny Hillis, Gerard \u2019t Hooft, Stephen Kosslyn, Jaron Lanier, Seth Lloyd, Martin Nowak, Oliver Sacks, Lee Smolin, Robert Trivers, Frank Wilczek, and more. Truly, the list of men goes on and on. (Among the only women I can find in this group is Harvard\u2019s Anne Harrington, who took a grant from Epstein around 1998.)\n\nAt a 2002 meeting about artificial intelligence on Epstein\u2019s island, 18 of the attendees were men, Slate reported; 12 attendees of a 2006 meeting have been publicly identified, and 10 were men. \u201cEvery meeting where I was with him were meetings with men,\u201d Bill Gates told The Wall Street Journal about his relationship with Epstein. Is this perhaps part of what \u201cnerd tunnel vision\u201d is?\n\nIn Slate\u2019s piece on Epstein, both Lawrence Krauss, an astronomer who retired from Arizona State University after BuzzFeed News reported on his history of sexual harassment, and Roger Schank, a former AI professor at Stanford, Yale, and Northwestern, describe Epstein as being surrounded by young women: \u201cIt was me, him, and six girls,\u201d Schank says in the piece, describing his first-ever meeting with Epstein. Both Schank and Krauss deny that the women they met were underage. \u201cThey were not high school girls,\u201d Schank told Slate.\n\nAI pioneer Marvin Minsky was among Epstein\u2019s buddies as well. A woman named Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was sexually trafficked by Epstein, also said she was forced to have sex with Minsky. Giuffre was 17 at the time. Minsky was 73.\n\nResponsibility goes all the way to the top\n\nRecently, another MIT computer scientist, Richard Stallman, attempted a defense of Minsky, suggesting that Giuffre must have seemed \u201centirely willing\u201d to Minsky. Stallman had posted on his blog in 2003 that \u201ceveryone age 14 or above ought to take part in sex, though not indiscriminately. (Some people are ready earlier).\u201d Stallman also wrote in 2011 that \u201c\u2018child pornography\u2019 might be a photo of yourself or your lover that the two of you shared. It might be an image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult would find attractive. What\u2019s heinous about having such a photo?\u201d\n\nStallman resigned from MIT following his most recent comments. He has no connection to Epstein as far as I know. But his defense of Minsky may help explain why Epstein fit in so well at MIT. It appears the entire community has a severe case of \u201cnerd tunnel vision,\u201d one that\u2019s been comfortably in place for at least a decade. (On September 14th, Stallman posted that he\u2019s changed his mind about legalizing pedophilia.)\n\nResponsibility goes all the way to the top. On September 12th, MIT president Rafael Reif announced that the MIT investigation found a thank-you note addressed to Epstein from 2012 that Reif had signed. (The note was in response to a gift from Epstein to Seth Lloyd, a professor of physics.)\n\nReputation laundering has worked well for some in the scientific community for a long, long time. The Nobel Prizes are a case in point. The prizes are named for Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. If you know nothing about Nobel\u2019s life except the prizes he funded, you\u2019re likely to think he was a good guy. You\u2019d never guess that one obituary identified him as a \u201cmerchant of death.\u201d Prizes that exist to launder reputations don\u2019t take chances on unknowns. They award exclusively the most elite, and the glow of the awardee\u2019s reputation makes the prize prestigious. The effect is that prizes are given to established scientists who are least in need of funding and support. Prizes, like Epstein\u2019s donations, serve to consolidate power among those who already have it.\n\nPrizes, like donations, serve to consolidate power among those who already have it\n\nThe Nobels have awarded three physics prizes in total to women, out of 210 laureates. Chemistry is doing slightly better, as five women are laureates (of 181 total). Medicine is better yet: 12 entire women (of 216 laureates). And the Nobels only scratch the surface of the reputation laundering endemic in the scientific community.\n\nElite institutions are engaged in the same kind of racket. In order to maintain their elite reputations, they pull talented scholars from other schools once those scholars have published remarkable work; they employ young scholars with the \u201cright\u201d background, which usually means a powerful adviser who\u2019s recommended that scholar; and they highly value fundraising and publicity. Nothing succeeds like success.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: the people who received Epstein\u2019s money after his conviction didn\u2019t care about the victimization of girls. At no point did anyone experiencing \u201cnerd tunnel vision\u201d think about the demoralizing effects this money might have on women in the broader scientific community, nor did they consider the women whose work wasn\u2019t funded as a result. The people who received Epstein\u2019s money before his conviction aren\u2019t without blame, either. They didn\u2019t seem to mind leaving out their professional female peers, nor did they object to the presence of lots of young women who had nothing to do with science.\n\nBefore The New Yorker blew up Ito\u2019s apology tour, the MIT Media Lab held a discussion about the fallout of the original Epstein revelations that reportedly began with breathing exercises and reflection. Ito had likely hoped to begin a process of \u201crestorative justice\u201d that would end with him keeping his job. But the meeting went off the rails when Nicholas Negroponte, who founded the lab, told the audience that he would have taken Epstein\u2019s money all over again, suggesting he didn\u2019t think it was wrong. \u201cIf you wind back the clock,\u201d he said, \u201cI would still say: take it.\u201d", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein liked to describe himself as a \"science philanthropist,\" and academics liked to take his money.
