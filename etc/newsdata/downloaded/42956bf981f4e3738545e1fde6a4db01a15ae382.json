Rather than speaking in Trumpian terms of narrow American interests, he employed the seemingly bygone, more universalist language of American values.\n\nWith the cameras rolling, the U.S. vice president told Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi this week during a summit in Singapore that there was no \u201cexcuse\u201d for the Myanmar military\u2019s violent persecution of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims. He reminded her that the United States places a \u201cpremium\u201d on democratic institutions like \u201ca free and independent press.\u201d\n\nIt was a stirring performance. But then one recalled the Trump administration\u2019s muted response to the plight of the Rohingya, the president\u2019s own relative silence on the matter, and the fact that back in the United States, he was denouncing journalists as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d who peddle \u201cfake news.\u201d The cumulative effect was that Pence didn\u2019t come across as a man bearing a stern warning from the White House. He appeared, instead, to be a true believer in a message all his own.\n\nThe president and his top advisers have tended to selectively invoke traditional U.S. values like democracy and human rights as a cudgel against adversaries such as China, Cuba, and Iran, and to otherwise downplay them in carrying out their \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda. But Pence, along with outgoing Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, has emerged as a minority voice in the administration for a values-driven approach to foreign policy. It\u2019s a conviction that seems to arise at least in part from Pence\u2019s evangelical Christian faith. And it doesn\u2019t include values that many Christian conservatives oppose, like gay or reproductive rights.\n\nIf Trump consistently champions any value, it\u2019s that of adhering exclusively to national interests. The vice president, by contrast, often describes his country\u2019s overriding interest in the world as defending and advancing its values, which he has associated with Christian teachings about serving as a beacon to a troubled world, embracing God-given religious liberty, and recognizing persecution as a central component of faith.\n\nPence subscribes to the notion, which the Puritans borrowed from Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount, of the United States as a divinely favored \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201d As an Indiana congressman and governor, he stressed the country\u2019s unique role in the world as a \u201cbeacon of freedom.\u201d\n\nLong before he was getting ahead of other Trump-administration officials in condemning the apparent murder of a journalist by the Saudi state as an affront to the \u201cfree world,\u201d Pence was co-founding a congressional caucus to promote press freedom around the world. (Prior to entering Congress in 2001, he worked for years as a conservative talk-radio host.)\n\nWell before he was denouncing the repressive rule of Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, then-Congressman Pence was lambasting Barack Obama for \u201cwarmly greeting\u201d the \u201cvirulent anti-American socialist dictator\u201d of Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. (Imagine what Congressman Pence might say about his current boss falling \u201cin love\u201d with the virulently anti-American dictator of North Korea.)\n\nWhereas Trump stopped talking about Kim Jong Un\u2019s brutality when he started talks with the North Korean leader about giving up his nuclear weapons, Pence has persisted in calling out the Kim regime for persecuting Christians and subjecting the North Korean people to \u201cunparalleled privation and cruelty.\u201d\n\nAnd more so than other Trump advisers, Pence has emphasized that the current confrontation between China and the United States is as much about clashing values as it is about the balance of trade or relative military might. In an October address on the administration\u2019s China policy, the vice president expressed alarm about the Chinese government\u2019s sprawling surveillance and censorship apparatus, \u201cOrwellian\u201d social-credit system, and ruthless crackdown on its Christian, Buddhist, and Muslim minorities.\n\n\u201cAs history attests, a country that oppresses its own people rarely stops there. Beijing also aims to extend its reach across the wider world,\u201d Pence warned.\n\nThe vice president has explicitly linked these positions to his theological beliefs. He\u2019s noted, for example, that religious freedom \u201cis endowed not by government, but by our Creator\u201d and is therefore the right of \u201call people so endowed\u201d rather than some special American inheritance. And he\u2019s stated that the persecution of Christians anywhere in the world bears witness to the truth of the Gospel, pointing to the biblical passage that \u201call who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\u201d\n\nBut as a result, Pence\u2019s conception of American values is largely focused on religious freedom, particularly the freedom of Christians, and dismissive of some other liberties. For instance, as a congressman, Pence opposed a foreign-relations bill on the grounds that it promoted \u201ca set of values,\u201d such as \u201cabortion rights overseas\u201d and \u201cchanges in laws regarding homosexuality around the world,\u201d that \u201care at odds with the majority of the American people\u201d and thus don\u2019t qualify as \u201cuniversally recognized human rights.\u201d As vice president, he endorsed Trump\u2019s restoration of a policy prohibiting U.S. foreign assistance to organizations that advocate for abortion rights or offer abortion counseling and related services.\n\nAs Pence tells it, free worship is the key to a freer and safer world. \u201cWhen religious liberty is denied or destroyed, we know that other freedoms\u2014freedom of speech, of press, assembly, and even democratic institutions themselves\u2014are imperiled,\u201d he declared during a religious-freedom summit the administration organized in July. \u201cThose nations that reject religious freedom breed radicalism and resentment in their citizens. They sow the seeds of violence within their borders\u2014violence that often spills over into their neighbors and across the world.\u201d\n\nAnd Pence argues that his own flock is more endangered than any other religion. This has prompted the vice president to help direct tens of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to Christians and other minorities in Iraq, and to use the term genocide in describing isis\u2019s assault on Christians (he did not mention that word when discussing the fate of the Rohingya with Suu Kyi). \u201cThroughout the world, no people of faith today face greater hostility or hatred than the followers of Christ,\u201d Pence has asserted.\n\n\u201cAfter this great nation secured our independence, the American Founders enshrined religious freedom as the first freedom in the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Pence noted in the July speech.\n\nThen he quoted George Washington\u2019s letter to a Jewish congregation in Rhode Island. U.S. policy was \u201cworthy of imitation,\u201d the first president had observed, because the U.S. government \u201cgives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\u201d", "description": "In Asia, Trump\\'s vice president delivered a Christian message all on his own.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman", "Staff Writer", "The Atlantic", "Read Bio", "Uri Friedman Is A Senior Associate Editor At The Atlantic", "Where He Oversees The Global Channel.
