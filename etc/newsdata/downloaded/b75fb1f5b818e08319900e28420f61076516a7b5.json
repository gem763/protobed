Business representatives believe the big companies such as supermarket chains will be able to put systems in place to deal with any checks but will be looking for government assistance to help smaller businesses.\n\nWill there be a border through the Irish Sea immediately if parliament votes for a deal?\n\nNo. The discussion over the Irish border is part of Boris Johnson\u2019s alternative arrangements to the controversial backstop. It will only be triggered if the UK and EU do not seal their main trade deal before the end of the transition period.\n\nWhat kind of checks will be made?\n\nThe extent and type of checks will not be clear until the detail of the deal emerges, but essentially they fall into two categories: tariffs and VAT. Excise duties also apply but will not trouble most importers as they generally apply to a limited amount of controlled goods including alcohol, cigarettes and fuel.\n\nWho will be required to have their goods checked?\n\nCustoms declarations apply for both exports and imports and, although the trade is domestic, for the purposes of this version of a Brexit backstop, the checks will be made on behalf of the EU. It is concerned about goods from a third country leaking into Ireland and therefore the single market.\n\nWhat will businesses selling to Northern Ireland have to do?\n\nExporters from Great Britain will be required to fill out complicated customs declaration forms. Anna Jerzewska, an independent customs consultant, says each form has 50 fields and, according to government estimates last week, will take 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete.\n\nEach business will have to establish all its commodity codes, a 10-digit number unique to each product that determines the precise tariff applicable.\n\nUsing school shirts as an example, the code will vary according to the components in the shirt: whether the shirt is of knitted fabric, cotton, whether it has sleeves, pockets, whether the overlap at the front is right over left or left over right.\n\n\u201cAll these commodity codes have to be exact and if you get it wrong you could be committing an offence,\u201d said Jerzewska. \u201cPeople will have to find that code and that will be a challenge. Imagine if you had to find the commodity code for your laptop. Where would you even start?\u201d\n\nWhat happens when the goods arrive in Belfast?\n\nThe \u201cbuyer\u201d or importer will have to pay an EU tariff. This is likely to be collected on behalf of the EU by UK officials, although in time it is likely to be an electronic transaction.\n\nWhat happens if the importer is also selling that shirt to schools in Dublin?\n\nThere will not be any check on the box of shirts as it crosses the border, but the importer will not get a rebate on this consignment if it is sold in Dublin.\n\nWill getting a rebate be easy?\n\nIt is not clear how the government intends to proceed with the tariff arrangements but if it works like the Dover-Calais system it will not be easy.\n\nThere is no system set up for a seamless tariff pay and refund system that will be the success or failure at the heart of the new Irish backstop. Currently the EU operates a streamlined refund system for VAT known as VIES (VAT information exchange system) across Europe.\n\nThere is nothing similar for tariffs, leaving retailers and traders concerned. \u201cPeople won\u2019t want to pay tariffs upfront and then wait weeks for a refund because it will kill your working capital. It will have to be a seamless invisible transaction,\u201d said Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium.", "description": "We examine the impact of the Brexit plans under discussion between the EU and UK", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f35dd5754d603cf5c9ff67020ef06428c3007e/510_0_2937_1763/master/2937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f87a26d4e7054b1c3bb7d63d0bfa3a5c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
