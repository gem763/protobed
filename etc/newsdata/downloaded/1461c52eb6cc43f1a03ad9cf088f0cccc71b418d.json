The ONS report also showed there were 6.2million couple families \u2013 where both a mother and father were bringing up their children \u2013 in the UK.\n\nOf these, 73.2 per cent have both parents in work. Mothers who work are supported by measures such as tax credits and subsidised and free childcare.\n\nEarlier this week, research showed over a quarter of new mothers return to full-time work or self-employed jobs within three years of having a baby [File photo]\n\nBut families with stay-at-home mothers have no similar state support to help them apart from child benefit.\n\nTom Vizard, of the ONS, said: \u2018In 2019, three-quarters of mothers with dependent children were in work, up from two-thirds of mothers at the start of the century. In comparison, over nine in ten fathers were working.\u2019 The proportion of working mothers overtook the share of women without children who have jobs in the mid-2000s.\n\nHowever, yesterday\u2019s figures also showed that while more mothers overall work to pay the bills, many cut back on their hours or career ambitions to spend more time at home.\n\nNearly three out of ten mothers with a child under the age of 14 reduced working hours for childcare reasons.\n\nBut only one in 20 fathers made a similar move. It is a blow for ministers who have been pressing for more mothers to return to full-time work soon after having a baby \u2013 and for men to take a greater role in caring for children.\n\nThe ONS figures put the number of full-time stay-at-home parents in families headed by a couple at fewer than 1.7million.\n\nThe steadily rising proportion of women who have at least part-time paid work while they bring up their children passed the landmark figure in the spring [File photo]\n\nThe great majority of these are stay-at-home mothers who bring up children rather than follow a career \u2013 and can afford to run a home without relying on two incomes.\n\nEarlier this week, research showed over a quarter of new mothers return to full-time work or self-employed jobs within three years of having a baby.\n\nAnother report, by the Marriage Foundation think-tank, showed the proportion of families with a child under five where the father alone goes out to work has remained at over nine out of ten since the Nineties. However, mothers are the sole earner in fewer than one out of ten such families.\n\nSpokesman Harry Benson said: \u2018Years of social and policy efforts to encourage dads to be more equal parents of young children have utterly failed to translate into any shift in who takes prime responsibility.\u2019\n\nHe insisted: \u2018Over the past two decades, in families where only one parent works, it remains stubbornly the case that it is almost invariably the dad who goes out and mum who stays at home.\u2019", "description": "The steadily rising proportion of women who have at least part-time paid work while they bring up their children passed the landmark figure in the spring.", "authors": ["Steve Doughty Social Affairs Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/00/20158182-0-image-a-55_1571958663815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
