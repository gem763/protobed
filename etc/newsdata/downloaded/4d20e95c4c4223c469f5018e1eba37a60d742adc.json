In 2015 the businessman died of an undisclosed illness. At the time of his death Prosper was legally married to Tina but was in a traditional union with musician and socialite Tina Dlangwana.\n\nNow, it seems, Tina may have found her happily ever after in the beefy arms of Generations: The Legacy actor Fuzile Mahamba. They\u2019ve been dating for six months and Tina couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never give up on love based on previous love relationships that didn\u2019t work out because I don\u2019t live my life from a point of fear,\u201d she tells DRUM.\n\nHer marriage to Prosper, she says, and everything that\u2019s happened in between, was all meant to bring her to this point in her life.\n\n\u201cI see everything I went through as part of what was meant to happen to me. I had to learn to love myself first, wholeheartedly. I know who I am as a person, I believe in God and I\u2019m here today because of good and bad experiences I went through.\u201d\n\nTina and Fuzile kept their relationship under wraps until friends leaked a video of them cuddling in the bedroom to a tabloid newspaper. Tina, who has always been very candid about her private life, says she wishes news of the relationship was better handled.\n\n\u201cI understand that I\u2019m an actress and my fans, the media and my work intertwine. My issue is that all stakeholders need to be sensitive about how information is put out because we have kids, families and careers to sustain,\u201d she says.\n\nNow that the secret\u2019s out, however, she wants people to know that only once they love themselves will they find love in the arms of someone else.\n\nAs she puts it, \u201cYou are who you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nWith a year to go before Tina turns the big 5\u20130, she\u2019s been doing a lot of introspection. Earlier this year the actress told us she was \u201con a spiritual journey to self-actualisation\u201d and hadn\u2019t touched alcohol, meat or dairy products for two months. She\u2019s a changed person and the person who has helped her find inner happiness is her spiritual teacher, Swami Vishwaparanthapananda (Making magic together, 7 March).\n\nRecently, she wrote online that her Swami was going overseas but Tina wears a ring to remind her of his teachings. Her spiritual teacher has helped change her mindset, she says. \u201cWhen you change how you look at things, a lot of things start making sense and you have a positive mindshift.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had it hard because I refused to learn some lessons the easy way, so most of my life lessons, such as self-love, were learnt the hard way.\u201d\n\nThe hard lessons, however, made her a tough cookie. \u201cI\u2019m highly resilient and I don\u2019t give up easily,\u201d Tina says. \u201cMy dad was a warrior in a sense \u2013 he used to tell me if a man says something to me, I need to rephrase the question and ask him to repeat himself.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what he meant back then but now I know he was teaching me never to be taken advantage of and to stand up for myself in every situation, especially in love.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s learnt to value herself and her new man knows her worth too. \u201cTina is a strong woman who\u2019s ready to take a bullet for her loved ones,\u201d Fuzile tells us.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s loving and knows how to keep her family warm. I love and respect her, and I know that she does too. We\u2019re like friends who share everything together.\n\nThe relationship has become pretty serious but \u201cwe\u2019re currently taking things one step at a time and putting God first\u201d, Fuzile says.\n\n\u201cShe has all the qualities I need in a woman and, God willing, I would like to spend the rest of my life with her.\u201d\n\nTina met Fuzile (40) at OR International airport after she had dropped her ID, according to newspaper reports. Fuzile picked it up and tapped her on the shoulder to return it. Later, when the actors realised that they were seated next to each other on the same flight, they struck up a conversation.\n\n\u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t sure because I wasn\u2019t really into masculine guys with a big moustache,\u201d Tina told Sowetan Live. \u201cI saw him as a fan who was just starstruck but he kept on pressing until I gave in.\u201d\n\nThe younger man\u2019s persistence has paid off but Tina isn\u2019t in a rush to walk down the aisle. She refuses to base her happiness on an event, marital status or a feeling, she says. As happy as her new man makes her, Tina\u2019s responsible for her own happiness.\n\n\u201cWe are quick to react and label our partners\u2019 behaviours as inconsiderate, without turning the situation and looking at it from their perspective,\u201d Tina says. \u201cWe tend to have unrealistic expectations of our partners and forget that we are mirroring each other, through good and bad personality traits, while trying to find our own rhythms.\u201d\n\nShe and Fuzile seem to have found their rhythm and are dancing to their own beat. They\u2019re happily in love and the key, she says, is to take each day as it comes.\n\n\u201cIt the train is moving, let it move; if it stops, let it stop,\u201d she says laughing.\n\nThe free-spirited actress has always done things her way. \u201cI live my life with no regret and judgement and believe that whatever happens is meant to be,\u201d Tina says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced expensive learning curves because some of my life lessons I had to learn over and over again until I got the lesson. I believe there\u2019s no right or wrong in how one lives their life, just consequences to our actions and the decisions we make.\u201d", "description": "Tina Jaxa took charge of her own happiness \u2013 and it led to her finding love when she least expected it.", "authors": ["Dimakatso Ngoasheng"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/197ea413a15846e99f454af0635c5f38.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
