Is the party\u2019s projected majority in parliament somehow lacking?\n\n\u201cKaczynski really counted on a bigger majority, which would allow him to override presidential vetos,\u201d said Olgierd Annusewicz, a political scientist at Warsaw University. The result makes next year\u2019s presidential ballot more important, as a defeat there could throw a spanner in plans to complete the revolution, he said.\n\nNo K.O.\n\nOne obvious disappointment for Law & Justice was the Senate: it clinched just 49 of the 100 seats. But losing its majority there will only slow -- not stop -- legislation, as lower house can override amendments. And with more than 99% of the vote counted, the nationalists won 43.8%, giving them a single-party majority.\n\nA knockout victory at the ballot box would have boosted sentiment that four years of work transforming Poland into a rogue from one of the European Union\u2019s most reliable partners, would soon be irreversible. It would have also bolstered Law & Justice\u2019s arguments that voters don\u2019t agree with the bloc\u2019s criticism over democratic standards.\n\nInstead, broadsheet Rzeczpospolita called it \u201cA victory on points,\u201d while daily Dziennik Gazeta Prawna led with: \u201cDirection: No Change.\u201d\n\nNot exactly the revolution Kaczynski had in mind.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Wojciech Moskwa in Warsaw at wmoskwa@bloomberg.net;Marek Strzelecki in Warsaw at mstrzelecki1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net, ;Andrea Dudik at adudik@bloomberg.net, Michael Winfrey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- For a party that just achieved their country\u2019s best showing in a parliamentary election since the fall of communism, Poland\u2019s ruling nationalists are unusually glum.After an exit poll announced the historic win late on Sunday, Law & Justice Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski sulked in front of", "authors": ["Wojciech Moskwa", "Marek Strzelecki"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oQKn2zu_QblQ9a1_3BrHZg--~B/aD0xMzkyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2d306809731b7240227c51033597985d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
