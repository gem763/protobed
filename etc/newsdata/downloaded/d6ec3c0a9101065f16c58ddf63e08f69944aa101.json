He had gotten into a confrontation with GM Mike Mayock on Wednesday in which he reportedly used disparaging language and cussed out Mayock.\n\nDespite the rift, the Raiders planned to play Brown in the season opener on Monday. But on Friday night, Brown posted a video to his YouTube channel of what appeared to be a phone conversation between him and head coach Jon Gruden that Brown taped.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the video, Gruden purportedly asks Brown to \u201cstop this s\u2014 and just play football,\u201d with Brown insisting that he\u2019s wanted to be a Raider since \u201cday one.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cPlease stop this s\u2014- and just play football. How hard is that?\u201d Gruden said on the video. \u201cYou\u2019re a great football player. Just play football.\u201d\n\nBrown said: \u201cI don't know why it's a question of me wanting to be a Raider; it's like, do you guys want me to be a Raider?\"\n\nIn the caption to the video, Brown called out false narratives and ended it with \u201cFree me!\u201d\n\nIt appears that he quite literally wants to be freed from the Raiders.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\u201cRelease me Raiders,\u201d he wrote, adding the hashtag #NOMore.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FzlVd8YeV_593MpVZ7DNXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A7EDn.KSbKayisPcUuD9Ag--~B/aD0yODMwO3c9NDI0NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/1adb7a00-c20f-11e9-9fed-f4ad40255b63", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
