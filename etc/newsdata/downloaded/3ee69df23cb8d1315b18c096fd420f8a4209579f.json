Under the current playoff format adopted in 1990, only 30 of 238 teams that started out 0-2 recovered to reach the playoffs.\n\nHistory provides a glimmer of hope, however, for the Broncos and the eight other teams that are 0-2.\n\nIn each of the past six seasons, at least one such team reached the playoffs. Houston and Seattle did it last season and in 2015. New Orleans did it in 2017, Miami in 2016, Indianapolis in 2014 and Carolina in 2013.\n\nBefore that, there was a four-year stretch when no 0-2 team made the playoffs.\n\nIn 2008, New England won its first two but without an injured Tom Brady, the Patriots missed the playoffs at 11-5, while San Diego started out 0-2 and made the playoffs at 8-8.\n\nThat anomaly aside, it\u2019s historically a whole lot easier for teams to make the playoffs if they get off to a 2-0 start.\n\nWhile only eight 0-2 teams have reached the playoffs over the past decade, 42 of 77 teams that started 2-0 (54 percent) made it.\n\nThis year, that bodes well for the Patriots, Bills, Chiefs and Ravens in the AFC and for the Cowboys, Rams, Seahawks, 49ers and Packers in the NFC.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the candidates to make it seven straight seasons for an 0-2 team to still be playing past Week 17:\n\nMIAMI DOLPHINS : Outscored 102-10, they\u2019re the longest of long shots, although it\u2019s a good bet the No. 1 pick in 2020 will be theirs.\n\nDENVER BRONCOS : They\u2019ve collected zero sacks and zero takeaways and LT Garett Bolles\u2019 holding habit is worse than ever.\n\nCINCINNATI BENGALS : Zac Taylor\u2019s team flopped against the 49ers at home after a solid showing at Seattle.\n\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS : No Brown. No Bell. And now, no Big Ben. Welcome to the Steel City, Minkah Fitzpatrick.\n\nJACKSONVILLE JAGUARS : Jalen Ramsey just wants to win and he figures that might have to happen somewhere else.\n\nNEW YORK GIANTS : No more Eli Manning, who joins Roethlisberger, Brees and Foles as Super Bowl champ QBs watching backups play.\n\nWASHINGTON REDSKINS : Case Keenum is enjoying a rebound from his awful season in Denver, but D isn\u2019t what it was cracked up to be.\n\nCAROLINA PANTHERS : Cam Newton doesn\u2019t look right - and no, we\u2019re not talking about his fashion choices.\n\nNEW YORK JETS : Sam Darnold sidelined by mononucleosis, backup Trevor Siemian sidelined by Myles Garrett.\n\nThe Broncos were the only NFL team to start 2-0 in each of the previous six seasons. Under Peyton Manning, they parlayed three fast starts into two Super Bowl runs and one title. Since his retirement, not even a sniff of the playoffs.\n\nA loss at Green Bay on Sunday would make Vic Fangio the first coach in the franchise\u2019s 60-year history to lose his first three games.\n\nAnd history is even crueler to 0-3 teams, with only six of 176 such squads reaching the playoffs since the 16-game schedule was adopted in 1980. That includes the 1982 Buccaneers, who went 5-4 in the strike-shortened season and was one of 16 playoff teams in an expanded format.\n\nThe others are the \u201881 Jets, \u201892 Chargers, \u201895 Lions, \u201898 Bills and \u201818 Texans, who were the first 0-3 team to make it past Week 17 since the current division alignment in 2002.\n\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d Harris said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win this weekend!\u201d\n\nThe \u201892 Chargers are the only team in NFL history to reach the playoffs after starting 0-4.\n\nEXTRA, EXTRA! Denver\u2019s Brandon McManus missed an extra point Sunday but was given a reprieve because holder Colby Wadman\u2019s hard count had drawn Buster Skrine offside. Otherwise, there would have been 10 missed PATs through two games for the first time since the NFL pushed the extra point back from 20 yards out in 2015.\n\nThe 33-yard PATs have given the league the drama it craved:\n\n-2019: 9 missed, 1 blocked; 93.8 percent accuracy\n\n-2018: 8 missed, 1 blocked; 94.9 accuracy\n\n-2017: 8 missed; 93.5 percent\n\n-2016: 9 missed, 3 blocked; 93.9 percent\n\n-2015: 9 missed, 2 blocked; 94.2 percent\n\n-2014 (last year of old PAT): 1 missed, 1 blocked; 99.3 percent\n\nCOLIN HAS COMPANY: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson threw for 272 yards and two TDs and rushed for a career-high 120 yards in Baltimore\u2019s 23-17 win over Arizona. He\u2019s the first player with at least 250 yards passing and 120 yards rushing in a regular-season game in NFL history.\n\nColin Kaepernick did it in his first career playoff game, leading the 49ers to a 45-31 win over Green Bay on Jan. 12, 2013. Kaepernick had 263 yards passing and two TDs and ran for 181 yards and two scores.\n\nDOMINANT PATRIOTS: The defending champion Patriots have outscored their opponents 76-3 in the first two games. They\u2019re the fourth team in the Super Bowl era with a plus-70 point differential after two games, joining the \u201867 Raiders, \u201870 Lions and \u201875 Redskins. New England also is the fourth team to allow three or fewer points through two games, joining the \u201870 Lions, \u201876 Oilers and \u201881 Bills.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Last week, cornerback Chris Harris Jr. mentioned how critical it was for the Broncos to beat the Bears because \"there's not a lot of 0-2 teams that make the playoffs.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/buccaneers_panthers_football_95758_c0-158-3780-2361_s1770x1032.jpg?4cf8d91ab985b6bdf16abf575ce8866398896294", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
