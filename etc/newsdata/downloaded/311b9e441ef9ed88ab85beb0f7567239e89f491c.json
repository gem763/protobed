Maybe get back to parliament?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Thousands protest after Boris Johnson requests to suspend parliament Show all 29 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

What about parliament?'\n\n\"I am so concerned about the proroguing of parliament and that real attack on democracy and the hypocrisy, the contrast between what he was saying and his actions and the fact that he must think we are stupid.\"\n\nMr Gilchrist insisted his intervention was not driven by party politics or his belief in EU membership.\n\n\"I have got an opinion on Brexit, but actually the proroguing has made me more passionate, because I see it as a flagrant attack on democracy and on those fundamental values of our country,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not about being party political or about Brexit per se. The whole point of Brexit was supposed to be about repatriating powers and allowing parliament to do its job. For me, it's the attack on democracy that's the real issue.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Doncaster earlier in the day, Mr Johnson was confronted by an angry woman who told him: \u201cPeople have died because of austerity.\n\n\"And you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now and we\u2019re going to leave the EU and everything\u2019s going to be great \u2013 it\u2019s just a fairy tale.\u201d\n\nHe showed no reaction as one man told him: \u201cFind a deal here? This is Doncaster, not Europe.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has been interrupted during a high-profile speech by a heckler protesting at his decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the Brexit deadline.
