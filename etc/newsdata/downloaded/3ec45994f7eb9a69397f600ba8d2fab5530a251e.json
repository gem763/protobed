Not an objective test. The question is not, 'Was the fear rational?' The question is, 'Did the fear exist?'\" he asked.\n\nNEIGHBOR WHO CALLED 911 ABOUT JEFFERSON\u2019S HOME SAYS \u2018ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO IS RING THE DOORBELL\u2019\n\nNapolitano cited another recent case in Texas in which Amber Guyger, a former Dallas police officer convicted of murder in the shooting that killed neighbor Botham Jean, was sentenced by a jury to 10 years behind bars.\n\n\"Her defense was that it was an honest mistake,\" he said. \"But, she was ultimately not able to prove that defense.\"\n\nDean was arrested hours after resigning from the Fort Worth Police Department. In a statement, the Department said that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \"perceiving a threat.\"\n\nTEXAS MAN WHO SAID COPS WOULDN'T FIND HIM IS FOUND, ARRESTED ON BURGLARY CHARGE\n\nThe body camera video released shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights. Then one officer shouts, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\" A single shot is then fired through a window.\n\nIn the video, the officer does not identify himself as police.\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price said that the killing of Jefferson was unjustified.\n\nOn Monday, Price told reporters: \"I'm so sorry. On behalf of the entire city of Fort Worth, I'm sorry. To Atatiana's family, it's unacceptable. There's nothing can justify what happened on Saturday morning. Nothing.\"\n\n\"At the time the Chief made that statement, he went through a litany of things which -- according to the Chief -- officers of Fort Worth are trained to do which he did not do,\" said Napolitano. \"Which...would have made it very difficult for them to defend him.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNapolitano told Hemmer that in most states the prosecution must disprove the affirmative defense. However, in Texas the burden of proof is reversed--it's on the defendant.\n\n\"It's much higher and a very difficult burden to meet,\" he added.\n\nFox News\u2019 Greg Norman, Mike Arroyo, Louis Casiano, Melissa Leon, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said Tuesday that former Fort Worth officer Aaron\u00a0Dean will have to prove to the jury that he had a \"justifiable fear in his mind of physical harm\" after killing 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson in her mother's home on Saturday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/NAPS-CROP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
