The airline is currently reconfiguring its Boeing 777-200, 777-300 and 787-9 aircraft to fit a stretch zone at the front of the Economy Class cabin, with up to 42 seats.\n\nDespite being the same seat as in Economy Class, Economy Stretch will have a 35-inch seat pitch. This compares to Air New Zealand's standard Economy Class seat pitch of around 31 inches and 41 inches in Premium Economy.\n\nAir New Zealand's Chief Revenue Officer, Cam Wallace, said, \"We know one size doesn't fit all and we want customers to have a fantastic experience, whatever the cabin. Economy customers told us they want more space and comfort and we're looking forward to giving customers a new option when travelling long haul. While our premium cabins will remain the first choice for those wanting all the luxuries, Economy Stretch is a step-up at a competitive price, and we're confident it will appeal.\"\n\nAir New Zealand is currently installing an Economy Stretch zone across its widebody fleet with all aircraft to be reconfigured by late 2020.\n\nThe new product will be available for purchase from early next year and will be offered on all Air New Zealand operated long-haul flights from late 2020.\n\n\u00a9 Asia Travel Tips", "description": "Air New Zealand has launched Economy Stretch.
