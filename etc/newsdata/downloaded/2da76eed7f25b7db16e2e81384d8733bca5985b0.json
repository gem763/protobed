We're all hoping that over the next 72 hours, we're just talking about two football matches.\n\n'I think both countries would have a strong desire for that and I have to say again, we don't look at other countries in a way that we don't shine a mirror on our own.\n\n'What happened in Hartlepool a couple of weeks ago was probably worse than things I've seen or heard about in many other countries in the world. So, I think we have to be very careful in how we cover everything.'\n\nSouthgate has been trying to ease tensions, saying they're not trying to fan the flames\n\nIn his letter to UEFA, Mihaylov wrote: 'The Bulgarian Football Union, the Bulgarian general public and I find offensive due to unjust branding of the local spectators as people inclined to discriminatory behaviour.\n\n'We feel that this fixation on potential incidents during the game in Sofia does not do justice to the Bulgarian supporters, the general public and to the extreme efforts and measures that we have taken in order to ensure a fair and safe environment for a true footballing spectacle.'\n\nMeanwhile, Southgate is set to keep faith with Michael Keane at centre back despite his poor night in England's 5-3 win over Kosovo last month, while Kieran Trippier hopes to play, ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold, at right back.\n\nMason Mount will play in an advanced midfield role for his full England debut, with Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice also in midfield.", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL IN PRAGUE: England were caught in an explosive race row on Thursday after Bulgarian football chiefs made an official complaint to UEFA.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19561474-0-image-a-10_1570744955738.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
