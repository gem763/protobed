And it will no longer make available the types of bullets that while used in hunting rifles can also be fired by military-style weapons.\n\nAdditionally, in the more than two dozen states with open carry laws, Walmart is \"respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores and Sam's Clubs ... unless they are authorized law enforcement officers,'' said Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs.\n\nThat action follows \"multiple cases'' in which people entered their stores with visible weapons, upsetting customers and employees, Bartlett said.\n\nWalmart has been the focus of a campaign by gun control activists and others to pressure it to stop selling guns and take other actions in the wake of a wave of mass shootings, including one at a Walmart in El Paso last month that left 22 people dead.\n\nRead the Walmart memo: CEO Doug McMillon outlines mass shootings' response\n\nWhat to do after Dorian: After Hurricane Dorian: Your house has flooded. Here's what you should do next.\n\nBy asking customers not to openly carry weapons in its stores, Walmart will join other retailers such as Starbucks that have implemented similar policies. Walmart will post signs to inform customers of the change and train employees in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We just hope that customers will understand the rationale behind this, that it is not an attempt to question their legal rights,'' Bartlett said. \"It's certainly just about the experience we've had in our own stores that have put too many customers, too many associates in a place of extreme discomfort. ... We've had multiple cases of evacuations because of this.''\n\nFollowing Walmart's announcement, Kroger also asked shoppers to leave guns at home and is encouraging lawmakers to pass laws that will strengthen background checks.\n\nWalmart will also no longer sell handguns in Alaska, the one state where it still allowed such purchases.\n\nWalmart will sell what remains of the handgun ammunition it has offered, along with the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber ammunition that can be used in military-style weapons. But then it will be focused on guns used by sportsmen. The changes it is making will shrink Walmart's ammunition market share from roughly 20% to between 6% and 9%, Bartlett said. The retailer makes up about 2% of the gun market.\n\nSome gun control advocates praised the steps Walmart announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWalmart deserves enormous credit for joining the strong and growing majority of Americans who know that we have too many guns in our country and they are too easy to get,\u201d Igor Volsky, the organization's executive director and founder said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Volsky added \"that work doesn\u2019t end with Walmart\u2019s decision today. As Congress comes back to consider gun violence, Walmart should make it clear that it stands with Americans who are demanding real change.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon to employees, he said the company is calling for federal lawmakers to improve background checks and to create legislation that would \"remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger. ... Today, I\u2019m sending letters to the White House and the congressional leadership that call for action on these common sense measures.''\n\nA Walmart in El Paso, Texas, was the site of one of two mass shootings the weekend of Aug. 3 that together left 31 people dead and dozens more injured.\n\nIn this file photo taken on August 6, 2019, a makeshift memorial for victims of the shooting that left a total of 22 people dead in a shjooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.
