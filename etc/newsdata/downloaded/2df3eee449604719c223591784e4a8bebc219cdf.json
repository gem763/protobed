At the moment, it is at its lowest level.\n\nLow rainfall in recent weeks and the possible over-extraction of water have also led to the table becoming lower, Mokgoro said.\n\n\"Furthermore, some of the boreholes, which have been in use for many years, have also dried up, while others have collapsed in the Grootfontein compartment. The government is working on the urgent rehabilitation of these boreholes as well as identifying new ones at a different compartment for further testing,\" he added.\n\nMokgoro said the government and other stakeholders were attending to the challenges.\n\nHe stated the second water source in Mahikeng, the Modimola water purification plant near the Modimola Dam, was polluted with raw sewage due to the non-functioning water purification system of the Mahikeng Local Municipality.\n\nPlans to start removing the sewage are underway.\n\nThe Department of Water and Sanitation assured the premier it was at an advanced stage with the testing of new and extra boreholes.\n\nIt added once the results were available on the water quality, an effort would be made to increase the supply of adequate drinking water.", "description": "Residents of Mahikeng in the North West have been urged to remain patient as the provincial government works toward reducing water cuts being experienced in the area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4059/7f28e9ffbb3045478f721500f22138d2.gif", "published_at": "2019-07-10"}
