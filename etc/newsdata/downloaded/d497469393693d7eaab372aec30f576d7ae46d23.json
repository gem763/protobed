And there\u2019s Jadon too.\n\n\u201cYou want to be able to get them all into the game, and maybe at 5-1 or whatever we were, our intentions would have been to do that. At 5-2, 5-3, then you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Hmm, OK, how do we actually affect the game?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe felt, in actual fact, we were still a huge threat with the ball, and we didn\u2019t really feel the need to take a step back because we weren\u2019t structurally defending poorly, we\u2019d just made some crazy errors.\n\n\u201cSo, at some of those moments, rather than change something for the sake of it that actually might influence it the wrong way, we left it because we thought generally speaking that was the best way to see out the game, and then I felt (Ross) Barkley and Sancho had just started to physically tire at the end and the two lads came in and saw the game out well.\n\n\u201cBut in terms of the young players, there still won\u2019t be many teams in the top tier of European sides this week who have played as many under-22/23s as we have, I would imagine.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s qualifier certainly appeared more beneficial than Saturday\u2019s 4-0 thrashing of Bulgaria at Wembley, where the visitors sat deep and only fleetingly threatened on the counter.\n\nKosovo, by contrast, attacked England at St Mary\u2019s and posed different problems, while their second-half wobble raises questions about the young group\u2019s game-management.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think (the errors) are inevitable because even for a young side we shouldn\u2019t have been making the mistakes that we made,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not a bad thing for them to go through, to experience that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of qualifying games that have been a breeze and (against Kosovo) they\u2019ve had a different sort of test.\n\n\u201cAnd the only way for them to mature and learn and improve is to go through those sorts of situations.\n\n\u201cI mean, you would still feel a two-goal lead... from the side, we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re still in control of the game, but on the pitch that can feel a little bit differently.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to feel that and have to respond to that. We\u2019ve learned a lot from individual and collective responses to those moments (on Tuesday night).\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Gareth Southgate is pleased by the way England\u2019s youngsters are progressing and believes the frenetic win against Kosovo will serve them well.
