It also marked a stark change in rhetoric by Trump, who during a press conference in New York last year vowed to stand by the Kurds, who have been America\u2019s only allies in Syria fighting the Islamic State group . Trump said at the time that the Kurds \u201cfought with us\u201d and \u201cdied with us,\u201d and insisted that America would never forget.\n\nAfter Erdogan announced the offensive, Trump called the operation \u201ca bad idea.\u201d Later Wednesday, he said he didn\u2019t want to be involved in \u201cendless, senseless wars.\u201d\n\nIn northern Syria, residents of the borders areas were in a panic and got out on foot, in cars and with rickshaws piled with mattresses and a few belongings. It was a wrenchingly familiar scenario for the many who, only a few years ago, had fled the advances on their towns and villages by Islamic State group.\n\nPlumes of smoke could be seen rising near the town of Qamishli and clashes continued late Wednesday amid intense shelling as Turkey struck at least six different border towns along a 290-mile (300-kilometer) stretch. At least seven civilians and three members of the Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces were killed in the Turkish bombardment, Kurdish activists and a Syria war monitor said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s campaign \u2014 in which a NATO member is raining down bombs on an area where hundreds of U.S. troops are stationed \u2014 drew immediate criticism and calls for restraint from Europe. In his statement, Trump emphasized that there are no American soldiers in the area under attack.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d Erdogan said in a tweet announcing what he called \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d\n\nHe said that Turkish forces, with Ankara-backed Syrian fighters known as the Syrian National Army, had begun to eradicate what he called \u201cthe threat of terror\u201d against Turkey.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said Turkish warplanes were targeting \u201ccivilian areas\u201d in northern Syria and that shells also had fallen near a prison guarded by Kurds and holding some of the most dangerous IS militants. The AP could not verify the report independently.\n\nIn Washington, officials said two British militants believed to be part of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages and was known as \u201cThe Beatles\u201d had been moved out of a detention center in Syria and were in U.S. custody.\n\nBefore Turkey\u2019s attack, Syrian Kurdish forces who control nearly 30 percent of Syria\u2019s territories warned of a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d More than 2 million people live in the area impacted by the attacks, according to aid groups.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said those killed in the Turkish bombardments included two Christian Assyrians in Qamishli, a married couple and their child, a man in a village outside of the town of Tal Abyad, and a child in a village west of Qamishli.\n\nThe Turkish operation meant to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d carries potential gains and risk for Turkey by getting even more deeply involved in the Syria war. It also would ignite new fighting in Syria\u2019s 8-year-old war, potentially displacing hundreds of thousands.\n\nA resident of Tal Abyad said one of the bombs hit an SDF post, and he fled with his wife and mother by car to Raqqa, nearly 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south, to flee the bombing. The resident, who gave his name as Maher, said the road to Raqqa was packed with vehicles and families, some fleeing on foot \u201cto get away from the bombing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople fled and left everything behind,\u201d he said in a text message after he reached safety.\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey. Expectations of an invasion increased after Trump\u2019s announcement Sunday, although he also threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if the Turkish push went too far.\n\nU.S. critics said he was sacrificing an ally, the Syrian Kurdish forces, and undermining Washington\u2019s credibility. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that if Trump \u201cfollows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\nTrump later said the U.S. \u201cdoes not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nTrump said he made clear from the start of his political career that \u201cI did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars \u2014 especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment.\u201d\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, while noting that Turkey \u201chas legitimate security concerns\u201d after suffering \u201chorrendous terrorist attacks\u201d and hosting thousands of refugees, said the country should not \u201cfurther destabilize the region\u201d with its military action in Syria.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas condemned the offensive, saying it will \u201cfurther destabilize the region and strengthen IS.\u201d The operation also was criticized by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe EU is paying Turkey 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) to help the country cope with almost 4 million Syrian refugees on its territory in exchange for stopping migrants leaving for Europe.\n\nTurkey urged the international community to rally behind Ankara, which he said would take over the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey aimed to \u201cneutralize\u201d Syrian Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria and to \u201cliberate the local population from the yoke of the armed thugs,\u201d Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency\u2019s communications director, wrote in a Washington Post column published Wednesday.\n\nErdogan discussed the incursion by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Erdogan\u2019s office said he told Putin the military action \u201cwill contribute to the peace and stability\u201d and allow for a political process in Syria.\n\nIn its call for a general mobilization, the local civilian Kurdish authority known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria asked the global community to live up to its and asked the U.S.-led coalition to set up a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria to protect the civilian population from Turkish airstrikes.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish group urged Moscow to broker talks with the Syrian government in Damascus in light of the Turkish operation. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration said it is responding positively to calls from Moscow encouraging the Kurds and the Syrian government to settle their difference through talks.\n\nSyria\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned Turkey\u2019s plans, calling it a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of international law and vowing to repel an incursion.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Washington of playing \u201cvery dangerous games\u201d with the Syrian Kurds, saying the U.S. first propped up the Syrian Kurdish \u201cquasi state\u201d in Syria and now is withdrawing support.\n\n\u201cSuch reckless attitude to this highly sensitive subject can set fire to the entire region, and we have to avoid it at any cost,\u201d he said in Kazakhstan.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, three IS militants targeted the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Raqqa, once the de facto IS capital at the height of the militants\u2019 power. An activist collective in Raqqa reported an exchange of fire and an explosion; the Observatory said two IS fighters engaged in a shootout before blowing themselves up.\n\nIS claimed responsibility, saying one of its members killed or wounded 13 SDF members.\n\nThe SDF, which holds thousands of IS fighters in detention facilities in northeastern Syria, has warned that a Turkish incursion might lead to the resurgence of the extremists. The U.S.-allied Kurdish-led force captured the last IS area controlled by the militants in eastern Syria in March.", "description": "Turkey launched airstrikes, fired artillery and began a ground offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday after U.S. troops pulled...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT009_kurds1_ZG_20191009204340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
