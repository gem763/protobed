Label You?", "language": "en", "text": "When Tabong Kima checked his Twitter feed early Wednesday morning, the hashtag of the moment was #ImageNetRoulette.\n\nEveryone, it seemed, was uploading selfies to a website where some sort of artificial intelligence analyzed each face and described what it saw. The site, ImageNet Roulette , pegged one man as an \u201corphan.\u201d Another was a \u201cnonsmoker.\u201d A third, wearing glasses, was a \u201cswot, grind, nerd, wonk, dweeb.\u201d\n\nAcross Mr. Kima\u2019s Twitter feed, these labels \u2014 some accurate, some strange, some wildly off base \u2014 were played for laughs. So he joined in. But Mr. Kima, a 24-year-old African-American, did not like what he saw. When he uploaded his own smiling photo, the site tagged him as a \u201cwrongdoer\u201d and an \u201coffender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might have a bad sense of humor,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think this is particularly funny.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, his response was just what the site was aiming for.
