Blizzard is allowing the Hearthstone pro to keep his prize money and has reduced his ban to six months.\n\nIn a post-match interview on an official Hearthstone stream, Blitzchung wore a gas mask similar to those donned by the Hong Kong protesters and said, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. The revolution of our age!\u201d\n\nBut as Blizzard president J. Allen Brack pointed out, Blitzchung did not break any rules during play. \u201cWe now believe he should receive his prizing,\u201d said Brack in a statement last week.\n\n\u201cWe understand that for some this is not about the prize, and perhaps for others it is disrespectful to even discuss it. That is not our intention. But playing fair also includes appropriate pre-and post-match conduct, especially when a player accepts recognition for winning in a broadcast. When we think about the suspension, six months for Blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.\u201d\n\nThe Hearthstone pro has now issued his own statement about Blizzard\u2019s revised ruling. He is grateful to the company for reconsidering its decision. However, he still thinks the six-month ban is too long and wishes the company would reconsider its firing of the two casters who hid under the desk when he voiced his support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nBlitzchung\u2019s statement is measured and polite.
