Former President Obama decided to take the opportunity to get some press for the Obama Foundation.\n\nObama tweeted out a photo of the meeting.\n\nJust 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. pic.twitter.com/VgCPAaDp3C \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 17, 2019\n\nThe former president fist-bumped with her, because, you know, he\u2019s cool. \u201cYou and me we\u2019re a team.\u201d He asked if she \u201cbelieves\u201d in fist-bumping, which is an odd thing to say, but, ok. The Obama Foundation Twitter account has a short video clip of the two sitting down to talk.\n\nOur future will be shaped by the next generation\u2014and @GretaThunberg isn't waiting to get started. At 16, Greta is a leading voice in the fight to save our planet. Yesterday, she sat down with @BarackObama for a conversation about how no one is too young to change the world. pic.twitter.com/7qnIXyUY8P \u2014 The Obama Foundation (@ObamaFoundation) September 17, 2019\n\nAt the end of August, Greta Thunberg arrived in lower Manhattan on a 60-foot zero carbon-emission yacht. She is in Washington, D.C. to promote an \u201cintergenerational climate strike\u201d on September 20. Tuesday Senator Markey, the sponsor of the Green New Deal in the Senate, organized a news conference with other Democrats. Thunberg attended but didn\u2019t speak. She served as a prop for the cameras to bring attention to the young activists on Capitol Hill. Wednesday she will appear before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and later speak on the steps of the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat Markey may not have expected was to be scolded by the teenager for not doing enough for the cause. He said the 2020 election will be a referendum on climate change. I certainly hope so. Americans looked at the Green New Deal and became concerned for the sanity of the far-left.\n\nBy failing to take meaningful action on climate, our leaders failed the young people of the world. A generation of leaders owes our youngest generations an apology & a commitment to finally take the bold action we\u2019ve failed to achieve. Proud to join young climate activists today. pic.twitter.com/B7DEPKIcfK \u2014 Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) September 17, 2019\n\nMarkey said their movement is shifting the political landscape. The senator pointed to the 2020 presidential debates as evidence of what has changed. Candidates are being asked about climate change and pushed to introduce plans to combat global warming. This is in stark contrast to 2016. \u201cWhat has happened? You have happened,\u201d he told the activists. \u201cYou are giving this extra level of energy to the political process that is absolutely changing the dynamics of politics in the United States.\u201d The 2020 election, Markey said, will in many ways be a \u201creferendum on climate change\u201d.\n\nThunberg and other young climate change activists met with the Senate climate crisis task force on Tuesday. After praising the youngsters and asking for advice on how to move forward, Markey and the others got their comeuppance. The kids want action righthisminute. Save your praise, gramps.\n\n\u201cPlease save your praise. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn\u2019t lead to anything. \u201cIf you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don\u2019t want to be heard. We want science to be heard.\u201d In remarks meant for Congress as a whole, she said: \u201cI know you are trying but just not hard enough. Sorry.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Markey persisted. The man can pander with the best of them. Many of these kids aren\u2019t even old enough to vote and Thunberg isn\u2019t an American citizen. He\u2019ll take marching orders from them anyway. Who is the adult here?\n\n\u201cWe need your leadership,\u201d he told Thunberg. \u201cYoung people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before. And that is creating a new X factor.\u201d Still, Markey vowed to try: \u201cWe hear you. We hear what you\u2019re saying and we will redouble our efforts.\u201d\n\nThe global climate strike on September 20 precedes the U.N. Climate Summit. Thunberg will be in New York for both. Some businesses are so cowed by the kids that they are actually closing their doors for a period of time in support of the climate strike. I\u2019ve written about the liberal activism of companies like Patagonia in the past and that company will join in. Others this year include Amazon.\n\nAmazon employees are planning to take action against their employer. More than 1,400 Amazon employees are expected to strike against the company\u2019s practices that have contributed to the current climate crisis, marking the first walkout at the company\u2019s Seattle headquarters. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the group behind the protest, lists three specific demands: zero emissions by 2030, zero custom Amazon Web Services (AWS) for fossil fuel companies, and zero funding for climate politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft refuse to be left out, too.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Google Workers for Action on Climate tweeted that over 400 employees have committed to join a local climate strike. \u201cI support climate actions because we only have one earth and keeping it alive and healthy is one of the biggest responsibilities that we have,\u201d one Google employee shared on the twitter account. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kids to look at me in 20 years asking how could you screw up like this.\u201d\n\nNew York City schools are excusing students so that they can participate in the strike. I\u2019ll be surprised if other school systems controlled by liberal alarmists don\u2019t do the same. The marching orders have been received.", "description": "\"We're a team\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obama-me.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
