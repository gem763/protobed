He also expressed fears that disaster may have already struck in some areas.\n\nEarthquake, tornado\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 shook the areas drenched by the rainfall, shortly before the typhoon made landfall. The quake was centred in the ocean off the\n\ncoast of Chiba, near Tokyo.\n\nAt least one man was killed as a tornado ripped through Chiba Prefecture and overturned a car in the city of Ichihara as the storm's centre approached, while five people were hurt as the twister ripped through a house. Their injuries were not life-threatening, city official Tatsuya Sakamaki said.\n\nHagibis, which means \"speed\" in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 162 km/h, according to the meteorological agency. It was expected to make landfall near Tokyo later Saturday, unleashing up to 55 millimetres of rain before blowing out to sea.\n\nTaped-up windows and bags filled with water are seen here on Saturday at a convenience store in the Shinagawa district of Tokyo.

Firefighters said the two men were working at a river canal to try to control overflowing when they were swept away.\n\nSwollen rivers, mudslide warnings\n\nYusuke Ikegaya, a Shizuoka resident, was lucky and evacuated to safety. He said he was surprised because he had been told the typhoon would make landfall in the afternoon but noticed the nearby river about to overflow in the morning.\n\n\"In the 28 years of my life, this is the first time I've had to evacuate even before a typhoon has landed,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities also warned of mudslides, common in mountainous Japan.\n\nPublic broadcaster NHK said Shiroyama dam in Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, may release some of its waters, which were nearing limits. An overflooded dam is likely to cause greater damage, and so releasing some water gradually is a standard emergency measure.\n\nFlights, train services halted\n\nRugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events in the area were cancelled, while flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier in the week, including urging people to stay indoors.\n\nSome 17,000 police and military troops were called up, standing ready for rescue operations.\n\nResidents taped up their apartment windows in case they shattered. TV talks shows showed footage of household items like a slipper bashing through glass when hurled by winds.\n\nEvacuation advisories were issued for risk areas, including Shimoda city, west of Tokyo. Dozens of evacuation centres were opening in coastal towns, and people were resting on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed.\n\nA destroyed house and vehicle are seen following in Chiba, near Tokyo, on Saturday.

The Defence Ministry cut a three-day annual navy review to a single day on Monday.\n\nAll Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines grounded most domestic and international flights at the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya airports. Central Japan Railway Co. cancelled bullet-train service between Tokyo and Osaka except for several early Saturday trains connecting Nagoya and Osaka. Tokyo Disneyland was closed. Ginza department stores and smaller shops throughout Tokyo were shuttered.\n\nA typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.", "description": "A heavy downpour and strong winds pounded Tokyo and surrounding areas on Saturday as a powerful typhoon forecast as the worst in six decades made landfall southwest of the city.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319343.1570873704!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1175363343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
