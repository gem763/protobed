He might enjoy it, too.'\n\nBuffon has spoken recently about his desire to win the Champions League to cap off a trophy-laden career for both club and country, and his relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n'I must say, Cristiano is really a nice guy to be around,' said Buffon.\n\n'We spend a long time discussing and preparing things, he interacts with his teammates. He has been a pleasant surprise.\n\n'After that overhead kick he scored against us for Real Madrid, I asked him how old he was. He smiled and said: 'I'm 33.
