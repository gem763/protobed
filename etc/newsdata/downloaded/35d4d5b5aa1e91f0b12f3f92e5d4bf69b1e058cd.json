I would love to have not spent the last 13 days on the streets, but we have no choice. We\u2019re trapped.\u201d\n\nFive Extinction Rebellion protesters were due to appear in court on Friday in connection with disruption to the transport network during the Thursday morning rush-hour.\n\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) said Mark Ovland, 36, from Keinton Mandeville in Somerset, was charged with breaching his bail conditions when he allegedly disrupted a Jubilee line train at Canning Town station in east London at about 6.45am.\n\nOvland is due to appear before magistrates at Highbury Corner later. He was arrested alongside another man, a 35-year-old from Filton in South Gloucestershire, who was arrested on suspicion of obstructing the railway. The unnamed man has been released on bail.\n\nFour other people will appear at the same court charged in connection with an incident at Shadwell station, east London, on the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nThe BTP said they were Margreit Bos, 32, of Chartham in Kent; Martin Newell, 52, of Sparkhill in Birmingham; Philip Kingston, 83, of Patchway in Bristol; and Sue Parfitt, 77, of Henbury in Bristol.\n\nTwo other men, aged 32 and from Lewisham and Kingston upon Hull, were arrested at Stratford station on suspicion of obstructing the railway, BTP said. They have been released on bail.", "description": "Activists lock themselves to wooden pyramid structure at centre of busy junction", "authors": ["Damien Gayle", "Richard Vize"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33b2612016a9b9ac24b58e95ca290464896bdb65/0_0_6096_3658/master/6096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c8f7a6f144bef581877195b39511246", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
