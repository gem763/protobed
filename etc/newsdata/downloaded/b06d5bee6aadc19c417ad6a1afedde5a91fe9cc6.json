They also could have picked the New Otani in the heart of the city.\n\nInstead, Jones decided on an out-of-town option, next to Disneyland, facing Tokyo Bay.\n\nThe theme park surroundings are at odds with the build-up to a serious sporting contest, but teams who have used the base earlier in the tournament have been impressed by the nearby training facilities.\n\nEngland had second choice and selected the resort situated near the popular tourist spot\n\nThere are bad omens though. South Africa and Ireland both stayed at the same hotel before losing to the All Blacks - in a pool opener and a quarter-final respectively.\n\nAlso, it is a location far from Yokohama Stadium, where Saturday's semi-final will take place - the same distance, 40km, as it is from Tokyo Stadium.\n\nThe Irish management were concerned about a 90-minute journey time, so Johnny Sexton was the only one of their players who went to the latter arena for the 'captain's run' training session before their encounter with New Zealand.\n\nHowever, Jones likes to base his team in luxurious, remote surroundings, far from busy centres, wherever possible.\n\nHe is mindful of potential distractions during such a momentous week, saying: 'You've got to do more media, there's more attention; there are more fans around. For the players to get from A to B, it takes 10 minutes rather than five minutes. You've got to be able to cope with that and find ways to get to your best.'", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: England are on a Mickey Mouse route to the World Cup Final - as Eddie Jones has decided to take his squad to Disneyland this week, ahead of their clash with the All Blacks.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/23/20010188-0-image-a-14_1571695486335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
