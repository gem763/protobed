The tab is removed for the sake of more privacy as well as simplicity, according to Vishal Shah, Instagram's head of product.", "description": "Instagram's new \"dark mode\" feature is following in the footsteps of other apps that have recently introduced an eye-friendly option.", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c701f4b650746640fd088?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
