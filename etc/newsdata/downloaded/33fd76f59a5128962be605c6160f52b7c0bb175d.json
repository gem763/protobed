Even more concerning still, we are calling out what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories,\" the letter reads.\n\nIt goes on to state, \"As women Members of Parliament from all backgrounds, we stand with you in saying it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.\"\n\nThe 72 MPs, which represent one-third of the 208 women in the House of Commons, called on the national media to respect an individual's right to privacy.\n\nPrince Harry has been vocal about his concerns around media attention. In an Oct. 1 statement, he compared Meghan's treatment by the press that of his late mother, Princess Diana.\n\nIn 1997, the Princess of Wales died in a car crash, as the paparazzi pursued her vehicle. The \u201cPeople's Princess\u201d became fodder for tabloids and newspapers before her death, leading her brother, Earl Charles Spencer, to state in a eulogy for his late sister, that she was the \"most hunted person of the modern age.\"\n\nPrince Harry has said he\u2019s fearful he\u2019s seeing similar patterns repeat.\n\n\u201cMy wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences \u2014 a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,\u201d Prince Harry wrote in the statement.\n\nHe added: \u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one. Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the couple's royal tour, in which Meghan and Prince Harry visited South Africa, with their five-month-old son, Archie, news broke that Meghan had \"initiated legal proceedings\" against the Mail on Sunday and its parent company for publishing her letter to her father. Days later, it was revealed that Prince Harry took legal action against The Sun and The Daily Mirror for allegedly hacking his voicemail messages.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\"We are calling out what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories,\" the letter reads.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B89Tx1up.QSOVscnETTwyw--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f11c9370-f710-11e9-93ef-458317755284", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
