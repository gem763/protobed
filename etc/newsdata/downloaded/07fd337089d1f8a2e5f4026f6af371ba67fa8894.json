Kevin Lloyd of the North Davis Fire District, right, let a little girl paint their nails purple after a terrifying car accident\n\nNo one was seriously hurt but Braelyn, 2, was crying and trembling after the crash\n\nThe rescuers noticed that Braelyn was holding a small bottle of nail polish and began asking her about it, in order to try and take her mind of what had just happened.\n\nThe duo decided to let the little girl give them her version of a manicure.\n\n'Within minutes, the child was calmly painting their nails and had forgotten about the accident she had just experienced,' the fire district said in a Facebook posting.\n\n'Great job Chief Hadley and Captain Lloyd for providing awesome customer service to one of our young citizens.'\n\nUpon noticing two bottles of purple nail polish clutched in her hands, the rescuers asked her if she would give them a manicure which she duly obliged\n\n'When I walked up, she was screaming really really loud,' Captain Lloyd, right, said about the toddler. He said that he used the nail varnish bottles in an attempt to calm her down\n\n'She's never painted anyone's nails before, and now she asks me all the time since Friday,' dad Brandyn Fernelius said to Fox 13.\n\nThe dad explained how his daughter was looking forward to heading to her grandma's house to paint her own nails when the family car was rear-ended.\n\nPregnant Mom Jocelyn Fernelius was driving at the time of the mini van crash.\n\nJocelyn explained how the woman in the other vehicle managed to hit their car three more times from behind before finally stopping.\n\n'She's never painted anyone's nails before, and now she asks me all the time since Friday,' dad Brandyn Fernelius, left, said. Right, Braelyn is seen handing nail varnish her mom, Jocelyn\n\nPregnant Mom Jocelyn Fernelius was driving at the time of the mini van crash.\n\n'Braelyn's screaming, crying,' Jocelyn recalled. 'I'm freaking out, because I'm pregnant and because she's in the car.'\n\n'When I walked up, she was screaming really really loud,' Captain Lloyd said about the toddler.\n\nHe noticed that she was still holding onto bottles of nail polish at the time and so he began to ask her about them.\n\n'It was 'something common that I could use to help her,' Lloyd said. 'I don't know, I just opened them up,' he said.\n\nMoments later, Braelyn began painting his nails when his colleague Chief Hadley also joined in on the manicure session.\n\nThe firefighters have received a lot of praise online for their actions in comforting the little girl\n\nAlthough the crash was relatively minor, the minivan was rear-ended three times by a woman\n\n'A lot of the colors she wanted was pink and purple,' he said. 'But, I kind of got feeling that she wanted to keep my hand pink, and his purple.'\n\n'Thank you for your service and calming down this precious innocent child,' wrote one user in response to the department's Facebook post. 'The best first responders in the business' added another.\n\nAnother joked: 'Bat. Chief Hadley and Capt. Lloyd, you should wear that color more often. It makes your uniforms look even better! Superstars in uniform and some extra pizzazz!'\n\nNorth Davis Fire Chief Mark Becraft also commended the pair. 'Kudos to these great guys that serve our community \u2014 it's just the little things that make a huge difference,' he wrote.", "description": "Two Utah firefighters went above and beyond the call of duty when they let a traumatized little girl paint their nails purple to comfort her in the wake of a terrifying car accident.", "authors": ["James Gordon For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19762206-0-image-a-4_1571179207644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
