But Piper Jaffray allayed fears, saying it expects the company will continue to capture a significant portion of traditional content dollars, as those dollars migrate to streaming.\n\nNetflix rose 2.27% on the day (as of 1:20 p.m. ET) and is up more than 10% for the year so far. However, the shares are still nearly 24% below their 52-week high, a function of shedding more than a fifth of its gains after posting disappointing second results. The issue was meager subscriber additions that came in well below analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nBut Piper believes subscriber growth will rebound in the third quarter, driven by an improved content slate in the second half of the year, forecasting third-quarter domestic subscription growth around 6.4% year over year and international growth in a range of 33% to 35%.\n\n\"There should be a positive impact from an improving slate and we are, therefore, optimistic about the company\u2019s opportunity to grow subscriber additions year on year on a full-year basis,\u201d Piper said.\n\nApple sent streaming companies like Netflix and Roku (NASDAQ: ) tumbling earlier this week, when it revealed that its streaming service, AppleTV+, would go live on Nov. 1 at a lower price than Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney+ streaming services.", "description": "StockBeat: Netflix Climbs on Piper Jaffray Backing Despite Competition", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1R0IB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
