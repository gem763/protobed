The EU has its own veto on a deal: the European parliament must approve it, and the initial reaction of MEPs was hostile. Dublin reacted more strongly than the European Commission, and there is no sign of the EU abandoning the Irish government.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Perhaps. But there was a logic to doing it in the way Johnson did. The EU, its fingers burnt by May, has been reluctant to make concessions until it is confident a deal would secure a Commons majority. If Johnson can show there is what Michael Gove hailed as a \u201cpretty solid majority\u201d, it puts pressure on Brussels.\n\nThe question now is whether the EU rejects the UK plan or enters formal negotiations. London is ramping up the pressure, hinting that talks must start this weekend and even threatening that Johnson might not attend the crunch EU summit on 17 & 18 October.\n\nIf serious negotiations take place, Johnson would have to give ground. There are signs he would. He has dropped the Downing Street spin that this is his \u201cfinal offer\u201d. One Whitehall source admitted: \u201cThere is scope for some movement on our side.\u201d\n\nOne option would be to ditch Johnson\u2019s customs plan in return for a time limit to the hated Irish backstop. But keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs zone would almost certainly be a U-turn too far for Johnson. It could cost him the support of the DUP and the European Research Group (ERG) for his proposed deal. So Johnson might then have an agreement acceptable to Brussels but not parliament. Catch-22 again.\n\nHe cannot make concessions without keeping the DUP onside, since many Tory MPs take their cue from Arlene Foster\u2019s party. The ERG\u2019s hints of support after meeting Johnson last night are significant. Some ERG figures have previously claimed 60 Tories would oppose a deal based on May\u2019s agreement even if the Irish backstop were removed, as it would be under Johnson\u2019s plan.\n\nThe penny has finally dropped for the hardline Eurosceptics: this might be their last chance of securing Brexit without the gamble of a general election. Johnson could also rely on most of the 21 Tories who lost the whip for rebelling against no deal. He might need a handful of backbench Labour votes, but that is likely.\n\nBut, for now, it looks like there won\u2019t be a deal to put to a Commons vote.\n\nWhat happens then? The Benn Act, forcing Johnson to seek an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership to prevent no deal on 31 October, kicks in on 19 October. Despite suggestions from ministers that Johnson has a secret plan to get round the act, they appear not to know what it is when quizzed in media interviews. It may be that the secret plan is that there is no secret plan; Downing Street wants MPs and the EU to think one exists, so they both sign up to an agreement to avoid no deal. But Brussels is cleverer than some Johnson allies think. It knows the Benn Act takes some of the pressure off the EU to strike an agreement. It might decide to wait and see what happens in an election during the three-month extension envisaged in the act.\n\nIf there is a secret plan, it is probably that Johnson sits on his hands on 19 October in the knowledge he would be taken to court. The government would lose, then grudgingly obey the law and request the extension the prime minister said he would never seek. In a general election, Johnson would in effect be asking for a mandate for no deal. That might allow him to squeeze the Brexit Party vote, as he knows he needs to do.\n\nThe critical question would be whether Leave voters punished Johnson for the extension. The bad news for his opponents is that his allies are increasingly confident he would be able to deflect the blame to parliament, the EU and the judges. Jeremy Corbyn should think about that before he approves an election.", "description": "First, the good news for Boris Johnson. His long-awaited Brexit plan would probably be approved by the Commons.
