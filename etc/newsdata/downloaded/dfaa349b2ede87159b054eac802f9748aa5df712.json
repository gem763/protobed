If Democrats can appeal to those who are unsure, they stand a good chance of driving up public favor.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPopular support for a House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump may be rising, even among swing voters. A new Insider poll found that swing voters aren't sure whether or not they support impeachment \u2014 but considerably more favor it than those who don't.\n\nFollowing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump on Tuesday, Insider polled over 1,000 adults nationwide on their feelings about impeachment and their 2020 voting preferences.\n\nRespondents were asked \"Who do you think you will vote for in the 2020 general election?\" with options that included \"Probably the Democratic nominee,\" \"Probably the Republican nominee,\" \"Neither / I don't intend to vote\" and \"I'm not sure at this time.\" For the purposes of this analysis, those who selected that last option were categorized as \"swing voters.\"\n\nWhen asked, \"Impeachment is the first step in the process of removing a president from office. Do you think the House of Representatives should impeach President Trump?\" a large number of swing voters responded with uncertainty:\n\n33.5% said they \"support\" or \"strongly support\" impeachment.\n\n23.8% said they \"oppose\" or \"strongly oppose\" impeachment.\n\n42.6% said they either \"don't know\" or \"neither support nor oppose\" impeachment.\n\nAn investigation of Trump is favored by a substantial minority\n\nLike Americans on the whole, swing voters are less shy about weighing in on an impeachment inquiry \u2014 an investigation that is typically the harbinger of official charges, or articles of impeachment, being imposed on the president.\n\nWhen asked, \"Do you believe launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump for soliciting foreign interference in a US election is the right thing to do?\" a lot of swing voters said they support an inquiry:\n\n44.3% said \"yes\" or \"definitely yes.\"\n\n29% said \"probably not\" or \"definitely not.\"\n\n26.7% said \"I don't know.\"\n\nDemocrats are well-poised to drum up public support for impeachment\n\nDespite the sizable amount of uncertainty among swing voters, results showed significantly more support for beginning an impeachment than opposition. Undecided voters backed impeachment by 10 percentage points more than they opposed it, and backed an impeachment inquiry by 15 points more than they opposed it \u2014 no slim margins.\n\nPart of the uncertainty likely owes to a lack of knowledge on the matter. Only a third of those polled overall reported that they were familiar with the situation, involving a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, that led to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nStill, the numbers suggest that Democrats have an advantage in public opinion. If they can allay apprehension among the undecided, the scales will tip more strongly to their side.\n\nRead more:\n\nPOLL: Americans support the impeachment inquiry into Trump, but they worry about electoral blowback\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Democrats think the House should impeach Trump.
