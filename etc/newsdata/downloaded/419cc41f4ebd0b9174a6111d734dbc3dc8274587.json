CLARY/Getty Images\n\nBelinda Bencic pulled off one of the biggest upsets at the 2019 U.S. Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win over top-seeded Naomi Osaka on Monday.\n\nThe No. 13 seed earned three breaks over two sets to secure a spot in the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam for just the second time in her career.\n\nOsaka and Novak Djokovic were each No. 1 seeds in their respective draws and defending champions at the U.S. Open, but each player was eliminated in Round 4 within a span of 24 hours.\n\nOsaka had been dominant coming into Monday's match. She had straight-set victories in her past two matches and dropped a combined nine games in total.\n\nHowever, Bencic has had continued success against the current No. 1 player in the world:\n\nIn four career head-to-head matches, Osaka's only win came in 2013, when both players were teenagers on the ITF tour.\n\nBencic was especially impressive Monday at finishing long rallies with winners:\n\nShe ended with 29 winners and only 12 unforced errors, and she won all 10 of her net points.\n\nBencic also dominated on first serves (28-of-34) and faced only one break point the entire match.\n\nShe will try to keep her U.S. Open run going in the quarterfinals against Donna Vekic, who defeated Julia Goerges in three sets Monday.", "description": "Belinda  Bencic  pulled off one of the biggest upsets at the 2019 U.S. Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win over top-seeded  Naomi Osaka  on Monday.
