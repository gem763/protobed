They accused Franco and two other men associated with his production company and school of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, fraud and other wrongdoing.\n\nFranco and his colleagues were \u201cdangling the opportunity to aspiring actors of employment in film and television,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\n\u201cFranco\u2019s targets were even duped to pay for their exploitation through a fraudulent \u2018acting school\u2019 (Studio 4) designed to benefit Franco and his production companies wherein employment opportunities for women supposedly increased when they agreed to overt sexual acts, nudity and performing in sex scenes - often in an orgy type setting,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nStudents were encouraged to pay $750 to join a sex scenes master class at the school and had to audition nude or partially nude, the lawsuit said.\n\nAfter completing the class, Tither-Kaplan was offered a role in a project in which Franco appeared in an orgy scene with women. He removed plastic guards covering actresses\u2019 vaginas while simulating oral sex, the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of other women who attended the school, and seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Director and star James Franco arrives for the gala presentation of \"The Disaster Artist\" at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 12, 2017.

He was asked on the show to comment on accusations made against him on social media.\n\nThe lawsuit, cited his comment, \u201cIf I have done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.\u201d The lawsuit said that Franco and others had \u201ccommitted egregious wrongs\u201d to student actors and had \u201cdone nothing to fix these wrongs.\u201d\n\nFranco\u2019s best-known films include \u201c127 hours,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cThe Disaster Artist.\u201d At the Golden Globes ceremony on Jan. 7, 2018, Franco wore a Time\u2019s Up movement pin supporting victims of sexual harassment.", "description": "Two women filed a civil lawsuit against Hollywood actor James Franco on Thursday, accusing him of running a bogus film school where young women eager to advance their acting careers were duped into auditioning nude or shooting explicit sex scenes.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436872968&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF93054", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
