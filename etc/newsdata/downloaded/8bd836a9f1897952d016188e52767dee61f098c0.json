Morey tweeted and deleted a logo with the phrase, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe expression of support angered Chinese sponsors of the NBA, some of whom pulled their sponsorships. The NBA then released an apologetic statement distancing itself from Morey\u2019s tweet, a move that sparked a wave of criticism in the U.S. from prominent politicians and media figures.\n\nPence also took aim at Nike, saying the footwear company\u2019s removal of Houston Rockets merchandise from Chinese stores in the wake of the controversy shows that the company, which \u201cpromotes itself as a so-called social justice champion\u201d in this case \u201cprefers checking its social conscience at the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cFar too many American multi-national corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China\u2019s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party but even affirmative expressions of American values,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence\u2019s remarks come as the Trump administration continues to hope for a trade agreement with the world\u2019s second-largest economy. President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in Chile at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in hopes of agreeing on \u201cphase one\u201d of a trade deal.\n\nThe vice president accused China of moving to \u201ccurtail the rights and liberties\u201d of the people of Hong Kong and warned that any violence by China against Hong Kong would harm Beijing\u2019s chances of getting a trade deal with the U.S.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has made it clear from early on that there must be a peaceful resolution that respects the rights of the people of Hong Kong,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence also criticized the Chinese Communist Party for the government\u2019s handling of other issues, including suppressing the freedom of religion of the Chinese people, namely Uighur Muslims.", "description": "\"Lately, China has also been trying to export censorship, the hallmark of its regime,\"\u00a0the vice president said in remarks at The Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
