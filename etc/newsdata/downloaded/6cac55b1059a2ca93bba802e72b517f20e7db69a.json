No further printed or electronic versions will be provided.\n\nThose are the rules under which Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the committee chair, is proceeding, according to Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal, who interviewed committee member Rep. Elaine Stefanik (R-NY):\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik was informed this week by Republican House Intelligence Committee staffers of a new diktat from Chairman Adam Schiff. It made the New York Republican\u2019s jaw drop. Democrats had informed Republicans that, from here on out, the committee would produce a single, printed transcript of every interview it conducted as part of its impeachment inquiry. Only members of the three committees involved in the purported inquiry would be allowed to view that printout, and only in the presence of a Democratic staffer. Ms. Stefanik\u2014an elected member of Congress who sits on the Intelligence Committee\u2014will be babysat while reading by an unelected employee of the Democrats. \u2026 Conservative commentators keep noting that Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s refusal to hold a vote on the House floor to authorize an official impeachment inquiry helps her caucus\u2019s vulnerable members evade accountability. But there\u2019s a more practical and uglier reason for Democrats to skip the formalities. Normally an authorization vote would be followed by official rules on how the inquiry would proceed. Under today\u2019s process, Mr. Schiff gets to make up the rules as he goes along. Behold the Lord High Impeacher.\n\nRead Strassel\u2019s full article at the Journal.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, a Republican resolution in the Senate disapproving of the House impeachment process had reached 50 co-sponsors (out of 53 GOP members).\n\nJoel B.
