I think he\u2019s going to get tired in the first round trying to deal with me and I think I\u2019ll just pick him apart and I\u2019ll probably land something big again, a kick or a knee or something. I think I\u2019m going to finish him, though. It\u2019s kill or be killed. This fight ain\u2019t going the distance.\u201d\n\nKrause (26-7 MMA, 7-3 UFC), who\u2019s in Boston this week to corner Sean Woodson at Friday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 event, has invested a lot of time in coaching. His Missouri gym, Glory MMA, is home to fighters like Megan Anderson, Zak Cummings and Tim Elliott.\n\nKrause even is prepared to admit that he probably prefers coaching over fighting.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s far more fulfilling to help somebody else accomplish their dreams,\u201d Krause said. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this for like 13 years now, so I definitely enjoy it more than I do fighting. I\u2019m probably better at it, too. I think it\u2019s a good segue for whenever I decide to retire. It\u2019ll be a good segue for me to go right into.\u201d\n\nIn his most recent outing, Krause took out Warlley Alves, who actually just knocked Krause\u2019s next opponent, Moraes. It\u2019s been more than a year since Krause last competed, but he\u2019s not too concerned about any potential ring rust.\n\nHe\u2019s just not that interested in taking numerous fights a year at this point of his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had 60 fights, pro and amateur \u2013 I know what a fight looks like,\u201d Krause said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in ring rust. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real thing, especially with my style. I think if you have the style of just going out and getting after people, high volume \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real thing.\u201d\n\nThe fight may appear to be peculiar matchmaking on paper since Krause has won five straight and Moraes has lost two in a row. But Krause isn\u2019t underestimating his opponent.\n\nHe does expect it to be a rough night for Moraes, though.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always game, he\u2019s always scrappy,\u201d Krause said. \u201c(He has) probably some of the best jiu-jitsu in the UFC if he gets on top of you. I definitely respect him as an opponent, but I also think I\u2019m a very difficult fight for him.\u201d", "description": "James Krause is confident that he will finish Sergio Moraes at UFC Sao Paulo.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/james-krause-ufc-fight-night-135-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
