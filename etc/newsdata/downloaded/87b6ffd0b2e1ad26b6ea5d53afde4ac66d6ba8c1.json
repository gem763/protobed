You are a goose whose sole objective is to annoy a group of villagers.\n\nYou can honk to scare the wits out of an unsuspecting couple or steal and hide tools from someone trying to garden.\n\nThe list of possible shenanigans goes on.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re being annoying, you\u2019re playing to win.\n\nAnd with a game this absurd, it\u2019s only natural that the internet is blowing up with #honk-inspired memes.\n\nOne Twitter user suggests that for a villain as big as a goose, the only logical next step after the village is the Marvel Universe.\n\nBells are just one of many objects you can take in the game, and another user took that idea straight to Taco Bell.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, some are having trouble explaining the absurd game to others.\n\nAnd some memes are just as absurd as the game itself.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just memes. Some desktop users have even been inspired to goosify their keyboards.\n\nsorry but i couldn't resist making a goose keycap as annoying and obnoxious as the goose in the game\n\n#untitledgoosegame pic.twitter.com/GbSkFoJd6i \u2014 tiny ~ SPOOKeycap maker \ufffd\ufffd (@tinymakesthings) October 2, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re just glad that so many people finally have an outlet for their inner goose.\n\nKeep on #honking on.", "description": "New \u201cUntitled Goose Game\u201d is a top seller on Nintendo Switch and spawning all kinds of memes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/GooseGame.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
