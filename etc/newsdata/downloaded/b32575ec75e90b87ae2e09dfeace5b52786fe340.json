USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany -- Simone Biles is the ultimate security blanket.\n\nThe U.S. women kept their golden streak intact with a fifth consecutive title at the world championships Tuesday, and it\u2019s largely thanks to Biles\u2019 composure. Well, that and her jaw-dropping talent, which was on full display as she brought down the house with her final floor routine.\n\nBut it was Biles who settled the Americans while one team after another saw its medals hopes disappear in a cloud of chalk dust. When Grace McCallum botched a skill on uneven bars, swinging wildly to keep herself from falling off, and when Sunisa Lee tumbled off balance beam, Biles was there in the next routine to pick them up.\n\n\u201cTo have somebody with that level of experience,\u201d national team coordinator Tom Forster said, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely reassuring.\u201d\n\nSimone Biles of the U.S. performs on the balance beam during women's team final at the Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, (Photo: Matthias Schrader, AP)\n\nThe U.S. women have won every world and Olympic title since 2011, a run of dominance rarely seen in a sport where being even a millimeter off can leave you sprawling on the floor, your medal hopes next to you. And it\u2019s not been close.\n\nIn the \u201cSimone Era,\u201d which began with the 2013 world championships, the Americans have won every title by five points or better. Their score of 172.330 points Tuesday was nearly six points ahead of Russia. See the score from the 49ers beatdown of the Cleveland Browns? Yeah. It's like that.\n\nBiles is a big factor in that, obviously. The greatest gymnast of her and every other generation, she does skills nobody else even dares try, and does them better. She alone accounted for 2\u00bd points of the Americans\u2019 winning margin, posting the highest scores on vault, balance beam and floor exercise.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than Biles\u2019 gymnastics.\n\nThe U.S. women rarely make major errors \u2013 this is believed to be the first time since 2010 they\u2019ve had to count a fall in team finals. But they have the security of knowing that, even if they do, Biles will be there to bail them out. The mistakes won\u2019t snowball, as they did with, say, China.\n\nThe Chinese, second in qualifying, knew they had to score big on uneven bars and balance beam to have any chance of catching the Americans. But Chen Yile struggled through her bar routine, and team captain Liu Tingting fell not once, but twice.\n\nOn beam, the next event, Liu fell again and went over the time limit. By the time that rotation was over, so were their medal hopes.\n\nScenarios like that played out all over the floor, as teams crumbled at the thought of winning a medal or just under the general pressure.\n\n\u201cThey saw that after qualifications they did very good and some teams felt they could get the medal. I think they put too much pressure on themselves,\u201d said Laurent Landi, Biles\u2019 coach.\n\nNow contrast that with the Americans.\n\nTheir scores on vault, their first event, were good enough to secure them the title. But with three rotations still to go, you can\u2019t bank on that.\n\nSure enough, McCallum, first up on uneven bars, stalled on a handstand after a pirouette. Then, on beam, Lee had a big wobble and then the fall.\n\nBut instead of getting carried away by the errors, the Americans let Biles carry them. Up next after both McCallum and Lee, Biles delivered what are probably her best routines of the entire summer on both uneven bars and balance beam.\n\n\u201cSimone knows herself. She knows how to calm herself down and to perform under a lot of pressure -- and after some of the little ones have made mistakes here and there,\u201d Landi said.\n\nAdded alternate MyKayla Skinner, \u201cShe\u2019s incredible, and she\u2019s always, always there to count on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Biles doesn\u2019t feel the same pressure as everyone else. She does.\n\nBut she\u2019s learned how to block it out and deliver.\n\nFor all of Biles\u2019 medals \u2013 this latest gold was her 21st at world championships, a record for a female gymnast \u2013 it\u2019s the team ones she cherishes. So when the U.S. needs her most, she is at her best.\n\n\u201cWe all put in a team effort for this medal,\u201d she said, \u201cso it's really special.\u201d\n\nBiles closed the Americans\u2019 night with a jaw-dropping performance on floor. Her triple-twisting, double somersault pass \u2013 now known as the Biles II \u2013 was breathtaking. She soared so high, she probably could have dusted off one of the lights. Not only did she stay in bounds on the landing, she stuck it, barely moving a muscle.\n\nBy the end of the routine, she was grinning and her teammates were jumping up and down, secure in the knowledge they were golden yet again.\n\n\u201cThe other day we walked out there, and I was like, `I literally hate this feeling. I don't know why I keep forcing myself to do it. I hate that feeling like I'm gonna puke,\u2019\u201d Biles said. \u201cWe love the thrill of it, so it reminds me to never give up. Because one day, I won't have the opportunity to get that feeling.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "US women win fifth consecutive team title, giving Simone Biles a record 21st medal at world championships.
