But has he delivered? The national debt is now skyrocketing to levels not seen since World War II and the trade war with China has experts fearing a global recession.\n\n\"Trump makes grandiose promises,\" Moore told Hasan. \"He exaggerates and sometimes I wish he wouldn\u2019t do that. But if you compare where the economy is today versus where it was when he entered office, it\u2019s substantially stronger.\"\n\nDonald Trump would be better off to stop talking so much and let his record speak for itself. Stephen Moore\n\nMoore, a conservative commentator and economist at the Heritage Foundation, is also an adviser to the Trump 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nHe told Hasan he helped write immigration legislation, referring to a bill supported by President Trump and introduced by Republican senators. Moore, however, said he does not agree with some of the government\u2019s positions on immigration.\n\nWhen challenged on policies limiting legal immigration and the dire situation in migrant detention centres at the US-Mexico border, Moore said conditions in every centre he visited had been humane.\n\n\"But I do believe that until we get the border secure and we get that wall built, once we do that, we can increase our legal immigration.\"\n\nWhen pressed further on the numerous false statements Trump has made, like needing an ID to buy a box of cereal and suggesting that wind turbines cause cancer, Moore said, \"Donald Trump would be better off to stop talking so much and let his record speak for itself\".\n\n\"What I'm saying is, what Americans care about is his performance, his results, not what he says and how he acts,\" he added.\n\nThis is the first Head to Head episode with an audience recorded in the United States and marks the beginning of a new series. It takes place in front of an audience at the George Washington University in Washington DC.\n\nWe are joined by a panel of three experts:\n\nTiffany Cross - liberal commentator, co-founder and managing editor of the US news outlet, The Beat DC\n\nRick Wilson - former political strategist for the Republican Party, conservative critic of President Trump, and author of Everything Trump Touches Dies\n\nJenna Ellis Rives - constitutional lawyer, member of the Trump 2020 Advisory Board, and author of The Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution\n\nThis episode will be broadcast on October 4 at 20:00 GMT and will be repeated on October 5 at 12:00 GMT, October 6 at 01:00 GMT, and October 7 at 06:00 GMT.\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter @AJHeadtoHead.
