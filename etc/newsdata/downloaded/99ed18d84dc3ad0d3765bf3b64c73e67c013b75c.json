BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe next time a woman, and especially a woman of color \u2014 because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart \u2014 tells you what she needs in order to do her job \u2014 listen to her,\u201d Fosse/Verdon star Michelle Williams said as she accepted her 2019 Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. It was a rousing statement that received boisterous applause from the audience at L.A.\u2019s Microsoft Theater, where the 71st Emmys were held, and immediate social media support. InStyle, the Lean In organization, and Refinery29\u2019s own Instagram all shared the speech, whether it was as a video or memeable text post.\n\nWilliams\u2019 words put a fine point on a night that proved women\u2019s stories aren\u2019t just necessary \u2014 they\u2019re exceptional. It\u2019s unfortunate that the limelight didn\u2019t hit every woman. When you zoom out on the evening, you realize women of color have still been left out in the Emmy cold.\n\nThree series left the Emmys as the heirs apparent to the next decade of television, particularly since the event stood as Game of Thrones\u2019 farewell party. When the biggest show on TV ends, something needs to step into that vacuum. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Killing Eve, and Fleabag demonstrated they were up to the task. Maisel won both supporting actor races in the comedy genre after dominating the Emmys last year with eight wins. Killing Eve\u2019s leading lady Jodie Comer beat out Game of Thrones queen Emilia Clarke \u2014 the presumed winner after the most gutting villainous turn of the TV decade \u2014 in the tense Outstanding Actress in a Drama race. Fleabag was the biggest success story of the night, taking home Outstanding Comedy Series, Lead Actress, Writing, and Directing gold. Fleabag may be over, but its creator, Killing Eve mastermind Phoebe Waller-Bridge, has officially been crowned television\u2019s next visionary.\n\nThese three series follow noticeably similar central characters. Their settings and circumstances might be different, but their broad strokes are not. Each one is a white woman with a chaotic interior life \u2014 due to a shocking divorce, bloodthirsty assassin lifestyle, or tragic guilt \u2014 who is still wildly resilient despite all that mess. Even after the arrests or priest seductions or elaborate stabbings, you root for them.\n\nThis is a trio of potent reminders that women don\u2019t need to be perfect to be compelling. In fact, they\u2019re all so much more interesting when they\u2019re not pristine saints. After watching hard-boiled antiheroes power 21st century television \u2014 see: Don Draper (Jon Hamm), Walter White (2019 Emmy opener Bryan Cranston), every man in Deadwood, and every man on Game of Thrones \u2014 it has been refreshing to see women characters shed the restraints of the Likable Woman trope and entertain their darkest impulses. As someone who vocally loves all three of these shows, it\u2019s easy to celebrate their well-deserved victories.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s also necessary to consider who isn\u2019t taking home statues and posing in the winner\u2019s circles in their stead. Comer beat out co-star Sandra Oh, who plays Killing Eve\u2018s true complicated center as the titular Eve Polastri. Oh was the first Asian woman ever to be nominated in this category in the Emmy\u2019s 71-year history. Both the Outstanding Comedy race and Waller-Bridge\u2019s Lead Comedy Actress category were all-white competitions. When They See Us\u2019 Marsha Stephanie Blake was the only woman of color nominated in any supporting acting category across the board. Even Michelle Williams, who championed listening to women of color, took home the Limited Series Lead Actress trophy over two Black women: Niecy Nash and Aunjanue Ellis of When They See Us. Williams can\u2019t control Emmy voting, but she does benefit from the current state of it.\n\nWhen They See Us, which won just 2 Emmys out of 16 nominations, reminds it\u2019s not that stellar storytelling from women of color doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 it simply isn\u2019t what Emmy voters believe is award-worthy. The limited series\u2019 director, Oscar-winner Ava DuVernay, also lost her category, this time to a white man, Chernobyl helmer Johan Renck.\n\nWhile undeniable talents like DuVernay and Nash were at least nominated, so many other women of color were snubbed entirely. Although Insecure\u2019s stellar third season, which premiered in August 2018, may seem like eons ago, it was actually eligible for this Emmys cycle. It was solely nominated in the cinematography category, which it lost. That means Issa Rae could not find her way into the Lead Actress race, and her relentlessly funny supporting cast failed to get a single nod. Apparently, the fearsome power of HBO\u2019s award show net does know some bounds. In that same vein, Asian actor Maya Erskine received a writing nod for her Hulu series Pen15, but was never even a whisper in the Lead Actress race. Anyone who has seen Erskine\u2019s show can tell you she\u2019s giving the fearless taboo performance of a lifetime as her horny 13-year-old self.\n\nStory continues", "description": "\u201cThe next time a woman, and especially a woman of color \u2014 because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart \u2014 tells you what she needs in order to do her job \u2014 listen to her,\u201d Fosse/Verdon star Michelle Williams said as she accepted her 2019 Emmy for Outstanding", "authors": ["Ariana Romero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GnZLoPZT63l.3rBBKo.ctQ--~B/aD0xMDI0O3c9ODUzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/refinery_29_uk_109/763bb3b6a14e25a2001cf23ad4836651", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
