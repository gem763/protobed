He was so excited William had to tell him to calm down,\" tweeted one fan.\n\nAnother added: \"Prince William telling George to calm down might be the best thing I've ever witnessed.\"\n\nWills has been a Villa fan for years and is often spotted at their games, but it's the first time we've seen him take George and Charlotte along.\n\nExplaining his love for the club back in 2015 he said: \"A long time ago at school I got into football big time. I was looking around for clubs. All my friends at school were either Man United fans or Chelsea fans and I didn\u2019t want to follow the run of the mill teams.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI wanted to have a team that was more mid-table that could give me more emotional rollercoaster moments.\n\n\u201cAston Villa\u2019s always had a great history. I have got friends of mine who support Aston Villa and one of the first FA Cup games I went to was Bolton v Aston Villa back in 2000. Sadly, Villa went on to lose to Chelsea.\n\n\u201cIt was fantastic, I sat with all the fans with my red beanie on, and I was sat with all the Brummie fans and had a great time.\n\n\u201cIt was the atmosphere, the camaraderie and I really felt that there was something I could connect with.\u201d\n\nVilla's win on Saturday sees them climb to 14th in the table and leap-frog Norwich, who drop into the relegation places at their expense.", "description": "Kate Middleton and Prince William took their two oldest kids Prince George and Princess Charlotte to watch Aston Villa on Saturday, and it looks like the family had a great day", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469468.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Norwich-City-v-Aston-Villa-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
