They could still use more from Jimmy Garoppolo.", "language": "en", "text": "Two years later, the 49ers indeed are on a roll. They are the NFC\u2019s only unbeaten team, taking a record of 6-0 into Sunday\u2019s home game against the Carolina Panthers. They\u2019re coming off a satisfying victory at FedEx Field that allowed Shanahan to award a game ball to his father, Mike, and exact some family revenge against the Washington Redskins. And Lynch bolstered the roster Tuesday by trading for Denver Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it\u2019s not a straight line from the Garoppolo trade in October 2017 to today. The 49ers endured a miserable 2018 season without Garoppolo, who was lost to a knee injury after three games. And even now, they are not winning because of Garoppolo; his numbers are rather ordinary. The 49ers are winning because they\u2019re a deep and versatile team led by an overpowering defense.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a D-line like that and linebackers and our secondary that make plays, you have that out there, you definitely feel good,\u201d tight end George Kittle said after last Sunday\u2019s 9-0 triumph over the Redskins. \u201cThe best part is, they just get you fired up, no matter what. If we\u2019re losing or we\u2019re winning, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, our defense did this, and we\u2019ve got to give them some help.\u2019 And it\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers and Patriots are the NFL\u2019s only undefeated teams. If they meet in the Super Bowl, the story line will be Brady vs. Garoppolo, his former understudy. But both teams are trying to find their way on offense while their dominant defenses do the heavy lifting. The 49ers are first in the league in pass defense and second, behind the Patriots, in total defense and scoring defense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGuys are just owning their jobs,\u201d defensive tackle DeForest Buckner said. \u201cThey\u2019re not pointing any fingers when things go wrong. They come on the sideline and see what\u2019s going wrong. Everybody\u2019s seeing what we can do better to help the [defense], and we\u2019re just feeding off each other\u2019s energy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the 49ers are terrible on offense. Shanahan is considered one of the league\u2019s top offensive designers. The 49ers are second in the NFL in rushing offense, seventh in total offense and 11th in scoring. And Kittle is one of the league\u2019s top tight ends.\n\nBut it\u2019s also clear that if the 49ers are going to meet the now-raised expectations in a season suddenly full of possibilities, they\u2019ll need more from Garoppolo. He has six interceptions to go with seven touchdown passes, and he has an okay, but far from dazzling, passer rating of 90.8 that ranks 21st in the league.\n\nThat is not a sentiment that is voiced in the locker room, though: 49ers players express support for their quarterback. Cornerback Richard Sherman said Garoppolo made the plays that needed to be made, whether they were reflected in the stats or not, in rainy conditions against the Redskins. Kittle said Garoppolo is the team\u2019s leader.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe leadership that he carries and the voice that he has both on the sideline and in the huddle, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Kittle said. \u201cHe\u2019s what makes our team click. He\u2019s our leader. And to have someone like that who kind of carries the team, whether he\u2019s throwing for how many yards or rushing for how many yards, his voice takes us a long way.\u201d\n\nGaroppolo certainly was missed last season as the 49ers finished 4-12. That left them 10-22 over two seasons with Shanahan and Lynch in charge. With Garoppolo back, the pieces are in place. The trade for Sanders, who had 1,000-yard receiving seasons for the Broncos in 2014, 2015 and 2016, should help the passing game. The confidence and resolve don\u2019t require further boosting.\n\n\u201cWe have that focus,\u201d Kittle said. \u201cWe have that will, and we have that grit. And I love that about this team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the mood needs to be lightened, Kittle said, he will joke with Garoppolo to get the quarterback agitated, sometimes by pretending not to understand the play-call in the huddle.\n\n\u201cI just try to act dumb all the time to him so he has to repeat it,\u201d Kittle said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like: \u2018No, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m kidding. I actually got it.\u2019 Football is a lot easier when you\u2019re having fun. If it\u2019s too serious, I don\u2019t really like that.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers clearly are enjoying their success. Shanahan, the former Redskins assistant who was ousted when his father\u2019s head coaching tenure with the team came to an acrimonious end after the 2013 season, savored Sunday\u2019s win even though his dad wasn\u2019t in attendance. And 49ers players followed a game-ending sack by rookie defensive end Nick Bosa by celebrating with belly-flop slides across the soggy turf.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Sherman also said he trusts Kyle Shanahan and defensive coordinator Robert Saleh to keep the celebrations in check and remind players that there are bigger things to accomplish.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s looking ahead,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cNobody\u2019s like, \u2018Man, I can\u2019t wait to play such and such.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can\u2019t wait until we get here.\u2019 \u2026 I think guys have the right mentality on this team to just stay locked in, stay in the moment, stay in the present. Don\u2019t look too far ahead. Don\u2019t look too far back. Don\u2019t say, \u2018Man, it feels good to be like this,\u2019 because I think the moment you take an exhale and say, \u2018Ah, man, this feels good,\u2019 is when you get hit in the mouth and you take a step back. And I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s doing that.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Garoppolo has been mediocre, but San Francisco's dominant defense has the team in early contention for the NFC title.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gKGrmdoPn43mt0JTbKiQftnUYH8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TULBVWXTPUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
