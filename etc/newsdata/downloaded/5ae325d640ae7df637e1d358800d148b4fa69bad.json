Generally, Western liberalism is up against an enormous amount of opposition everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Murdoch cut ties with his father\u2019s company, turning down $2 billion following the Disney merger. His other brother Lachlan has since taken over as Chairman and CEO.\n\nHe has since donated to the presidential campaigns of Pete Buttigieg, saying it\u2019s \u201cclear to anyone who hears him speak that he has an extraordinary mind,\u201d and that the 2020 election is \u201ca really crucial moment\u201d for liberal ideals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
