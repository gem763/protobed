As he embarked on his journey, Sara Swaty, a young photographer and friend, set off to capture it, frame by frame, year after year. \"In my previous work, I had never had the opportunity to connect with anyone so deeply and document their transition from the very beginning,\" said Swaty, who first met Harrison as a teenager in high school.\n\nLeft: Harrison, aged 22. \"At my private school, I was the 'pretty girl' who 'fell in with the wrong crowd.'\"\n\nRight: Harrison, 22, poses for a photograph in 2012.\n\nTestosterone, a needle and alcohol swab that belong to Harrison. In a 2016 study published in the journal LGBT Health, 31 percent of transgender individuals surveyed said they experienced a moderate amount of rejection from their families and 14 percent said they experienced a high amount of rejection. A recent U.S. study found that roughly half of transgender male teens have attempted suicide at least once.\n\nHarrison, 28, and his father Robbin. \"My dad has always been my person, I fully believe I get my strangeness and my weirdness from him.\" \"Harrison's been my soulmate, my companion,\" said his father Robbin, a retired teacher in his sixties. \"He said he was transitioning and wanted to become a boy and I was fine with that.\" Harrison\u2019s mother Stephanie said it was really hard at first to process her son\u2019s decision to transition. \"It was like the death of that child.\"\n\nLeft: Harrison, 25, poses on his car. \"Growing up in Saint Louis shaped me as a human... It's truly my home.\"\n\nRight: Harrison, 25, poses for a photograph at his home in 2015.\n\nHarrison, 28, and Sandra embrace at their home in 2018. Harrison and his fianc\u00e9e Sandra Manzoni, 29, a fellow bartender and an air acrobatics performer who he met two years ago have recently bought a house in St. Louis. Harrison recounted how nervous he was when he first asked Manzoni out, telling a friend how he couldn't breathe around her. Now, a year after their engagement, \"I\u2019ve learned how to breathe with her in the house,\" Harrison said jokingly.\n\nHarrison, 26, talks with Mackenzie and Elle in Elle's apartment in 2015. Harrison's tight-knit group of friends were hardly surprised by his decision to transition. They were taking cues from things he would say or do and, in a way, they saw it coming. \"When he came out as trans, we sort of looked at each other and went 'Duh',\" said George Caputa, one of his closest friends who now lives in Germany. \"When you truly love and support one who is trans, their gender identity has little to do with what you love about them.\"\n\nLeft: George gives a testosterone shot to 22-year-old Harrison. \"George and I have been friends now for 12 years, I've never felt exposed in front of him\u2026 we're chosen family and always have been.\"\n\nRight: Harrison, 21, poses for a photograph while looking out the window in 2011.\n\nHarrison, 27, gives himself a testosterone shot in his bedroom in 2017. \"When I first started it was painful and scary because I've never liked needles or shots, but you just get used to it. It's everyday life now.\" But Harrison also has faced many challenges. \"When I first started transitioning I couldn't find a job for the life of me,\" he recalled. \"Anytime I tried to explain to an interviewer that my deadname (name prior to transition) wasn't the name I went by, they just got confused and wouldn\u2019t hire me.\u201d Eventually, Harrison found a home in craft bartending where he said he can express himself and finally be appreciated. Healthcare was also among his biggest concerns. With patchy coverage, getting access to testosterone at an affordable price was often hard and he ended up paying for much of it out of pocket. He says he had to shell out roughly $110 every month for seven years, more than $9,000 in total.\n\nHarrison, 27, serves a cocktail as he works at Planter's House in 2017. Lack of health insurance remains a big concern for Harrison, who runs a bar in St. Louis, and a big hurdle to his getting top surgery, a procedure that includes the surgical removal of breasts and chest reconstruction that can cost several thousand dollars. Encouraged by friends and eager to put an end to the physical pain caused by years of wearing a tight binder around his chest, Harrison recently started a \"GoFundMe.com\" page to raise enough money for his top surgery. \"I've always felt like surgery was always out of reach due to the price tag, which is why it's taken me 7 years to ask,\" he wrote on the web page. \"So this is my current journey, please help me feel better, not only about my pain, but my self esteem.\u201d\n\nHarrison, 27, and Sandra joke around in their backyard in 2017. So far, Harrison has raised $8,330 surpassing his goal of $8,000. Over these seven years, Harrison went from being the \"pretty girl\" in school to becoming his true self, growing a \"beautiful red beard\" and getting close to finally be able to swim in public. \"It\u2019s beyond luck, karma, blessed, whatever you believe in,\" he said. \"I honestly never thought I would get to this point in my life.\"", "description": "For Harrison Massie, transitioning from female to male was never about trading one gender for another.", "authors": ["Sara Swaty", "Maria Caspani"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ2V1Op0fvoQUUJu7Rkag9RHwpQfwRzZtgxpwddq4EKD_roeaj0EtG7QRb4Ltd2QNbIZO7OBDcCv3a5H5m_TBvttMBzMc1AXrjG02IpJ_QQZS", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
