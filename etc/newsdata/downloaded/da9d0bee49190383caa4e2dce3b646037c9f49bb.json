Sterling impresses effortlessly again\n\nIt was only the slightest of touches, followed by the smoothest of pirouettes, and yet Raheem Sterling had swept the entirety of Kosovo\u2019s midfield out to sea in one liquid motion. In truth, he shouldn\u2019t even have been lingering on the centre-circle. But, sensing the breakaway and the lack of link between defence and attack, he drifted back, shook off three defenders and sucked in two more before laying the ball off for Kane to drill a low shot through the keeper\u2019s legs.\n\nThat was just one act in a performance that drifted between the exceptional and seemingly effortless. There was the idle flick over the Kosovan right-back\u2019s head, the wriggling runs into the box which seemed to cast a longshore drift over the entire defence and leave empty shores of space behind. For much of this match, even with Jadon Sancho\u2019s own trickery on the other wing, Sterling was operating on a level the players around him could only marvel at and, the greatest testament to the past two years is that it\u2019s what we\u2019ve now come to greedily expect.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Keane sets tone for night of disastrous defending\n\nFor all Keane\u2019s traffic-red blushes, his early error was buried as little more than a muddy footnote by the end of this frantic match. Yet, the sheer absence of concentration within the first 30 seconds was as comical as it were complacent. To lay responsibility firmly at the leaden feet of Keane and his deftly weighted through ball to Kosovan striker Valon Berisha would be cruel. Instead, it was Ross Barkley\u2019s old-fashioned hospital pass that engendered the early panic and allowed Berisha to expel a 14-month goal drought.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In Sterling, Kane and Sancho/Rashford, Gareth Southgate boasts one of the most prolific and exciting front-threes in all of football. In defence, despite Harry Maguire\u2019s \u00a380m price-tag, there\u2019s an awkward and perpetual unsteadiness that refuses to fade. After Keane\u2019s early calamity, Maguire\u2019s inexcusably clumsy slide tackle gifted Kosovo the penalty from which they scored their third goal and, after Southgate spent the build-up to this match calling for focus, he must be wondering which forgotten well he\u2019s been shouting down.\n\n3. Sancho solidifies starting spot\n\nIt\u2019s the total lack of fear that is most striking about Jadon Sancho. Making just his third start for England, there is no over-urgency to impress that hinders his decision-making, no reluctance to run straight at defenders in a way that causes them to stumble over their own feet.\n\nHis two goals were headline-grabbing, the product of well-timed runs and Kosovo\u2019s own defensive shortcomings, but it was the sense of calm the 19-year-old exuded that is so impressive. With 14 goals in 37 Bundesliga appearances, there is no need to treat Sancho as a prospect in need of a feathered touch or steady integration.\n\nIn this traditional 4-3-3 set-up, playing as the right-winger so Sterling can flourish on his favoured left, he is one of England\u2019s standout players. That fact becomes clearer with every astute performance, and the case for Marcus Rashford\u2019s inclusion becomes all the more tricky to negotiate.\n\n4. Southgate\u2019s touchline dilemma\n\nFrom the moment Berisha scythed past Jordan Pickford, this match was played out with the composed grace of a bloody gung-ho ending to a Tarantino film. And, for the neutral, the eight goals were thrilling to watch, the defensive flaws enticing and bemusing, the endless freedom in attack the type of box-office football to leaveTV networks drooling.\n\nBut, on the touchline, Southgate must have been wondering what he could do to take hold of this maelstrom. With the score at 5-3, England were even sitting back, springing on the counter-attack against a Kosovo side who boast an admittedly understated No 120 world ranking.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to avoid England\u2019s lack of adaptability in such a scenario. There is no broad-shouldered defensive lynchpin to rely on when a bully is needed to break up the play and a palpable reluctance to switch out of the side's 4-3-3 formation. Against tonight\u2019s opponents, there was never any real threat that England would squander their lead, but it does beg the question over what answers Southgate has when England come up against a side every bit as talented and technical.\n\n5.Chilwell fails to strengthen case against Rose\n\nBen Chilwell returned to the starting eleven in the role he\u2019s supposed to occupy for a decade to come, but the defensive uncertainty seemed to spread to the Leicester left-back with viral strength. Faced by Florent Hadergjonaj, who is usually sheltered as a right-back for Huddersfield, Chilwell was often found guilty and seemed to lack the gloss of composure that\u2019s come to be so commonplace at club level.\n\nThat can perhaps be forgiven in a game that was decidedly helter-skelter, but with Danny Rose still more than readily vying for that role, on a night where defenders writhed in the mud, Chilwell came out far from unscathed.", "description": "1.
