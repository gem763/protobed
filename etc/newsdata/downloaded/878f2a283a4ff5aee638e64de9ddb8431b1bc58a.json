Her \u201cWill & Grace\u201d co-star Eric McCormack echoed the call, saying he wanted to be aware of who he no longer wants to work with.\n\nAmid backlash from both sides of the aisle who argued that the pair were unfairly targeting private individuals and promoting intolerance of different political views, Messing defended her plea earlier this week.\n\nNoting that political donations are public, she denied ever calling for a blacklist of Trump donors in Hollywood but argued that \u201cI as a consumer want to know where MY Money is going when I pay for entertainment\u201d and that Trump voters similarly are free to choose not to watch her show.\n\nTrump also seized on a separate tweet from Messing that sparked a firestorm this week, one in which she applauded a sign in front of an Alabama church suggesting black voters who supported the president had mental illnesses. Messing on Wednesday apologized, tweeting that she regrets \u201crecklessly\u201d sharing the sign.\n\nHer apology came as #RacistDebraMessing trended on Twitter. \"The use of the term \u2018mentally ill\u2019 was wrong & hurtful,\u201d she wrote of the church sign, though she doubled down on her criticism of incendiary rhetoric from Trump and his supporters. Trump on Thursday slammed the \u201cterrible things she said about blacks and mental illness.\u201d\n\nThe president also complained Wednesday that there was a double standard at play, invoking actress Roseanne Barr, a vocal supporter of the president who was fired from her eponymous sitcom reboot last year for making racist comments about a former Obama aide.\n\n\u201cIf Roseanne Barr said what she did, even being on a much higher rated show, she would have been thrown off television,\u201d Trump contended, noting Barr\u2019s firing and asking whether \u201cFake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue?\u201d\n\n", "description": "The president claimed Messing wanted to create a \"blacklist\" of Trump supporters.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/2f/4fffe57e48b3be18dda27464b958/190905-debra-messing-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
