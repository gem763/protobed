He reasoned that a nuclear fission bomb might create temperatures so extreme that it would cause the hydrogen atoms in the air and water to fuse together into helium, just like in our sun, generating a runaway reaction that would eventually engulf the globe, extinguishing all life and turning the Earth into a miniature star.\n\nWhen Teller informed some of his colleagues of this possibility, he was greeted with both skepticism and fear. Hans Bethe immediately dismissed the idea, but according to author Pearl Buck, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur Compton was so concerned that he told Robert Oppenheimer that if there were even the slightest chance of this \u201cultimate catastrophe\u201d playing out, all work on the bomb should stop.\n\nSo a study was commissioned to explore the matter in detail, and six months before the Trinity test, the very first detonation of nuclear device, Edward Teller and Emil Konopinski announced their findings in a report with the ominous title \u201cIgnition of the Atmosphere With Nuclear Bombs.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Pomeroy", "Realclearscience.Com Blog The_Fear_That_A_Nuclear_Bomb_Could_Ignite_The_Atmosphere.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
