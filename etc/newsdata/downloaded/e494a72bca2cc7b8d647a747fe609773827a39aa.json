Everywhere he tried to go he was on the banned list, he wasn\u2019t allowed.\n\n\"He was fat-shamed and guess what folks, he lost half his body weight in a year. Sometimes you need someone to go, 'Hey fatty, stop eating fatty food' and by the way I'm talking as much about myself when I say that as anyone else.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nSusanna still wasn't sure it worked, admitting: \"I don\u2019t like fat-shaming to tell someone to lose weight, I think it's tough love gone a bit too far.\"\n\nDibsy and the personal trainer who saved his life then appeared on the show and actually refuted Piers' claims - claiming the technique wasn't actually fat-shaming, and was just support.\n\nShowing off his weight loss, Dibsy added that if he had been fat-shamed he wouldn't have got through his journey with Susanna supporting his claims that he wasn't fat-shamed and that it didn't work.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe said: \"I don\u2019t think I was fat-shamed. I describe it as being supportive, fat-shaming is being called fat.\"\n\nSusanna agreed: \"There is a difference between supportive advice which you consented to and cooperated with, and fat-shaming in a deliberate attempt to make someone feel bad.\"\n\nPiers then slightly backtracked, admitting: \"You shouldn't\u2019t go around abusing people for being fat but I do think sometimes you do need a shock.\"\n\nDibsy is now hoping to drop down to 16 stone, while he's preparing for an operation to remove four stone of skin following his transformation.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "Darren McClintock, known as Dibsy, was banned by his town from all takeaways before losing 20 stone in weight - but insists it wasn't fat-shaming", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534886.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_081019GMB_5497JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
