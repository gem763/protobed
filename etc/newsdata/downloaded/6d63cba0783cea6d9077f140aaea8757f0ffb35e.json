Robert De Niro is pictured in a scene from the forthcoming movie\n\nOnly 23 films hold a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes - including Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and All About Eve.\n\nThe Irishman is set to be released in cinemas on November 1, and will hit Netflix on November 27 - the day before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe film cost a whopping $160 million to make, and runs for 3 hours and 29 minutes - a run time longer than The Godfather, Titanic and all of Lord of The Rings films.\n\nNot one of the 80 published reviews have been negative.\n\nThe Irishman is being hailed as Scorcese's magnum opus - a giant feat given his glittering 40-year career\n\nThe Irishman has attained a higher Rotten Tomatoes rating than Taxi Driver (pictured)\n\n1990's Goodfellas (pictured) is one of Scorcese's most beloved movies - but it scored lower than The Irishman on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nOf the film's epic run-time, MailOnline's Roxy Simons wrote in a recent review: 'There's rarely a moment where The Irishman is burdened by this run-time, thanks to its incredible lead stars, masterful direction and poignant storyline.'\n\nMeanwhile, Variety's Owen Gleiberman wrote: ''One might even ask: 'Why, in the age of skittery attention spans, did Scorsese choose to make a three-and-a-half-hour magnum opus for Netflix?'\n\n'But the answer, it turns out, is rather up-to-the-minute. That running time is a mere blip in the world of binge-watching; if The Irishman weren't a movie at all but, in fact, a show (a limited series, say), we'd be talking all of three episodes.'\n\nElsewhere, The Telegraph's Robbie Collin looked towards Scorsese's most recent filmography, as he wrote: 'As Scorsese late-career masterpieces go, The Irishman splits the difference between Silence and The Wolf of Wall Street: this is a weighty, contemplative work, but one that moves like lightning for its entire three-and-a-quarter hours plus credits, and sporadically shakes with darkly comic amusement.\n\n'It would be unchivalrous to put a date on when De Niro was last this good. But he's sensational \u2013 giving a grippingly subtle, internalised performance that melts through the de-ageing process as if it were no more than make-up.'", "description": "The Irishman is set to be released in cinemas on November 1, and will hit Netflix on November 27 - the day before Thanksgiving.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19855802-0-image-a-12_1571344321259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
