And it\u2019s what apparently happened Saturday to Atatiana Jefferson, who was playing video games with her nephew in her Fort Worth home when a police officer fired through a window and shot her dead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe officer who gunned down Jefferson is white, but the racism in these killings \u2014 and it is racism, pure and simple \u2014 has less to do with the color of the perpetrators than that of the victims. After all these high-profile incidents, after all the consciousness-raising and all the soul-searching, black lives still are simply not valued the way white lives are. In too many police departments, officers still are being enculturated to see persons of color as both threatening and disposable. From what we know at this point, the killing of Jefferson was unjustified by any imaginable standard.\n\nIt was around 2:30 a.m. A neighbor noticed that the lights were on in Jefferson\u2019s house and a door appeared to be open. Knowing that Jefferson and her nephew were there alone, according to news reports, the neighbor called a non-emergency police line to ask that someone check to make sure everything was all right.\n\nThe officers who responded parked their squad car around the corner and approached stealthily. Body-camera footage released by the Fort Worth Police Department shows the officers making their way to the backyard and approaching a closed first-floor window. One of them shines a flashlight through the window and yells, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d Then he fires through the window, immediately and without identifying himself as a police officer, and Jefferson is killed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is progress, I suppose, that police did not seek to suppress the video of the shooting and its aftermath \u2014 and also that the officer has resigned and may face criminal charges. Images from inside the house show a firearm, which to me suggests a possible scenario: What if Jefferson heard noises outside, suspected a possible intruder and reached for a weapon to defend herself?\n\nAccording to the National Rifle Association and pro-gun zealots such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), that\u2019s exactly what a law-abiding citizen should do, right? The main reason for making firearms so widely available is to allow us the means to defend ourselves and our families. If the police officer had been a prowler, according to the good-guy-with-a-gun philosophy, Jefferson had every right to shoot him.\n\nOh, but I forgot: Second Amendment rights don\u2019t apply to African Americans. You will recall that Castile was legally carrying a firearm when he was pulled over for a traffic violation, and that fact was enough to get him killed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt happens that Jefferson, by all accounts, was an upstanding citizen \u2014 a graduate of Xavier University of Louisiana, with a degree in biology, who sold pharmaceutical equipment for a living and was thinking about going to medical school. So was Jean, a promising young accountant. So was Castile, who worked in a school cafeteria.\n\nBut Jefferson\u2019s character is not relevant to whether she had the right to stay up late in her own home playing Xbox games with her nephew. It is not relevant to whether the 8-year-old had to witness his aunt being brutally killed.\n\nIt will not do to write this off as just a horrible mistake \u2014 not when such mistakes fit such a clear pattern. Far too often, police officers approach situations involving African Americans with racist assumptions. They see a deadly threat where none exists. They act in ways that escalate the situation rather than calm it down. They are too quick to draw their weapons and too quick to fire. They shoot first and ask questions later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRacist attitudes lead to tragic outcomes. Until police departments banish those attitudes, until officers\u2019 default assumption is that black Americans are not suspects but citizens, more innocents like Atatiana Jefferson will die.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Until police departments banish racist attitudes, more innocents like Atatiana Jefferson will die.", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson", "Columnist Focusing On Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RGGyreWxr2D5w4zVjj3CSqPcx9Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HCIBEHOYUI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
