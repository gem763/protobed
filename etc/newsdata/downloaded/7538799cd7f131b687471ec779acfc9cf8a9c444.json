This is The Trailer.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) speaks at SEIU's Unions for All summit in Los Angeles on Friday. (Etienne Laurent/EPA-EFE)\n\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Three years ago, Kamala Harris won a Senate seat from California in a 24-point rout. More than 7.5 million voters, most of them Democrats, backed her candidacy.\n\nBut at the moment, not many of them are interested in supporting her for president.\n\n\u201cI find her message much less clear,\u201d said Beth Malikowski, 58, who wore a 2016 Hillary Clinton T-shirt to Elizabeth Warren's Thursday night town hall here. \u201cI'd love to watch her mop the floor with Trump, but I didn't know much about her until she ran for president.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe's not known around here,\u201d said William Pierce, 70. \u201cI have a thing against her, because we can't get an answer from her about the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't like her,\u201d said Cindy Mohr, 58. \u201cI saw a clip of her in San Francisco, talking about dealing with kids dropping out of school or playing hooky, and smirking as she said she was going to put their parents in jail.\u201d\n\nFive months out from California's primary, just four months before the first ballots go out in the mail, Harris has fallen to the middle of the pack in a state where she has won three big, expensive races. A run of early endorsements, including one from Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), has not translated to popular support. Democratic nervousness about the candidates dominating their primary \u2014 former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 has not translated into support for any candidate in the middle of the pack.\n\nThe candidate most obviously struggling in that arrangement is Harris, for whom a potential advantage \u2014 a delegate-rich early primary in her home state \u2014 has yet to pan out. This week, as the senator appeared on the cover of Time magazine, a new poll from the Public Policy Institute found just 8 percent of California Democrats supporting her run for president.\n\n\u201cI do not rise and fall with poll numbers,\u201d Harris told reporters at the SEIU's \u201cUnions for All\u201d forum this week. \u201cWhat we are seeing when we go to these early states is a great amount of enthusiasm. We're building up as we always intended to do.\u201d\n\nAfter a spectacular start, a rally in her hometown of Oakland that remains the largest single gathering for any 2020 Democrat, Harris has slipped behind in California for the same reasons she's struggled nationally. Other campaigns plunged into the state and organized early; other candidates proved more compelling to Democratic and labor groups. Liberal voters who pay close attention to the primary were deluged with early, negative stories about Harris's time as San Francisco district attorney; other voters often didn't realize she was their senator.\n\n\u201cHarris isn't the 'favorite daughter' candidate, but that's not unusual, because she's not well known,\u201d said Rose Kapolczynski, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped elect Harris's predecessor, Barbara Boxer. \u201cFive years into [Boxer's] first term, one-third of voters said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion. And she was a pretty high-profile, aggressive senator.\u201d Voters were probably not even aware of the Newsom endorsement, she added; it was, at best, a one-day story.\n\nHarris's campaign remains well organized in California and dominates other candidates with local endorsements \u2014 at least 150 of them, from left-wing icon Rep. Barbara Lee to Blue Dog Democratic Rep. Jim Costa. The campaign has 11 staff working in the state and says that at least 3,000 volunteers \u201chave been trained to be community organizers through Camp Kamala,\u201d its organizing school.\n\nThe campaign is clear-eyed about its problems, suggesting that the California picture, and every other primary, would shift if the senator did well in Iowa. But some donors who had high hopes for Harris have started to play out a primary where the senator lags behind.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s built a really strong base of fans in California, and I think she\u2019ll retain that, either in this race or in the future,\u201d Donna Bojarsky, a Democratic strategist who attended a Harris fundraiser last week, said in an email. \u201cWe do see more people now pondering out loud how/if Elizabeth Warren could broaden her base in a general election. That has definitively shifted in the last few weeks.\u201d\n\nWarren has become a bigger part of the conversation for two reasons \u2014 a series of rallies where she has drawn out thousands of Californians and a strong appearances at the sort of forums where Harris has struggled. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents around 15,000 California nurses, endorsed Harris in her 2016 Senate race; last month, its members voted to support Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. (The senator from Vermont had won the union's 2016 presidential endorsement outright.)\n\nThere are even more votes at play with the California SEIU, which does not make its own endorsement but has a role in the national endorsement and was a major presence at a \u201cUnions for All\u201d forum. Bob Schoonover, the president of the California SEIU, complimented Harris's focus on sector-wide organizing \u2014 one of the union's major priorities \u2014 while praising the \u201cpersonal connection\u201d Joe Biden had with the audience and Warren's ability to explain labor's goals.\n\n\u201cDo we have a really good relationship with Sen. Harris? Absolutely,\u201d Schoonover said. \u201cWe made a real difference in her 2010 election for attorney general. We are probably closer to her than any other candidate. But Joe Biden's been around forever; Elizabeth Warren's been around a really long time. So has Bernie Sanders. You have to get a longer look at people than we've had so far.\u201d\n\nWarren and Sanders, in particular, have also been building out their California campaigns. The Sanders campaign said that 730,000 Californians have taken some sort of action on its behalf, from donations to house parties; over the weekend, when the candidate's health scare kept him in Las Vegas, pre-scheduled campaign events and office openings went forward with mariachi bands instead of Sanders. Warren's campaign has held five \u201cbarnstorming\u201d events in major cities, similar to the Sanders campaign, to sign up and train supporters.\n\nThere has been less grass-roots organizing so far for Tom Steyer, the other Californian in the race, and the last candidate to enter it. Most of the appearances by Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been in front of donors. But that donor interest is a function of Democrats' interest in their non-Harris alternatives. After his own \u201cUnions for All\u201d appearance, Buttigieg, who had drawn a large crowd to a rally in Sacramento, played down the idea that home-state candidates had the advantage in California.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I've found from the fantastic reception we've got in different California communities is it feels like the voters of the state are very open-minded,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, California is wide open. And we're going to continue appearing here, not just in the biggest cities, but also we really enjoyed visiting different kinds of communities like Fresno, which in some ways reminds me of my hometown of South Bend.\u201d\n\nAmy B Wang contributed reporting from Los Angeles.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cUncertainty takes over the lead in the Democratic presidential race,\u201d by Michael Scherer and Matt Viser\n\nNervousness about Biden, a health scare for Sanders and persistent panic about Warren, all in the same week.\n\n\u201cBiden faced his biggest challenge and struggled to form a response,\u201d by Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns and Katie Glueck\n\nDid the slow fight-back to Trump's Ukraine scandal have an effect on Biden?\n\n\u201cSanders\u2019s heart attack raises questions about his age, potential damage to campaign,\u201d by Sean Sullivan and Amy Gardner\n\nThere's one playbook for how heart attacks get covered, and it's not good for Sanders.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s impeachment saga stems from a political hit job gone bad,\u201d by Joshua Green\n\nThe oppo research roots of an investigation that has been backfiring.\n\n\u201c \u2018Out on a limb\u2019: Inside the Republican reckoning over Trump\u2019s possible impeachment,\u201d by Robert Costa and Philip Rucker\n\nRepublicans broadcasting confidence while they fret the latest details.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard\u2019s return sets stage for debate fireworks,\u201d by Daniel Strauss\n\nDemocrats don't worry about her in the polls; they do worry about how she could use her onstage time to attack them.\n\n\u201cFor House Democrats, impeachment probe widens the divide they hoped to bridge,\u201d by Mike DeBonis and Amber Phillips\n\nThis week's congressional town halls didn't have as many fireworks as Republicans hoped for, but the mood was not all positive about impeachment.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nJoe Biden speaks at the SEIU Unions For All Summit in Los Angeles on Friday. (Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Joe Biden remains the biggest obstacle in the path of every other Democratic candidate for president. Even his donors are growing nervous about the attacks on him, asking whether the time it took for him to respond to President Trump \u2014 and an effort to keep focused on Biden's policy agenda, steering away from \u201cdistraction\u201d \u2014 hints at any general election weakness.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden's presidential rivals keep declining to pile on. Elizabeth Warren initially hesitated when asked whether her ethics plan would prevent a Hunter Biden-style situation: a member of a vice president's family getting a job with a foreign company. Since then, she has refused to engage on the question, pivoting back to Trump. And at the SEIU's two-day candidate forum here, most Democrats again refused to take a swing at Biden.\n\n\u201cLeave Joe Biden alone,\u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), repeating her refrain from the last two weeks of Biden coverage.\n\n\u201cThere won't be any confusion about the ethical expectations that I will have for my White House,\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said when he faced the same question. \u201cBut specifically with regards to this question, I also think it is not a good idea for us to get sucked into commenting on one of our fellow Democratic competitors when the real story here is the president of the United States confessing on air to the abuse of power, and we cannot allow him to change the subject.\u201d\n\nA little discord came from former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has swung back and forth in his approach to Biden, from demanding he answer for certain key votes to saying Democrats should not attack one another. In California, he was alone in suggesting that a strong ethics plan would prevent the sort of situation now being mined for attack material by Trump.\n\n\u201cI can't totally follow all the twists of that,\u201d O'Rourke said when asked about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine. \u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my Cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.\u201d\n\nBut as the president continues to make incorrect assertions about Biden, no Democrat has defended the story at the center: Hunter Biden's career. Last week, in a CNN interview, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said flatly that people in the younger Biden's position shouldn't take questionable jobs.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of beliefs about ethics rules and the needs for our government of the United States to go far further in the rules that we have,\u201d he began. \u201cI just don\u2019t think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who appeared on CNN today, went down the same path. Asked whether she would have let any presidential or vice presidential offspring take a job with a foreign company, she said she wouldn't have.\n\n\u201cI can promise you right now, my own daughter, who's only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cBut that is not the issue. The issue here is what the president is doing, because we have the Ukrainian prosecutors saying that there's no evidence. There has \u2014 as you have said on your show, multiple people looking at this \u2014 that there's no evidence that the vice president did something wrong here.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, no Democrat has tried to twist the issue back to the president himself \u2014 a president who has involved his children more closely in campaigning and governing than any modern predecessor, while putting no limitations on their ability to conduct business, in the United States or overseas.\n\nIMPEACHMENT WATCH\n\nAll three races for governor this year, in Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi, will be held in states that voted overwhelmingly to put Donald Trump in the White House. All three are more competitive than the 2016 results might suggest, with Democrats reaching out to Republican voters and focusing on health care \u2014 exactly what national Democrats want the next year to be about.\n\nThe result? While even some swing-district Democrats have endorsed the impeachment inquiry, the red-state Democrats running for governor have mostly declined to talk about it \u2014 much less to endorse it. In Mississippi, Attorney General Jim Hood has sounded a bit like Republicans, describing anything happening between the president and Democratic leaders as noise.\n\n\u201cI'm focused on our race for governor and on the local issues affecting Mississippi such as education, roads and bridges, and healthcare,\u201d Hood said in a statement last month. \u201cAll of the craziness and gridlock in Washington has created a positive response here in Mississippi where moderates in both parties are coming together to move our state forward.\u201d\n\nIn Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin tried to inject impeachment into the race by holding a news conference, where he reiterated that he opposed impeachment (\u201cit's destroying this nation\u201d) while his opponent, Attorney General Andy Beshear, would not take a position.\n\n\u201cAs Kentucky\u2019s top prosecutor, I make my decisions based on facts and evidence. And all I have right now are news stories,\u201d Beshear said in an interview with Kentucky reporters. \u201cMy hope, if they choose to proceed, is that they set it up in a nonpartisan way that is focused on getting to the truth and evidence, and not scoring political points.\u201d\n\nLouisiana's John Bel Edwards, the only incumbent Democratic governor on the ballot this year, took a similar approach. Impeachment has not even come up in televised debates so far.\n\nBut Democrats were taken aback at the way the president tweeted about the race, urging voters to pick any Republican in the Oct. 12 primary and labeling Edwards a \u201cNancy Pelosi/Chuck Schumer Democrat.\u201d Up to now, Republicans had preferred to tie Edwards to Hillary Clinton or one of the 2020 presidential candidates; the impeachment inquiry had convinced Republicans that the Democrats in Washington made better foils. And on Sunday, the president announced an Oct. 11 rally in Louisiana, the day before the primary, nationalizing a race that Republicans had struggled to turn into a Trump referendum.\n\nThe latest on the impeachment inquiry:\n\nTURNOUT WATCH\n\nFrom left, Eddie Rispone, Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham participate in a debate in Baton Rouge last month. (Bill Feig/Advocate/AP)\n\nEarly voting has wrapped up in Louisiana's gubernatorial primary; in-person voting for the primary is still six days away. And the first batch of numbers looked better for the Republicans in the race than it did for Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\nOverall, 374,190 ballots were cast in the early vote, up nearly 50 percent from the early vote in 2015. In that race, a moderate Republican was challenging Edwards and the GOP front-runner, David Vitter; this year, two other Republicans are challenging Edwards, and the result has been a boost in party turnout. As first reported by pollster John Couvillon, registered Democrats had a 14-point advantage in the early vote four years ago. This year, the Democratic advantage shrank to a single point.\n\nEdwards's campaign suggested that the black early vote, which jumped on the final day, was a positive sign \u2014 one in four early voters was black, down just marginally from 2015. But Republicans were much happier, with David Weinman, a spokesman for GOP candidate Ralph Abraham, calling the turnout \u201chistoric.\u201d And it came while Edwards and an allied super PAC dominated early TV advertising, before Republicans tapped the president to try to nationalize the race. Trump tweeted Sunday that he is going to Louisiana on Friday for a rally, aiming to deny Edwards a majority of the vote. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nJoe Biden, \u201cUnhinged.\u201d The former vice president's campaign had been running \u201cgeneral election\u201d ads before this week, with messaging and policy proposals designed as much for independents as for the activists who might actually caucus in Iowa. This spot attacks Trump directly but is aimed more at Democratic primary voters, warning them that the president thinks his tactics \u201cwill allow him to pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is spending $6 million to put the ad on TV and digital platforms, by far the biggest buy by any Democrat not named Tom Steyer. It's also relying quite a bit on earned media, which the Biden speech quoted in this spot did not dominate \u2014 he delivered it at night in Reno, on Pacific time, missing many of that day's news deadlines.\n\nDonald Trump, \u201cChanging Things.\u201d As his party has bounced between a couple of different strategies to fight back on impeachment, Trump has focused on one: blaming Democrats for envy-inspired chaos. \u201cIt isn't pretty,\u201d a narrator says. \u201cThe swamp hates him. But Mr. Nice Guy won't cut it. It takes a tough guy to change Washington.\u201d Polling hasn't found much support for the message beyond the president's supporters, but it's meant to change the entire discussion around corruption: If a voter is disgusted at Washington, he should trust the president and assume that any accusations against him are false.\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\n2020 election in Wisconsin (Fox News, 1,512 voters)\n\nJoe Biden \u2014 48%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 39%\n\nBernie Sanders \u2014 45%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 40%\n\nElizabeth Warren \u2014 45%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 41%\n\nThis is one of the first polls conducted entirely since the beginning of the Trump-Ukraine saga and the House's impeachment inquiry. It finds two things that cut against Republicans' planning: The president is weak in the swing state that Democrats worry the most about, and attacks on Joe Biden haven't turned many voters away from him.\n\nEvery major Democratic candidate leads Trump and runs ahead of Hillary Clinton with key voters; none lose rural voters by 27 points, as Clinton did, and Biden loses them by only two points. By a 22-point margin, voters believe that the Ukraine story is a \u201cserious\u201d liability for Trump; by a one-point margin, voters are comfortable with impeachment, though divided on whether they also want the president removed from office. White voters, who powered Trump's narrow 2016 wins in the Midwest, are cooler on him now. Three years ago, he won 52 percent of their votes in Wisconsin, and he's now at 44 percent with them against Warren, 43 percent against Sanders and 41 percent against Biden.\n\nThe Democrats' own primary is a bit more muddled. Biden leads the field with 28 percent to Warren's 22 percent; Sanders, who won the 2016 primary in a landslide, polls at 17 percent. There's much less support for the candidates who have run on Midwestern roots and electability \u2014 7 percent for Pete Buttigieg and 2 percent for Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSouth Carolina Democratic primary (Fox News, 803 Democrats)\n\nJoe Biden \u2014 41% ( 6)\n\nElizabeth Warren \u2014 12% ( 7)\n\nBernie Sanders \u2014 10% (-4)\n\nKamala Harris \u2014 4% (-8)\n\nTom Steyer \u2014 4% ( 4)\n\nCory Booker \u2014 3 ( 0)\n\nPete Buttigieg \u2014 2 ( 0)\n\nMichael Bennet \u2014 1 ( 1)\n\nTulsi Gabbard \u2014 1 ( 1)\n\nTim Ryan \u2014 1 ( 1)\n\nMarianne Williamson \u2014 1 ( 0)\n\nAndrew Yang \u2014 1 ( 0)\n\nThe first Southern primary remains, for Biden, a variation on the \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2014 he leads there handily, but not with the margin that Hillary Clinton won on her way to putting Sanders away. In 2015, Fox's first South Carolina poll was taken in December, and it found Clinton up by 44 points with a 71-point advantage among black voters. Biden leads with black voters by 39 points over Sanders, who gets 9 percent of their support, while Warren gets 8 percent. Overall, 50 percent of South Carolina's black Democrats pick Biden; 30 percent pick another candidate, and the rest are undecided.\n\nThat's more than enough to keep Biden ahead of a crowded pack, as no other Democrat has built a powerful constituency here. The former vice president trails with only one group of voters \u2014 white voters with college degrees, who back Warren by a 26-to-21 margin over Biden. The continuing weakness of the race's black candidates gives Biden more space here, with Harris, who would be the first black woman president, at just 3 percent with black women.\n\nDEBATE SEASON\n\nThe Oct. 15 debate in Ohio will be the last Democratic faceoff under the current rules \u2014 qualifying by getting 2 percent in four polls and more than 130,000 donations. The November debate, with no set date yet, will be limited to candidates who reach 3 percent in four national polls, or 5 percent in two polls of early states, all while getting at least 165,000 donations.\n\nAs of today, seven candidates have qualified for November's debate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer. The latter two were pushed over the line by new Fox News polling from South Carolina. And that leaves more than half the Democratic field off the stage, with perhaps a month to move things around.\n\nThe stragglers fit into two categories. Five of them qualified for the October debate: Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Tulsi Gabbard. Only one of these candidates, Yang, is close to making November's debate; one more poll would do it for him, as he passed the donation count weeks ago.\n\n2020\n\nBernie Sanders. He was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital Friday, then headed home to Vermont, with no individual campaign events scheduled. \u201cI'm feeling so much better,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI just want to thank all of you for the love and warm wishes that you sent to me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all but certain that Sanders led the 2020 Democrats in fundraising for the third quarter; he collected $25.3 million, slightly ahead of Elizabeth Warren. Half of their competitors have yet to announce their totals, but none were on track to pass Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, the other Democrats with eight-figure hauls.\n\nJoe Biden. On Friday, he held his first media gaggle since the impeachment inquiry began, unloading on the president as the human \"definition of corruption\" and chastising reporters who wanted him to talk about Hunter Biden's Ukraine work.\n\nJoe Sestak. He'll walk the length of New Hampshire, west to east, from Oct. 13 to 20. (That will put Sestak past Keene on the day of the fourth Democratic debate, for which he did not qualify.) In his past two races, both campaigns for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Sestak walked across a much larger state.\n\nMark Sanford. In a Sunday interview on CNN, he agreed with an argument from House Republican leaders \u2014 that Democrats should hold a real impeachment vote, rather than letting an \u201cinquiry\u201d run through committees. \u201cI don't know that, ultimately, impeachment is the best way to go,\u201d he added. \u201cI think probably censure is, given the fact that we're this close to an election.\u201d\n\nTulsi Gabbard. She\u2019s campaigning across Iowa on Sunday through Tuesday, with a series of town halls and more intimate coffees.\n\nSteve Bullock. He raised $2.3 million in the third quarter, though he did not release numbers to suggest he would hit the debate thresholds.\n\nAmy Klobuchar. She was in New Hampshire on Sunday to open a Manchester campaign office.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... four days until the CNN-hosted LGBT town halls\n\n... six days until Louisiana's gubernatorial primary\n\n... nine days until the fourth Democratic debate", "description": "In this edition: California's indifference toward its would-be favorite daughter, Democrats struggling with the Hunter Biden question, and impeachment getting injected into down-ballot races.", "authors": ["David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/eeeed0a4b78cee0a48dc6613287738ee-5000-3333-70-8-Rex_Kamala_Harris_attends_SEIUs_Uni_10436438L_tstmp_1570393472.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
