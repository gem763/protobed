Nobody, because no one wants to have doubts about their health.\"", "description": "When Rachelle Gagnon went to see her family doctor for a routine physical on Aug. 22, she was shocked to learn she had\u00a0a\u00a0lump in her breast.\u00a0Adding to her worry, Gagnon was told she'd have to wait until Sept. 18 for a\u00a0mammogram.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1588971.1567194180!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hi-mammogram-breast-852-cp.jpg"}
