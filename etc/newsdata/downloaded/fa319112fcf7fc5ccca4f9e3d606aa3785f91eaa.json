Its private valuation was as high as $47 billion.\n\nThe move comes as WeWork's parent company announced Friday that it plans to make a number of changes to its corporate governance structure in advance of its much-anticipated IPO and amid growing investor concerns.\n\nIn an amended S-1 filing, The We Co. said it's changing its high-vote stock from 20 votes per share to 10 votes per share, curtailing WeWork CEO Adam Neumann's voting power. Prior to the move, Neumann controlled the majority of voting rights through the company's Class B and Class C shares, with both classes carrying 20 votes per share compared with Class A shares, which have one vote per share. The filing also states that WeWork will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker \"WE.\"\n\nThe company also eliminated a key provision that would have allowed Neumann's wife, Rebekah, to lead the search for his successor should he ever become permanently disabled or deceased. Instead, WeWork's board would pick a successor. The filing states that \"no members of Adam's family will sit on our board.\"", "description": "WeWork could slash its IPO valuation to less than $15 billion, reflecting weak investor demand, as it announced sweeping changes to its corporate governance structure.", "authors": ["Annie Palmer", "Matthew J.
