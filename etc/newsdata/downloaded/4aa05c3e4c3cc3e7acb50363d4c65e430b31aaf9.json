You would think AOC and her party would get some credit from this person for condoning the killing of more than 600,000 children every year.\n\nNow they\u2019re all DINOs just because they don\u2019t want to eat the remains.\n\nShe did a good job here handling an exceptionally bizarre moment, in all fairness. With a question like this, there are only two possibilities: Troll/plant or earnest activist who\u2019s already blown past Greta-Thunberg-levels of alarmism and entered Cloud-cuckoo-land. Either way, it would have been a bad look for Ocasio-Cortez to mock her or get annoyed. If you mock her and she turns out to be mental, you\u2019ve made fun of a person who needs help. If you get annoyed at the trolling, then you\u2019ve been pwn3d. The smart play was to lower the volume, not be antagonistic, and hope that she\u2019s not armed.\n\nAnyway, it does appear to have been a case of trolling \u2014 although not a Republican one. And of course, trolling isn\u2019t mutually exclusive with \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Sort of the opposite, if you\u2019ve spent even five minutes online.\n\nThe LaRouchies are many things but \u201ctraditional GOPers\u201d isn\u2019t one of them. Although who knows? After this, baby-eating may end up as a \u201cBaba Booey\u201d-type troll callback for the Republicans in AOC\u2019s district to ask about at her townhalls.\n\n*Are* there any Republicans in her district?\n\nAnyway, breathe easy. Eating babies won\u2019t enter the mainstream of climate activism until 2024 at the earliest.", "description": "Solutions.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
