For example, a customer can perform online shopping on one screen while reading individual product descriptions on the other, or open two separate search engines on each screen.\n\nSee also: LG needs to decide where OLED should live\n\nSince its launch, LG has also extended Whale's availability to the V50 ThinQ, V50S ThinQ's predecessor, and vowed to further expand its deployment to other devices.\n\nThe company is currently offering a dual screen accessory for free to those who purchase the V50S ThinQ in South Korea to promote its use.\n\nLG is expecting operating profits of 781 billion won and revenues of 15.7 trillion won for the third quarter, which would be a rise of 4.3% and 1.8% from a year prior, respectively.\n\nIts mobile business is expected to have reduced its loss in comparison to previous quarters due to recent cost cutting efforts.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nLG V50 ThinQ 4G review: A dual-display 5G flagship\n\nLG's V50 ThinQ 5G is a 5G smartphone with a difference: it comes with a hinged cover that incorporates a second screen.
