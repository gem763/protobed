The books have been a publishing phenomenon, a huge commercial fiction brand, since the Coventry-born author (real name Jim Grant) wrote the first, Killing Floor, in 1997, when he heard he was getting laid off from his job as a TV executive. The stories are, essentially, westerns. Reacher is a loner, a wanderer. He has never settled into a \u201cnormal\u201d life after leaving the army. He travels the US, hitching or taking the bus: it\u2019s a way of life he began as a means to explore the country, but by now, it\u2019s a compulsion. He carries only a toothbrush. He buys new clothes when he needs them, junks the old ones. He doesn\u2019t look for trouble, but trouble finds him. In each new town he solves the mystery, gets the bad guys and doles out rough justice. There\u2019s a lot of violence: guns, or scrappy hand-to-hand fighting. Kicks in the groin, punches to the head, elbows scything ferociously into flanks.\n\nFor stories to be as successful as these, they need to be read by people who don\u2019t generally read. But what makes Reacher so fascinating is the books\u2019 appeal not only outside, but within the rarefied circles of the literati \u2013 unlike, say, the work of Dan Brown or EL James. Their success with the grandes dames of literature is especially striking. Antonia Fraser is a fan. Kate Atkinson is a fan. Margaret Drabble, asked earlier this year by the Guardian what book she wished she\u2019d written, answered: \u201cAnything by Lee Child. What page turners, what prose, what landscapes, what motorways and motels, what mythic dimensions! I read, awestruck, waiting impatiently for the next.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I read, awestruck, waiting impatiently for the next\u2019 \u2026 Margaret Drabble.

Margaret MacMillan, the great authority on the first world war and a recent Reith lecturer, absolutely loves Child\u2019s books. Jenny Davidson, professor of comparative literature at Columbia in New York, calls herself \u201can obsessive fan\u201d. She regards them as the absolute apogee of light reading: they are, she says, like the exquisite versions of fast food prepared by Michelin-starred chefs.\n\nI am no grande dame, but I love them too. I\u2019ve read all 24. When finding a title for my last book (a non-fiction work about mazes and labyrinths) I thought to myself, \u201cWhat would Lee Child do?\u201d I called it Red Thread, which seemed to me to have a properly Reacher-esque pithiness. The new Lee Child, I am pleased to note, is called Blue Moon.\n\nWhat is it about Jack Reacher and literary women? Part of the draw is purely formal. Take this passage from Blue Moon, selected more or less at random:\n\nHis limbs were slow because they were heavy, and they were heavy because they were not only thick but also long. In the case of his legs, very long. He drove hard off his left foot and kicked out with his right, stretching low, a huge vicious wingspan, aiming at anything, any part of the guy, any part of the swoop, any window of time, whatever came along.\n\nSimple words, strung together with a real mastery of rhythm. Nothing fancy. Think of the simplicity of a Shakespeare sonnet, its preference for one- and two-syllable words (\u201cRough winds do shake the darling buds of May\u201d). The repetition of \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clong\u201d. The way the final sentence coils and stretches out, heavy and long itself, ready to deliver its killer kick. Child is a stickler for grammar. So is Reacher.\n\nReacher respects and likes women. Finds them delightful, and sexy. But not in a creepy way\n\nThen there are the landscapes that Child conjures: the dusty nowhere-towns of the American flyover states; their diners and pawnshops and hardware stores. All of this is summoned up with extreme economy, helped along by particularly resonant recurring words and phrases: \u201cblacktop\u201d (asphalt), \u201cbackhoe\u201d (a digger), \u201ccloverleaf\u201d (a road-junction design). The place names themselves are resonant. Last year\u2019s story, Past Tense, was set in Laconia, New Hampshire. The original Laconia was the territory in Greece occupied by the ancient Spartans, famously ruthless warriors, like Reacher. From Laconia we derive the word laconic, a reference to their severe, economic and sometimes dryly witty way with words \u2013 Reacher\u2019s own verbal mode to a tee.\n\nThere is a mythic heft to all this. \u201cReacher is the archetypal hero \u2013 the stranger who walks into town and avenges its wrongs \u2013 the classic trope identified by Auden in \u2018The Guilty Vicarage\u2019, his essay on detective fiction,\u201d says novelist Amanda Craig, another big fan. She calls him a \u201cmodern knight errant\u201d. In myths and fairytales, we expect certain patterns. So it is with Reacher stories. Guardian writer Steven Poole once asked novelist Haruki Murakami why he liked the books. \u201cEverything\u2019s the same!\u201d answered Murakami.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Reacher author, Lee Child. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian\n\nOf course, everything is not quite the same: Davidson points out how adept Child is at ringing the changes, writing flashback novels that deal with Reacher\u2019s army career, or switching between first-person and third-person stories. But it\u2019s true, on some fundamental level, that everything is the same. We know, more often than not, there will be a minor dust-up in the first 10 pages or so. We know that there will be a careful drip-feed of plot points and minor resolutions leading up to a climactic chapter of ferocious violence, where the bad guys will be dispatched. Resolution will come, and Reacher will ride out of town once more, taking absolutely nothing with him. The body count, 24 books in, is into the hundreds. Crime novelist Val McDermid writes a funny scene in her latest book, How the Dead Speak. Her character Carol Jordan, now an ex-cop herself, and suffering from PTSD, is on a stake out. She listens to a Lee Child on audiobook to help with the boredom. \u201cCarol thought that if his hero was real, after what he\u2019d been through in twenty-odd books, he\u2019d be in dire need of [trauma therapist] Melissa Rintoul\u2019s services.\u201d He would. But the mythic, formulaic elements of Reacher books are crucial to their enjoyment, and mustn\u2019t be tarnished with too much realism. No trauma therapy for Reacher.\n\nWhich brings me to the violence itself. What makes it palatable is its extreme stylisation. The fight scenes in Reacher novels remind me of arming and battle scenes in the Iliad, with their recurrent shapes and turns of phrase. This stylisation is rendered partly through a radical deceleration of pace. In Andy Martin\u2019s book Reacher Said Nothing \u2013 for which Martin sat at Child\u2019s elbow through the composition of the novel Make Me \u2013 Child said that he had one rule. \u201cYou should write the fast stuff slow and the slow stuff fast.\u201d In Blue Moon, there are some prime examples. In one fight, eight blows in total are delivered by Reacher and his assailants \u2013 this takes four whole pages to describe, and is punctuated by a chapter break. Only very occasionally does Reacher fight women, and this is when the violence arguably tips over from enjoyably stylised to something more gratuitous. Gone Tomorrow, with its graphic account of a woman\u2019s \u201cflawless face\u201d being \u201cruined\u201d before her throat is cut \u201cear to ear\u201d is pretty dreadful (I\u2019ll spare you the details). But on the whole, he avoids the trope of exoticising or eroticising violence against women.\n\nWomen want to be Jack Reacher: to abandon all responsibilities, to be physically invincible\n\nReacher will often team up with an ally in his adventures. That ally will frequently be an attractive, competent woman employed in some branch of law enforcement, with whom he may have a brief, consensual, mutually satisfying affair. Which brings me to another fundamental part of the stories\u2019 appeal to women, notwithstanding the example above: their understated feminism. Reacher respects and likes women. Finds them delightful, and sexy. But not in a creepy way. The female characters are invariably self-sufficient, neither needy nor tortured; it is surprisingly difficult to find such women in popular fiction written by men.\n\nIn some ways, Blue Moon might be read as a post\u2011#MeToo story. One of the injustices righted in this story turns on male aggression towards women, and sexual exploitation. has an especially grim denouement, bloody even by Child\u2019s standards it is hard not to read it \u2013 on one level, at least \u2013 as female revenge drama.\n\nThere\u2019s that. But do women fancy Jack Reacher? Do female readers fantasise about him? Well, some clearly do. That said, he is \u201ca big ugly guy\u201d built like \u201ca brick outhouse\u201d. Not my type. I think the real point is that women want to be him. That\u2019s the fantasy: to abandon all responsibilities, to walk through the world with nothing. To be physically invincible. To be justifiably fearless.\n\n\u2022 Lee Child\u2019s Blue Moon is published by Bantam on 29 October. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.
