But this remains the heart of the club.\n\n\u201cThe middle section of last season, after Ole\u2019s arrival, feels most relevant to what we want to achieve and where we want to be.\n\n\u201cWe saw a team playing fast, fluid football, with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants.\n\n\u201cOle has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years.\n\n\u201cHe's building a squad that respects the club\u2019s history, in which players work hard and respect their team-mates. No-one is bigger than the club.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThere is an acceptance at United that poor recruitment is the root cause of their current plight, signing too many players who simply were not up to the standard required or, in some cases, past it.\n\nSince 2013, the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Radamel Falacao, Angel Di Maria, Morgan Schneiderlin, Memphis Depay and Alexis Sanchez have all come in and flopped in the famous red shirt.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nUnited have restructured their recruitment department, adding 45 scouts since Fergie retired, while greater forward planning means next summer's transfer targets will be identified by January.\n\nIf any of those targets become available in January, United will move for them, although there is an acknowledgment that the mid-season window is a notoriously difficult time in which to buy.\n\nThere has also been a deliberate shift in focus, from the failed policy of signing established players, to one focused on younger players who will buy into Solskjaer's long-term vision and playing style.\n\n\u201cThe changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad,\u201d said Woodward.\n\n\u201cBut it's also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.\u201d\n\nThe message from the top at United is simple: there may be short-term pain for long-term gain, but the path they have embarked on is the right one, with the right man - Solskjaer - at the helm.", "description": "Man Utd chief Ed Woodward has opened up on their worst ever Premier League start but defended manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Pa Wire Pa Images", "Sunday Mirror", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20328182.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Everton-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-Goodison-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
