The government will not deviate from this policy position,\" Mabuza said.\n\nHe added the inter-ministerial committee on land reform and agriculture, which is tasked with co-ordinating and providing political leadership to accelerate land reform, was currently finalising the government's comprehensive response to the recommendations made by the panel of experts on land reform.\n\nA comprehensive response to the panel's recommendations will be presented to the Cabinet for consideration and approval for implementation.\n\n\"It is worth pointing out that the panel of experts on land reform has supported the amendment of the Constitution to set out unambiguous provisions for expropriation of land without compensation. The panel also supports the finalisation of the Expropriation Bill to enable land expropriation within a properly guided legislative framework.\n\n\"In as far as the work of the constitutional review committee toward the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution is concerned, the chairperson of the joint constitutional review committee announced that the committee will be able to meet its deadline to amend the Constitution,\" Mabuza said.\n\nIt is actually the ad hoc committee to initiate and introduce legislation amending section 25 of the Constitution that is dealing with the amendment, and not the joint constitutional review committee (CRC).\n\nLast year, the CRC recommended that the Constitution should be amended after a vast, if controversial, public participation process. Both committees are chaired by Mathole Motshekga.\n\nMabuza said Motshekga had indicated the committee would complete its work by March next year.\n\n\"We are confident that Parliament will be able to finalise its own processes within the planned schedules.\n\n\"In the meantime, the government will proceed with the development and tabling of the Expropriation Bill currently underway to provide for the expropriation of property for a public purpose or in the public interest. This process will not be affected by the parliamentary process for the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution,\" Mabuza said.\n\n'That's not redistribution!'\n\nIn response to a follow-up question by DA MP Thandeka Mbabama, he said the government was reviewing its redistribution programme, adding this included leasing land.\n\n\"That's not redistribution!\" DA MP Geordin Hill-Lewis interjected.\n\n\"It is!\" Mabuza hit back, before adding it might be better to debate the policy once it had been announced.\n\nThe FF Plus' Corn\u00e9 Mulder asked if the government supported the EFF's policy that states all land would be expropriated by the state which would also then own all the land.\n\n\"Well, that's the policy of the EFF. Why are you asking me? I'm from the ruling party,\" Mabuza said.\n\nIn response to another question, he added they were expecting resistance to expropriation without compensation.\n\n\"We are prepared for that resistance, because our intentions are noble.\"\n\nMabuza added they were encouraged by white farmers who have donated unused land.\n\n\"This is goodwill that we want to encourage.\"", "description": "Amending the Constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation remains a priority of the current administration, Deputy President David Mabuza has told the National Assembly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9327/490249d24ff54d458bc1b62eb373ec06.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
