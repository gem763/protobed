Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and the president's other defenders claimed on weekend news shows that rules they said required a whistleblower to have first-hand knowledge were changed, just before the complaint, was filed to allow second-hand information -- and Trump did so himself on Monday.\n\n\u201cWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning.\n\nWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThe complaint, which prompted an impeachment inquiry, was based on second-hand knowledge the whistleblower said was gained from other U.S. government officials, and it alleged that Trump abused his office in the July 25 call by repeatedly pressuring Ukraine's president to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe president's supporters have claimed that, in August, prior to the whistleblower filing his complaint about Trump and the July call, the intelligence community changed a rule they say required that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.\n\nIn making the claim, Trump and his supporters referred to a change made on the \u201cDisclosure of Urgent Concern\u201d form, which previously had asked if the whistleblower had direct or indirect knowledge.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector's general's office released a statement Monday evening disputing any recent change in the whistleblower form.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the whistleblower complaint received by the ICIG on August 12, 2019, the ICIG processed and reviewed the complaint in accordance with the law,\u201d read a statement from the intelligence community inspector general's office (ICIG) dated Sept. 30. \u201cThe Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019 is the same form the ICIG has had in place since May 24, 2018,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNational security lawyers who specialize in whistleblower complaints told ABC News that whistleblowers have never been required to have direct knowledge of alleged wrongdoing in order to file a complaint.\n\n\u201cIn no way, shape or form was anything changed as a matter of law,\u201d said national security lawyer Brad Moss. \u201cThe law has never said that a whistleblower couldn't have second information because that would unnecessarily restrict an inordinate amount of whistleblowing allegations coming forward because most people don\u2019t have the first-hand information.\u201d\n\nIrvin McCullough, national security analyst for Government Accountability Project, said that the change made by the intelligence community's chief watchdog Michael Atkinson, in an attempt to revamp and simplify the form, carried no legal weight and did not change any whistleblower laws or protections.\n\nMoss agreed, saying that the previous form caused some confusion for whistleblowers who did not have legal counsel about whether they themselves had to have first-hand knowledge. He agreed as well that changing the form didn't change the law that he said clearly allows a whistleblower to file a complaint with second-hand information.\n\n\u201cThe changed form didn\u2019t change anything as a matter of law, nor could they change the law with just a form,\u201d Moss said. \u201cIf they wanted to revise the evidentiary threshold that the ICIG [intelligence community inspector general) had to meet, then Congress had to change the law -- it couldn\u2019t be done through a form.\n\nMcCullough explained that to file a complaint a whistleblower is required only to have \u201creasonable belief\u201d of wrongdoing and that, once the complaint is filed, it is up to the inspector general to acquire first-hand information and whether to deem the complaint credible.\n\n\u201cWhat the old form purported to explain to the whistleblowers was that the ICIG could not find their information credible unless they obtained first hand knowledge of the wrongdoing,\u201d McCullough said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the law anymore,\u201d Moss said on why he believes Trump and his supporters are spreading this claim. \u201cThis is about political persuasion. It is a good political smear tactic to use to get their allies on board as long as possible and to muddy the waters.\u201d", "description": "Legal experts debunked President Trump's claim that rules requiring whistleblowers have first-hand knowledge were changed in August just before the complaint.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-6-ap-er-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
