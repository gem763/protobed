When I was born, she thought I would never be able to,\" Mrs Savage said.\n\n\"There was a little bit of apprehension about meeting her. We were both feeling kind of emotional. She was waiting outside the lift and we walked right past her because I didn't recognise her at first.\n\n(Image: Family/Solent News)\n\n(Image: Family/Solent News)\n\n\"When I did, I said it's lovely to see you.\" She may be my mother, but she feels like a complete stranger.\n\n\"She was so pleased to hear from me it was lovely.\n\n\"It wasn't awkward. She's very chatty, and we have got so much catching up to do.\"\n\nMrs Preston gave birth to Mrs Savage in 1950, at The Grange - a mother and baby home in Birmingham notorious for separating unmarried mothers from their children - after splitting up with Christine's father.\n\nChristine, who her natural mother named Heather, was then adopted by Olive and Harold Turner, a secretary and accountant who could not have children themselves, and remained in the city.\n\n(Image: Family/Solent News)\n\n(Image: Family/Solent News)\n\nMargaret moved briefly back to her native Nottingham, but left for London after the social stigma and inevitable gossip about her birth out of wedlock proved too much to deal with.\n\nShe later married and went on to have two more children and worked as a healthcare assistant.\n\nDetailing the heartbreaking moment when her mother was separated from her Mrs Savage said: \"She saw my adoptive parents arrive, with tears streaming down her face.\n\n\"But that's just what happened in the 1950s.\n\n\"She was unmarried, and at the time that was totally unacceptable.\"\n\nMrs Savage was always conscious of the fact that she was adopted, but until recently never felt inclined to seek out her natural mother.\n\n(Image: Family/Solent News)\n\nHer adoptive parents told her she was adopted from a very early age so it wouldn't come as a shock, Christine believes.\n\nShe added: \"I never wanted to search for my biological parents, because I had a loving family.\n\n\"My adopted mother offered to help me years ago, but I didn't really put much thought into it.\"\n\nChristine went on to follow in the footsteps of her adoptive mother - working various secretary jobs throughout the country, in part because she could speak French, Spanish, and German, fluently, and eventually settled in Oakley, near Portsmouth, Hants.\n\nShe also had two children of her own - Richard Stephen, 43, Kathryn Rosemary, 40, and three grandchildren - Oliver, ten, Luke, eight, and Alex, six, all of whom live in Hampshire.\n\nHer adoptive mother and father died in 1988, and 2001, respectively.\n\n(Image: Family/Solent News)\n\nFollowing her retirement in 2012, Christine had a change of heart, and began searching for her mother, having only her name, childhood address, and incidental details, such as the fact she had eczema .\n\nAfter having no luck searching electoral rolls, and even splashing out hundreds of pounds on a private researcher, she decided to upload her DNA to website Ancestry.co.uk .\n\nShe was alerted to a close match - a 61-year-old woman from Australia named Rosalind Preston, who turned out to be her younger half-sister and who had no idea that her mother had given birth to another child almost a decade before.\n\nChristine said: \"I sent a message to say I see we are a close DNA match.\n\n\"I told her a little bit about myself.\n\n\"I didn't say much because I didn't know if I would get a reply.\n\n\"She came back and said 'how nice to hear from you', assuming I was a cousin or or something.\n\n\"I said I'm her half-sister and that came as a huge shock.\n\n\"For Rosalind, there was some explaining to do.\"\n\nShe later received a message from a 58-year-old man from Florida named Geoff Preston, Rosalind's - and Christine's - younger brother.\n\nThe message read: \"I hear I'm your little brother\".\n\nMr Preston gave her her natural mother's phone number and she rang her immediately.\n\nThey spoke on the phone before Mrs Savage travelled with her husband, retired accountant Steve, 68, to her home in St. Annes-on Sea, near Blackpool, Lancs, to meet her in person.\n\nThey spent almost four hours together, exchanging stories, making cups of tea, and eating chocolate eclairs.\n\nMargaret is now relocating back to Birmingham and can be closer to her daughter, and Christine is intending on bringing her daughter Kathryn to meet her grandmother for the first time soon.", "description": "Margaret Preston, 88, had always hoped her daughter would one day track her down after giving her up for adoption in 1950", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Solent News", "Family Solent News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583638.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-SN_CHRISTINE_AND_MARGARET_05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
