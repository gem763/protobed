Tribble, the indictment alleges, \u201cdeveloped a personal relationship\u201d with then-President of Cobra Acquisitions Donald Keith Ellison.\n\nTribble is said to have received perks like hotel accommodation, first-class airfare, the use of a credit card and personal helicopter flights from Cobra Acquisitions. Authorities said Ellison also provided a job at the company for Tribble\u2019s friend Jovanda R. Patterson, when she left FEMA in July 2018.\n\nTribble, Patterson and Ellison are all facing charges.\n\n\u201cThese defendants were supposed to come to Puerto Rico to help during the recovery after the devastation suffered from Hurricane Mar\u00eda,\u201d U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e9lez said in a statement.\n\n\u201cInstead, they decided to take advantage of the precarious conditions of our electric power grid and engaged in a bribery and honest services wire fraud scheme in order to enrich themselves illegally.\u201d\n\nCobra Acquisitions received contracts worth $1.8 billion, that were paid for with FEMA funding, according to the Justice Department.\n\nBill Leone, a lawyer for Ellison, said that the indictment \u201ccriminalizes normal business and personal relationships that are not criminal under the law, no matter how far you stretch it,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nHurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico in September 2017 as a Category 4 hurricane, caused severe devastation to the island. A study by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University found that almost 3,000 people died in the six months following the storm as a result of problems caused by the disaster. It look 11 months to restore power to residents, according to the New York Times.\n\nWrite to Amy Gunia at amy.gunia@time.com.", "description": "Current and former FEMA employees Ahsha Nateef Tribble and Jovanda R.
