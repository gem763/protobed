Mubadala invested $15 billion in SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund 1, and was expected to invest in SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 in the fourth quarter of 2019, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.\n\nMubadala weighing investment in second SoftBank tech fund: executive", "description": "Mubadala weighing investment in second SoftBank tech fund: executive", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9716G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
