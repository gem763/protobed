Smith on behalf of current Assessor employees Stephen Adamus, Yvonne Austin, and Scott Woods.\n\nThe 48-page \u201cwhistleblower lawsuit\u201d has been sent to several award-winning investigative journalists here in Southern California who have a long history of reporting on alleged illegal activities dating back to the late 1990s and for the past two decades.\n\nI was sent a copy of the lawsuit late Tuesday afternoon from sources that I chose not to disclose.\n\nPulitzer Prize winner Richard Winton of The Los Angeles Times was the first to report the story Tuesday night via its web edition.\n\nIn the Times report, they omitted the alleged preferential treatment and assessed property refunds given to Chan.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the three plaintiffs, Adamus, Woods, and Austin, repeatedly claim they were \u201cpressured to unlawfully change unfavorable tax decisions they made during a taxpayer\u2019s reassessment\u201d that resulted in millions of dollars of loss to the County.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, all the Plaintiffs have \u201crepeatedly complained\u201d to Prang and his top executives inside the Assessor\u2019s office including Santos Kreimann and George Reinke--two of the most influential inside executives among the staff at the Assessor's office.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that uber wealthy connected taxpayers close to Prang \u201cunlawfully obtain favorable tax treatment; that the US Federal Tax Code as well as the California Tax Code is \u201croutinely violated\u201d inside both the Assessor\u2019s office as well as County employees, including County Counsel for the benefit of connected taxpayers.\u201d\n\nPrang is a former Mayor and City Councilmember in West Hollywood and is currently in his second term as Assessor. The Los Angeles County Assessor oversees more than $1 trillion in property taxes that is the lifeblood to run the multibillion dollar county agency.\n\nLos Angeles County is currently engulfed in a massive homeless crisis. Just outside the offices of the Assessor you can literally see hundreds of tents, tons of human waste and garbage for literally miles.\n\nThe complaint states that the \u201cDepartment engages in special tax treatment in violation of law and state\u201d [from] \"entities and individuals\u201d that received lower assessed property values. The suit claims that millions of dollars of refunds were given to The RAND Corporation that included a $1.5 million refund. The RAND Corporation was established as a \u201cNot for Profit Organization.\u201d The lawsuit states the following regarding Rand: \u201cAs a result of the decision to settle, Adamus complained by email to Chief Deputy Santos Kreimann and Assessor Jeffrey Prang that the county had intentionally lost the case and that the public had been harmed by the loss.\"\n\nThe suit also states that GMW LIMITED, LLC, the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, The Armenian Society, Luxor Properties, Chan, and even The Paley Center for Media all received the red-carpet treatment by the Assessor.\n\n\u201cThe County counsel routinely violates the law by intentionally losing cases for connected taxpayers and that all three Plaintiffs have been pressured and \u201cunlawfully changed unfavorable tax decisions they made during taxpayer's reassessment.\u201d\n\nSmith also contends that his clients were \u201cencouraged\u201d to break the law by \"unlawfully changing unfavorable tax decisions they made against a taxpayer's reassessment.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit said that Adamus, Woods, and Austin, have been \u201cdirected to act in conspiracy in violation of Penal Code section 424.\"\n\nIn addition, the case claims Misuse of Public Funds to pay public money for reimbursement when an individual or entity was not legally entitled to the money.\n\nAlso the suit strongly claims that the three Plaintiffs were directed to not use email when communicating with their superiors when a violation of law had occurred in a conspiracy to hide illegal activities; the Plaintiffs refused to go along with illegal, unlawful conduct by County Counsel and the Assessor.\n\nNote: Randy Economy has won five top investigative journalism awards from the prestigious Los Angeles Press Club.
