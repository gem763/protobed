REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo\n\nLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Lionsgate and Millennium\u2019s \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d ruled the box office during an expectedly quiet Labor Day weekend. The third entry in the action franchise generated $11.5 million over the weekend and should close out the holiday with $14.4 million.\n\nWithout any new nationwide offerings from a major Hollywood studio, those ticket sales were enough to maintain first place on domestic box office charts. After two weekends in theaters, the Gerard Butler-led \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d has earned $43.6 million.\n\nBlumhouse Tilt and OTL took on the last weekend of summer, closing out popcorn season with \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go.\u201d The supernatural thriller debuted with $2.4 million from 920 North American theaters and is expected to finish the holiday weekend with $3 million. David Oyelowo stars as a detective working to solve the murder of his niece (portrayed by Storm Reid) when he surprisingly gets a phone call from her. \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go\u201d premiered at Sundance under the name \u201cRelive.\u201d\n\nThe final movie to launch this summer is Forrest Film\u2019s drama \u201cBennett\u2019s War,\u201d which is hoping to hit half a million in box office receipts through Monday. Over the weekend, the movie collected $445,151.\n\nLabor Day weekend isn\u2019t usually a busy time of year for moviegoing, so holdovers including Universal\u2019s \u201cGood Boys\u201d and \u201cHobbs & Shaw\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d\n\nUniversal\u2019s \u201cGood Boys\u201d held steady at No. 2, pocketing $9.1 million over the weekend for an estimated $11.5 million Labor Day weekend. After three weeks in theaters, the R-rated comedy has earned a solid $58 million.\n\nDisney\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d nabbed third place, earning $6.7 million during its seventh outing and eyeing $8.8 million through the four-day weekend. Through Sunday, the photorealistic remake has earned $521 million in North America. \u201cThe Lion King\u201d is now the seventh-biggest movie in history with $1.562 billion globally, passing \u201cFurious 7\u201d ($1.516 billion) and \u201cThe Avengers ($1.519 million).\n\nIn fourth, Universal\u2019s \u201cHobbs & Shaw\u201d generated $6.2 million over the weekend and should finish the holiday with $8 million. The \u201cFast & Furious\u201d spinoff, starring Dwayne Wade and Jason Statham, has made $158.86 million at the domestic box office and $684.2 million worldwide.\n\nSony\u2019s \u201cOvercomer\u201d amassed $5.7 million for a fifth-place finish. The faith-based film looks to end Monday with $7.8 million, which would bring North American ticket sales to $19.4 million.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Lionsgate and Millennium's \"Angel Has Fallen\" ruled the box office during an expectedly quiet Labor Day weekend.
