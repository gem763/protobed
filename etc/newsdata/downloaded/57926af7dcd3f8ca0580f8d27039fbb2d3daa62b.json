In 2008, he \"recruited and armed\" a volunteer unit to fight Russian troops in Georgia in 2008, it added.\n\nThe site also said he had joined an anti-terrorist unit in Georgia's interior ministry, while retaining links with Islamists.\n\nAfter surviving two assassination attempts in Georgia, he had spent recent years in Germany, where he had applied for political asylum. Russia has denied involvement in any of the attempts on his life.\n\n- Passport puzzle -\n\nPolice arrested a suspect shortly after the shooting, who had allegedly thrown a stone-laden bag containing his firearm and his getaway electric bicycle into a river.\n\nThey also found a wig they think he wore during the attack, an air ticket for Moscow for the following day and a large sum of cash in his apartment, Der Spiegel reported.\n\nThe joint media investigation named the suspect as 49-year-old Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, a Russian national from Siberia. Police have charged him with murder and are holding him in Berlin.\n\nThe joint media investigation reported that he had travelled to Germany having obtained a visa for France just a day after applying.\n\nWhile he had a valid passport, Bellingcat said they had established that no such person existed in Russia's national citizen database.\n\nThat made Russia's claim that he was not connected to the state implausible, Bellingcat said, as no one outside the state apparatus could get a valid passport using a fake identity.\n\nAn additional troubling element in the case is that the suspect's passport number has been traced back to a unit of the Russian interior ministry which has already in the past delivered identity documents for GRU intelligence.\n\nThe GRU was cited in the case of last year's poisoning in Britain of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, after Bellingcat said it had identified those responsible for that attack came from the military spy agency.\n\nRussia has repeatedly also denied any involvement in that incident.\n\nSpiegel, Bellingcat and The Insider concluded from their investigation that Russian implication in the killing of Khangoshvili was a \"possible scenario\".\n\n- 'Russian hallmark' -\n\nThe media investigation also looked at other potential scenarios.\n\nThey considered a link to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, who has close ties with Russia's president Vladimir Putin -- and \"Chechen Islamists\", who \"might have acted in revenge over rivalries linked to organised crime\" or to the victim's military past.\n\nA German government source told AFP Saturday only that the victim was known to German security officials.\n\nDespite Russian denials, a German security source told Spiegel earlier this week they were \"100-percent certain\" Russia was responsible.\n\nPatrick Sensburg, a lawmaker with the ruling party and a security specialist told Bild daily: \"There are some indications the author of the crime had links with Russian (security) services.\n\n\"If that proves to be the case the question is who is pulling the strings in Moscow.\"\n\nGreen lawmakers are also calling for answers, while a Chechen protest rally is scheduled for Wednesday in Berlin.", "description": "Despite Russian denials, German politicians and media are blaming Moscow for the Berlin assassination of a Georgian who once fought Russian forces in Chechnya, an affair that could spark a diplomatic crisis.
