Imaginative name, we know) is now available to buy.\n\nAs the name gives away, Twirl Orange is a Cadbury Twirl \u2013 so flaked milk chocolate surrounded by more milk chocolate \u2013 with a hint of orange flavour. Think of a Twirl mashed up with a Terry\u2019s Chocolate Orange.\n\nFrom 23 September onwards, Twirl Orange will be available nationwide as the usual 43g two-finger packs, with an RRP of 65p.\n\nBe warned, however, that these are a limited edition item. Cadbury hasn\u2019t given an official timeline of when their orange delights will be snatched from our shelves, but it\u2019s probably worth stocking up just in case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadhika Pai, Brand Manager for Cadbury at Mondelez said: \u2018We are very excited to share Cadbury Twirl Orange with chocolate fans in the UK, especially after seeing all the recent enthusiasm and anticipation for the product.\n\n\u2018Our expert chocolatiers have crafted the perfect blend of delicious Cadbury chocolate and orange. We can\u2019t wait for people to try it for themselves and let us know what they think.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately we can\u2019t see any Twirl Orange bars available online, so you won\u2019t be able to add them to your weekly grocery shop just yet.\n\nWe do know, however, that they\u2019re being stocked by Asda, Morrisons, and Sainsbury\u2019s. Make sure you pop into your local to give the flavour a go.\n\nThe flavour already has fans in Australia, where it\u2019s been sold long before rumours of its launch came to the UK. Australians have described the Twirl as \u2018heaven\u2019, so we expect good things.\n\nIf you like your chocolate with the flavour of orange, you\u2019ll probably like this. Go forth and sample to your heart\u2019s content, free from the hassle of having to order overpriced bars from Ebay.\n\nMORE: How to plant a tree for the Big Climate Fightback\n\nMORE: Fireworking is the latest dating trend to describe your rubbish love life\n\nMORE: What I Rent: Jamie, \u00a3895 a month for a one-bedroom flat in Brighton\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "As the new orange flavour Twirl chocolate bar launches in the UK, where should you go to buy it and how much does it cost?", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/twirl-featured-image-af08_1569939173.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
