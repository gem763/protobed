Because heaven forbid a rapist is mis-gendered?\n\nSix departments, including the South Yorkshire and Thames Valley constabularies, were revealed to have adopted the mind-numbing practice, which allows violent sex offenders to be listed as female in a database used by the Home Office. Durham, Kent, Norfolk and Suffolk police forces, as well as the British Transport Police, are also believed to allow dangerous criminals to define their own gender \u2013 biology or facts be damned.\n\nA women\u2019s rights group, Fair Play for Women (FPW), discovered the bizarre policy after filing a Freedom of Information request.\n\nAlso on rt.com Menstrual health under siege from trans community outraged that physiology isn\u2019t inclusive\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get much more of a male crime than rape,\u201d Nicola Williams, director of FPW, told the Sunday Times. \u201cIt would be highly offensive to a woman who was raped to have it written down that her attacker was a female when clearly that was a male with a penis.\u201d But she\u2019s probably just transphobic.\n\nIn Britain, the legal definition of rape states that the criminal act involves penetrating another person with a penis without their consent \u2013 not exactly something that a female could do. Women accused of sexual violence are charged with different crimes. In layman\u2019s terms: Violent criminals who committed acts that only men can legally carry out can now identify as female, without issue, in several parts of Britain. Who knew that the PC police were a real thing?\n\nFearful of being labeled transphobic or not adequately \u201cwoke,\u201d companies and governments have been pressured into acquiescing to the demands of fringe activists. Sanitary pad manufacturer \u2018Always\u2019 recently announced that it would no longer use the female Venus symbol on its packaging, following complaints that the image was somehow discriminatory.\n\nAlso on rt.com I am a trans woman \u2013 but I think this woke world has gone too far\n\nLike this story?
