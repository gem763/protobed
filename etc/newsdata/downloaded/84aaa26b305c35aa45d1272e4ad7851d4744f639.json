She wrote scripts for Sean Hannity before breaking out as a reporter for National Review. But at Politico, she\u2019s broken stories across the landscape, including the scoop that Jared Kushner had lost his intelligence clearance. She\u2019s also a CNN contributor.\n\nUnlike some of its pro-Trump rivals, the site occupies an ambivalent relationship with the Trump movement. That\u2019s in part because of its roots in a neoconservative wing of the party, many of whose members openly loathe the president, and partly because the Beacon played a role in the prehistory of the legendary Steele dossier, initially hiring the research firm Fusion GPS to research Trump.\n\nIts parody is also, sometimes, misunderstood, as when it crowned the pro-Trump Charlie Kirk 2018\u2019s Man of the Year, with jokes that were largely missed on Twitter. (\u201cIn marked contrast to the effete, wrinkled pundits of the Old Right, Kirk infuses his conservatism with a distinctly millennial panache, deploying edgy memes and viral video clips in the war for America's youth.\u201d)\n\nThe Beacon launched in 2012 as somewhere between a traditional news organization and a high-concept prank, with a promise to \u201ctake the fight to the Left.\u201d Alternately parodic and wire-service serious, it has broken major political news, mostly negative, about Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris , and occasionally members of rival Republican factions, like Rand Paul ; and maintained a drumbeat of national security reporting sympathetic to Israel\u2019s government and hostile to China\u2019s. The Beacon is privately held but has confirmed its backers include the hedge fund figure and Republican megadonor Paul Singer.\n\n\u201cI want to build on the excellent work the Beacon has done and continue to train serious reporters who have a conservative outlook and an irreverent sensibility,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThe focus has been and will continue to be on scoops and original reporting.\u201d\n\nEliana Johnson, whose most recent work includes a hair-raising account of Trump\u2019s visit to Mount Vernon, will take over a staff of 24 from the Beacon\u2019s founding editor, Matthew Continetti.\n\nA leading political reporter is leaving Politico to lead neoconservative flagship the Washington Free Beacon, the latest move in a conservative media world attempting to adjust to the age of President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd Johnson\u2019s move to the Beacon raises a broader question about what the \u2014 conservative? right-wing? pro-Trump? \u2014 media ought to be at a moment when the leader of the American right is openly hostile not just to specific media outlets but also to the notion of agreed-upon facts that underlie partisan disagreements. Though Fox News continues to shape the worldview of its older audience and many of Trump\u2019s voters, the political realignment destabilized traditional outlets like the Weekly Standard, which folded, and National Review, which has limped into Trump\u2019s camp.\n\nMeanwhile, his fierce advocates at Breitbart have lost altitude while the ascendant Daily Caller\u2019s eagerness to channel Trump\u2019s rawest nationalism has produced a steady drumbeat of internal scandals over its infiltration by members of white nationalist extremist organizations. Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire has focused its attention on Trump\u2019s enemies while doing little in the way of original reporting.\n\nAmong all these outlets, there\u2019s an inherited shortage of original reporting. Though the conservative media has long sought to position itself as an alternative to mainstream outlets that focus largely on reporting \u2014 the national daily newspapers, larger digital operations like this one, and CNN \u2014 it has always been more of a critique of that media than an alternative to it. It\u2019s parallel in its structure to the growing corps of left-wing outlets, from the Nation to Jacobin, despite its positioning as an alternative source of reporting. Fox\u2019s tiny news-gathering operation, for instance, is a shadow of CNN\u2019s global reporting corps, and there is no partisan equivalent on any side of mainstream newsrooms like the Wall Street Journal's and the New York Times'. (The Washington Times was founded in 1982 to fill that void, with mixed results.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never reached a critical mass,\u201d said Continetti of the conservative journalism scene. \u201cThe conservatives who come through this farm system of news production that we\u2019ve created are almost inevitably swept up in the larger media \u2014 the ones who are best at reporting or editing and whose primary goal isn\u2019t ideological. They are taken up, and in many ways we celebrate them as success stories.\u201d\n\nThe Beacon\u2019s goal, he said, has always been to use reporting in the service of an end.\n\nThe idea, Continetti said, was to \u201cfind the best conservative journalists who will abide by the canons of journalism \u2014 fact-checking, legal review, calling the subjects of your stories for comment.\u201d\n\nThe Beacon\u2019s decision, he said, was \u201cto write our news stories in the affectless style of the AP, because we don\u2019t want to give our critics any ammunition.\u201d\n\n\u201cConservatives have tended to gravitate toward opinion, and they run the most successful cable news outlet, and they\u2019ve done talk radio very successfully \u2014 but there\u2019s been less interest on the right in doing real, serious reporting,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I think is extremely important \u2014 and fun.\u201d\n\nThe longtime dream on the right of a real corps of reporters, waging an ideological war with the tools of traditional American journalism, has never quite emerged. The founding of the Washington Times probably marked its high-water mark. And the Beacon fills only a tiny part of that gap.\n\nMeanwhile, though, Johnson will have to navigate what she identified in 2017 as the trickiest element of conservative journalism right now: dealing with Donald Trump.\n\nAsked if she thinks the media is unfair to the president, as Trump never stops claiming, she took a long pause.\n\n\u201cI think the media is unfair to the president\u2019s supporters, and at times uncharitable to the president,\u201d she said. \u201cThe media often doesn\u2019t point out that in focus group after focus group, the president\u2019s supporters understand that he lies \u2014 they understand that he\u2019s not telling the truth \u2014 so there are reasons beyond that that they support the president.\u201d", "description": "Eliana Johnson, of Politico now and formerly National Review, will lead the neoconservative outlet.", "authors": ["Ben Smith", "Buzzfeed News Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-09/4/15/campaign_images/eba33d06fa85/a-top-white-house-reporter-is-taking-over-the-was-2-1202-1567611406-0_dblbig.jpg"}
