Fall weather is here.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n(Zsaj via Flickr)\n\nOur lawns are parched. Our air conditioners are tired. And our summer wardrobes are worn out. But, finally, the weather regime has shifted, none too soon, and we can declare summer over and fall arrived.\n\nThe cooler, drier air is streaming into the region as we speak. By Saturday morning, temperatures will dip into the 40s to near 50, the lowest since last April. The change in conditions is sudden, especially considering the persistence of the warmth over the last 4\u00bd months.\n\n\n\nThe forecast from the National Weather Service calls for low temperatures on Saturday morning.\n\nStarting in mid-May, when we declared summer had begun, high temperatures consistently reached the 80s or higher. The statistics tell the story: The heat was relentless:\n\nIt was the seventh-warmest May on record.\n\nThe June-through-August (meteorological summer) period ranked seventh-warmest on record.\n\nSeptember, which reached the 80s and 90s on 25 of 30 days, ranked third-warmest on record.\n\nBetween May and this first week of October, we racked up 62 days at or above 90 degrees, third-most on record (trailing 1980 and 2010, when there were 67 such days).\n\nOn Wednesday this week (Oct. 2), we hit 98 degrees in Washington, our highest October temperature ever recorded.\n\n[Review: Our summer outlook was a failure]\n\nBut we\u2019ve now turned the corner, and, like the flip of a switch, the summerlike 80s and 90s have shut off. The forecast for the next week is for highs in the 60s and 70s:\n\n\n\nWashington's seven-day forecast from the National Weather Service. (WeatherBell.com)\n\nUnlike the hot high-pressure zones that have been parked over the area in recent weeks, the jet stream is set to move faster and take more frequent dips, pushing cool fronts through the region routinely.\n\nOur criteria for declaring summer over is no further risk of a heat wave, or three straight days at or above 90. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ve reached that point. Our average high temperature is now in the low 70s and slips into the 60s in just over a week.\n\nBut we are still likely to have more warm days. It\u2019s common to see some 80-degree weather deep into October, hence the concept of \u201cIndian summer.\u201d\n\n[What is \u2018Indian summer\u2019?]\n\nWe probably won\u2019t hit 90 again, however. The latest Washington has ever hit 90 degrees is Oct. 11, and forecast models over the next 10 days don\u2019t show us getting close. However, in this age of climate warming it would not shock us if, at some point in the future, we see 90-degree weather move later into October.\n\nSince 2015, we\u2019ve issued these end-of-summer declarations, based on the actual weather, rather than calendar definitions. The dates of these declarations have ranged from Sept. 11 to Oct. 12.\n\nThis year\u2019s end-of-summer/start-of-fall declaration lies toward the end of the range.\n\nFor everyone eager to don sweaters and fleeces and enjoy a hot drink on a crisp autumn morning, your time is here. Enjoy. Before too long, the conversation will shift to snow. \u2026", "description": "The forecast, for the next week, is for highs in the 60s and 70s.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "October At Am", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
