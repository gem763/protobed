Weeks after Stephens sent a letter to her employer saying she had \u201cdecided to become the person that my mind already is\u201d and would soon start wearing the uniform marked female, the funeral-home owner fired her. \u201cBecause he was no longer going to represent himself as a man,\u201d her boss would explain, refusing to refer to Stephens by female pronouns. \u201cHe wanted to dress like a woman.\u201d\n\nIn a brief written by the Christian-right legal-advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, Harris Funeral Homes claims that Stephens isn\u2019t covered by civil-rights law because they \u201cwould have responded to a female employee who insisted on dressing as a man while working with grieving families the same way it responded to Stephens.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s oral argument is likely to be the first time the word transgender has been spoken before the mahogany bench, Chase Strangio, one of Stephens\u2019s attorneys at the ACLU, recently wrote, \u201cand when the justices look out from the bench and see my co-counsel and me at counsel table, it may be the first time they have looked at transgender attorneys defending our own existence.\u201d The justices are being asked not only to consider the case of Stephens and the separate cases of two gay men who say they were fired for their sexual orientation, but more broadly to answer the question of whether a person can be fired for being the wrong kind of woman or man.\n\nThat\u2019s already supposed to be illegal. \u201cIn order to excise LGBT people from the protection of civil-rights law, the Trump administration is asking them to roll back sex-discrimination law for everyone,\u201d Strangio told me in an interview. If the court accepts their arguments, Strangio said, \u201cthe enforcement of sex stereotypes in the workplace is lawful as long as it is complementary.\u201d The government, in this view, can police the boundaries of gender as long as it does so for everyone; woe betide the cisgender woman at Harris Funeral Homes whose conduct is unbecoming to a lady.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that legislators in 1964 probably weren\u2019t contemplating cases like these. (According to Gillian Thomas\u2019s Because of Sex, an account of the gender provision of the Civil Rights Act, they were mainly thinking about white supremacy, openly worrying that banning only racial discrimination would give black women more rights than white ones.) But for decades, the highest court has repeatedly allowed that federal ban on gender discrimination to be interpreted more expansively than the most literal meaning at that particular moment. The justices grasped over the years that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination against women, and in 1989, the court agreed that Title VII also protected a cisgender woman who had been fired from Price Waterhouse because she didn\u2019t dress and act as women were expected to. The point of the law, a plurality wrote, was \u201cto strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.\u201d In 1998, no less of a conservative darling than Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority that men who were sexually harassed by men also were covered by the law, because while it was \u201cassuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with,\u201d the law could cover \u201creasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u201d\n\nAs \u201creasonably comparable evils\u201d go, a transgender woman and two gay men\u2019s being fired for their gender identity and sexual orientation is hardly a stretch. The broader principle that the government cannot tell Americans how to be a man and how to be a woman underpinned the 1970s constitutional advocacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who will sit on the other side of the bench Tuesday; that work already helped bolster arguments for marriage equality.\n\nBut Stephens\u2019s opponents purport to be the true feminists. The attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice, who filed a brief supporting the funeral home, claim that making it illegal to fire Aimee Stephens would \u201creduce bodily-privacy protections for everyone, and erode equal opportunities for women and girls.\u201d They raise the fearmongering specter of \u201covernight facilities, showers, restrooms, and locker rooms.\u201d Pseudo-feminist Astroturf groups like the Independent Women\u2019s Forum have claimed that ruling for Stephens would ultimately \u201creduce the number of athletic opportunities for biological women and girls.\u201d (Several legitimate feminist groups, like the National Women\u2019s Law Center and a coalition of anti-violence groups, have filed on behalf of Stephens and the other plaintiffs.) Something called the Women\u2019s Liberation Front, which boasts of \u201cover 500 members,\u201d accuses Stephens of having \u201cbootstrapped\u201d existing law to \u201crevolutionize the legal meaning of \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo-called bootstrapping has, in fact, been the history of how the creaky structures of the law have gradually made room for people historically left out of it. Women would still be lesser creatures under the constitution if Ginsburg hadn\u2019t bootstrapped onto the 14th Amendment, which was written to protect the formerly enslaved. Movements are built on each other, in part out of a recognition of a common purpose (or, at least, a common adversary); the law has often followed, if imperfectly. Had the law not had room to grow, women still could be lawfully fired for being perceived as too aggressive, and all of the oppressions uncovered by Me Too might still be perfectly legal. The women who now believe they can shut the door after themselves may soon find themselves on the wrong side of it.", "description": "This week, the first transgender-discrimination case will reach the high court.
