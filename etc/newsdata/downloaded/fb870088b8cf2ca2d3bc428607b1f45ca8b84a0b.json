Another victim, Ryan McKinlay was killed in the same year as charlotte in a very similar incident.\n\n'The parents have joined with us. We've been to see an MP. We want to bring in a law of some sort, although we know it's going to be an uphill struggle.\n\n'I've emailed, written, and I've actually met with quite a lot of MPs. I'm never, ever going to give up. There's no way.\n\nCharlotte Brown (left) died after Jack Shepherd (right) crashed his speedboat in 2015\n\n'There's a lot of bereaved families out there in the same position as us. We're not the only ones. Anyone who wants to join our voice and become one, that'd be perfect.'\n\nShepherd's trial revealed that anyone can hire a boat for personal use without training or a licence, while it was also not mandatory to wear or carry a life jacket.\n\nThese factors enraged Miss Brown's family who hope to bring in a 'Charlie's law' for waterways to bring in better safety measures for privately rented boats.\n\nMiss Brown's sister Katie Brown added: 'He was able to take out his boat numerous times drunk, speeding, driving recklessly and with only a small fine as a potential consequence because there are no criminal laws.\n\n'It's getting easier to now purchase boats from the internet, which is what he did, and just take them out with no licence.\n\nThe speedboat owned by web designer Jack Shepherd, which crashed in the Thames in 2015\n\n'When there's no law, there's no deterrent, and it's very difficult to hold that person accountable if there's something that happens.'\n\nSpeaking about her sister, Katie added: 'She was so funny and loving, she was passionate, do anything for her friends and family. Life isn't the same without her.\n\n'But we need to let her legacy live on and make a change, so that hopefully this would be much less likely to happen if those laws were in place.'\n\nIn June, Miss Brown's family were left furious after Shepherd was let off his six-month sentence for going on the run, with it being quashed on a technicality.\n\nMiss Brown's family (left to right) father Graham Brown, sister Katie and mother Roz Wicken arrive at the Old Bailey in London for Shepherd's manslaughter trial in July 2018\n\nHe had gone on the run for ten months to start a new life in Georgia, yet claimed that the trial he dodged had been a miscarriage of justice.\n\nHis manslaughter conviction was upheld, but his appeal against the bail offence was successful because of a paperwork blunder by the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nMarried father-of-one Shepherd, who is originally from Exeter, ran away in March 2018 ahead of his July trial which took place in his absence.\n\nWhile British taxpayers funded his defence via legal aid, the fugitive was living it up Georgia, earning cash as a web designer, wooing a new girlfriend and learning to ski.\n\nShepherd is led to a police van in Georgia after ten months on the run from the UK in April\n\nWhen he was hauled back from Georgia - after the Daily Mail flushed him out of his hideaway in January - he appeared at the Old Bailey and admitted skipping bail.\n\nHe had two months taken off his sentence for pleading guilty - meaning he was handed just six months, on top of his six year manslaughter sentence.\n\nHowever, this decision was overturned after his lawyers argued the Old Bailey did not have the proper 'jurisdiction' to convict him.\n\nTo further complicate matters, Shepherd is also serving four years for glassing a hotel barman in Devon, on the night before he fled the UK.", "description": "Charlotte Brown, 24, of Clacton, Essex, died after Jack Shepherd's speedboat crashed and capsized on a champagne-fuelled night on the Thames in London in December 2015.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19682256-0-image-a-8_1571042563037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
