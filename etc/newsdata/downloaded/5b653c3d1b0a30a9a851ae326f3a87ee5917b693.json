John Bel Edwards on Monday.\n\nDonald Trump, Jr., and Kimberly Guilfoyle appeared together Monday to support the GOP candidates Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) and Eddie Rispone, ahead of President Trump\u2019s upcoming Friday night rally in Louisiana.\n\nAt the Monday afternoon event there were upwards of 600 people, a capacity crowd.\n\nCrowd with Signs at Louisiana Rally, Photo Courtesy of Louisiana GOP\n\nBut American Bridge took a misleading photo\u2014from hours before the event started\u2014to suggest that the Trump, Jr., rally did not have a big crowd and somehow Republicans were worried.\n\nObviously, these photos are not an accurate representation of the crowd size given the fact that the photos above it show a much bigger crowd for the president\u2019s son and for the GOP candidates for governor. Edwards has had a close relationship with this misleading leftist organization and has regularly retweeted its staffers\u2019 commentary.\n\nTrump, Jr.\u2019s team and Abraham\u2019s team were quick to rip the leftist organization for the misleading images.\n\n\u201cWhile the frauds at American Bridge posted pictures of an empty room before the rally even began, the pics we provided prove that the event drew an overflow crowd of over 600 people for a midday Monday rally,\u201d Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. \u201cAfter getting caught red-handed knowingly lying about this, how can anyone in the media ever trust anything from American Bridge again?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf American Bridge spent as much money on research as their founder David Brock spends on cocaine, they might not make mistakes like this,\u201d GOP strategist Arthur Schwartz, who is close with the first family, added \u2013 a reference to the American Bridge founder\u2019s reported drug problems.\n\n\u201cThis is another pathetic lie against President Trump from a failed and desperate Governor,\u201d Abraham added. \u201cJohn Bel Edwards is no different than the radicals in his party, who will stop at nothing to impeach President Trump. That\u2019s why Louisiana will re-elect Donald Trump in 2020 and fire John Bel Edwards in 2019. I can\u2019t wait to work with President Trump to make Louisiana win.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump heads to Louisiana on Friday night for a rally with the GOP candidates. Saturday is Louisiana\u2019s jungle primary, and assuming the Democrat Edwards stays under 50 percent on Saturday, it will go to a runoff between either Abraham or Rispone\u2014whoever finishes in second place\u2014and Edwards. Early voting wrapped this past Saturday with a massive surge in GOP turnout and a much smaller increase in Democrat turnout, a sign Edwards may be headed for trouble on Saturday if Republicans turn out in force in Louisiana this weekend.", "description": "Leftist group American Bridge, lied about the crowd size at a Donald Trump, Jr. campaign event in Louisiana Monday.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Crowd-from-Behind-Louisiana-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
