This time I plan on doing great until it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAnderson admits he\u2019s heading into the contest with a sizable chip on his shoulder after being told by the UFC higher-ups that his name doesn\u2019t move the promotional needle, and that his lack of star power is holding him back.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Hunter Campbell and he said the needle didn\u2019t move when they say my name, that\u2019s when the chip sat and that\u2019s when it got heavy \u2013 a burden on my back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of a burden through camp, though, because I\u2019m using it as fuel. They want a dog. That\u2019s what they want. So that\u2019s what they\u2019ve got.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to go out there and be reckless, but I\u2019m happy to go out there and kill somebody for me to get respect. And if he dies, he dies. It is what it is.\u201d\n\nThe comments clearly irked Anderson, who said his resume warrants a bigger promotional push \u2013 and more respect \u2013 than he feels he\u2019s receiving right now.\n\n\u201cI definitely took offense to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI come from a place in a wrestling background, where if you beat the top guys, you\u2019re the top guy. You beat the No. 3 guy, you\u2019re No. 3. You beat No. 2, you\u2019re No. 2. And next is you work your way up to the title.\n\n\u201cI beat those top guys. I beat the No. 4, I beat the No. 3. I (expletive) mauled the guy that\u2019s ranked third right now when I first got in the UFC and he turned down the rematch because he doesn\u2019t want to lose again. So why am I getting punished to go back? Then when he said, \u2018Well, the needle doesn\u2019t move when we say your name. There\u2019s no doubt about it, you\u2019ll probably be the toughest fight for Jon Jones because you\u2019ve got the cardio, the wrestling and the striking. But the needle doesn\u2019t move when we say your name, and we\u2019re in the business of making money.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere is a way to change it, but I accept the fact that I am who I am. I don\u2019t mind not having a big following. I mind the fact that I\u2019m being disrespected and they\u2019re trying to keep me away from the title, but I don\u2019t mind the fact that I don\u2019t have the following that they want me to have. I say all the time, that\u2019s fake friends. Fake friends and fake fans. The 50,000 followers I have now is because they follow me, they\u2019ve seen me, they\u2019ve met me, I\u2019ve done something to entice them (to thinking), \u2018This is a good guy. This is a genuine, good guy. I want to follow this guy because he\u2019s 100 percent. He\u2019s as real as it comes. He\u2019s not fake.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Jon Jones whistling Dixie: \u2018Oh I\u2019m a great Christian man. This, this and this,\u2019 then get caught in a strip club and get in an accident drunk, smoking weed. I\u2019m not Conor McGregor: \u2018I\u2019m the people\u2019s champ,\u2019 then go and punch an old man at the bar. That\u2019s the stuff they like, the controversy. Just like our season of \u2018The Ultimate Fighter.\u2019 It ranked the lowest because there was no drama. That\u2019s what the people like. This is a world full of drama. Everybody wants someone to talk about. Everybody wants to be gossip girls, and they want to be Internet trolls. If you don\u2019t give them that, they don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nAnderson faces Walker, a wild Brazilian striker whose UFC tenure to date has been highlighted by three back-to-back first-round finishes. But while the MMA world appears excited to see how Walker will fare against a top-level wrestler, Anderson himself says the recency bias with regard to Walker\u2019s performances is clouding reality somewhat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hyped, he\u2019s exciting, he\u2019s flashy and people like him because he\u2019s exciting. And I think Jimi Manuwa was the one that said it \u2013 MMA fans\u2019 memories are short-lived.\n\n\u201cIf y\u2019all look and research, the man\u2019s been knocked out from one punch in two fights. He\u2019s been choked out by a guy who\u2019s just got in the UFC. And he fought Henrique da Silva, who was 2-4 in the UFC, and went to the judges\u2019 cards. You all got short memories. They\u2019re casuals. They see what they hype up. I blame the UFC.\n\n\u201cI posted the other day (about) the fighter I demolished, Jan Blachowicz. That was my third fight in the UFC, and I killed him. He made a post saying, \u2018I have to go home and rethink my life.\u2019 Not \u2018my career\u2019 \u2013 \u2018my life.\u2019 But nobody knows that I fought Jan Blachowicz. Why? Because it was a decision. If I\u2019d have finished him in the first round, they would have hyped the (expletive) out of it. That\u2019s just the way it is. It\u2019s time for me to go out and do the same thing to Johnny. But they\u2019ll just stop talking about him and they still won\u2019t talk about me.\u201d\n\nWith Anderson believing that his lack of controversy and lack of social media followers is key to his lack of title opportunities so far, he said the task in front of him now is a simple one, though he said he won\u2019t change who he is just to get a title shot.\n\n\u201cI came to terms with the fact that I\u2019ve gotta go out and kill everyone else in the division,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first I had that chip on my shoulder, I deserved this, I earned this. But in this life you don\u2019t get what you earned anymore, you get what you take and if I\u2019ve got to go out there and take it from everybody, it is what it is.\u201d", "description": "UFC contender Corey Anderson says he may not win the UFC's popularity contest, but he will prove he's worthy of a title shot after UFC 244.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "George Garcia", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/corey-anderson-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
