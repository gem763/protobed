(Google Maps)\n\nTrask had been in the live-in treatment program for a year. Before that, she lived in another facility three hours away in the Comox Valley following program cuts, she said.\n\nThe senior has no ID \u2014 it was stolen \u2014and no family that can help. She often doesn't take the mood-stabilizing medications she needs.\n\nBeen wronged and you're not the only one? Contact our Go Public team\n\nShe's been sleeping in homeless shelters and tents hidden in Victoria public parks since being evicted from the live-in treatment program last spring.\n\nBegged to stay\n\nWhile Vancouver Island Health's motto is, \"Excellent health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time,\" spokesperson Cheryl Bloxham told Go Public the health authority does discharge mentally ill people into emergency shelters \"as a last resort.\"\n\nShe said involuntary discharges are rare but that there is no database tracking exact numbers.\n\nBloxham wouldn't comment on Trask's case, citing confidentiality rules, but said Island Health ensures those who are discharged and willing to participate in treatment programs continue to have access to mental health and substance-use services.\n\nTrask says she was willing to participate, even begged to stay.\n\nTrask is part of a broken system lacking housing and treatment facilities that can result in people with mental illness being put out onto the street, where their condition deteriorates, according to Jino Distasio, a researcher who has studied how to house people with mental health challenges.\n\nJino Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg, was part of a study showing the most important requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing. (Gary Solilak/CBC)\n\n\"Dumping people onto the streets or into the shelter networks [is] everything we've been trying to undo over the last decade,\" he said.\n\nThat adds pressure on overburdened emergency services across the country.\n\nRats 'running all over her body'\n\nTrask found an advocate in Carolina Tudela \u2014 a volunteer for a homeless drop-in centre \u2014 after she called in, asking for help dealing with rats that had entered her tent.\n\n\"It was overrun for sure. They were running all over her body when I found her,\" said Tudela.\n\nTudela picked Trask up and drove her around that June night, offering to pay for a hotel, but she couldn't get her a room because Trask had no identification.\n\nTrask ended up going back to her tent that night.\n\n\"What outrages me is the indifference and callousness,\" Tudela told Go Public. \"That somebody can just be kicked out of a program like that \u2026 with nowhere to go. Just 'Good luck.'\"\n\nTrask, left, and Carolina Tudela, a volunteer at a Victoria homeless shelter, became acquainted when Trask contacted the shelter, asking for help with the rats that had entered her tent. (Mike McArthur/CBC)\n\nIn September, police confiscated Trask's tent after finding it in a public park, leaving her to sleep on mats on the floors of homeless shelters or outdoors on church steps.\n\nShe says she was surrounded by violence. Now, she's back at a park in another tent belonging to another homeless person, hoping this one is hidden far enough from public view that it won't be confiscated.\n\nTudela wrote to the provincial health authority and the B.C. government in August, asking them to help Trask.\n\nShe says no one responded.\n\nHousing key to improving mental health: study\n\nAlthough the eviction letter said Trask had been verbally aggressive and threatening, her advocate says Trask is \"a very frail woman.\"\n\n\"She's all about 110 pounds,\" Tudela said. \"She lives in constant fear she'll be kicked out of the tent she's got or that she's going to be raped at night. She lives in constant fear of harm.\"\n\nMental health experts estimate that 35,000 people are homeless in Canada on any given night \u2014 and of those, approximately 15 per cent suffer from mental illness.\n\n\"There's just no way in a country like Canada that we should have this many people on any given night struggling with shelter,\" said Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg.\n\nHe says the reasons given for Trask's eviction are common challenges when treating people with certain mental health issues.\n\nHe worked on one of the largest mental health services trials ever conducted in Canada, called At Home/Chez Soi (AHCS), and says leaving patients with no place to live and no access to treatment goes against the study's findings.\n\nThe AHCS study he co-authored followed more than 2,000 participants for two years with test sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, N.B.\n\nIt found that the most important requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing.\n\nThe study, published Oct. 7, is considered the longest-running of its kind using the Housing First model, which is believed to significantly reduce homelessness over the long term.\n\nWATCH | Judy Trask shows housing advocate Carolina Tudela her tent in a Victoria park:\n\nThis is Judy's second tent since her March eviction; the first was taken away by police 0:16\n\nWithout stable housing, Distasio says, patients' mental health deteriorates, putting more pressure on the emergency services everyone uses and pays for.\n\n\"Overuse of ERs, emergency services, police, fire, ambulance. It's a cascade of services and supports to address these individuals,\" Distasio told Go Public.\n\n'The coldness of it all'\n\nGo Public put Trask's situation to Canada's first provincial minister of mental health and addictions, British Columbia's Judy Darcy, who admits the system is broken.\n\n\"For years, many people in B.C. have been struggling to navigate a fragmented and unco-ordinated mental health and addictions system of care,\" Darcy said in an email to Go Public. \"Our government is working to change this.\"\n\nDarcy says the B.C. government plans to build 2,200 affordable housing units and expand access to mental health and addictions programs. Advocates say other provinces need to follow suit.\n\nAs for Trask, she remains homeless. Tudela regularly checks on her friend and says she's worried about what might happen to her living on the street.\n\n\"You know the program is not working when you throw people out on the street. I mean, this is a senior citizen. Judy has mental health problems,\" says Tudela. \"The system is broken \u2026 I don't understand the coldness of it all.\"", "description": "A 65-year-old B.C. woman says she was discharged from her residential mental health program against her will and has been homeless and without treatment since March.", "authors": ["Rosa Marchitelli Is A National Award Winner For Her Investigative Work.
