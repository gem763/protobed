Additionally, individuals will be able to cultivate two cannabis plants \u2013 with a maximum of four per household \u2013 for personal use. Possession of more than 50g of the drug, or cultivation of more than four plants, will remain illegal.\n\nUnfortunately for those who are contemplating a highly technical hydroponics setup, this is not permitted by the legislation. Amendments proposed by the Greens which would allow hydroponic cannabis were voted down as were amendments allowing greater allowances for those with medical cannabis needs.\n\nThe bill does not affect Commonwealth laws regarding the buying and selling of cannabis. It remains a prohibited substance under Commonwealth law, and police officers in the ACT will be able to arrest and charge anyone possessing cannabis under those laws.\n\nAs with the ACT\u2019s attempt to legalise same-sex marriage in 2013, the Commonwealth government could seek to strike out these laws if it deems them incompatible with federal legislation.\n\nThe bill\u2019s authors assert that it seeks to \u201cbring cannabis laws more in line with modern community standards and reflect global trends\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe bill will reduce the burden on our criminal justice system and bring us a step closer to a cannabis market,\u201d it reads.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
