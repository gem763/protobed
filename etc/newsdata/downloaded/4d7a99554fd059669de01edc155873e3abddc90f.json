Polls show that health care is a top issue for swing voters, but Democrats currently have the edge and Obamacare is polling at all-time highs.\n\nTrump promised in this year's State of the Union address to wipe out HIV transmission in the United States in a decade. At campaign rallies since then, he\u2019s promised to lower drug costs, end the opioid epidemic and even cure childhood cancer. He\u2019s rolled out a plan to overhaul kidney care for hundreds of thousands of Americans on dialysis and waiting for life-saving transplants. And now he\u2019s taking on the rapidly worsening epidemic of youth vaping.\n\n\u201cWhen people say, \u2018What\u2019s the plan?\u2019 We\u2019ve done so much,\u201d said Brian Blase, a former special assistant to Trump who worked on alternatives to Obamacare coverage before leaving the White House this summer. \u201cThere\u2019s already been a lot of profound actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs President Trump has said, 'The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Matthews, the Trump campaign\u2019s deputy press secretary. \u201cThe 2020 Democrat field is embracing a government takeover of health care that would eliminate private insurance, increase wait times and decrease quality of care.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s initiatives have received qualified support from Democrats and public health experts. But Democrats are flabbergasted by the White House efforts to paint Trump as President Health Care. They may like his kidney plan but can\u2019t get past his persistent efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, institute the first work requirements in Medicaid history, roll back benefits for legal immigrants and abolish historic LGBTQ patient protections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Orwellian. It\u2019s like two plus two is five,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse, a longtime Democratic strategist who works with Protect Our Care, a pro-Obamacare advocacy group. \u201cWe think he\u2019s been the leading general in the war on health care.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Keep attacking Obamacare for the base, while carefully constructing a more comforting health care narrative for the center.\n\nThe dramatic vaping move was the latest example. Trump on Wednesday abruptly summoned reporters to the Oval Office and announced a sweeping ban on flavored e-cigarettes, amid a growing epidemic of teen vaping. His administration is also preparing to unveil additional efforts this fall on opioids, rural health and health care price transparency, four officials told POLITICO. That may not divert all the attention from the president\u2019s often inflammatory tweets and gibes, but it creates a parallel channel of conversation.\n\nRepublicans also believe the Democratic tilt left on health care, particularly the Sen. Bernie Sanders-inspired promises of free \"Medicare for All,\" will play right into Trump\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the grandiose leftist, socialist dreams of the Democratic Party. All those fantasy programs would bankrupt the country,\u201d said a senior administration official who's active on the health care front. By working on specific diseases and health issues, \u201cwe\u2019re really building a very strong narrative around this president and this administration.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, White House officials maintain that the media and health analysts are paying undue attention to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 even though Trump himself keeps attacking the law, including lashing out at his late nemesis Sen. John McCain for blocking Obamacare repeal two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe frame of reference is all around the ACA \u2014 but the individual market is a tiny slice of the full health care marketplace,\u201d the senior official said.\n\nObamacare \u2014 which includes Medicaid expansion, patient protections and health system reforms that affect far many more people than the roughly 10 million people in the law's individual market \u2014 could again dominate the election season. A federal appeals court could strike down part or all of the health care law this fall, as Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has urged it to do.\n\nThat could mean the Supreme Court again takes up an Obamacare case during an election year. Trump has repeatedly vowed to have an Obamacare replacement plan ready \u2014 though several officials said that won't happen this month, as Trump had suggested.\n\nPolling analysts told POLITICO that Trump faces an uphill battle on winning swing voters over to his health care agenda.\n\n\u201cRecent polling data has found that health care is not an issue that seems to be working for President Trump for both the overall public and a crucial group of swing voters in the upcoming 2020 election,\u201d said Ashley Kirzinger of Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAccording to Kaiser\u2019s polls, 50 percent of swing voters said that health care makes them more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate in 2020 compared with just 32 percent who said they were more likely to support Trump. Democrats\u2019 18-point advantage on health care in Kaiser\u2019s polls is ahead of other hot-button issues like immigration, trade and gun policy, where Democrats hold only a narrow advantage or trail the president.\n\nTrump also has repeatedly stepped on his own message with off-script comments that have gone viral and overshadowed the actual initiatives he was announcing. The president in July proclaimed that kidneys have \u201ca very special place in the heart,\u201d contributing to media coverage that Trump publicly grumbled about later that week. His vaping remarks, in which he seemed to describe his teenage son as the first lady\u2019s child, not the first couple\u2019s, didn\u2019t go unnoticed, either. He interjected that 13-year-old Barron was their child \"together.\u201d\n\nTrump still has more than a year to polish his health care record before the 2020 election, and senior officials have repeatedly met with Democrats in search of an elusive deal to lower drug prices.\n\nThe president already has celebrated what he said was the first decline in U.S. drug prices in around 50 years, although his claim has been largely debunked by fact checkers because it draws on incomplete data that leaves out some of the priciest medications. A forthcoming plan from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could pressure Trump to either plow ahead with, or retreat from, a campaign pledge to support direct negotiations with drugmakers, a longtime Democratic priority that Republicans have fiercely opposed.\n\nAdministration officials also have vowed to combat surprise medical bills, a priority broadly opposed by the health care industry but being considered by multiple congressional committees.\n\nBut as the election approaches, Democrats are under some pressure to block some of Trump's health care initiatives, or at least counter with their own, rather than help burnish his image.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not enamored with the idea that Democrats should be negotiating with him on prescription drugs,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cCan you trust him not to pull the rug out from under you at the end of the day?\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s Orwellian,\u201d says one Democratic strategist.", "authors": ["Joanne Kenen", "Dan Diamond"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/be/fa/17175b2247ba8b8f8392b2252aa4/190912-trump-ap-773.jpg"}
