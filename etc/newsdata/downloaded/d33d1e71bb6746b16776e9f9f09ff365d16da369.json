Disruptions from strong storms last month also contributed to it, Zhu Hong, an economist with the bureau, said in a statement. For the first eight months, industrial profits declined 1.7% on year, the bureau said.\n\nChina's producer prices fell further into deflation last month, piling pressure on manufacturers that had been struggling with the prolonged trade war between China and the U.S., official data showed earlier. Meanwhile, value-added industrial output grew at the slowest pace in more than a decade, underscoring sluggish demand and soft business confidence, the bureau said.\n\nTokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.3% as a long-dreaded Oct. 1 hike in Japan's sales tax to 10% from the current 8% loomed.\n\nMany stocks in the Nikkei also went ex-dividend on Friday, which is accounted for a good portion of the index's decline, according to analysts. Kansai Electric Power (9503.TO) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.TO) fell, while Japan Display (6740.TO) slid after it said a key investor wanted to pull out of the bailout plan.\n\nThe Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3%, while Seoul's Kospi dropped 1.3%, dragged down by large-cap technology shares. Despite renewed hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal, U.S. political uncertainty caused by an impeachment inquiry into President Trump weighs on investor sentiment, which could prompt profit-taking on recent gains, a KB Securities analyst said.\n\nSydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.4%.\n\nTraders were encouraged by a Chinese Commerce Ministry announcement that importers had agreed to buy U.S. soybeans as the two sides make conciliatory gestures ahead of trade talks. That followed an earlier decision to list punitive tariffs on soybeans, the biggest Chinese import from the United States.\n\nPlans to go ahead with negotiations next month have helped to ease market jitters but there has been no sign of progress toward resolving the bruising tariff war over trade and technology.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.2% to 2,977.62 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.3% to 26,891.12. The Nasdaq dropped 0.6% to 8,030.66.\n\nWhile many analysts say the Trump probe isn't likely to affect the market significantly, it does add a degree of uncertainty and could complicate the White House's efforts to resolve trade disputes with China and other nations.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude lost 31 cents to $56.11 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gave up 8 cents to $56.41 on Thursday. Brent crude , used to price international oils, fell 60 cents to $61.18 per barrel in London. It retreated 31 cents the previous session to $61.74.\n\nThe dollar declined to 107.67 yen from Thursday's 107.83 yen. The euro rose to $1.0922 from $1.0920.\n\nThis story was compiled from Dow Jones Newswires and Associated Press reports.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 01:17 ET (05:17 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
