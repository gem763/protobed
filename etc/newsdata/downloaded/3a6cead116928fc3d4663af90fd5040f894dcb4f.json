I\u2019m serious!\u201d\n\nAsher-Smith had been installed as the poster girl for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics before adding relay silver to her 200 metres gold and 100m silver on Saturday night.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd few will argue with the choice of world athletics boss Seb Coe given the way the 23-year-old backed up her triple gold medal-winning performance at last year\u2019s Europeans.\n\nAlready second favourite behind Ben Stokes for SPOTY, she is going to be in high demand in the nine months between now and flying to Japan.\n\nBut she pledged: \u201cI will keep being me. If that means great things happen then they do, if it doesn\u2019t then hey-ho. I have always been about running fast.\n\n\u201cI have mixed emotions about my profile going up. I am not one to be like, \u2018look at me\u2019, I am not that kind of person who is \u201clook at this, look at that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the things that I\u2019ve had to get used to, the extra attention, people wanting selfies when I am warming up. But that is not why I came into the sport.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I like to run and I want to keep doing that and having fun. Keep being me on the track. That means eye liner, lipsticks, scrunchies, smiling and being clumsy!\u201d\n\nAsher-Smith paid tribute to team mates Asha Phillip, Ashleigh Nelson and Daryl Neita, without whom her third medal of the week would not have been possible.\n\nThese are all experienced athletes who will keep their friend grounded and, anyway, Asher-Smith is savvy enough to work out that if she gets distracted from her day job, the trapping will quickly melt away.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI know you only get this platform because you are running fast and successful,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019m very clear that you have to keep doing that.\u201d\n\nAthletics owes her a debt of gratitude for sprinkling stardust on an event beset by its fair share of problems - from tiny crowds early on, to extreme weather conditions, to the Salazar doping scandal.\n\nThe British team were relieved to have her too given that otherwise they would have got nowhere near the \u2018minimum\u2019 medal target, set by UK Sport, of seven.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nDespite falling two short, team captain Richard Kilty claimed they can confidently expect to win \u201c10 to 12\u201d at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s got to be the target,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not being ambitious.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI will keep being me.
