Watercolor and gouache on tea-stained paper (Image Courtesy of the James Prosek and Waqas Wajahat, New York)\n\nAs a college junior, he wrote an illustrated history of trout \u2014 and he\u2019s been an outside-the-box artist ever since.\n\nJames Prosek (b. 1975) is the Audubon of fish. John James Audubon\u2019s The Birds of America, published between 1827 and 1838, is an amalgam of science and art. Audubon\u2019s renderings of hundreds of birds, mostly in watercolor, were elegantly engraved in volumes that informed ornithology for generations. The art\u2019s gorgeous and cinematic. Whenever I see an Audubon bird, I think of close-ups of movie stars. For most of his career, and he\u2019s a mid-generation artist, Prosek has done the same thing with fish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsek is a modern man. He\u2019s a fascinating, fine artist but a master of today\u2019s media. He makes documentaries, writes, teaches, and promotes conservation initiatives. A few years ago, he retraced the first book on fishing, The Compleat Angler, written by Issak Walton in 1653. His documentary on Walton is unusually good.\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about outside-the-box artists off and on all year. Angela Lorenz makes artist\u2019s books. Sheila Hicks is a textile sculptor. Henri Broyard is a young African-American painter. I planned to write about Prosek this month, mostly because he defies boundaries and thinks about art and science. Then, Harold Bloom died last week. Prosek and I were Bloom students at Yale, though of different generations. Bloom taught me about Shelley, Southey, Byron, and Wordsworth.\n\nBloom called Prosek \u201can original.\u201d He thought Prosek was the best artist of his \u2014 Bloom\u2019s \u2014 era. What did he mean?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt starts with trout. Prosek wrote his first book, Trout: An Illustrated History, in 1996, when he was a junior at Yale. He painted the book\u2019s watercolor illustrations of 70 types of North American trout and researched and wrote this first study of trout. Prosek always loved fishing. He learned as a ten-year-old that there wasn\u2019t a book on the trout of North America. Over the next ten years, he produced one. He was surprised at the differences of opinion existing among freshwater and marine biologists over which fish were trouts. They weren\u2019t turgid, manic differences. To him, they showed deeply informed men and women bumping up against nature\u2019s inscrutability. He started to question regimes of classification. I think that appealed the most to Bloom. He wasn\u2019t into regimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think fishing is the most boring thing in the world, notwithstanding the branch of the Battenkill River, our country\u2019s best site for trout fishing, that runs through my land in Vermont. That said, the watercolors are beautiful. Prosek commanded a rainbow palette \u2014 among his subjects are rainbow trout \u2014 but he also has a command of texture. These fish look wet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got the book, I thought, \u201cIs this guy a still-life painter or a seascapist or a pathologist or a taxidermist?\u201d He\u2019s all of the above, and more. He can\u2019t be classified. Indeed, he\u2019s against classification, and so was Bloom. Bloom\u2019s famous today for advocating a canon of great books on Western culture \u2014 a classification of books worth reading \u2014 but he was a scholar of romantic poetry. He taught me the wildness of these poets. They were intellectually feral. They were deeply curious about nature. They loved its unpredictability. They weren\u2019t much into beauty. They were into the sublime.\n\nSince Trout: An Illustrated History, he\u2019s written and illustrated books on ocean fish and eels. The art for the eel book is, because of the subject, an aesthetic collision of the linear with the asymmetrical but then an alliance. There\u2019s method to the madness \u2014 eels are among earth\u2019s oldest creatures, so they\u2019ve got something going for them in both the durability and management departments \u2014 but Prosek is a fine abstract artist. I look at the eel pictures with wonder for their energy but also their simple palette of black and gray.\n\nProsek depicts animals and birds, too. The birds are usually silhouettes, one of art\u2019s most beguiling and reductive media. His animals have an Edwardian opulence, with lots of big, spotted, and lethal cats and armor-plated critters. There\u2019s no doubting their presence and authority, but they\u2019re not exactly wild. They\u2019re illustrative. Prosek places his big animals in an ordered network of branches with a sprinkling of bird silhouettes. Like his silhouettes, they\u2019re profiles. They\u2019re encyclopedia entries. That\u2019s how we make sense of the world.\n\nProsek\u2019s work is about classification. Not its dangers \u2014 he\u2019s the furthest thing from an outrage pimp \u2014 but its irrelevance. An obsession with putting things in groups denies the messiness of life. Prosek\u2019s eels have the right idea. They\u2019re going in a million different directions. The only thing we can know for certain is nature\u2019s willfulness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has a new show opening soon at the Yale University Art Gallery \u2014 Yale\u2019s first show combining things from the art galleries on campus and the Peabody Museum, Yale\u2019s anthropological and biological museum. Prosek\u2019s show is about nature\u2019s incessant creativity, pushing and pulling always to make something new. We can never understand nature\u2019s aesthetics, but Prosek is always thinking about it.\n\nI was \u2014 and then wasn\u2019t \u2014 surprised to see Prosek\u2019s work in a place of pride at the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition in 2018. The British ceramic artist Grayson Perry headed the committee selecting the art to be displayed. Perry is a very good artist, and I loved the show. I wrote about it for NR. It\u2019s the oldest contemporary art show in the world, and 2018 was its 250th anniversary. It\u2019s rare for an American artist to get work in the show since it\u2019s almost entirely British artists. I was proud to see the American Prosek prominently featured. His two tiger pictures looked great.\n\nWith over a thousand works of art in the Royal Academy show, I focused on other things in my story. Months passed, and I started to write a piece on Prosek a couple of weeks ago. Then, Bloom died. I remembered \u2014 a good art historian has thousands of pictures filed away in his head \u2014 that Perry had put Prosek\u2019s work in the 250th Royal Academy show.\n\nPerry\u2019s a potter. Pottery is an ancient art. It\u2019s what I call \u201cUr-Art,\u201d a medium as old as humanity. Painting is at the top of the art-history and art-market hierarchy, so Perry is an outsider. He\u2019s freewheeling. Perry\u2019s a cross-dresser, and while Prosek and I are more likely to shop in the men\u2019s department at Brooks Brothers, in art Perry and Prosek don\u2019t just challenge the conventional. They ignore it. I also remembered that Perry had placed Prosek\u2019s work next to Sonia Lawson\u2019s portrait of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the wildest of the Romantics. I don\u2019t know whether Bloom saw the show. I think it would have confirmed his thinking about Prosek. He\u2019s an original.", "description": "James Prosek commanded a rainbow palette in his paintings -- among his subjects are rainbow trout -- but he also has a command of texture.
