Memorials in Chinatown this week marked the spots where four homeless men were killed Saturday, their heads smashed while they slept by an attacker wielding a metal bar.\n\nBut something else was left at the sites. Fresh boxes of hot pizza were stacked at each memorial. And with them, a note. \u201cI wish with all my heart,\u201d it read, \u201cthat I could have been there at that very moment to protect all of you guys.\u201d\n\nThe author added, \u201cyou know me as the pizza guy.\u201d Then he revealed something from his own past: \u201cAs a former homeless man, I know the struggle that all of you guys went through every day.\u201d\n\nThe pizzas and notes came from Hakki Akdeniz, a 39-year-old immigrant who has built a small chain of pizza shops in the city and, with it, something of an unofficial, but solid, support network for the homeless in Manhattan. His visits to the memorials this week, each time lugging a stack of pizzas that reached his chin, follow a remarkable journey even in a city built on rags-to-riches tales.\n\nAkdeniz is Kurdish, was raised in Turkey and emigrated to Canada as a young man. Back in Turkey, he had worked in cafes making lahmacun, flattened dough topped with spiced meat, and he aspired to make its Western cousin, pizza, in the United States.\n\nHakki Akdeniz at one of his seven Champion Pizza locations, in Manhattan. More\n\nHe arrived by bus in New York in 2001 with $240 in his pocket and a promise of a bed at a friend\u2019s apartment. When the friend changed his mind, Akdeniz moved into a dingy motel on 42nd Street and watched his meager savings dribble away at $30 a night.\n\nBroke, he spent a few nights huddled with his bags in Grand Central Terminal. Someone pointed him to the Bowery Mission, one of the city\u2019s most well-known homeless shelters, in the heart of the city\u2019s skid row.\n\n\u201cI stayed there for 96 nights,\u201d Akdeniz said. He busied himself in the kitchen, chopping onions and washing dishes, and he looked for work making pizza. His English was poor. He noticed a woman at the mission reading a Turkish language newspaper, and she helped him find a listing for a job at a Mediterranean pizza shop in Hoboken, New Jersey, near the PATH station.\n\nHe showed up in New Jersey in unwashed clothes. The owner was skeptical. \u201cHe thought I was so dirty, unclean,\u201d recalled Akdeniz. Desperate, he asked, \u201cCan I make a pizza?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was shaking, so nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came out no good. I said, \u2018Can I make another one?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter a few failed attempts, the owner hired him \u2014 to wash dishes. That night Akdeniz slept on a bench across from the restaurant, returning early the next day. The next night, he slept in the basement of the pizza shop\u2019s building.\n\nLater that week, the cook gave him a tip. There was a building in Sunnyside, Queens, where the super had an assistant who did odd jobs and lived rent-free in the basement. The assistant was looking for an assistant \u2014 same perks. \u201cThe boiler room, you can sleep in the corner,\u201d Akdeniz was told.\n\nA year later, he had saved enough to move into an apartment with a roommate. He got a new job in early 2003 washing dishes at a restaurant on Ninth Avenue in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. On St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the regular pizza maker didn\u2019t show up to work, and Akdeniz was promoted on the spot.", "description": "NEW YORK -- Candles, flowers and handwritten tributes flow onto the sidewalk like surf filling a void in the sand, replacing the body just taken away.
