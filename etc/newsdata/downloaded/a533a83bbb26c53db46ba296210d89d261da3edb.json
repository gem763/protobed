(Photo: Disney)\n\nA new fan video brings a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films together, to show the courageous journey and what finally brought it to an end.\n\nTen years, 21 films, a lot of popcorn. The MCU spent years building to Avengers: Endgame, dedicating dozens of hours to the adventures of Iron Man, Captain America, Black Panther, Black Widow, and hundreds of others.\n\nMerman aka \u201cSlyfer,\u201d a 19-year-old French YouTuber and student video editor, released a new compilation called \u201c(Marvel) Avengers | Journey\u2019s End,\u201d commemorating Avengers: Endgame and the entire MUC so far. It runs at about eight minutes, but it\u2019s a worthwhile eight minutes.\n\nDisney and Marvel are currently getting ready for Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which starts with Scarlett Johansson\u2019s solo debut as Black Widow in 2020, followed by the arrival of The Eternals.\n\nThe series took a bit of a hit recently, as the shared partnership between Sony and Disney for Spider-Man dissolved, with Sony CEO Tony Vinciquerra saying just yesterday the company has confidence in its own shared universe succeeding. It remains to be seen if it will look anything like the tremendous achievement Marvel Studios pulled off over the last several years.", "description": "A new fan video brings a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films together, to show the courageous journey and what finally brought it to an end....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/mn2ytisyjuwgtv4sdmxv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
