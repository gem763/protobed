I feel like there\u2019s truth to all rumors, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how you dress it up.\u201d\n\nDiggs practiced Thursday, but the Vikings\u2019 decision to list his Wednesday absence as a \u201cnon-football injury\u201d \u2014 despite his insistence that he had a cold \u2014 only fueled speculation that the talented 25-year old has grown weary in the Vikings\u2019 run-heavy scheme, manned by a largely risk-averse quarterback in Kirk Cousins.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nAnd guess what? If that is indeed the case .... Diggs has an effing point! Not to go all Howard Beale on you, but good on him \u2014 and Adam Thielen, too \u2014 for being fed up and refusing to take it anymore.\n\nLook, the Vikings boast one of the league\u2019s strongest ground games, and in an era where it\u2019s never been easier to pass due to offense-friendly rule changes, they should absolutely be ripping up defenses through the air, too \u2014 and not just on Cousins\u2019 beloved play-action.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut they aren\u2019t, largely because of Cousins\u2019 inability to push the ball downfield. What\u2019s more, the Vikings are even weak on play-action, averaging a mere 6.3 yards per play (24th in the league despite calling it at a 29 percent clip, eighth most in the league). If you were an All-Pro caliber receiver in your absolute prime, that type of passing ineptitude would piss you off, too.\n\nStefon Diggs is not denying he isn't frustrated with his role with the Minnesota Vikings. (Getty Images)\n\nSo from here, if both of them speaking out this week is what it takes to get Cousins\u2019 attention, then it\u2019s for the best. And while we\u2019re at it, so is the fact that there seems to be an increasing number of NFL players who \u2014 despite playing in one of America\u2019s most militaristic, rigid sports leagues \u2014 increasingly seem to be recognizing and asserting their power (albeit to a lesser degree than their counterparts in, say, the NBA).\n\nIn Jacksonville, star 25-year-old cornerback Jalen Ramsey is mired in a standoff with the organization over \u201cdisrespectful\u201d things that were said in a meeting. This August, Zeke Elliott held out all of training camp and was ultimately rewarded with a massive deal a year ahead of schedule. And last year, Le\u2019Veon Bell opted to sit out the entire season rather than log another 400-touch campaign during a contract year. He was rewarded with a massive deal by the Jets this offseason.\n\nBy the way \u2014 if you find yourself being annoyed by this phenomenon, if you find yourself angry about players taking a business-like approach to a child\u2019s game, just remember that A) football stops being a child\u2019s game the moment players enter the multi-million dollar exploitation machine that is college football and B) NFL teams sever contracts and unceremoniously cut players all the time.\n\nBesides, think of all the Hall of Fame careers that would have been saved if more players had this epiphany a decade or even two decades ago. Maybe Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson wouldn\u2019t have each retired at 30 years old. Imagine seeing those two at the absolute peak of their powers, playing for legit championship contenders on the game\u2019s biggest stages. It would have been just as fulfilling as seeing John Elway finally cash in on a title late in his career, right?\n\nThe thing is, you also have to acknowledge that Elway was a little lucky. Even star players can\u2019t pick their teammates and coaches, so it took the football gods finally sending him a competent supporting cast \u2014 led by coach Mike Shanahan and Hall-of-Fame running back Terrell Davis \u2014 to solidify his legacy.\n\nNot every player who cares about winning is afforded that, obviously, which is why \u2014 considering the tenuous nature of NFL careers \u2014 it\u2019s so important for those players to do whatever they can to maximize their chances to do just that, even after they\u2019ve get handsomely paid (which Diggs has been).\n\nSo if that means Diggs has to open some eyes feeding into speculation he wants a trade, that\u2019s fine by me. As long as he doesn\u2019t become an Antonio Brown-like distraction \u2014 which I\u2019m not even convinced an in-his-prime Terrell Owens could replicate at this point \u2014 my hunch is his teammates understand.\n\nHell, in today\u2019s day and age, it might not be long before one of them chooses to sit out or speak out in an attempt to take control of their legacy ... especially if it elevates Cousins\u2019 play, or Diggs indeed forces a trade.\n\nThey say the NFL is a copycat league, but as Diggs showed Thursday, we\u2019re slowly seeing that it\u2019s a phrase that extends to players\u2019 willingness to make business decisions as much as it does coaches\u2019 willingness to steal on-field concepts from each other.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Stefon Diggs is right to complain about his role with the Vikings.
