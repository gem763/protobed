Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.75% would pay $4 billion over time. Drugmaker Teva TEVA, -0.29% would contribute the drugs, but not cash.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing and said the details of the deal could change.\n\nA $50 billion framework was first reported Wednesday by The New York Times. Samantha Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, confirmed to the AP that that report \u201cappears to be correct on the details of the tentative settlement framework.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether states and local governments will accept the deal. Drug companies and other state attorneys general who are leading the talks either did not return messages or comment.\n\nThe talks are picking up as a jury is being selected in Cleveland for a trial on claims against some companies in the drug industry being brought by the Ohio counties of Cuyahoga and Summit. They claim the companies engaged in a conspiracy that has damaged their communities should be held accountable.\n\nJury selection began Wednesday and could wrap up Thursday, with opening arguments scheduled Monday.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has already settled with the two counties. If the other companies settle, too, it would leave only the pharmacy chain Walgreens WBA, +0.27% \u2014 in its role as a distributor to its own stores \u2014 and the smaller distributor Henry Schein as defendants. It\u2019s not clear whether the trial would go on in that case.\n\nThe defendants in the Cleveland trial include Actavis and Cephalon, drug companies now owned by Teva.\n\nAll the companies say they complied with the law and supplied only drugs that doctors prescribed.\n\nWhile the case concerns only claims for the two counties, it is a bellwether intended to show how legal issues might be resolved in more than 2,000 other lawsuits over the opioid crisis.\n\nIn court Wednesday, lawyers for the defendants argued that the trial should be postponed in case potential jurors saw any of the coverage and would be tainted when learning of the massive amount of money possibly being discussed.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster said he didn\u2019t believe many of the potential jurors would have been exposed to the stories but that he would question them to determine whether they were aware of the coverage.\n\nA delay, he said, could push the trial into next year.\n\nThe other major question was how to select a dozen jurors for a trial over opioids in a region hit particularly hard by addictions and overdoses.\n\nQuestionnaires were sent to potential jurors in nine northeast Ohio counties, including Cuyahoga, which along with neighboring Summit County was chosen as the first plaintiff in a trial in what could become the most complicated class action lawsuit in U.S. history. Cuyahoga County is home to Cleveland, and Summit to the city of Akron.\n\nThe questionnaire asked potential jurors to answer questions about their and immediate family members\u2019 experiences with prescription painkillers and the crisis itself.\n\nThey were asked to check off whether they had ever used 11 different prescription opioids. Had they or family members ever used heroin or illicit fentanyl? Have they ever been prescribed painkillers after surgery? Have they or a family member ever been treated for addiction? Have they ever overdosed?\n\nThose with close connections to the crisis are expected to be excluded from serving on the jury.\n\nCounting prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly made fentanyl, opioids have been blamed for more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.", "description": "Efforts to settle thousands of lawsuits related to the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic intensified Wednesday ahead of the scheduled start of arguments in the first...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT372_opioid_ZG_20191015165718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
