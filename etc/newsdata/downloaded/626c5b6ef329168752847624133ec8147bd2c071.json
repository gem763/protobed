Try these envy-reduction techniques", "language": "en", "text": "You expect your kids to grow up and enjoy healthy, happy lives. But what if their happiness\u2014and wealth\u2014far exceeds yours?\n\nWhat begins as a concerted effort to support their interests can turn into mounting envy as you watch them attain levels of success that you never imagined. The shock of seeing your son or daughter launch a hot tech startup or earn celebrity status as, say, an actor or musician can leave you thrilled but also rueful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthy and normal to think, \u2018I worked my butt off and I didn\u2019t make all this money,\u2019\u201d said Dawn C. Carr, an assistant professor of sociology at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Fla. \u201cYou may also look at your kid and think, \u2018When I was your age, I didn\u2019t have the time to take risks and do the things you\u2019re doing that led to these amazing outcomes.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead: These are the best new ideas in retirement\n\nJealousy can mix with bitterness as you reflect on sacrifices you\u2019ve made that prevented you from pursuing your dreams. And now you crave a greater role in your child\u2019s life, but with each passing year you become less of a participant and more of a spectator.\n\nTrying to live your dream vicariously invites disappointment. Even if you remain close with your kid, you\u2019re still on the outside looking in.\n\nIf you feel a tinge of regret, replace thoughts of resentment with a commitment to act on your long-deferred aspirations. Perhaps your child can open up doors to help restart your career by connecting you to agents or funding your entrepreneurial venture.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that because you\u2019ve reached a certain age like 65, it\u2019s all over now,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe\u2019re good at making ourselves feel dissatisfied because we see all that others have,\u201d but it\u2019s better to turn that yearning into an action plan to do what you love.\n\nRead: The real math of coffee and your retirement\n\nIdeally, your relationship with your kid allows you to speak from the heart. Along with sharing your joy in their success, you might propose how they can help you fulfill your potential as well.\n\n\u201cMost parents are extremely proud,\u201d Carr said. \u201cSo if they do have those feelings, they tend not to share them.\u201d\n\nSuppressing your simmering anger will only breed more frustration. If you find yourself privately wishing for your child\u2019s comeuppance, that\u2019s a bad sign.\n\nRead: 10 ways to build wealth over a lifetime\n\nYoung adults who gain fame and wealth face varying degrees of stress. It\u2019s easy to see their lives as endlessly blissful, when in fact they may feel lonely and overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cEverybody has struggles,\u201d Carr said. \u201cDon\u2019t assume, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re rich. They have no problems.\u2019 If they feel your resentment, it can lead to rejection of them listening to you.\u201d\n\nInstead, position yourself not just as a loving parent but as a trustworthy friend. Show genuine concern for their well-being. Convey that you\u2019re not only on their team but also that you love them and care about their happiness.\n\nRead: Want a pension in retirement? Here\u2019s how to create one\n\nBut what if your child is too busy\u2014or simply unwilling\u2014to include you in her glorious life of private jets and soirees with stars?\n\n\u201cRemind yourself of your role in facilitating your child\u2019s success,\u201d said Preston Ni, professor of communication studies at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, Calif. He suggests replacing negative thoughts with life-affirming declarations such as, \u201cThis is part of my legacy.\u201d\n\nHe also favors using the word \u201cactually\u201d to adopt a fresh perspective. Rather than stew in jealousy, tell yourself, \u201cActually, he wouldn\u2019t be where he is without me\u201d or \u201cActually, I have great friends and I\u2019m happy with my life right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mental reframe,\u201d said Ni, author of \u201cHow to Let Go of Negative Thoughts and Emotions.\u201d \u201cUsing \u2018actually\u2019 kills off negative thoughts.\u201d", "description": "When support turns to envy.", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL694_brady__ZG_20190619105109.jpg"}
