REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nA spokesman for the Berlin government confirmed it was looking into the application for the bridging loan, without commenting on the size of the request.\n\nLabour union Verdi said it supported the application.\n\n\u201cEverything possible needs to be done to save Condor and its jobs,\u201d Christine Behle of the Verdi board said in a statement, adding the firm was profitable and the brand trusted. Condor employs around 4,500 people.\n\nSeparately, the German state of Hesse, where Condor is based, said it stood ready to support the airline via guarantees, adding it was examining whether conditions for state aid applied.\n\nCondor reiterated that it was a profitable enterprise, adding it expected earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to rise in the current financial year ending Sept. 30, compared with about 43 million euros ($47.24 million) previously.\n\nAround 600,000 holidaymakers, including tens of thousands from Germany, have been stranded around this world by the demise of Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm.\n\nGovernments or insurance companies, depending on individual countries\u2019 laws, will have to step in and bring them home.\n\nA spokesman for the German Aviation Association (BDL) said that, as Condor was operating as normal, there was no need for a major repatriation program in Germany.\n\n\u201cCondor is continuing flight operations as usual, meaning there is no need for a repatriation mission like that done with Germania,\u201d he said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nAirline Germania collapsed in February, sparking a major operation to fetch stranded passengers.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook helped shares of rival package holiday and airline companies, as it takes capacity out of the holiday market.\n\nGermany\u2019s TUI (TUIGn.DE) gained more than 10%, reaching its highest level since February.", "description": "Thomas Cook's German holiday airline Condor has asked the German government for a bridging loan, the airline said on Monday, adding it would continue operating despite its parent company's collapse.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433015532&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0IX"}
