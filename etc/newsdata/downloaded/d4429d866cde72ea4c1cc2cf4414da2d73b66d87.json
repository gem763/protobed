Howard added the foster parents and homeowners where the girls were found had some connection, but it was unclear what that relationship was.\n\nAccording to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Howard said the girls were last seen when a caregiver put them to bed, and it wasn\u2019t clear how they ended up in the car.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
