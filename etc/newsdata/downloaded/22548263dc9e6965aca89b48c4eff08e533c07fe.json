Apstein called the outburst \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAstros Manager A.J. Hinch called the incident \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cuncalled for\u201d in a news conference before the Washington Nationals\u2019 5-4 win in Game 1 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFor me as a leader in this organization down here in the clubhouse, on the field, I take everything that happens in the clubhouse to heart,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cNo one, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media, should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.\u201d\n\nBut the Astros have had other run-ins with media members this season. ESPN baseball columnist Jeff Passan said on the network\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d program that Houston\u2019s \u201corganizational philosophy\u201d toward media is \u201cjust arrogance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Astros always, when they are attacked, will attack back,\u201d Passan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this was, despite the fact that we\u2019re on Day 1 of the World Series \u2026 talking about this and not Gerrit Cole versus Max Scherzer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMajor League Baseball is investigating the incident involving Taubman, something Luhnow said he \u201cwelcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want anybody who interacts with our organization to feel comfortable and to feel respected,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cClearly that was not the case in the celebration after the Yankees victory. We can do better and we will do better. \u2026 I do apologize. This situation should have never happened.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "MLB is investigating the clubhouse encounter with three female journalists.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/H9KpRe4nsGUZ0lcHiNKQIPrb7Cg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7YHH72HHYYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
