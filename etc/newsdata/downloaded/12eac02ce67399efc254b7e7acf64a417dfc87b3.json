The exceptional variety of its water habitats has made it a sanctuary for a large number of birds and reptiles, as well as for threatened species such as the manatee. It is on the danger list because of serious and continuing degradation of its aquatic ecosystem.\"", "description": "Sites on Unesco's list of World Heritage in danger include Liverpool, The Everglades, and a slew of ancient Middle Eastern cities", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/March/us-everglades-AP-TRAVEL-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-05-08"}
