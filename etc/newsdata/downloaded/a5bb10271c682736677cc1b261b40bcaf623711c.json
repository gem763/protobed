But that\u2019s not cinema.\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nNow Coppola has shared his two pence.\n\n\u2018When Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration,\u2019 he said to journalists in Lyon, where he has been awarded the Prix Lumi\u00e8re at the Lumi\u00e8re Festival for his contribution to cinema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.\n\nHe spoke at Festival Lumiere in Lyon (Picture: MEGA)\n\n\u2018Martin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u2019\n\nOuch!\n\nCoppola wasn\u2019t the first to back Scorsese\u2019s comments, after Friends\u2019 Jennifer Aniston agreed.\n\nSpeaking about the changing landscape of film, Jen spoke about how she hoped for a Meg Ryan-era comeback, mourning the loss of cinema\u2019s yesteryear and not vibing a career in front of a green screen.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re seeing what\u2019s available out there and it\u2019s just diminishing and diminishing in terms of, it\u2019s big Marvel movies,\u2019 the actress told Variety this week.\n\nScorsese\u2019s comments enraged many (Picture: Invision)\n\n\u2018Or things that I\u2019m not just asked to do or really that interested in living in a green screen.\u2019\n\nAs she added the business of moviemaking had \u2018changed so much\u2019, she said: \u2018I think we would so love to have the era of Meg Ryan come back.\u2019\n\nAniston added: \u2018I just think it would be nice to go into a movie theatre, sit cosy. I think we should have a resurgence. Let\u2019s get the Terms of Endearment back out there. You know, Heaven Can Wait, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Goodbye Girl.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever last week Robert Downey Jr said that Scorsese\u2019s comments \u2018made no sense\u2019, before getting in a dig about Marvel\u2019s \u2018phenomenal\u2019 success.\n\nThe Iron Man star brought up the director while chatting to Howard Stern, saying: \u2018I didn\u2019t expect [the MCU] to become what it became and it is this very large multi-headed hydra at this point. I\u2019ve always had other interests. And according to Scorsese, it\u2019s \u201cnot cinema\u201d. I gotta take a look at that.\u2019\n\nStern asked RDJ why Scorsese, 74, said such a thing, with the 54-year-old diplomatically replying: \u2018Because it\u2019s his opinion.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
