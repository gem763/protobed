If the resolution passes, which it\u2019s expected to do, future impeachment hearings will be more public, with clarified roles for Republican participation in the process (including some subpoena power) and protections for the president. McCarthy and other House Republicans will have to find a new line of defense.\n\nThe reason House Republicans lambasted their own rules in the first place was that arguing about process was politically more expedient than arguing about substance. The Trump administration used the same tactic when discrediting the Mueller investigation: It\u2019s a witch hunt; it was started under false pretenses; it\u2019s part of a deep-state conspiracy; it\u2019s a bunch of angry Democrats. Never mind the possible obstruction of justice by the president of the United States, they implored\u2014the important thing is that no one ever should have found out about it in the first place!\n\n(After Mueller declined to accuse the president of any crime directly, Trump and his defenders added a substantive argument\u2014\u201cNo collusion, total exoneration\u201d\u2014to the procedural argument.)\n\nNew scandal, same tactic. The Democrats announce an amorphous impeachment inquiry, and the Republicans attack it on process grounds. The whole point is to distract from the substance of the issue by, ironically, appealing to an innate sense of fairness and propriety.", "description": "", "authors": ["Benjamin Parker", "Thebulwark.Com What-The-New-Impeachment-Vote-Means-For-Trumps-Defenders"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
