Authorities have launched an investigation.\n\nThe Okaz newspaper said that the victims were expatriates who lived in the kingdom and who were performing the umrah, the lesser pilgrimage to the Muslim holy places which can be undertaken year round.\n\nThis year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world in August to take part in the annual hajj pilgrimage - one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\nThe hajj and the umrah centre on the western city of Mecca and its surrounding hills and valleys, but the itinerary also often takes in the other holy city of Medina.\n\nLast year, a high-speed train line was opened linking Mecca and Medina in just two and a half hours, halving the previous travel time.\n\nPrince Faisal bin Salman, the governor of Medina region, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, SPA said.\n\nPakistan said four people survived the bus crash, including one of its nationals, while several other Pakistani citizens were killed.\n\n\"It has been reported that 35 passengers out of total 39 lost their lives,\" the foreign ministry in Islamabad said in a statement.\n\n\"Initial reports indicate that the deceased also include a certain number of Pakistani nationals.

Condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. Praying for a quick recovery of the injured,\" he tweeted.\n\nTransporting worshippers around the holy sites, particularly during the hajj, is a huge challenge for Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring the pilgrimage, the roads can be chaotic with thousands of buses creating interminable traffic jams.\n\nFour British pilgrims were killed and 12 others injured in April last year when their bus collided with a fuel tanker while they were on the way to Mecca.\n\nAnd in January 2017, six Britons, including a two-month-old baby, were killed in a minibus on their way to Medina after making a pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nIn September 2015, a stampede killed up to 2,300 worshippers - including hundreds of Iranians - in the worst disaster ever to strike the hajj.\n\nEarlier that month, 100 people were killed when a construction crane toppled into a courtyard of Mecca's Grand Mosque.\n\nAs part of efforts to diversify its oil-dependent economy, the ultra-conservative kingdom wants to foster a year-round religious tourism sector that attracts millions of pilgrims.\n\nUp until last month, it only issued visas to Muslim pilgrims, foreign workers and recently to spectators at sporting or cultural events, but tourists are now allowed to visit as part of the drive to wean the biggest Arab economy off its dependence on oil.", "description": "Thirty-five foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near the Islamic holy city of Medina, Saudi state media says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6647/92881691188243ccb61b6086092e51dc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
