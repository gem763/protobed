REFILE-GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil surges, stock futures slip after attack on Saudi facility\n\n(Corrects to add analyst's full name in paragraph 14)\n\n* Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Oil prices surge on fears of global supply disruption\n\n* Safe haven gold, Japanese yen rise, stock futures slip\n\n* Japan markets closed for public holiday, liquidity seen\n\nBy Swati Pandey\n\nSYDNEY, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices surged to six-month\n\nhighs on Monday while Wall Street futures fell and safe-haven\n\nbets returned after weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia's crude\n\nfacilities knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nU.S. crude futures were last up 11% at $61.10 a\n\nbarrel, coming off highs on expectations other global oil\n\nsuppliers would step in to lift output. Brent crude\n\nsoared 13% at $68.06 after earlier rising to $71.95.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebel group had claimed\n\nresponsibility for the attack, which hit the world's biggest\n\noil-processing facility but a senior U.S. official told\n\nreporters on Sunday that evidence indicated Tehran was behind\n\nit. The attacks heightened investor worries about the\n\ngeopolitical situation in the region and worsening relations\n\nbetween Iran and the United States.\n\nThose fears powered safe-haven assets, with prices for gold\n\nclimbing 1% in early Asian trade to $1,503.09.\n\nMoves in Asian share markets were small, however, with Japan\n\nshut for a public holiday.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas a tick lower at 515.4. Australian shares\n\nwere down 0.1% while South Korea's KOSPI was a tad\n\nhigher.\n\nE-Minis for the S&P 500 were off 0.4% while those for\n\nthe Dow eased 0.3%. \"If risk appetite collapses due to fears of worsening middle\n\neast tensions in the wake of any retaliation to the drone\n\nattacks, some emerging markets could face a double whammy of\n\npressures,\" said Mitul Kotecha, Singapore-based senior emerging\n\nmarkets strategist at TD Securities.\n\n\"In Asia, the most risk sensitive currencies are Indian\n\nrupee INR=D3 , Indonesian rupiah IDR=D3 and Philippine peso\n\nPHP=D3 .\"\n\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES\n\nAmong major currencies, the Saudi news pushed the yen\n\nup 0.4% to 107.64 per dollar while the Canadian dollar CAD=D3\n\nrose 0.5% in anticipation of higher oil prices.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 was little moved near a three-week top\n\nwhile the pound GBP=D3 hovered near Friday's two-month highs.\n\nThat left the greenback down 0.15% at 98.105 against a basket of\n\nsix major currencies .\n\nThe risk-sensitive Australian dollar was down 0.5% against\n\nthe yen AUDJPY= , snapping nine straight days of gains. The\n\nkiwi dollar slipped to a one-week low on the yen.\n\n\"One immediate question this (attack) poses for bond markets\n\nis whether a further rise in the inflation expectations\n\ncomponent of bond yields - which have proved historically\n\nsensitive to oil prices - will give this month's sharp bond\n\nmarket sell-off fresh impetus,\" said NAB analyst Ray Attrill.\n\n\"Or will safe haven considerations dominate to drive yields\n\nlower? Watch this space.\"\n\nIn early Asian trading, futures for U.S. 10-year Treasury\n\nnotes TYv1 rose 0.3%, indicating yields may slip when cash\n\ntrading begins. Global bonds were sold off last week, sending yields higher,\n\nled by a broader risk rally on hopes the United States and China\n\nwould soon end their long trade war. Better-than-expected U.S.\n\nretail sales data also boosted sentiment.\n\nChinese data for industrial production, retail sales and\n\nfixed asset investment will be released later on Monday, which\n\ncould help set the tone for this week.\n\nInvestors also await the outcome of the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve's policy meeting on Wednesday at which it is widely\n\nexpected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy\n\npath.
