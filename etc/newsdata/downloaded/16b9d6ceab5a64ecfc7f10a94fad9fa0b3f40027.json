USA TODAY\n\nOscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. has been indicted by a New York grand jury in his groping case \u2013 with a new and previously uncharged incident added to the charges. As a result, his trial on the original charge, set to begin Thursday, was postponed and a new arraignment was scheduled for Oct. 15.\n\nManhattan Assistant District Attorney Jenna Long filed a \"certificate of affirmative grand jury action\" Thursday, according to Justin Henry, spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.\n\nHe said the indictment and the details of the charges will not be unsealed until Gooding's arraignment on the indictment next week.\n\nGooding was originally charged in June with misdemeanor groping stemming from a New York City bar encounter with a 29-year-old woman.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr., arrives at court in New York for a proceeding on his groping case, Oct. 10, 2019.

But instead the case was postponed because prosecutors said they were still waiting for evidence in the case.\n\nMark Heller, Gooding's New York defense attorney, told USA TODAY in an email, that the defense was \"ready for a trial\" this week. He did not immediately return a call requesting comment on the new development.\n\nGooding, 51, has pleaded not guilty, insisting that \"nothing happened.\"\n\nHis is the second celebrity criminal case scheduled to be tried in New York in the post-#MeToo era. It's also a rare example of prosecuting a groping case, a crime seldom reported in New York, says local criminal defense attorney Stuart Slotnick.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr., (C) with his lawyers arrive at court for proceeding in his groping case, Oct. 10, 2019, in New York.

The reasons why include Gooding's movie-star status, the sex-crime nature of the accusation and the intense pressure prosecutors are under to do more to pursue sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\n\"This is a well-known celebrity, instantly recognizable, and to suggest that he would, in public in a bar, commit a sexual crime is somewhat outrageous,\" Slotnick told USA TODAY last month. \"This case is heading for a not-guilty verdict. In the legal world, it's generally perceived as ending in a not-guilty verdict. \"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/10/cuba-gooding-jr-trial-groping-case-new-york-city/3908382002/", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr has been indicted by a New York grand jury in his groping case, with a new charge added, postponing his trial again.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published A.M.
