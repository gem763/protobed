He is not alone. We have hit uncharted political territory. An unstable president has lurched under the pressure of an impeachment inquiry into a form of madness that is either a very public suicide or some weird genius for survival. Trump is Robert De Niro, armed with a gun, in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d gazing into the mirror repeating: \u201cYou talkin\u2019 to me?\u201d\n\nWe are. Nixon wanted his profanities deleted from transcripts. Trump has no such qualms. He trumpets his view of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry on Twitter: \u201cBULLSHIT.\u201d He will not be a one-term president! That\u2019s weak, like Carter, like Bush One! He cannot be WEAK like them! He cannot lose! It\u2019s all an attempted \u201ccoup\u201d!\n\nThe White House, I hear, now operates like the 26th floor of Trump Tower during the campaign. There\u2019s no structure or plan. There\u2019s no war room or communications cell. People wander in and wander out, except they\u2019re all lawyered up now, no doubt. They\u2019re not even in crisis mode. Trump just goes out and shoots his mouth, as he has from Day 1. Like a good Mafia boss, he now has everyone complicit. They\u2019re all in this together \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and the rest. Since John Kelly escaped in January, Trump\u2019s henchmen are all that\u2019s left.", "description": "Is this Trump\u2019s public suicide or his genius for survival?", "authors": ["Roger Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/opinion/04cohenNew/04cohenNew-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
