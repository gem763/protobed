(AP) - Changes are coming to Tennessee\u2019s proposal to become the first state to receive funding in a lump sum for its Medicaid program, TennCare, health officials said Thursday.\n\nTennCare Director Gabe Roberts told state lawmakers that the proposal will be amended to say changes won\u2019t be made to the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment benefit for children under 21. He said another change will say the plan won\u2019t limit off-label drugs for pediatric patients.\n\nRoberts said TennCare wasn\u2019t planning to change either, but wants to provide clarification.\n\nThe edits come as TennCare sorts through written and verbal public comments on the $7.9 billion block grant proposal. Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s administration released the proposal last month under a new state law calling for a block grant plan, which Trump has encouraged states to submit. The agency drew a slew of concerns during five public hearings on the issue about whether the proposal could compromise care for the most vulnerable citizens.\n\nMore changes are expected based on the feedback, Roberts said.\n\nAt the first hearing , for instance, one speaker pointed out that concerns in the room came from many quarters including trade associations, disability groups, specialty and primary care groups, physicians, pediatricians, senior citizens, charitable clinics, mental health and addiction experts, parents and others.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s state House committee meeting, TennCare heard from groups that represent doctors, hospitals, people with disabilities and the pharmaceutical industry, with each still concerned about the proposal.\n\nEach group, for instance, worried about one proposed change that could limit some prescriptions for those on TennCare to one drug covered per therapeutic class. The pharmaceutical representative even contended that the idea would violate an agreement under a Medicaid rebate law.\n\n\u201cA closed formulary would severely restrict a physician\u2019s ability to prescribe the most effective medicine for a patient and could lead to more costly treatments, such as emergency department visits, hospitalizations and added procedures,\u201d said Jack Fosbinder, state counsel for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\nTennCare has sought to assure that TennCare patients wouldn\u2019t be at risk of losing benefits or being taken off eligibility rolls. The waiver proposal said the only new flexibilities sought in eligibility or benefits would be \u201ccommon-sense measures consistent with the larger block grant framework of improving program efficiency, and which are intended to make the TennCare program stronger and more effective.\u201d\n\nLee has touted it as a chance to be innovative and demonstrate efficiencies in delivering the same services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve written it in the waiver and we\u2019ve said it repeatedly and the governor has too: this model is not contingent upon any types of cuts to service or cuts to eligibility,\u201d Roberts told reporters.\n\nTennessee must file the proposal with federal officials by Nov. 20. If federal approval is granted, state lawmakers would get to vote on the final product.\n\nThe block grant would cover core medical services for the disabled and blind, children, adults and elderly - or about 1.2 million Tennesseans. This means administrative costs, prescription drugs, uncompensated hospital payments and individuals dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare would not be part of the block grant plan, which would cover a much smaller segment of TennCare.\n\nThe federal government would increase Tennessee\u2019s block grant funding if enrollment grows beyond the original calculation.\n\nRoberts, the TennCare director, has described the plan as a \u201chybrid\u201d approach to block grants because the state has designed its proposal to allow Tennessee to keep 50% of any unspent block grant funds.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Changes are coming to Tennessee's proposal to become the first state to receive funding in a lump sum for its Medicaid program, TennCare, health officials said Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Mattise"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
