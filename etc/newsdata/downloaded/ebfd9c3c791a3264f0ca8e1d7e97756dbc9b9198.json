Given the strong bullish trend, we\u2019re monitoring prices for a break higher.\n\nOverall, the price action has been predominantly bullish this year, although the trend has not been without its bumps. Despite an okay earnings report, prices sold off at the end of July as traders booked a profit. Yet, this hasn\u2019t prevented buyers stepping back in to take it to new highs.\n\nOver the past three months Apple (NASDAQ: ) has outperformed its sector and the S&P500 and maintained a bullish structure. According to Reuters, only three of 43 analysts have Apple marked as a sell, 17 a hold, 10 a buy and 13 a strong buy. Sure, analysts\u2019 estimates tend to be on the optimistic side (to say the least), but with another month until their next earnings release and a strong bullish structure, it still allows for further upside.\n\nFor now, we\u2019re waiting for bullish momentum to break it out of compression to signal a resumption of its uptrend.\n\nMonitoring Apple For Breakout From Compression", "description": "Shares Analysis by Matt Simpson covering: Apple Inc.
