I don\u2019t want an election but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop negotiations and to compel another pointless delay to Brexit potentially for years then that would be the only way to resolve this.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that we are tonight tabling a motion under the Fixed Term Parliament Act.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn responded that while Mr Johnson was free to table a motion for a general election, his party would not back it while no-deal remained as an option.\n\nHe said the government must \u201cget the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a presidency, we have a Prime Minister who governs with the consensus of the House of Commons representing the people within whom the sovereignty rests,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no majority to leave without a deal within the country\u201d.\n\nMr Corbyn called on Mr Johnson to put his Brexit plan to the people.\n\nSpeaking earlier after a meeting of so-called \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 MPs, Mr Corbyn said he \u201cfully expects\u201d that cross-party legislation to prevent no-deal will clear the Commons on Wednesday and become law shortly afterwards. Labour has tabled a motion in the House of Lords which would allow peers to complete the bill\u2019s remaining stages by Friday.\n\n\u201cLabour wants to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and to have a general election, so we can end austerity and invest in our communities.
