With nigh-on a full team of players out injured, the odds of stopping Manchester City looked insurmountable. Instead Daniel Farke\u2019s men gave their best performance of the season by far, not only cutting the champions open but looking solid at the back for the first time. There was kudos for the debutants in defence, Sam Byram and Ibrahim Amadou, but also for more seasoned Norwich players. Emi Buend\u00eda and Marco Stiepermann were central to a buccaneering style in the Championship yet had struggled to bring that form to the top flight. With the gauntlet down, however, they delivered. Buend\u00eda contributed two assists and regularly sprung the City press. Stiepermann sparked several counter attacks and crucially reestablished his understanding with Teemu Pukki.

Which camp do you sit in where Arsenal, whose insistence on playing from the back was calamitous against Watford, and Unai Emery are concerned? They had flirted with danger several times before, in a near-action replay of Manchester City\u2019s ridiculous third concession against Norwich, Sokratis Papastathopoulos\u2019s sloppiness allowed Tom Cleverley to hand Watford a lifeline. Bernd Leno could be seen booting the ball long from a goal-kick, to cheers from the away fans, shortly afterwards but Ainsley Maitland-Niles almost let the home team in again later on as Arsenal tried to play short again. The new rule that allows players to receive a goal-kick inside the area has been grasped enthusiastically by many managers but it is not heresy to remind them you do not have to take advantage of it \u2013 particularly if your players are not up to the job.

Firmino emerged from the bench at Anfield to provide two glorious assists for Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah as Liverpool eventually broke a well\u2011organised Newcastle unit. \u201cCantona is as good a player as I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Firmino week in, week out but what he gives them is a perfect balance. Cantona gave us that. We had Giggs and Kanchelskis who had frightening pace and stretched sides so much like Liverpool\u2019s two [Man\u00e9 and Salah], and Cantona dropped into that hole and people couldn\u2019t get anywhere near them. That\u2019s what you see with Firmino.\u201d Andy Hunter\n\nMatch report: Liverpool 3-1 Newcastle Uniited\n\n4) Maguire deserved more from upset Leicester fans\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said Harry Maguire would not be too unsettled by the rancour he encountered from the away end at Old Trafford. And there are so many precedents \u2013 to cite just one example, the Blackburn fans\u2019 treatment of Alan Shearer after the player had left Ewood Park \u2013 nobody should have been wholly surprised by the reception for Maguire from the section of Leicester fans. All the same, it did feel perplexing that a player could serve a club with distinction, as Maguire did for Leicester, then leave for \u00a380m, taking care to handle a delicate situation in the right manner and earning the respect of his colleagues in the process, then become public enemy No 1 with their supporters. Maguire can reflect on a satisfying day, making it a frustrating occasion for Jamie Vardy, but he would be entitled to wonder why his first game for United against his old club took place against that kind of ill feeling.

Son often starred in a central role if Kane was out with an ankle injury and his performances seemed to dip whenever the team\u2019s star striker returned, leading to talk that the South Korean forward needed to be given more freedom by Mauricio Pochettino. But the relationship between Kane and Son appeared to be in fine working order during this win. They were both excellent and their link play showed they are more than capable of flourishing in the same attack, especially when they combined brilliantly for Erik Lamela\u2019s goal. There were also two dashing goals from Son and although Kane failed to get on the scoresheet, the England captain\u2019s intelligent performance was a reminder of his impressive team ethic.

They had shown they could beat the big sides; surely it couldn\u2019t be that hard to maintain that but start winning against the teams in the bottom half of the table as well. But five games in, Wolves are still without a league victory. Although they improved drastically after half\u2011time, there was an odd passivity to them in the first half. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo denied the Europa League was an issue, as he probably has to, but this is a recurring pattern. If nothing else, it has forced him to chop and change his team in a way that he didn\u2019t last season. Wolves surely are too good to be seriously involved in a relegation scrap, but there needs to be an improvement soon.

The Bournemouth midfielder returned to action with the kind of tenacity and grit that truly makes Eddie Howe\u2019s side tick, not to mention the 22-year-old\u2019s wonderful palette of passing. Cook orchestrated things before being given a well-earned breather 13 minutes from time. A standing ovation followed suit, with Howe equally enthused. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHe handles the ball in any situation and you saw early in the match how he manipulated himself out of some really difficult holes.\u201d With the summer recruits Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Arnaut Danjuma, 22, yet to make their debut for the club, there are reasons to be cheerful. \u201cWhen we have more options, with some of the outstanding young players we have out injured, it\u2019s going to be an exciting team to manage,\u201d Howe said.

Calvert-Lewin is happy to chase and battle but does not currently possess the requisite qualities to make him into a lone striker, despite his goal at Bournemouth. Kean, on the other hand, came off the bench at the Vitality Stadium and, along with fellow substitute Bernard, made Everton look more dynamic in the final third, even if they failed to provide the goals necessary to get back into the game. Kean is a young striker and has just arrived from Italy, so will need time to settle but he could adapt far quicker by being on the pitch and learning about the Premier League, rather than taking inspiration from his Everton colleagues.

And as Brighton hogged possession while Burnley sent searching balls towards their strapping forwards, the game largely played out as expected. There was a certain irony, then, that the visitors\u2019 late point came from a move of crisp one-touch passing, Matej Vydra\u2019s flicked lay\u2011off slammed home superbly by Jeff Hendrick. Brighton\u2019s eight-game winless run at the Amex Stadium may seem like cause for concern but Potter\u2019s early tweak here \u2013 switching to a back four after a tepid opening half an hour \u2013 and the dominance it heralded suggests that his methods will serve them well in the long run.

Yet though unpopular, two of the decisions were technically correct and the other endlessly debatable. \u201cVAR is a fantastic tool, it makes the game fairer,\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said. He would say that with the points in the bag, but the Southampton manager also accepted the handball interpretation will always prove subjective. \u201cMaybe we got lucky today with the team in the replay room. Perhaps on another day a different set of officials will rule against us. We will have to accept that, because unintentional handball is always difficult for any referee.\u201d Paul Wilson\n\n\u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 0-1 Southampton", "description": "Emi Buend\u00eda was the architect of Manchester City\u2019s bad day, Arsenal were woeful in defence and Harry Maguire deserved better from Leicester fans", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71884887cd8391747d886174869d82305424f1b/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c496b801ddad36d77b639b001518e1f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
