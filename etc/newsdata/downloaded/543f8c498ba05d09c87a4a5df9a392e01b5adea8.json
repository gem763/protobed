(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nTwo months after teammate Tyler Skaggs was found dead in his Southlake, Texas, hotel room, Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angels were forced to process the event all over again after learning the results of Skaggs' autopsy.\n\nOn Friday, the Tarrant County, Texas, medical examiner's office revealed that Skaggs had a mix of alcohol and opioids in his system at the time of his death. The revelation sent shockwaves throughout the league and especially the Angels clubhouse.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAccording to MLB.com's Rhett Bollinger, the Angels were not aware that the report was going to come out on Friday. As a result, the players decided to close the clubhouse doors without talking to the media before their game against the Boston Red Sox. Only general manager Billy Eppler and manager Brad Ausmus were made available to speak.\n\nIt was a different story on Saturday.\n\nTrout, who along with Skaggs, was selected by the Angels in the 2009 draft, was among the players to speak and express shock upon learning of the circumstances surrounding Skaggs\u2019 death.\n\nVia MLB.com:\n\n\u201cObviously, it doesn\u2019t change my view on Tyler.\u201d \u201cHe made a big impact on my life, this team. I was kind of shocked when the news came out like that. That\u2019s tough, but it doesn\u2019t change the feeling I have for him and the way he impacted my life.\u201d\n\nAfter Skaggs was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2010, he was reunited with Trout following a trade back to Los Angeles before the 2014 season. They remained teammates and friends until Skaggs\u2019 death.\n\nIt\u2019s not always the case, but oftentimes when teammates spend that much time together, they form a special bond. That seemed to be the case with Trout and Skaggs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat closeness and the go, go, go mentality of a baseball player is also part of what makes the grieving process so difficult.\n\nTrout added that he was unaware of Skaggs taking opioids such as oxycodone and fentanyl, and wishes he\u2019d been able to help.\n\n\u201cObviously, if I knew I would have definitely said something or done something,\u201d said Trout. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. You love Tyler. We didn\u2019t know he was going through this. Just a tough situation when this came out. Tough to put your mind to it.\u201d\n\nSkaggs\u2019s family has retained prominent Texas attorney Rusty Hardin to represent them as the Southlake Police Department continues its investigation into the pitcher\u2019s death. The family is looking to find out how Skaggs came into possession of the opioids that contributed to his death, including who supplied them.\n\nMajor League Baseball is also reportedly planning to open its own investigation.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Mike Trout opens up after learning details of Tyler Skaggs' autopsy report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MQiCaDTJOet9c_Y5ulIEcw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDMuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mTenEKaj.pVo4MQpSLMADQ--~B/aD0xNzQ3O3c9Mjc4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/40982720-cc64-11e9-9bfe-0d959bbdabe0"}
