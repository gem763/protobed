Decrying technology in one breath and posturing for likes and retweets in another.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the Beltway cognoscenti, Americans continue to love and benefit from technology. You are probably reading this on a screen; a phone, tablet or computer. And you probably will use another form of technology not tied to your smartphone throughout your day.\n\nDid you look up directions or recommendations on your computer? Did your car tell you it\u2019s time for a service appointment? Did you use a voice assistant to hear your favorite song or turn off your lights?\n\nAll these innovations and more have become a part of our daily lives and the technology industry is already thinking about the next great thing.\n\nAnd beyond such daily conveniences, in communities along the Mississippi to regional economic powerhouses large and small, online platforms and the entire technology industry are changing lives and improving how we work and live. Small businesses are using technology to sell and ship more products outside of their own communities, expanding the business and increasing their bottom line.\n\nDoctors use cutting-edge technologies to map a disease\u2019s pathology to determine a clearer prognosis, a better treatment and save lives. New speech and language tools improve deaf and visually-impaired individuals\u2019 ability to communicate.\n\nSuggesting that technology is not innovating as quickly as it once was is not fair to the millions of men and women that are innovating and disrupting industries every day.\n\nSuggesting that technology is not innovating as quickly as it once was is not fair to the millions of men and women that are innovating and disrupting industries every day.\n\nIn 2018 alone, more than 260,000 Americans across 43 states started a new career in tech, joining the more than 11.6 million others already working in the booming industry. In fact, according to recent reports, states like Missouri will see a 9.5 percent increase in the tech workforce over the next five years.\n\nNationally, the average annual salary for jobs in the tech industry was $93,244 in 2018, according to tech career site Dice. In small towns and major cities, investors are backing tech start-ups to transform the way we live. While not every company will achieve a global scale, some do not need to in order to make a difference.\n\nInnovations take time to develop and they can come from anywhere. Backyard garages turn into laboratories for dreams. What makes technology and the innovation that drives it so fascinating is the ability for anyone to get involved.\n\nThe United States\u2019 global competitive edge is not only because of what is happening in Silicon Valley but also because innovation is happening in the Silicon Prairie of Nebraska and the rust belt\u2019s new tech corridors in Ohio and Michigan. Technology allows ideas to become products, only limited by hours in the day. (Not who you are, your level of education or where you\u2019re from.)\n\nThe tech industry applauds leaders who spark important conversations about the good that technology can bring. How companies protect people\u2019s personal information and how automation will affect jobs and economic opportunities are vital questions that policymakers and industry must address together.\n\nBut let there be no doubt, the tech sector is ready to continue our tradition of helping realize the \u201cdreams that fuel the American future.\u201d\n\nThe possibilities for innovation are only getting stronger as more investments are made to support increased broadband connectivity and services. Government leaders should focus on investments in public/private partnerships \u2013 like those that created the internet, and put us on the moon \u2013 as the best path forward to advancing innovation.\n\nIf today\u2019s smartphone or tablet can pack more power than NASA\u2019s entire Apollo space fleet, just imagine what devices will be capable of tomorrow. My colleagues in the tech industry are already thinking about what\u2019s next and we\u2019re excited to show the world what we\u2019ve been working on.\n\nJason Oxman is president and chief executive officer of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), the global trade association for the tech sector.
