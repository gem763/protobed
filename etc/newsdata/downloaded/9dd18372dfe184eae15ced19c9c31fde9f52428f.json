Huawei\n\nDespite uncertainty around its future access to Android, Huawei just launched its newest smartphone, the nova 5T, in Singapore on Thursday (Sept 5).\n\nThe mid-tier phone, which is aimed at younger buyers, costs S$598, and runs on EMUI 9.1 \u2013 an Android-based operating system.\n\nThis means that the phone will still have Google access, despite an ongoing US blacklist that prevents the tech giant from working with the Chinese brand.\n\nAccording to a report by Android Authority, the Nova 5T could have received Google certification before the ban was activated.\n\nThe first phone expected to be affected by the ban is the upcoming Mate 30 Pro.\n\nAs for the Nova 5T, the phone has a 6.26-inch screen, a fingerprint sensor, 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery takes one hour for a full charge.\n\nThe back of the phone boasts a textured, reflective finish that makes it look like it\u2019s radiating light \u2013 just like the aurora borealis, Huawei said.\n\nThe phone, which has no notch, has five camera lenses: a 32 MP (megapixel) selfie camera on the front, and four on the back.\n\nThey are: a 16 MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 48MP ultra-HD lens, a 2MP macro lens that can capture objects four centimetres away, and a 2MP bokeh lens for portraits.\n\nHuawei also claims the camera has a smart beauty filter that can avoid fake-looking modifications, a Super Night Mode that can take photos as clear as those with a tripod, and AI that can take better backlit shots.\n\nPre-orders for the phone start on Friday (Sept 6) and will end on Thursday (Sept 12).\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It comes in blue, black, and purple..
