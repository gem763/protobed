Make no mistake, the unanimity of culture and purpose in Alberta and Saskatchewan is just as powerful as in Quebec.\n\nHere is the roadmap that the prime minister can follow to govern for a while: he must variously adhere to the wishes of the Tories and Bloc. This is possible because no single opposition party can bring down the government which gives him the room to juggle interests and make trade-offs.\n\nIn the west, for instance, the Liberals can go ahead with the contentious TMX pipeline from Alberta to B.C. The Tories will back them up \u2014 forming a single-vote pipeline coalition of convenience. Trudeau\u2019s government has an incentive to do this because it bought the project for $4.5 billion and needs to complete it if it is to rebuild any support whatsoever in Alberta and Saskatchewan. It\u2019s also noteworthy that lower British Columbia, where the line is, voted Conservative too.\n\nAnd while the NDP, Bloc and Greens oppose it, they cannot outvote a Liberal-Tory pipeline collaboration.\n\nBesides the political benefit, the consequences of not building that pipeline, and the lines to exploit natural gas in northern B.C., are dire. Lest anyone have any doubts, a western \u201cseparatist\u201d project would be more economically viable and more crippling to Canada than the separatists who have support only in the southern third of Quebec.\n\nLikewise, in the east, the Liberals must continue to pander to Quebec by abandoning any notion of wading into Quebec\u2019s \u201chijabgate\u201d controversy or its ban against civil servants and institutions donning religious headgear, jewellery and images. Also, the Bloc may demand that the feds butt out of tax collection; change the new NAFTA, now in front of Congress, to let Quebec dairy farmers continue to gouge consumers with fixed prices; and give SNC-Lavalin a get-out-of-jail pass. The combination of the Liberals and Bloc is greater than the other three but some of these (notably the SNC deal) would alienate the other three opposition parties that Trudeau needs to remain in power.\n\nAs a tradeoff to approval of pipelines out west and Quebec concessions, the Liberals will also be bullied by the NDP and Greens into moving ahead with pharmacare, dental care and more environmental strictures. A Liberal coalition of convenience with the NDP and Greens adds up to a majority (in fact, the Liberals and NDP alone could do it).\n\nBut if the Liberals capitulate to these demands, Canada\u2019s deficits will soar. The Green\u2019s full-blown pharmacare plan will cost $27 billion in 2020 and rise to $31 billion annually four years later. This is bigger than Canada\u2019s defence budget. And free post-secondary education is another $16 billion annually.\n\nUnfortunately, the Conservatives and Bloc cannot prevent this from happening, but will benefit from this recklessness in the next election as taxes and deficits explode.\n\nIt\u2019s messy, but the path is navigable for the next four years if Trudeau is nimble and persuasive enough. Obviously, the Liberals will do anything to remain in power because a snap election would likely give Conservatives more seats and an even higher percentage of the popular vote (they got almost 250,000 more than the Liberals).\n\nBottom line: the election allows the country\u2019s two defined regions to be tails that can wag the dog but also to be played off against one another. It\u2019s very complicated. Trudeau may be unable to keep everyone a little bit happy. Stay tuned.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Bottom line: the election allows the country\u2019s two defined regions to be tails that can wag the dog but also to be played off against one another", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trudeau-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
