(Matt McClain/The Washington Post))\n\nThe 44th annual Marine Corps Marathon, one of the biggest street events in the Washington region, is Sunday and whether you plan to participate or watch, there are lots of things you need to be aware of \u2014 from street closings to parking restrictions to Metro hours.\n\nAbout 30,000 people will participate in 26.2-mile race that starts and ends in Arlington and takes runners across the Potomac River into Georgetown, Rock Creek Park and the Mall area. Thousands of supporters are expected to cheer them on from the sidewalks.\n\nThe event will make driving and parking challenging Sunday. Anyone who drives near or within the marathon\u2019s perimeter Sunday should consider other alternative transportation or routes.\n\nMetro will open two hours early to accommodate marathon crowds, and it will have extra trains. See more details below.\n\nRunners and spectators should prepare for some unsettled weather Sunday morning. The Capital Weather Gang is forecasting temperatures in mid-50s to start the race, and cloudy conditions with intermittent showers, with temperatures rising into the 60s by mid-to-late morning. Keep an eye out for a more detailed forecast closer to Sunday.\n\n[Showers could dampen World Series Game 4 and Marine Corps Marathon]\n\nThis map will help you explore the 2019 Marine Corps Marathon racecourse.
