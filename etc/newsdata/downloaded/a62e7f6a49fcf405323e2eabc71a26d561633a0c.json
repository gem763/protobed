As head of upstream, he has overseen numerous new projects coming to fruition, including Clair Ridge, to the west of Shetland in the North Sea.\n\nIn doing so he has preached efficiency, which is the best some fossil fuel producers can muster. Modernisation means BP\u2019s break-even price is on the way to falling below $50 a barrel. That is material given Brent crude is changing hands at $58 a barrel.\n\nThe market is more immediately concerned by weaker global economic growth and excess supply but the attack last month on Saudi oil facilities, widely blamed on Iran, signalled fresh turmoil in the Middle East that could spark higher prices.\n\nOpec says it is too early to debate more production cuts. Regardless, BP has plans to add another 900,000 barrels a day of new production by 2021, when the new $9bn (\u00a37bn) Argos platform on the Mad Dog field in the Gulf of Mexico should be on stream.\n\nA turning point for the company came in the summer of last year with the surprise $10.5bn acquisition of miner BHP\u2019s US shale oil and gas assets. It was the company\u2019s biggest deal in almost two decades and was accompanied by the first rise in the dividend for more than four years, demonstrating improving confidence and balance sheet strength.\n\nMr Dudley promised to trade out of older assets, setting a target of $10bn of disposals by the end of 2020. BP said on Friday that the disposal programme was running ahead of schedule, at the cost of a non-cash after-tax charge of $2bn-$3bn in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nIn the short term this will increase \u201cgearing\u201d \u2013 debt as a proportion of shareholder equity \u2013 although the company said it should then fall to the mid-20s per cent.\n\nRead Questor\u2019s rules of investment before you follow our tips\n\nAs well as tackling borrowings, BP is still stumping up an estimated $65bn in redress and clean-up costs for the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Oil spill payments cost it $3.2bn after tax last year. The payments will decline from here but continue for many years. That doesn\u2019t appear to leave much scope for green investment.\n\nHowever, the market for selling assets is predicted to improve and BP has shown it can be active in this area without stumping up all the funds. One example is Lightsource BP, a solar power developer operating in 10 countries that has attracted $7bn of third-party finance since BP bought in, according to company watchers at RBC.\n\nAnd don\u2019t discount natural gas, which Mr Dudley threw his weight behind recently as vital in reducing carbon emissions even though its production generates methane.", "description": "Questor share tip:", "authors": ["James Ashton", "Katie Morley", "Lauren Davidson", "Taha Lokhandwala"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/investing/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000211963868-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
