When the fake installer starts, the progress bar almost fills up entirely and then displays an error message.\n\n\u201cThe installer checks if Google is reachable. If not, the installation stops. If it is reachable, the installer downloads two binaries [files],\u201d according to Cisco Talos.\n\nCHINESE CYBER HACKERS HAVE BUILT A BACKDOOR IN US-CHINA TRADE WAR, REPORT SAYS\n\nOne of the binary files is used to perform \u201creconnaissance\u201d on the system and the second is the Remote Administrative Tool.\n\n\u201cThe attacker retrieves information such as the date, time and drivers,\" Cisco Talos researchers wrote in the report. \"The attacker can then see information on the system, the patch level, the number of processors, the network configuration, the hardware, firmware versions, the domain controller, the name of the admin, the list of the account, etc. This is a significant amount of information relating to a machine and makes the attacker well-prepared to carry out additional attacks.\u201d\n\nBoth the amount and the kind of information that is targeted makes the attacks particularly dangerous, Warren Mercer, a researcher at Cisco Talos, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cWhen you focus on the agenda of the attackers, it\u2019s unlikely to be a garden variety attack\u2026they certainly wanted something much more meaningful than your cat pictures,\u201d Mercer said.\n\nMercer added that it\u2019s difficult to assess the effectiveness of this attack since it was discovered before the operation went into high gear. \u201cWe did not identify any \u2018in-the-wild\u2019 activity associated and since our publication, the threat actor\u2019s website is now unavailable.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Researchers have unmasked a website masquerading as a job site for U.S. veterans that may have ties to Iran, according to media reports.", "authors": ["Brooke Crothers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/515400-iranian-flag-iran.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
