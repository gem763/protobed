Turkey would get sole control over areas of the Syrian border captured in its invasion, while Turkish, Russian and Syrian government forces would oversee the rest of the border region.\n\nAmerica's former US allies, the Kurdish fighters, are left hoping Moscow and Damascus will preserve some pieces of the Syrian Kurdish autonomy in the region.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper claimed US troops leaving Syria would continue to conduct operations against ISIS from Iraq.
