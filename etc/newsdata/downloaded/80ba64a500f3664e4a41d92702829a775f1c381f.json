REUTERS/Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency\n\nThe carrier, which has shaken up the long-haul market with cut-price transatlantic fares, also announced a two-year plan of fresh cost cuts and capacity reductions to help earnings, after its rapid expansion had led to hefty losses.\n\nThe cash-strapped carrier has for months said it aimed to find a partner to help take ownership of the Airbus fleet, allowing Norwegian to cut its debt and increase its equity.\n\nCCB Leasing Corp DAC (CCBLI), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS), will own 70% of the venture, with the rest held by Norwegian Air\u2019s Arctic Aviation.\n\nThe venture will purchase an initial 27 Airbus A320 NEO aircraft from Arctic to be delivered from 2020 to 2023.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will contribute significantly to reducing our current and future capital expenditure,\u201d acting Norwegian Air CEO Geir Karlsen said in a statement.\n\nThe company said the venture would reduce Norwegian\u2019s capital expenditure by about $1.5 billion, based on the 27 aircraft on order.\n\nNet profit for the third-quarter came in at 1.67 billion crowns ($183 million), beating the average analyst forecast in a Refinitiv poll for a profit of 1.47 billion crowns and up from a profit of 1.30 billion crowns a year ago.\n\nNorwegian\u2019s shares rose 23% in early trade to a three-month high of 44.28 Norwegian crowns.\n\n\u201cThis company is pulling out all the stops to get better,\u201d analysts at Bernstein wrote in a research note, adding that Norwegian should profit from each aircraft sold to the venture.\n\n\u201cWith a potential gain of up to $10 million per aircraft, it could remove some of the pressure on the equity covenant,\u201d they wrote.\n\nNorwegian cut its 2019 capital expenditure guidance by $200 million this year to $1.0 billion, while raising it by $100 million to $1.4 billion for next year.\n\nNorwegian, which was forced to raise cash from shareholders and postpone debt payments this year, has switched in 2019 to prioritising profits over growth. It said its 2019 cost cuts would save 2.3 billion crowns, more than its original 2 billion crowns target.\n\nIt also narrowed its 2019 guidance for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, and restructuring (EBITDAR), excluding other losses or gains, to 6.1 billion-6.5 billion crowns from billion-7 billion crowns.\n\nIn its new plan of cost cuts, Norwegian said it aimed to improve its annual EBITDAR run-rate by another 4 billion crowns by the end of 2021.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An employee walks past the logo of China Construction Bank at the bank\u2019s Dongguan branch office in Guangdong province, China July 5, 2019.
