Reminder: There are 147 days until the Iowa caucuses and 421 days until the 2020 election.\n\nAccording to the national polls, one candidate \u2014 Joe Biden \u2014 has been leading the Democratic presidential primary by 10 to 20 percentage points, on average, for the last nine months.\n\nYet a presidential primary isn\u2019t decided by national polls, and this weekend \u2014 with a gathering of 19 (19!) Democratic candidates at the state party convention in Manchester, N.H., and a flurry of new data \u2014 made it clear that another candidate has all the momentum where it matters most: Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Warren is underperforming nationally. In fact, she is the only major candidate who has steadily ticked up in national surveys since the start of May, more than doubling her polling average, from 8 percent to 18, over that period of time. Everyone else has slipped.\n\nBut Biden, at about 30 percent, is still far enough ahead to be considered the national frontrunner. And that\u2019s where things get interesting. Look beyond the top-line national polling, and a more complex picture emerges, one that seems to be getting rosier for Warren by the day.\n\nTake Saturday\u2019s convention at Southern New Hampshire University Arena. Anecdotal evidence is worth only so much, but on that front the coverage was unanimous.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren Stands Out at New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention,\u201d read the New York Times headline.\n\nThe Washington Post wrote: \u201cIn New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren Shows Why She\u2019s on the Rise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Massachusetts senator took the stage to a standing ovation that lasted around two minutes,\u201d the Times went on, \u201cand the thunderous applause that frequently interrupted her speech was amplified by the inflatable noisemakers that had been distributed to the crowd.\u201d\n\nWarren holds a baby at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Saturday.

But state convention strength does measure something important: the ground game. And Warren is spending more money, hiring more staff and opening more offices in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada than anyone else. As one Silver State operative put it in August, \u201cWarren has built a monster.\u201d\n\nEven more convincing? The latest early-state data. Over the weekend, Politico asked 100 New Hampshire delegates which candidate they favor. Many remain undecided. But of those with a preference, a full third named Warren. Bernie Sanders finished second. Biden trailed in third. \u201cNotably,\u201d Politico added, \u201cfew undecided delegates named Biden when asked who they were leaning toward.\u201d\n\nNew polling supports Politico\u2019s findings. The last time CBS/YouGov surveyed New Hampshire, in July, Warren (18 percent) trailed Biden (27 percent) and Sanders (20 percent). Now, in a poll released over the weekend, she\u2019s narrowly ahead, with 27 percent of the vote to Biden\u2019s 26 and Sanders\u2019s 25.\n\nThe CBS/YouGov poll also found Warren gaining ground across the early primary states. In July she lagged more than 150 early-state delegates behind Biden. Now, by \u201cgain[ing] delegate share as supporters of other, lower-tier candidates have been switching their preferences toward her,\u201d Warren (with an estimated 545 delegates) is nipping at the heels of the former vice president (who gained only 19 delegates over the last two months, bringing his estimated total to 600).\n\nOverall, 26 percent of early-state voters now list Warren as their first choice, according to CBS/YouGov, followed by Biden at 25 and Sanders at 19. Another 25 percent, meanwhile, list her as their second choice \u2014 far more than the 13 percent who say Biden. And Warren\u2019s second-choice advantage holds in each of the four earliest nominating contests, meaning that as the field narrows, she has a lot more room to grow.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren has steadily ticked up in national surveys since the start of May, more than doubling her polling average, from 8 percent to 18, over that period of time.
