We get on so well \u2013 it\u2019s a very different dynamic to what I\u2019ve had before.\n\n\"She\u2019s just so chilled. It\u2019s really nice to be going into this knowing it\u2019s going to be absolutely dandy. Unlike last year, it\u2019s worked so much better just taking a chilled-out approach to this and going through the process like we would have done, regardless of the shows we\u2019ve been on.\"\n\nSo far, the group of reality stars have been dubbed The Islanders, but it seems they're not keen on that actually being their band name.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nWes said: \"It\u2019s a touchy subject. I\u2019m not saying 'The Islanders' , I\u2019ll look like a f**king idiot.\"\n\nAnd Eyal added: \"We\u2019re still undecided. The Islanders is our name for now. Do you think you\u2019ll surprise some people?\n\nWes jumped in: \"From the outside looking in, you\u2019d think, 'Are they being serious?' I want to shock people and prove we really are artists.\"\n\nThe pals say they're hoping taking part in the show will make people forget they were ever on Love Island.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nWhen asked if that was the aim of the game, Wes said: \"Exactly. Think of Little Mix \u2013 some of them worked in shops beforehand. It\u2019s exactly the same as looking at us on Love Island and saying, 'You\u2019re never going to be the next pop star'.\n\n\"People go on The X Factor with no musical background and end up so successful, so there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t happen to us. We\u2019re bringing the shock factor.\"\n\n* Read the full interview in this week's heat, on sale Tuesday\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
