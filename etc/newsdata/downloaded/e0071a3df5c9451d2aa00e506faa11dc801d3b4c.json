Investment is likely to recover if the agreement is approved by Parliament, he said.\n\nWhile that would make monetary policy \"a little more interesting\", he said it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the BOE would hike interest rates.\n\nJohnson Urges End to Exhausting, Divisive Process\n\nBoris Johnson appealed to MPs to vote for his deal on Saturday, asking them to imagine the feeling of moving on after more than three years of wrangling with the EU.\n\n\"I just kind of invite everybody to imagine what it could be like tomorrow evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to to move on,\" he said in an interview with BBC TV.\n\n\"This has been a long, exhausting and quite divisive business\".\n\nJohnson said his Brexit deal is \"fantastic\" for Northern Ireland, because it \"leaves the EU with the rest of the UK, can take part in free trade deals, there aren't any tariff barriers\". He denied he had broken promises to the DUP in striking his agreement.\n\nIn a separate interview with ITV, Johnson promised a \u201cdeep and special partnership\u201d with the EU that would be based on a \u201cjumbo free trade agreement.\u201d He also said he would provide assurances on environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights -- issues of concern to Labour MPs considering backing him.", "description": "United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson is talking to MPs as he tries to build a majority in Parliament for the Brexit agreement he reached with the European Union on Thursday.", "authors": ["Robert Hutton", "Jessica Shankleman", "Francine Lacqua"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4133/bd9548c8c146436e91edf45fe97615da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
