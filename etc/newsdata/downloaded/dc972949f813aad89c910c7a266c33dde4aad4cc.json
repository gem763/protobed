Oppose a government takeover of the health care industry? Racist. Don\u2019t believe Brett Kavanaugh ran a rape gang as a high school kid? Sexist. You name it, Democrats have a readymade retort set to go. Now, with their latest delusion \u2013 the idea that President Trump was using U.S. aid to Ukraine to force them to \u201cmanufacture dirt\u201d against Joe Biden \u2013 they have added a new comeback: conspiracy theory.\n\nIt\u2019s a term used to dismiss anything inconvenient to the left, and paint anyone questioning their orthodoxy as a loon.\n\nBelieve, after years of anonymous sources leaking cherry-picked snippets of information to select Democrats in the media, that there is a group of people in the government actively working to undermine the Trump administration? You might as well believe the moon landing was filmed on a Hollywood soundstage.\n\nPeople lash out when they have nothing left with which to make their case. For Democrats, that\u2019s become so soon in a debate that an attack is often the first thing out of their mouths. For the entirety of the Obama administration, opposition to his policies and executive orders were denounced as racist so routinely the charge lost all meaning. Not believing the president of the United States could rewrite immigration law with the stroke of his pen (a position Obama held for years, right up until the point he did it) was not greeted with a rationale for the move but cries of bigotry.\n\nThe reason you can\u2019t have a political debate with a Democrat is they have no basis for their actions and policies beyond they want them. The same goes for this \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Washington Post declared \u201cGovernment-by-conspiracy-theory rides again.\u201d In that piece, \u201cnational correspondent\u201d Phil Bump decried any investigation into how the Russian hoax investigation came into being. He wrote that Attorney General \u201cBarr\u2019s efforts are in service to a sprawling conspiracy theory targeting Barr\u2019s own organization along with other components of the U.S. intelligence community. In other words, Barr is asking foreign countries to dig around for evidence of malfeasance by U.S. agencies.\u201d\n\nAfter two years of \u201cTrump is a Russian puppet\u201d having been found untrue, Democrats have no business calling anything a conspiracy. They\u2019d built up Robert Mueller to walk on water, that their dreams sank with his report pushed them over the edge.\n\nThe Russian hoax was the ultimate conspiracy, and it was perpetrated by Democrats. There wasn\u2019t one journalist at these liberal outlets who\u2019d even entertain the idea that the Trump campaign was anything but guilty. Discussions on cable news were not about \u201cwhat if\u201d it were true, they were about what it being true would mean and where it would lead.\n\nThe president was declared guilty, the impeachment cake had been ordered. It just turned out to be crow.\n\nWithout a beat, media Democrats moved on to the next attempt to destroy Donald Trump.\n\nThey thought they had him with Ukraine. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d used all the right buzzwords, the drool started flowing again. It just so happened that the words in the report didn\u2019t add up to the words in the actual transcript of the phone call in question.\n\nThere are 540 words between \u201cfavor\u201d and \u201cBiden\u201d in the transcript and, most importantly, the actual favor the president was asking for \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s assistance in investigating Ukrainian attempts to help Hillary Clinton in 2016. If there was a hunger among Democrats to protect our elections, wouldn\u2019t getting to the bottom of what actually happened the last time be a good place to start?\n\nNope, it\u2019s a conspiracy. So is wondering how Biden\u2019s drug-abusing kid managed to make a fortune from countries he had no background with in industries he had no experience in. And wondering how the Obama administration could spy on the Trump campaign under the guise of an unpaid advisor being a spy himself, yet that person never facing any charges whatsoever because he wasn\u2019t a spy, is the same as believing aliens reside at Area 51.\n\nChuck Todd lost his mind Sunday when Senator Ron Johnson dared raise questions liberals don\u2019t want the public to contemplate. \u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here,\u201d Todd yelled before screaming down Johnson. Two CNN \u201cmedia reporters\u201d called Fox viewers and anyone who doesn\u2019t subscribe to their worldview a conspiracy nut.\n\nPeople with the truth on their side don\u2019t have to work this hard to get people to believe them, they don\u2019t have to demonize those who don\u2019t. Liberals will still call you a racist/sexist/homophobe/xenophobe/whatever, but now they have a new arrow in their quiver. The only one they\u2019re missing is the truth. That might be the biggest conspiracy of them all.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "Liberals always have a \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist\u201d round chambered, ready .10/08/2019 1:11:16AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/3bbe62de-7a45-453d-844e-7d8a20ffc26b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
