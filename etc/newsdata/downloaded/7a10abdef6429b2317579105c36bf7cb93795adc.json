You\u2019ll Hate Mike Pence\u2019s $600,000 Limo Bill", "language": "en", "text": "On Wednesday, a story from a conservative news outlet that shall not be named\u2014nor linked to\u2014attempted to manufacture outrage over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s hair salon bill: There was a reported $80 cut, $180 for lowlights, and pure speculation about a $52 tip, for a grand total of approximately $312. The (pretty deluded) message? How dare a democratic socialist\u2014and someone in the public eye whose appearance very much matters, for better or for worse\u2014get a haircut at market price for a major metropolis?\n\nOther publications have subsequently seized on the invented \u201ccontroversy,\u201d even if no one seems truly mad about it except for conservative talking heads. On the contrary, much of the outrage online seems to be on AOC\u2019s behalf\u2014that harping on her haircut is gendered (recall Mitt Romney\u2019s comparably priced $70 cut back in 2011, or John Edwards\u2019s $1,250 hair bills in 2007). But leaping to AOC\u2019s defense can feel pretty senseless when, in fact, no one is better at crafting the perfect response to hypocrisy and nonsense than AOC herself.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of AOC supremely owning Twitter, the New York congresswoman noted that if you\u2019re mad about her $80 haircut, which, by the way, she paid for herself, you\u2019re bound to hate vice president Mike Pence\u2019s $600,000 limo bill from his official visit to Ireland last month, which, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Pence billed to taxpayers. You know, the same who should be offended by AOC\u2019s hair-care regimen. Citing State Department contracts, CREW writes that Pence racked up the steep bill because, despite meetings in Dublin, the VP elected to drive four hours away in order to stay at\u2014imagine a patented Coleen Rooney ellipsis here\u2014President Trump\u2019s golf resort in Doonbeg.\n\nSo why is AOC\u2019s private salon bill up for debate while Pence\u2019s public limo tab flies under the radar? Because there are ceaseless attempts to warp her party affiliation and deploy it against her, including suggestions that she should get her hair cut only at the Capitol Hill barbershop. \u201c40 million Americans live in poverty under today\u2019s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures,\u201d she tweeted on Thursday.\n\nBut, let\u2019s face it, even if AOC got a $20 Dumb and Dumber bowl cut, she\u2019d still be a thorn in the collective conservative side because she is both effective and polished, a fact that only seems to make her feel more threatening to her critics. There is a continued focus on her appearance from Fox News and the like. In the past, her clothes were the \u201ccontroversy,\u201d from that from-behind photo taken without her consent and tweeted (and later deleted) by Washington Examiner columnist Ed Scarry, who quipped that AOC\u2019s jacket and coat \u201cdon\u2019t look like a girl who struggles\u201d to the manufactured \u201coutrage\u201d over the borrowed $3,000 Gabriela Hearst suit she wore, fleetingly, for a photo shoot in Interview magazine. It\u2019s almost as if people don\u2019t think AOC deserves to dress, and look, the part of congresswoman.\n\nReliably, AOC had the sharpest reply to the latest wave of attention around her appearance. \u201cOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people,\u201d she tweeted on Thursday of Democratic socialism. As for her critics: \u201cThey\u2019re just mad we look good doing it.\u201d Now that\u2019s a hair flip.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "On Wednesday, a story from a conservative news outlet attempted to manufacture outrage over the congresswoman\u2019s hair salon bill.", "authors": ["Michelle Ruiz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XcllaIKPk.UUwRh.2Isa1Q--~B/aD0yOTExO3c9NDM2NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/264518ff1850105e64acd0861ce42567", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
