And surprisingly, while the massive inflow of dust caused global temperatures on Earth to plummet, it also provided a chance for new evolving species to flourish.\n\nThe 93-mile-wide asteroid was in the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter when it collided with something else and broke apart, creating a wealth of dust that flooded the inner solar system.\n\n\"It is analogous to standing in the middle of your living room and smashing a vacuum cleaner bag, only at a much larger scale,\" said Birger Schmitz, lead study author and professor of geology at Lund University.\n\nEarth is no stranger to the inflow of space material, like pieces of comets and asteroids.\n\n\"Normally, Earth gains about 40,000 tons of extraterrestrial material every year,\" said Philipp Heck, study author, a curator at the Field Museum and associate professor at the University of Chicago. \"Imagine multiplying that by a factor of a thousand or ten thousand.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Earth endured an ancient ice age 466 million years ago when a giant asteroid broke apart and sent waves of dust toward our planet over the next 2 million years, according to a new study.
