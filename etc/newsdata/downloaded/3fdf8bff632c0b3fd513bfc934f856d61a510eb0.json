RWC100: 40-21 1/21 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 40: Phil Kearns Known for his fiery character and physical approach, Kearns was hugely influential not just in 1991 but in 1999 too. Even though injury curtailed his third World Cup campaign, Kearns was a key figure in helping the Wallabies win the World Cup for the second time. Getty Images 3/21 39: George Smith Smith never won the World Cup, making his Wallabies debut after the 1999 triumph, but there are few players who deserved to do so. He changed the game for openside flankers, and the respect he earned from back-row opponents stemmed from what a formidable force he was to compete against. Getty Images 4/21 38: Ruben Kruger Scored the try in the controversial 1995 semi-final that kept the Springboks on course for glory. Sadly, Kruger passed away at the start of the decade after a 10-year battle with brain cancer. AFP/Getty Images 5/21 37: Sam Whitelock Incredibly, Whitelock could become one of three players who win the World Cup for a third consecutive time this tournament alongside Kieran Read and Sonny Bill Williams, and he is young enough to have a crack at 2023 too. Whitelock is sometimes overshadowed by his younger teammate Brodie Retallick, but what he has given the All Blacks should not be underestimated. Getty Images 6/21 36: Jerome Kaino One of the most powerful and physically-dominating blindside flankers the game has seen, Kaino brought a ferocious intensity to the game that helped him to World Cup wins in 2011 and 2015. Getty Images 7/21 35: Percy Montgomery South Africa's goal-kicking full-back of the 2007 World Cup triumph, Montgomery was one of the best all-round players of his time - represented by the fact he finished his career with 102 caps to his name. Getty Images 8/21 34: Jason Little The other part of the Australian centre pairing that dominated the 1990s, Little often competed with Daniel Herbert to partner Tim Horan. Getty Images 9/21 33: Bakkies Botha A Goliath on the pitch and not someone you wanted to run into, Botha formed a formidable partnership with Victor Matfield as South Africa won the 2007 World Cup. His lineout presence was intimidating enough before he'd even left the ground, while he wasn't half-bad at carrying either. Getty Images 10/21 32: Christophe Lamaison His performance against New Zealand in 1999 semi-finals remains one of the great individual displays in World Cup history. Lamaison was stereotypical of what French rugby is about: gifted athleticism, natural ability and a flare that was delightful to watch. His impact on Kiwi rugby remains to this day. AFP/Getty Images 11/21 31: Lawrence Dallaglio One of the players who learned from the errors of 1999 to dazzle in 2003. Remembered for making the break that set-up Jason Robinson's try in the World Cup final, but contributed so much more to England's campaign. Getty Images 12/21 30: Schalk Burger If Bakkies Botha wasn't bad enough, South Africa also possessed the mean Schalk Burger in their pack that inflicted plenty of punishment in opponents. Not always on the right side of the law, Burger remains one of the most combative flankers seen in the game, relying on his brute strength and athletic ability to wreak havoc at the breakdown. Getty Images 13/21 29: Joel Stransky Kicked all 15 points in South Africa's triumphant 1995 World Cup final effort, with his extra-time drop-goal going down in history as one of the epic World Cup moments. Getty Images 14/21 28: Conrad Smith One half of New Zealand's almighty centre pairing that proved pivotal in the 2011 and 2015 triumphs. Smith was never the most exciting or most dangerous player on the field, but he was the glue that held the back line together and without him, the All Blacks would not be what they are today. Getty Images 15/21 27: John Smit South Africa's 2007 World Cup-winning captain made the brave decision to convert from a prop to a hooker and reaped the rewards by leading his country to glory. Lead by example as he never shied away from battle on the pitch, but a gentleman off it. Getty Images 16/21 26: Victor Matfield His experience, leadership and calmness under pressure were big factors in South Africa's success over the decade he featured in. Came out of retirement for one last crack in 2015, though his best days were behind him by then. Getty Images 17/21 25: Richard Hill Played just three matches at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, but so important was he to England's hopes that Sir Clive Woodward was happy to carry him through the tournament knowing how much they needed him in the final. However, it was his semi-final return from injury that really stood out, keeping England's World Cup hopes alive against Wales. Getty Images 18/21 24: Zinzan Brooke One of the most gifted players in history. A No 8 with the carrying ability of a tight-forward and the passing and kicking skills of an out-half. A World Cup winner who spent a decade at the top of the game. Getty Images 19/21 23: Ma'a Nonu The other half of New Zealand's unrivalled centre pairing, Nonu overcame early struggles in his international career to become a force to be reckoned with. He provided one of the moments of the 2015 World Cup when he scored from nearly halfway in the final against Australia. Getty Images 20/21 22: Serge Blanco An enigma on the field who played with panache that befitted French rugby at the time. The full-back starred at the 1987 World Cup where France just came up short in the final, and hung up his boots after one last crack at it in 1991. AFP/Getty Images 21/21 21: Kieran Read The man who emerged from the shadow of Richie McCaw to lead the All Blacks, Read was a key figure in the 2011 and 2015 World Cup efforts. Getty Images 1/21 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 40: Phil Kearns Known for his fiery character and physical approach, Kearns was hugely influential not just in 1991 but in 1999 too.
