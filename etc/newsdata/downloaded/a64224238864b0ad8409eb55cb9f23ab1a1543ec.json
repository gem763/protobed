Where compassion is demanded, the welfare offices all too often dispense callousness.\n\nTaina Clarke is an Army veteran working toward a paralegal degree. In 2015 , she visited an H.R.A. office to fix a clerical error. After more than a two-hour wait, Ms. Clarke, concerned about picking up her son s from a babysitter , asked to see a supervisor. An officer approached her instead, and slammed her facedown onto a counter in front of a roomful of people still waiting to be seen.\n\n\u201cGet off her, she\u2019s so little!\u201d Ms. Clarke remembers hearing someone shout. The officer dragged her like a rag doll to a closet and threw her inside , she said. As he tried to slam the door shut, a female bystander stuck out her foot to stop the door from closing. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for her, I don\u2019t know what he would have done to me,\u201d Ms. Clarke said.\n\nH.R.A. officers arrested Ms. Clarke and charged her with trespassing, a charge that was later dismissed. She f iled a claim and eventually received a $45,000 settlement from the city. The H.R.A. took no action against the two officers named in the case, but both were later fired over unrelated issues, city officials said.\n\nThe stories share a pattern: A person waits for hours to see a caseworker, then is ordered by a peace officer to leave the office for a capricious reason, like asking to see a supervisor or using a cellphone. As the person leaves the building, he or she is jumped by a group of officers, often in an elevator, staircase or doorway.\n\nIn most of the cases reviewed by The Times, the officers are accused in court documents of making false arrests for charges like trespassing or disorderly conduct, after physically attacking someone. The charges are regularly dropped.\n\nIn December 2018, a viral video of Jazmine Headley, a young mother arrested at a Brooklyn H.R.A. center, offered a glimpse at the broken system. H.R.A. and police officers loomed over the unarmed black woman as her 1-year-old son was ripped from her arms. The dispute began when an officer told Ms. Headley she wasn\u2019t allowed to sit on the floor, though no seats were available.", "description": "An investigation reveals a troubling pattern of abuse against one of New York\u2019s most vulnerable populations.", "authors": ["Mara Gay", "Emma Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/opinion/28rhaprint/merlin_160262124_ba4ea026-5801-437e-879f-c60f663cefea-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
