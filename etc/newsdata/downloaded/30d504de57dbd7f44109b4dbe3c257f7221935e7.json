The dramatic images in the heart of Hong Kong served as the latest reminder that three months of demonstrations against China\u2019s grip over the city are unlikely to end soon.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam last week said she would formally withdraw a bill allowing extraditions to the mainland, which triggered the unrest in early June. But demonstrators now have a host of other demands, and Beijing has ruled out the biggest one: the right to elect a leader of their choosing.\n\nIn newspaper advertisements last month, Li called for an end to the violence in a poetic message that some interpreted as calling for those in power to stop persecution, while others said it meant to urge protesters to stop disrupting the city.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Shirley Zhao in Hong Kong at xzhao306@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Watkins at dwatkins19@bloomberg.net, Sam Nagarajan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong\u2019s richest man urged the government to \u201chave mercy\u201d in dealing with the unrest that has rocked the city this summer, describing recent months of protests as its worst crisis since World War II.Li Ka-shing, whose conglomerate is among Hong Kong\u2019s most dominant business empires,", "authors": ["Shirley Zhao"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
