Blockchain hype has led financial institutions (FIs) to pour money into the space and into distributed ledger technology more broadly: about $1.7 billion annually as of 2018, per research from Greenwich Associates cited by Bloomberg. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nDespite the hype, sentiment around the technology has grown increasingly skeptical as FIs struggle to realize the value of their investments. Incumbents have shuttered some early experiments, and FI execs are beginning to discuss blockchain's prospects in bearish terms.\n\nKey difficulties include scaling the technology for commercial application, ongoing regulatory uncertainty, and the difficulty of bringing together competing participants.\n\nYet amid the noise, it's becoming more clear where exactly blockchain has value, and some players are beginning to make genuine inroads in their adoption and deployment of the technology. Those who are finding success are both pushing back against souring industry sentiment and setting themselves up as industry leaders.\n\nIn The Blockchain in Banking Report, Business Insider Intelligence explores early blockchain successes and failures at four major banks, identifies the lessons these early wins \u2014 and losses \u2014 have for the rest of the financial services industry, and outlines actionable steps that industry players can take to ensure the success of their own blockchain projects.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), Bank of America (BofA), Citi Bank, CME Group, Fidelity Investments, HSBC, IBM, JPMorgan, Marco Polo, Mastercard, Nasdaq, PayPal, Ripple, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Santander, SWIFT, and Visa.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nBlockchain has been one of the most hyped technologies within financial services, heralded for its potential to eliminate pain points across the industry.\n\nDespite this enthusiasm, questions have come up about the technology's efficacy as FIs struggle to actualize blockchain solutions.
