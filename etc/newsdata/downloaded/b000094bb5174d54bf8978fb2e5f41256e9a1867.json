If you haven\u2019t started vaping, don\u2019t start.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, lawmaker Cheri Helt asked governor Kate Brown to immediately issue a temporary ban on the sale of all vaping products until health experts better understand the cause of the illnesses.\n\nMs Helt, a Republican from the small city of Bend, in Oregon, said in a statement: \u201cOregon needs an immediate pause in sales and stronger, longer-term regulation of all vaping-related products to save lives, prevent addiction and protect public health.\u201d\n\nOregon has so far linked five cases to the national outbreak of severe lung injury thought to be caused by vapes and e-cigarettes.
