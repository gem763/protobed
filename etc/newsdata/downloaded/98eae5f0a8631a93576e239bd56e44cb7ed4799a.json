I cannot believe what I had been with.'\n\nKelvin Cornwell was jailed for eight years, with a three year extended licence period\n\nShe had been beaten up three or four times before by 'evil' Cornwell, who began his campaign of abuse on Valentine's Day in 2018.\n\nHe would 'wait for a special occasion', buy her a new dress, tell her to get her hair done and book a restaurant, then 'flip.'\n\nEarlier this year, Ms Griffin knew she had to escape the relationship 'for the sake of her unborn child'.\n\nBut Griffin found out she was leaving after finding a text on her phone and beat her so viciously on March 4 that she had to spend the next three weeks in hospital.\n\nNeighbours who heard the commotion called the police.\n\nMs Griffin added: 'The police had come to the door so Kelvin had demanded I get up and get in the shower to clean myself. He said I had to tell them someone else had beaten me up.\n\n'I don't know how I managed to get up from that floor, but I did. The next thing I knew I was in the back of an ambulance.\n\n'The police didn't believe what Kelvin was telling them because, I have been told, the house looked like a murder scene, and a blood-splattered hammer was found on the floor.'\n\nMs Griffin only learned Cornwell, from Preston, had previously beat 17 other woman when it emerged during his trial\n\nAfter her hospital stay, she was sectioned for two months because her emotional state was so severe.\n\nShe still suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but has since given birth to her healthy little boy, Callum, now seven months old.\n\nShe added: 'I would wake up screaming. I don't think I've had a night that's been nightmare-free since it happened.'\n\nMs Griffin said Cornwell was a 'real gent' when they first met after she moved to Preston from Manchester.\n\nShe said: 'Then the emotional abuse started. He'd say things like, \"You're ugly\", or '\"I'm the only one who'll ever love you\".\n\n'He controlled what I wore, I couldn't wear anything tight or stylish, I had to be covered up. The usual things people do like going to the gym or shopping were big nos.\n\n'He would turn my friends and family against me - he'd smash my phones up so I couldn't contact people.\n\n'He would tell me to kill myself, or say that he would. He made me believe I'd get into trouble if I told anyone what was happening, and that it would be easier to kill myself.'\n\nDespite the abuse, Ms Griffin said she was lucky to escape with her life. 'I could have been a statistic, one of those women killed at the hands of their abusive partners.\n\n'I could have died that day, so I know I am lucky, though I find it hard to carry on, I daren't even go out.\n\n'As an ex-soldier he always said he had contacts and that he could keep me under surveillance, so I'm still scared.\n\n'I now have to take each day as it comes and warn others what he's like in the hope that nobody else suffers at his hands, like myself and others have.'", "description": "Kelvin Cornwell, from Preston, battered Gemma Griffin with such force he smashed her skull, nose and cheekbones, leaving the mother-of-three unrecognisable.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20125314-0-image-a-31_1571913618167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
