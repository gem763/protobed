He spent about 10 seconds looking at it, then pushed it aside and said, 'Is this one important to you? Do you really want it? Is it another Pixar?'\"\n\nJobs was the majority shareholder of Pixar, which Disney acquired in 2006. He was also a board member of The Walt Disney Company.\n\n\"I told [Jobs] that I wasn't sure if it was another Pixar, but they had great talent at the company, and the content was so rich that if we held the IP, it would put some real distance between us and everyone else,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said that he asked Jobs to reach out to Marvel's chairman and former CEO Ike Perlmutter to \"vouch for me.\"\n\n\"Later, after we'd closed the deal, Ike told me that he'd still had his doubts and the call from Steve made a big difference,\" Iger said. \"'He said you were true to your word,' Ike said. I was grateful that Steve was willing to do it as a friend, really, more than as the most influential member of our board.\"\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed over $22.5 billion worldwide over 23 movies (the first few of which were distributed by Paramount).
