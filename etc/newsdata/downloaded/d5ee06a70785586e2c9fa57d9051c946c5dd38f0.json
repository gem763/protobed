And she feels confident that now would be the right time to do it, given the warm reception for other reboots like \"Fuller House.\"\n\n\"I just wouldn't want to do anything ... less than it is,\u201d says Murphy, while attending the Hollywood Museum Celebrates The 55th Anniversary Of Gilligan's Island event.\n\n'BEWITCHED' STAR ERIN MURPHY: 'ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY HAD A DIRTY SENSE OF HUMOR AND SO DO I'\n\n\"It\u2019s hard because the show was so good and a lot of times people do reboots just to kind of get out there and make a little extra money. But I feel like the show was good and it's done.\" \u2014 Murphy on a potential 'Bewitched' reboot\n\nMurphy made a guest appearance in the television series \"Lassie\" after he time on \"Bewitched\" and has acted in a handful of TV series and made-for-TV movies, but she has largely stayed out of the limelight. Her decision for doing so, she said, had nothing to do with being tired out from the fame and everything to do with her kids.\n\n'BEWITCHED' SECRETS: 6 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW\n\n\u201cI have a family. So I kind of made a lot of decisions based on having kids and what jobs I could do and still be home to get them to school and home from school,\" she says. \"I think most of my decisions were formed by being a parent.\"\n\nBut Murphy reveals that over the years she\u2019s worked as a makeup artist and reminds fans that she did have a stint as a correspondent for Fox Reality for seven years.\n\nAnd though she gets the acting bug every now and then, Murphy says she\u2019s enjoyed being able to cash in her residual checks and live a relatively normal life all these years.\n\n\u201cI've always had a really good balance. When I was on 'Bewitched,' I still had breaks from the show where I was a normal kid and now I have just the right amount of fame where I could go to the Emmys and some of the fun things but I can still be incognito too. So it's a good balance,\u201d she explains, adding that she is occasionally stopped on the street by people who associate her with the show.\n\n'BEWITCHED' REBOOT IN THE WORKS AT ABC: REPORT\n\n\u201cShockingly that does happen!\u201d she proclaims. \u201cFans come up to me and say how much they love the show: \u2018Oh my gosh, we loved you. We grew up with you,\u2019 that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nBut once an actor always an actor -- and Murphy admits that she does sometimes get tempted to hop back into her childhood profession.\n\n\"I basically said I retired a year ago. I bought a house on the beach in Malibu and my dream car and I thought, 'When are you supposed to enjoy your life?'\" \u2014 Murphy on leaving acting\n\n\u201cI talk about it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don't even have a regular agent. I have a hosting agent so I do hosting gigs and international things but I don't know. Every now and then I have friends on a series and they'll bring me in for something.\n\n\"I basically said I retired a year ago,\" she adds. \"I bought a house on the beach in Malibu and my dream car and I thought, 'When are you supposed to enjoy your life?'\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAs for where Tabitha Stephens would be today? Murphy says their lives would look pretty similar.\n\n\u201cI think she would be a mom maybe living by the beach,\u201d she says, with a laugh. \u201cI kind of feel like I have her life now. So definitely a mom, probably using her magic a little more than her mom did,\u201d she proclaims, with a grin.", "description": "Erin Murphy -- who played Tabitha Stephens on the classic television series from 1966 to 1972\u00a0-- told\u00a0Fox News that she is handed scripts for a new rendition of the show every few years.", "authors": ["Nicole Pajer", "Murphy On A Potential 'Bewitched' Reboot", "Murphy On Leaving Acting"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177190242.jpg"}
