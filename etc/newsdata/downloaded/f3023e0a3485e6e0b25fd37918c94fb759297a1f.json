But things didn\u2019t quite go to plan on the other side of the Channel.\n\nFor the first time in three years the Brexit deal passed parliament but minutes later - but the vote to go ahead with the process of passing it in just three days was roundly rejected.\n\nWith hopes of getting Brexit done by the end of the month dashed, MEPs found themselves once again watching and waiting for some clarity to come out Westminster.\n\nMember of the Greens group in the European Parliament Bas Eickhout told Euronews that he_\"fully understands that the parliament is asking for more time because this is a huge deal. If you are then saying, 'let's deal with this hundreds of pages, that's totally ridiculous.\"_\n\nThe co-leaders of the Greens Philippe Lamberts added:\n\n\"Even if the British side ratifies after a few weeks, we will need a number of weeks to ratify here [at the European Parliament]. So if only for that, 31 January is reasonable.\"\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, Christian Democrat MEP Manfred Webe says \"if the UK Labour party is successful and they go for a second referendum, then it's their choice. It would be a good choice in my understanding, but it's their choice to do so. We are in the hands of London and again an extension should be granted.\"\n\nMEPs call for consequences for Turkey...\n\nThis week wasn\u2019t just about Brexit though.\n\nOn Wednesday in Strasbourg, MEPs called for EU sanctions against Turkey for its offensive in Syria.\n\nThis in addition to a number of senior MEPs calling for more support for children stuck in Syria after watching a special Euronews documentary.\n\nThere are hundreds minors who are EU nationals taken to the country by their parents.\n\n\u201cWe need to pave the way for a good European strategy for helping these children because they really are the victims of the terrorists\" said former European Parliament President Antonio Tajani.\n\nFarewell Tusk and Juncker...\n\nIt was swansong speeches from European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the Strasbourg session. The two Presidents made their final appearances here before handing over the reins of power to their successors.\n\nThe European Union they\u2019re handing over doesn't look to be growing - both men expressed their regret at the blocking of accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania.\n\nLooking ahead...\n\nBack in Brussels next week, it\u2019ll be ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s turn to say goodbye.\n\nIt's also Belgium\u2019s time to decide what to do about the Catalan leader Carles Puidgemont who Spanish want repatriated.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll mark the day Britain should have left the EU.\n\nWe'll leave you though with some warm words paid by the arch Eurosceptic Nigel Farage to the passionate Europhile\u2026 Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n\"I think it's important particularly given the polarity of politics these days to understand, you can take a different point of view from someone, but actually like them as a person, and I've always enjoyed his company\" Nigel Farage told Euronews.", "description": "In the State of the Union, we look at the delay to Brexit that Boris Johnson promised wouldn't happen, the call from MEPs for EU sanctions for Turkey and the farewell to Tusk and Juncker.", "authors": ["Jack Parrock"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/85/54/1000x563_cmsv2_c470a6f5-6eb5-5e58-866e-65816e8b718e-4258554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
