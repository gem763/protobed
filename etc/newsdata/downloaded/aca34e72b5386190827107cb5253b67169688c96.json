Who can better relate to such a sentiment than someone who retreated from the public eye for four years, only to return to vicious commentary about her appearance? Zellweger\u2019s struggles may not have involved Garland\u2019s addictions and custody battle, but the 50-year-old actor nonetheless brings a meta connection to the renaissance she\u2019s currently enjoying on behalf of \u201cJudy.\u201d\n\nIn the rousing showbiz lark \u201cChicago,\u201d which came on the heels of her star-making turns in \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary,\u201d Zellweger played a striver seduced by the glitz of fame. In \u201cJudy,\u201d she plays a bigwig hiding from it. As thoroughly as she morphs into Garland, that famous Zellweger panache doesn\u2019t go anywhere. The acting tics that made her a powerhouse of the 2000s \u2015 distended lips, shy smile, breathy vehemence, fidgety arms \u2015 are essential here. Those years when Hollywood reduced her to the dowdy wife (\u201cCinderella Man\u201d) or the self-absorbed clich\u00e9 (\u201cNew in Town\u201d), only to later question why she could have wanted to escape herself cosmetically, become the fulcrum for Zellweger\u2019s rebound.\n\nWatching \u201cJudy,\u201d which chronicles its subject\u2019s final year, specifically her five-week residency at a London nightclub in 1969, is like watching Zellweger walk a tightrope. Can she pull off the complex physicality and robust contralto? Garland\u2019s fans used to wonder the same thing. When Zellweger soars, so does your heart. The movie is most alive during her musical numbers. Judy takes the stage to perform \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d and it\u2019s a once-in-a-lullaby trance \u2014 an artist who is, finally, where she\u2019s meant to be, just as Zellweger is meant to be onscreen. That\u2019s a triumphant arc, as if the movie exists to remind us what brought Zellweger to our attention in the first place. The story of a Hollywood dignitary subsumed by an industry that applies heightened scrutiny to women finds added resonance.\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger in \"Judy,\" opening Sept. 27. (Photo: Roadside Attractions) More\n\nZellweger is one of several stars appearing in Oscar-season vehicles that directly or indirectly comment on their storied careers \u2014 roles that flourish because it\u2019s this person inhabiting that character. There\u2019s Eddie Murphy portraying a profane comedian in \u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d Adam Sandler testing the limits of a protagonist\u2019s unlikeability in \u201cUncut Gems\u201d and Shia LaBeouf reckoning with his aggro notoriety in \u201cHoney Boy.\u201d\n\nAll four actors, whose movies screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, have hit something of an impasse in recent years, either vanishing entirely or hitting the same notes time and again. Now, a timeless movie-star trial follows: How do their respective legacies inform this chapter, and what will it take to get audiences to see them in a different light?\n\nMurphy, like Zellweger, discovered Hollywood lost any sense of what to do with him. Once ranked among comedy\u2019s most reliable leading men, he scaled back on live-action work after his \u201cDreamgirls\u201d boon gave way to \u201cNorbit\u201d (2007), \u201cMeet Dave\u201d (2008) and \u201cImagine That\u201d (2009). Critics savaged all three films, and the box-office revenue was equally rough. Murphy\u2019s fast-talking theatrics \u2014 so winning in edgy \u201980s and \u201990s hallmarks like \u201cBeverly Hills Cop,\u201d \u201cComing to America\u201d and \u201cBowfinger\u201d \u2014 had become one-joke gambits. If \u201cThe Nutty Professor\u201d flaunted his range, it also turned into a curse. Afterward, most writers handed him increasingly childish buffoonery (\u201cThe Adventures of Pluto Nash,\u201d \u201cDaddy Day Care\u201d).", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler and Shia LaBeouf step into rich roles that double as meta commentary on their careers.", "authors": ["Matthew Jacobs"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/euz1NSRjpVkH3XL8uMRM.w--~B/aD05NzI7dz0xNzI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a42322200003300fbb906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
