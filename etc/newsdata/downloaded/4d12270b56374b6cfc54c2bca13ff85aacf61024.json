We can we must and we will, even though things have not been made easier by the surrender bill.\"\n\nDowning Street refused to comment but claimed the UK would be leaving the EU on October 31.\n\nBrexiteer Tory MP Steve Baker tweeted: \u201cA source confirms all this means is that Government will obey the law.\n\n\u201cIt does not mean we will extend.\n\n\u201cIt does not mean we will stay in the EU beyond Oct 31. We will leave.\u201d\n\nThe apparent contradiction suggests the PM could formally request an extension but plead with EU leaders not to grant it.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nOr he could ask an ally to veto a delay.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: \"Boris said we would leave by October 31st 'do or die'.\n\n\"Why does he keep saying things that are not true?\"\n\nThe bombshell risks exploding the Conservative leader\u2019s shaky authority after he vowed he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than plead for another delay to Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the bloc.\n\nUnder a law passed last month, the PM must seek an extension from Brussels if he is unable to get a withdrawal deal through Parliament by October 19.\n\nDowning Street hopes final details can be thrashed out at a crunch summit on October 17-18.\n\nBut if there is no-deal, legislation known as the Benn Act \u2013 named after its architect, Labour MP Hilary Benn \u2013 means he must ask for a delay.\n\nThe PM controversially branded the law \u201cthe Surrender Act\u201d and said it made negotiating more difficult.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nUntil yesterday, Mr Johnson claimed the Government would obey the law \u2013 but also insisted he would never seek an extension.\n\nPapers submitted to the Court of Session in Edinburgh suggest he has blinked and is ready to do just that.\n\nDocuments lodged with Scotland\u2019s highest civil court outline that the PM would not attempt to frustrate the Benn Act.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Copenhagen alongside his Danish counterpart, Irish PM Leo Varadkar indicated he would back a further delay.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy preference is that we come to an agreement and that we have a deal by the middle of October.\n\n\u201cBut if the UK government were to request an extension, of course we would consider it.\n\n\u201cBut I think most EU countries would really only consider it for a good reason, and that reason would have to be put forward.\n\n\u201cBut certainly an extension would be better than no-deal.\u201d\n\nThe move came as the PM battled to save his Brexit blueprint.\n\nHis plan to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic includes effectively leaving the province in the EU\u2019s Single Market, but pulling it out of the Customs Union alongside the rest of the UK.\n\nCustoms checks will take place away from the 310-mile frontier.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThere will be a crucial role for the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has not sat since the power-sharing executive collapsed in January 2017.\n\nThe Assembly would have to approve the plan every four years - potentially giving the Democratic Unionist Party a veto.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith was holding talks with provincial party leaders at Hillsborough Castle, Belfast, yesterday in a bid to rally support for the plan.\n\nHe also hoped to kick-start moves to restore the Assembly so it can give its approval.\n\nDublin has poured cold water on the PM\u2019s plan.\n\nMr Johnson is due to meet Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar next week, as well as launching a whistle-stop tour of European capitals as he tries to win over EU leaders.\n\nDublin and Brussels have urged No10 to publish the full legal text of its proposals.\n\nThe document was handed to negotiators in secret on Wednesday.\n\nBut EU leaders want it made public.\n\nNo10 could agree if it means formal negotiations can quickly reopen.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cIt\u2019s something that we will consider.\u201d\n\nUK teams are ready to resume talks over the weekend - and the European Commission made clear time was tight.\n\nCommission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said: \u201cWhat we have always said is that every day counts, especially as we near the end of October.\n\n\u201cTechnical-level meetings are currently ongoing in order to give the United Kingdom opportunity to present their proposals in more detail but no deadline has been set.\u201d", "description": "The PM has said Britain would leave the EU \"do or die\" on October 31", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Sky News", "Twitter", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20394514.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
