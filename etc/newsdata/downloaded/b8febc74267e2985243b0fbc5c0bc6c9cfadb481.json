'In this case, when considering their attachment force, our suction cups are better.'\n\nThe Northern clingfish can lift over twelve times its bodyweight, something researchers were eager to model.\n\nResearchers anticipate their technology will have a wide variety of uses, including subaquatic robots to clean algae and debris off of boat hulls and better tagging equipment for marine biologists who study whales.\n\nThe research could even improve the suction strength of everyday shower caddies.", "description": "Scientists at the University of Washington have made a major breakthrough in suction research by recreating the powerful suction cup on the underside of the Northern clingfish.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19417098-0-image-a-19_1570488075139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
