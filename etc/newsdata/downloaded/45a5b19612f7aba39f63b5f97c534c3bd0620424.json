Officers say he was unable to get himself out of the pool, so they put in a set of wooden steps.\n\nAccording to the television station WMUR, conservation officers worked late into the evening on Tuesday trying to help the moose out of the pool before \u201ceventually letting the animal have the pool to itself overnight\u201d, finally coaxing it out early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe department posted a video of the moose looking back and forth as the team held a rope and encouraging him toward the edge of the pool. After clambering out of the water, he scampered away.\n\nWazza the koala survives 110km/h trip on NSW highway with only a gravel rash Read more\n\nCol Kevin Jordan suggests it had to do with it being moose breeding season.\n\nHe told WMUR that \u201cthe younger moose will wander long distances struggling to find a female\u201d.\n\n\n\nJordan added that the creature must have caused quite a splash when the homeowners found it. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine \u2026 going to the sliding glass doors and looking out there and seeing a 1,200lb moose or 800lb moose in my pool.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post to accompany the video, the New Hampshire fish and game department wrote:\n\n\u201cWith the moose breeding season beginning to ramp up, bulls are on the move looking for mates. In his travels, this young bull accidentally found his way into a swimming pool in Bedford last night. NHF&G Wildlife Biologists, with assistance from local Conservation Officers, were able to help remove the moose from the pool. The moose was unable to get himself out after several hours as the pool had no stairs. By putting a set of wooden steps in the pool and coaxing the moose towards them, he was able to find his way out and back in to the woods.\u201d", "description": "New Hampshire fish and game officers built steps for the young male and eventually coaxed it out", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3579507d749068cc73458f25a598a97a41ce2be0/0_0_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e24151ee14f7d31191adbeaf23d487e"}
