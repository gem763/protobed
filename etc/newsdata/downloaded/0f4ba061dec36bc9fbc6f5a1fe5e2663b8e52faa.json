Photo: Noah Fecks\n\nIf you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ve probably wondered what famous people add to their carts. Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the hand sanitizer and the electric toothbrush. And in celebration of New York Taste, we\u2019re going to be asking some of the 40-plus chefs and mixologists whose food and drinks will be served on October 21 about the things they can\u2019t live without. (You can learn more about New York Taste and buy tickets here.) Next up is Chintan Pandya, executive chef of Adda Indian Canteen and Rahi, on his must-have backpack, protein bars, and kitchen tweezers.\n\nBeatsX Wireless in-Ear Headphones I like the convenience of these. Whenever I get a call, I don\u2019t need to hold my phone in my hand, I just put on my headphones. In the morning, because we have multiple things happening [at the restaurants], we have to be on calls about different projects, so that\u2019s where they help a lot. For me, they\u2019re a lifeline. $100 at Amazon Buy $100 at Amazon Buy\n\nToshiba Canvio Basics 1TB Portable External Hard Drive $44 (was $49, now 10% off) I have a lot of ideas that I keep updated on my laptop. Once I had a laptop that crashed, and [I lost] everything. Since then, I\u2019m very careful about keeping a backup on my hard drive. I always have this in my bag. Every time I come up with something new like a recipe, or take a picture of something that I like, I put a copy of it on my hard drive. I keep different folders on it with everything work-related. $44 at Amazon Buy $44 at Amazon Buy\n\nKirkland Signature Variety Protein Bars 20-Count It\u2019s hard for me to eat super-healthy because of my long work hours, but I try to avoid eating late at night. Still, I work late every night, so I always keep these protein bars in my bag. This one is low in sugar, but I also just like the taste of it. If I get hungry at night before getting back home I grab one. It just soothes me. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nOutdoor Products Module Day Pack I\u2019ve had this backpack from Outdoor Products for a while, and I just replaced it with a new one. If I\u2019m traveling and I don\u2019t want to check a bag, I can pack at least two or three days\u2019 worth of clothes in it. On a daily basis, my hard drive, paperwork, laptop, water bottle, and protein bars are all in there. $41 at Amazon Buy $41 at Amazon Buy\n\nAlfani Men's James Suede Driver with Bit $24 (was $80, now 70% off) I have multiple loafers, but I find the Alfani ones very comfortable. I literally have four or five colors right now. If I go [to Macy\u2019s] and see a new color, I buy it. I don\u2019t wear them at work, where I have to wear kitchen shoes, but if I have to go out and attend an event I\u2019ll wear them. Because I only wear them once or twice a week they end up lasting a long time. $24 at Macy's Buy\n\nCrocs Classic Clog $36 (was $40, now 10% off) In the kitchen, I wear Crocs. We have two restaurants right now and I keep a set of Crocs in each one. I\u2019ll wear my regular shoes to the restaurant, then change into a pair of these. They\u2019re very light and easy to wear, and you can clean them easily. I\u2019ve spoiled a lot of other shoes when I\u2019ve forgotten to change into my Crocs, and once you stain a pair of shoes they\u2019re done. The beauty of the Crocs is you can clean them as many times as you want. I just bought a white pair but I realized within a week that they get dirty very quickly, so I prefer the black ones. $36 at Zappos Buy\n\nAmul Cheese Tin I love cheese. I always keep a variety of cheese stocked in my fridge at home. There\u2019s one specific Indian cheese known as Amul that I always have in both my restaurants. Growing up in India, we didn\u2019t have the luxury of having multiple cheeses the way we do in America. We only had Amul. It\u2019s a hard cheese. A lot of people try to compare it with cheddar, but I think it\u2019s better than cheddar. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nNutriBullet 12-Piece High-Speed Blender/Mixer System $50 (was $60, now 17% off) I drink a protein shake every morning, so I need a NutriBullet. I use it every day. I\u2019ll do a protein powder with water and some fresh berries, and just blend it and drink it. I\u2019ve never tried another blender \u2014 it\u2019s more of a convenience than anything else. $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nBodum Bistro Electric Water Kettle The first thing I do every single morning is drink hot water. I keep a small water heater in my bedroom and also one in my kitchen, so wherever I am \u2014 upstairs or down \u2014 it\u2019s easy and convenient for me. $33 at Amazon Buy $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nCalphalon Contemporary Hard-Anodized Aluminum Nonstick Omelette Fry Pan I usually have eggs for breakfast three or four times a week, and I\u2019ll make them with this nonstick pan at home. Otherwise, I don\u2019t cook at home because my wife doesn\u2019t allow me. My wife and my mother both don\u2019t let me cook at home because they feel like I always create a mess. Once in a while if my wife needs some help, I\u2019ll help her out, but otherwise the only thing I cook at home is breakfast. And that\u2019s because my wife leaves for work before I do, so I have to make my breakfast on my own. She\u2019s very passionate about cooking. $41 at Amazon Buy $41 at Amazon Buy\n\nIn my restaurants, we use the KitchenAid for different purposes. Obviously, we use it in the pastry department. We also have the roller attachment \u2014 it\u2019s called the pasta-roller attachment, but we use it for our kind of cuisine, too, for something we want to roll out evenly like the skins for samosas or the dough for crispy chaats.\n\nWusthof 8\" Plating Tweezers Another important thing in the kitchen is tweezers. They\u2019re used to pick up things and plate them. Every chef in the city uses tweezers. It\u2019s become a very integral part of everybody\u2019s collection. If you\u2019re plating meat or garnishes, you\u2019ll use them. Nowadays we have micro garnishes \u2014 small, dainty ones \u2014 so instead of using your hands, you use the tweezers. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
