His writing on self-improvement, philosophy, and productivity has appeared in multiple publications. In his spare time, he enjoys walking around Munich, eating pizza, and adding more book summaries on Four Minute Books.\n\nHe finds Bill Gates fascinating \u2014 but not for his success or wealth. Instead, he's intrigued by what Gates can show us about being human.\n\nWhen Gates was asked what the worst day of his life was, he said it was the day that his mother passed away.\n\nGates \u2014 someone who is popularly defined by his success and business acumen \u2014 is fundamentally human, dealing with the universal experience of love and loss.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nBill Gates is fascinating for many reasons: his wealth, his habits, his ideas.\n\nThe new Netflix documentary \"Inside Bill's Brain: Decoding Bill Gates\" covers them all. It follows his extraordinary journey, from globalizing office software to building one of the world's most influential companies, becoming its richest man, and now, leading its largest foundation.\n\nBut the reason I'm fascinated by Gates has nothing to do with any of that. It's not his success, or his way of thinking, or his approach to solving the world's most critical problems with tech. To me, the most interesting thing about him is what he teaches us about what it means to be human.\n\nNiklas G\u00f6ke. Courtesy of Niklas G\u00f6ke\n\nThroughout the Netflix series, an interviewer asks Gates silly, get-to-know-you questions in quick succession: \"What's your favorite food? What's your favorite animal? What do you eat for breakfast?\" But every now and then, he throws in some curveballs, maybe to catch Gates off guard and get him to veer from his canned responses. Or maybe the show is just edited to make it look like Gates is getting a low-stakes grilling. Whatever the reason, at one point, the interviewer asks this question: \"What was the worst day of your life?\"\n\nGates is a composed man. He's reserved, but seems at ease answering all sorts of questions. But this one is different. He squints. He looks down. He appears to be thinking, but not really. He knows what he has to say \u2014 he just doesn't want to say it. No one would. But finally, he says it:\n\n\"The day my mother died.\"\n\nThere, sitting in the library of his $127 million mansion, is a man who's achieved everything there could possibly be to achieve, whose life \u2014 at least to us outsiders \u2014 is defined by his business success.\n\nAnd yet he didn't say, \"The day Steve Jobs accused me of stealing from him.\"\n\nHe didn't say, \"The day I was humiliated by getting hit in the face with a cream pie during a visit with Belgian business and government leaders.\"\n\nHe didn't say, \"The day we were forced to pay $1.3 billion in antitrust fines.\"\n\nNo, the worst day in the Microsoft billionaire's life was the day his mother died.\n\nNo matter who you are or who you aspire to be, at the end of the day, life is not about money or status or power. It's not even about legacy.\n\nLife is about people; the people you meet, the people you miss. Even the people you hate. Most of all, life is about the people you love. Some of them will die before you do. Nothing will ever bring them back.\n\nEvery one of us has limited time. But when it comes to spending it with those we hold dearest, we might have even less. Gates reminded me of this fact. It's his greatest lesson of all.", "description": "Bill Gates is known for his immense success.
