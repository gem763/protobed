But do you remember what you read?\n\nReading is one of life\u2019s great pleasures, especially when you\u2019re retired. Uninterrupted time to dive into a long magazine piece or finish off a novel can prove stimulating on many levels.\n\nIdeally, you relive at least some of that joy by retaining captivating passages, relevant advice or key facts. But the text bounces off you like a rubber ball. Within hours, you\u2019ve forgotten pretty much everything on the page.\n\nRetaining what you read involves three steps, says Ronald Kellogg, a professor of psychology at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Mo. First, you encode the memory by reading with care and making an effort to understand the content. Then you store the memory, perhaps by taking notes or repeating important phrases out loud.\n\nFinally, you need to retrieve it on demand. Smart people do this really well.\n\nRead: People spent $1.9 billion last year on tools to keep their brains sharp. Here\u2019s what really works\n\nYou may assume that the best way to remember a juicy tidbit is to sear the sentence into your brain by reading it over and over. Good luck with that.\n\n\u201cJust reading the same [sentence] repeatedly is worse than reading it once while trying to remember it,\u201d Kellogg said. \u201cThe effort to retrieve it in itself becomes a learning opportunity and a useful thing to do to increase retention.\u201d\n\nHe suggests that after reading a particularly noteworthy thicket of text, stop and quiz yourself by attempting to summarize the main point. That works better than reading the same thing three times in a row.\n\nKeeping a pen and paper handy provides an extra boost. Periodically jotting your musings reduces the odds that your mind will wander as you read.\n\n\u201cYou process information more deeply when you take notes in your own words so that you link the information to what you already know,\u201d said Kellogg, author of \u201cThe Psychology of Writing.\u201d This relates to a memory technique known as \u201celaborative rehearsal,\u201d he adds.\n\nHighlighting certain phrases with a yellow marker can increase your absorption. Saying out loud what you just read also reinforces it in your head.\n\nMichael Wasserman, 60, likes to scan chunks of text before reading line by line. This quick exercise in familiarization gives him a head start in remembering what matters most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking at the whole page or a whole paragraph at once and letting the words seep in,\u201d said Wasserman, a semiretired geriatrician in Ventura County, Calif.\n\nHe cautions readers against breaking down each sentence into its component parts. In an effort to retain vital facts in news articles or stirring literary passages in a novel, you can compartmentalize too much.\n\n\u201cIf you read really slowly, you\u2019re so focused on each word that you can miss the point of the sentence,\u201d Wasserman warned.\n\nYour mental alertness and physical health also play a role. Readers who eat right and keep fit tend to remember more easily.\n\n\u201cExercising, sleeping well and having a healthy diet help our brains stay functional,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cTaking in too many carbohydrates, as in processed foods, will slow you down in terms of your brain function.\u201d", "description": "You enjoy books, short stories and news articles.
