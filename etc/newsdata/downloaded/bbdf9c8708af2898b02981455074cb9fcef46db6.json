That might sound strange, considering he recently published a book celebrating the movies of 1999, but he swears it\u2019s the case.\n\n\u201cI am so loath to nostalgize the \u201990s, as someone from Gen X,\u201d he said over the phone. \u201cBecause I think that nostalgia can be a very ruinous, poisonous, delusional drug to take after a while.\u201d\n\nEven so, he couldn\u2019t help but look back for \u201cBest. Movie. Year. Ever.: How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen.\u201d Released back in April, Raftery\u2019s book surveys the film landscape circa Y2K and lovingly details what made it such a special time for moviegoers.\n\n\u201cEverything that had happened in the previous six to seven decades in cinema kind of all merged, and at the same time, the next several decades of cinema started to rear its head,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get another year where you have so many filmmakers of various generations and influences making so many good films for an audience quite so big.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get another year where you have so many filmmakers of various generations and influences making so many good films for an audience quite so big. Brian Raftery\n\nA quick rundown of just some of the titles that hit theaters that year: \u201cFight Club,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d \u201cMagnolia,\u201d \u201cThe Blair Witch Project,\u201d \u201cElection,\u201d \u201c10 Things I Hate About You,\u201d \u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d \u201cOffice Space,\u201d \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d \u201cThe Insider.\u201d Even a few of the less-than-stellar features (hello, \u201dAmerican Beauty\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\u201d) are significant. It\u2019s a staggering list, hence the cheeky designation of \u201cBest. Movie. Year. Ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe title is kind of a dare,\u201d Raftery admitted. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that people will argue about that and will look at \u201939 or \u201950 or \u201994 and very vehemently and angrily defend those years to me because those are all great years. Nothing makes me happier than people talking about movies.\u201d\n\nBecause he\u2019s an expert, and because it was such a stacked year, HuffPost asked Raftery to pick his top five favorite movies from 1999.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n1. \u201cElection\u201d (Directed by Alexander Payne)\n\nWhile I was writing the book for, like, two years, I had a top five in my head, and it changed almost every day. It\u2019s very hard to make a top 10 for that year, much less a five. But even when I was changing around my top five, there were three movies that were always on there. The first of which \u2014 and this probably is my favorite movies from that year, I\u2019ve watched it so many times \u2014 is \u201cElection.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d put that at number one for a couple of reasons. I definitely saw it in \u201999, but I don\u2019t think I quite appreciated how insightful and dark and relatable it was until the years afterward. I don\u2019t know what you would change from that movie, at all. Every performance is very spot-on. Reese Witherspoon doing that sort of assertive but very smart and take-control character, she\u2019s so good at it \u2014 you don\u2019t for a second not believe that Tracy Flick is going to run the world in some way, which is so crucial to that movie working.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a flawless movie. I hate to say that, because it sounds like a hack way to describe it. The kind of humor it has \u2014 which is obviously social satire but very much day-in-high-school comedy \u2014 is very funny to me. It just feels like a movie that could\u2019ve been made at any point in the last 20 years and it would feel timely.\n\nI think that\u2019s why I keep rewatching it and I never get tired of it. I always find something new. It says so much about gender and class and the way we treat one another and the way we view one another, and it articulates a lot of different levels of rage, which is just very rare in a movie. And the student rally scene, the pep rally scene, is hilarious, and you know who all those characters are the moment that scene happens. Tracy Flick\u2019s speech is amazing, and Chris Klein\u2019s speech is amazing, and they all feel like you\u2019re looking at the next 20 years of politics when you watch those speeches.\n\nThat\u2019s the best use of Chris Klein in any movie.\n\nAbsolutely. And he\u2019s such a unique character in that, I think most other directors and writers would make that guy either a dumb jock or a cruel jock, and he\u2019s just kind of a sweet guy who\u2019s always gonna be slightly in over his head in life, but he\u2019s not gonna be aware of it, and he plays that so beautifully. You can\u2019t really root against anyone in \u201cElection,\u201d and you can\u2019t really root entirely for them. And I love that about the movie.\n\nThere are a few movie characters from that year that have very good name recognition with people. If you say \u201cTyler Durden\u201d or \u201cMace Windu,\u201d people know who you\u2019re talking about. Tracy Flick is definitely one of those characters \u2014 she\u2019s an archetype, which is impressive.\n\nTotally. I think Tracy Flick and Tyler Durden are kind of, for better or worse, the king and queen of the 1999 prom. Those characters are really indelible and they feel like they\u2019re everywhere now.\n\n2. \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d (Directed by Spike Jonze)\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s the first Spike Jonze movie, and I love his films, I love him as a filmmaker. The fact that he and Charlie Kaufman got to make this movie still feels like they got away with something. And I think, even in the theater when I saw it, no one could understand that movie when it arrived. People who loved it were like, \u201cI saw this movie. I don\u2019t know what it is, I don\u2019t know how it got made, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing here.\u201d That style of comedy \u2014 which is, in some ways, very savage but very kind \u2014 is so hard to pull off.\n\n\u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d just having that surreal idea of going into someone\u2019s head and laying it out so beautifully, but also treating it matter-of-factly, made it so compelling. The weird thing about \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d is, like a lot of people, I didn\u2019t walk out thinking, \u201cWell, wait, how did they get in his head? They\u2019ve gotta explain that more.\u201d The thing about \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d is, you kind of buy it from the first five minutes. You go, \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nThat movie, in particular, felt like it was hitting on a lot of ideas that, in the late \u201990s, we hadn\u2019t quite articulated or hadn\u2019t quite realized were problems yet. I think the idea of hijacking someone\u2019s identity \u2014 which is being done on a minute-by-minute basis on the internet at this point \u2014 back then still felt kind of novel and weird. And I think people forget that Cameron Diaz\u2019s character [Lotte] has all these gender identity dilemmas and questions. It was very much saying to the audience, \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever thought about wanting to be someone else?\u201d And then it took that question further and it\u2019s like, \u201cAre you comfortable in your own body, even? Do you know who you\u2019re supposed to be?\u201d Those are such radical ideas to have in a movie that\u2019s about a puppeteer who\u2019s depressed.\n\nI rewatched it recently and I didn\u2019t know if the Cameron Diaz arc played well now, actually. I still thought the movie was great, but that was the only part that made me go, \u201cHmm.\u201d I just wasn\u2019t sure if the movie was playing her questions about gender identity for laughs.\n\nI always felt like that movie was so, ultimately, sympathetic toward Lotte; to my mind, she\u2019s the only redeeming character in the film, in a way. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an interesting question. And it\u2019s written by two cis, white guys \u2014 who knows what their perspective was on those things, and maybe they were reaching for a laugh a little bit.\n\nBut I feel like the part in the car, where she\u2019s really explaining it, gives that whole character and that moment and that idea a kindness to it. And the rest of the movie forward, you are very much on her side. I know that because I grew up with some of these movies, that I view them through a different lens than other people will, watching them now. And I wonder if that would hurt the movie, or whether people would be able to see it as a movie that was trying to discuss this at a time when a lot of films weren\u2019t.\n\n3. \u201cThree Kings\u201d (Directed by David O. Russell)\n\nI felt the way about \u201cThree Kings\u201d that other people that year felt about \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d And I don\u2019t mean in terms of the same ideas that it was trying to illustrate, but I felt so energized by that movie. It was a movie I just did not know that I had needed. It felt much smarter than a movie just saying, \u201cWar is bad.\u201d It felt like it was really trying to get at the roots of some distinctly American problems that I had seen as a young man and at specifically a generation that was very big on violence and violence in the culture.\n\nThis was a movie that was pointing all these questions back at the audience about what we were doing out there, what America\u2019s history of violence is, what our own sort of love of violence is, but also it\u2019s a cracker-jack action movie. It\u2019s so much fun, it\u2019s so exciting at times. The scene where Mark Wahlberg, his van or his truck is just careening across the sand, and it almost blows up, that kind of felt like it was capturing the spirit of the time \u2014 that we were also on the brink of something.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say this movie\u2019s been forgotten. But why do you think \u201cThree Kings\u201d has taken a back seat to some of the other films from that year?\n\nI don\u2019t know why. I can guess: It was a moderate hit, but it wasn\u2019t an awards movie, which I think would have kept it in the culture a little bit longer. I think there are probably a lot of people who haven\u2019t seen it because either they think it\u2019s too much of an action movie, they don\u2019t like action movies, or they think it\u2019s too much of a message movie, which it\u2019s not.\n\nIt was a very hard movie to sell, even back then. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a downer of a movie, but that movie was looking at a war that happened 10 years ago, basically, and saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d And we now know, 20 years later, it wasn\u2019t over.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to make a movie about the Middle East conflict, any era of it, any region involved, and get people to get excited for it. It\u2019s the most complicated geopolitical situation of my lifetime, and it\u2019s very hard to make a movie about it. But it does have its loyalists, and I do think even if David O. Russell made 10 more movies, \u201cThree Kings\u201d would probably always be one of his top three films. There\u2019s a lot of good movies that year, too. It\u2019s hard to make those top five, top 10 lists for that year and not leave some crucial movies out.\n\n4. \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d (Directed by Kimberly Peirce)\n\nI know for some people, this might be a controversial choice \u2014 I think \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d is an extraordinary movie. I was absolutely saddened by it when I saw it. Frankly, I was really down for days, just because Matthew Shepard had been on the cover of Time the year before, the \u201990s had had this really cruel homophobic streak in the culture in some ways, and in the real world. So that\u2019s obviously one reason why \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d resonated for me and still does.\n\nWhen I interviewed the cinematographer, he was telling me, I hadn\u2019t realized this, but Jim Denault was saying that they really tried to stay away from natural light. And when I rewatched it after that, I was like, \u201cOh yeah, this all looks like it\u2019s just the moon is out and there\u2019s nothing around them.\u201d All of the light is either these big, kind of Kwik-E-Mart, giant blasts of artificial light or it\u2019s this moonlight. And I just think that movie is very haunting.\n\nThat\u2019s a movie that would not be made the same way today. I think there would absolutely be a call \u2014 a completely justified and, I think, necessary call \u2014 for that to be a trans performer in that lead [role], and I think it would get made that way. It didn\u2019t get made that way back in the late \u201990s for reasons that the casting director and the director both talked about with me, and they just couldn\u2019t find the right person.\n\nAnd I know that there is a little bit of a stigma toward it because it\u2019s Hilary Swank, but I think that movie is deeply moving. It\u2019s a remarkable movie about teenagers. I know they\u2019re not strictly teenagers in that movie, but it\u2019s about young people and the bonds they form when they feel like they\u2019re on the outskirts of something, which is a really crucial component of that film that doesn\u2019t get talked about enough \u2014 the way all those kids find each other and make this very uneasy social truce for a while that gets ultimately betrayed in this heartbreaking, terrifying way.\n\nAnd I think the love story is very deeply, deeply moving. And I do think, at the time, it was an important film for people like me, who were not aware of these kind of troubles in any sort of intimate way; that movie and Matthew Shepard within a year of each other, those were crucial wake-up moments for a lot of oblivious, cis, straight guys like me.\n\nAm I wrong to think that \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d has a reputation for being awards bait? That it was an Oscars play?\n\nI don\u2019t know if it does or not. I\u2019m sure it does; it was Fox Searchlight, and Fox Searchlight\u2019s always this Oscar-bait-y studio, but it certainly wasn\u2019t made in that spirit. I think the fact that Kimberly Peirce was coming from a background of independent film and what we called then the \u201cNew Queer Cinema\u201d movement, and the fact that she did this on the tiniest of tiny budgets \u2014 if the media narrative that emerged afterward made it an Oscar-bait movie, sure, fair enough.\n\nAt the time, though, it certainly did not feel like that was the intent. And maybe that is part of the movie\u2019s legacy. I think there are people who also find it problematic that it\u2019s a movie with Hilary Swank playing a trans, real-life person [Brandon Teena] and is brutalized in the film. I think some people find that distasteful, and, again, I absolutely understand the idea that some people see this as a movie that turns a trans figure into a victim. The problems people have with this movie, I absolutely see and understand it. I just say, when I look at it as both a film, a series of performances, and what that movie meant culturally in 1999, it feels very important to me.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my context for the movie. Because I would\u2019ve first learned about it while watching the Oscars.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong. Look, the fact that Hilary Swank got an award for it during a period where a lot of actors were using indie movies to kind of get Oscars, I understand if there is some skepticism and cynicism about that. But I think what Kimberly Peirce was doing \u2014 and she had Andy Bienen, who was co-writing and Jim Denault, who shot it \u2014 I don\u2019t think it was made with anything but a serious sense of love and obsession for that story, and I think that comes out. And a love for Brandon.\n\n5. \u201cFight Club\u201d (Directed by David Fincher)\n\nI have a lot of qualifiers about \u201cFight Club.\u201d When I saw \u201cFight Club,\u201d I did not relate to it in one key way, which is that I was not raised by an angry man; I did not feel like I needed a war in my generation. All of the Tyler Durden stuff about masculinity in that movie did not connect with me at all. I understand when you say, \u201cI like \u2018Fight Club,\u2019\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cOh boy. We should probably not have this person babysit our kids.\u201d However, there\u2019s three things about that film that I love \u2014 three very specific things.\n\nOne: It is the absolute best performance of Brad Pitt\u2019s career, and maybe Ed Norton\u2019s, too. And the fact that Brad Pitt, who was, at that point, absolutely a demigod and one of the biggest movie stars in the world \u2014 he still is \u2014 but the fact that they managed to make his celebrity and his charisma and his sex appeal such an interesting and integral part of that character is such a delightful use of a famous person and a famous actor. It\u2019s the most perfectly cast movie in a year full of perfectly cast movies.\n\nAnd Edward Norton is just so punchable and drowsy-looking and manic, and he is spot-on as well. And, obviously, Helena Bonham-Carter is just so vicious and savage and this incredibly foxy, miserable, terrible, wonderful person. I think she\u2019s so good in it, and she\u2019s never had a role quite as vicious as that again.\n\nNumber two: I love the way Fincher shot it, the way he edited it, the way the scenes fall into one another. Jim Uhls, who\u2019s really important to credit, he did a remarkably great job adapting it. If you read the book, it does not read like a movie at all, and he really stripped out the stuff that wouldn\u2019t work in the movie.\n\nBut also, the third thing is: It\u2019s an anti-corporation movie, made by a huge corporation, made by a corporately funded filmmaker, and that part of the movie resonated with me in 1999 and still resonates with me now. The idea of branding and merchandise and what you own being the things that own you, all that stuff \u2014 even if it is kind of like dorm-room-sticker wisdom \u2014 I really related to that. It\u2019s important to have a movie that big and that glossy and that star-packed also be that provocative and kind of angry.\n\nSo, I love \u201cFight Club\u201d; I never thought Tyler Durden was cool, but I thought the idea of making fun of Calvin Klein ads and of Starbucks was very cool. And I thought the idea of making fun of corporate art is hilarious and necessary, especially when it comes from a giant piece of corporate art itself, you know?\n\nI get the appeal of Pitt\u2019s character in the first half of the film, but I don\u2019t know how you could walk away from that movie and not think he\u2019s the villain; the movie is pretty explicit about that. I feel like it\u2019s gotten a bad rap because of the fans.\n\nYeah, I think \u201cThe Matrix\u201d has a little bit of that, too, where it\u2019s just sort of like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the message you\u2019re taking away from it?\u201d I do think [\u201cFight Club\u201d\u2019s] fate kind of kept in line with the movie\u2019s ideas, where it\u2019s like, you just can\u2019t control these things. You can\u2019t control the directions of these kinds of movements, and \u201cFight Club\u201d kind of became its own movement.\n\nBut stuff like the airplane sequence, the whole montage where he\u2019s flying from one place to another, the rooftop shot at the end \u2014 it\u2019s extraordinary, high-end, high-craftsmanship filmmaking. And I think, sometimes, I allow that to let me overlook some of the more dangerous ideas in that film that maybe should\u2019ve been smoothed out. Or maybe they should\u2019ve made Tyler Durden more of a clear-cut villain.\n\nI mean, the idea of getting rid of your credit card company, who doesn\u2019t relate to that now? The question is, though, would someone really try to blow up a credit card company? Back then, that seemed like a relatively far-fetched idea.\n\nYou mentioned that maybe some stuff should\u2019ve been smoothed out a bit. This is obviously a very loaded question, but do you think that that movie bears a lot of responsibility for the way it\u2019s been interpreted?\n\nIt\u2019s tough because I think the people who wanted to see \u201cFight Club\u201d as an inspiration were going to see it as an inspiration no matter what. I think the problem with that movie is the problem with the culture, which is that there are a lot of very angry men who feel entitled and feel angry to a degree that they need to take some sort of action.\n\nI think very seriously and very deeply about what art should feel responsible for. Because there\u2019s part of me that feels like artists should never have to apologize or worry about this; there\u2019s also a part of me that winces when I see five posters with guns or five trailers with gunplay back to back.\n\nYou could argue that Tyler Durden should\u2019ve been a more clear-cut villain and that maybe that ending should\u2019ve felt a little less triumphant in some ways \u2014 but it also feels honest to what the mood of that time and that character was, I guess. But I don\u2019t think \u201cFight Club\u201d invented Anonymous, I don\u2019t think \u201cFight Club\u201d invented Gamergate. I think it maybe gave some of the people in those various movements \u2014 or whatever you want to call them \u2014 a shorthand and a meme and maybe a spirit animal, but I don\u2019t think it was intended as that.\n\nThat\u2019s a thorny question. I think the reason these movies are my five favorite is because they have inspired the most arguments, the most conversation, the most backtracking and backpedaling and then doubling down, among any other movies of that year. And I like movies like that. If you could talk to five different people at a party about \u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d you\u2019re going to get five very different perspectives on what it means and whether it works or not. I think that\u2019s what makes those five films very exciting.", "description": "Author Brian Raftery talks about \"Election,\" \"Being John Malkovich\" and a few other favorites of that landmark year in film.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82576724000012277db4b0.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
