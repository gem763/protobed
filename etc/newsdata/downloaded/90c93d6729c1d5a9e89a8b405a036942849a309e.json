We've got an opportunity to play in a game when we can prove we are and that's the only thing we're concerned with.\"\n\nBut he underlined England's achievement in inflicting the All Blacks' first defeat in 19 World Cup matches following their shock 2007 quarter-final loss to France, by saying: \"New Zealand are the gods of rugby.\n\n\"We had to take it to them and we wanted to show we could take it to them and put them on the back foot as much as we could.\"\n\nEngland did take the game by the scruff of the neck from the start, Manu Tuilagi crossing for a converted try with fewer than two minutes on the clock.\n\nAnd recalled flyhalf George Ford then landed four penalties after a knock to Owen Farrell, moved to inside centre, meant the England captain could not continue as goal-kicker.\n\nJones, who during the 2003 World Cup masterminded the Wallabies' semi-final win over New Zealand, said: \"We picked our finishing XV first, that's always the most crucial area when you play New Zealand.\n\n\"They did a super job for us and closed the game out.\"\n\nEngland signalled their determination before kick-off by forming an inverted V to confront the All Blacks' pre-match haka challenge.\n\n\"We didn't just want to stand there and let them come at us,\" said Farrell. \"We wanted to keep a respectful distance but we didn't want to let then come at us.\"\n\nNew Zealand cut the lead to 13-7 when Ardie Savea crossed for a converted try in the 57th minute following England hooker Jamie George's overthrown line-out.\n\nBut England, with the often fiery Farrell in charge, kept their composure.\n\n\"When they scored points today we were the calmest we've been under the posts,\" Farrell insisted.\n\nEngland will now face the winners of Sunday's match between South Africa and Wales in the final, with Jones jokingly saying he was looking forward to them playing out a draw that meant they would be forced into draining extra-time.\n\nBut, on a more serious note, he said: \"We know we can play better next week and we will have to play better next week.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones insisted his England side's focus would remain intact after they booked their place in next week's World Cup final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7946/7bd67e07fa6d4091b5008ee19def3285.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
