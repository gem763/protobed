This is a 22% rise from 2017 and the highest surge since the data was first collected in 2013.\n\nDrug-related deaths saw the biggest increase, rising by 55% since 2017.\n\nCharities called for an urgent investigation into the deaths of vulnerable people, saying it was heartbreaking and that they should not die \u201cunnoticed and unaccounted for\u201d.\n\nJon Sparkes, the chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis, said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking that hundreds of people were forced to spend the last days of their lives without the dignity of a secure home. This is now the second year running where we have known the true scale of the human cost of homelessness, yet still the lessons from these tragic deaths go unlearned.\u201d\n\nMost of the deaths in 2018 were among men, accounting for 641 estimated deaths and 88% of the total. The mean age at death was 45 years for men and 43 for women, far lower than the mean age of death for the general population which is 76 years and 81 years for men and women respectively.\n\nBen Humberstone, the head of health analysis and life events at the ONS, noted that the key issue behind the surge was deaths related to drug poisoning.\n\nTwo in five deaths of homeless people were related to drug poisoning in 2018 (294 estimated deaths), and the number of deaths from this cause has increased by 55% since 2017.\n\nThe homeless death of Kane Walker: how we let down the kid from care Read more\n\nSparkes added: \u201cBehind these statistics are human beings, who like all of us had talents and ambitions. They shouldn\u2019t be dying unnoticed and unaccounted for. It\u2019s crucial that governments urgently expand the safeguarding system used to investigate the deaths of vulnerable adults to include everyone who has died while street homeless, so we can help prevent more people from dying needlessly.\u201d\n\nLondon and the north-west had the highest numbers of deaths in 2018, with 148 (20% of the total number) and 103 (14% of the total number) estimated deaths of homeless people respectively.\n\nThe figures included rough sleepers and people using emergency accommodation such as shelters and hostels.", "description": "Charities call for urgent investigation after 22% rise in recorded homeless deaths", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3b4e49d6e894066e61ca9d00da6b41957ae67d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c1feca8c1bfcd233905847b7bb224202", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
