If this is an attempt to do that then it will fail\", the report quoted another cabinet minister as saying.\n\nWhile the Times newspaper did not specify how many Conservative lawmakers oppose a no-deal scenario, the Financial Times reported early on Wednesday that at least 50 members of parliament from the party will revolt against a general election manifesto pledging to pursue a no-deal Brexit.\n\nCertain lawmakers from the party are considering running on a softer individual Brexit platform or even standing aside altogether as a Tory candidate, the FT report added https://on.ft.com/2Mr4RIF.\n\nThe media reports come as the European Union accused Britain of playing a \"stupid blame game\" over Brexit after a Downing Street source told Reuters a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.\n\nWith just over three weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as both London and Brussels position themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Hogue, Jane Wardell & Simon Cameron-Moore)", "description": "Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, British Minister for Northern Ireland Julian Smith, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, Health Minister Matt Hancock and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox are all on a \"resignation watch list\", according to The Times report http://bit.ly/33fODZW.
