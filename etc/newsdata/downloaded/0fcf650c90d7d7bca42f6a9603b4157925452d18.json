And ring-fencing regulations have forced banks to hive off their high street operations from their riskier investment banking businesses.\n\nThis has left them with a pool of cash which they gain from customer deposits, and mortgage lending is one of the few ways they can put it to work.\n\nThe squeezes have particularly affected Santander, the third-largest mortgage lender in the UK. Bostock said: 'Our profitability for the first nine months of 2019 has been impacted by competitive income pressure, additional PPI costs and transformation programme investment.'\n\nThe average two-year fixed rate mortgage currently charges a 2.45 per cent interest rate, close to historic lows of 2.17 per cent, last seen in September 2017, and almost half the 4.79 per cent rate of 2009.\n\nEven though the Bank of England's base rate has risen from 0.25 per cent to 0.75 per cent since 2017, lenders are still battling to retain customers. This is good news for home-buyers taking out a mortgage but means more pain for savers who want a return from keeping their cash in the bank.\n\nA BLOW FOR SAVERS Shares in the Spanish parent of Santander fell 5 per cent to \u20ac3.28 on the Madrid stock market as investors were disappointed by its update. Large numbers of small British savers have shares in the Spanish lender due to its takeovers of Abbey National and Alliance & Leicester. Savers in the two former building societies were handed free shares when they floated on the UK stock market. They then became investors in Santander when it acquired the two British former mutuals. Santander shares were above \u20ac6 back in early 2018.\n\nDarren Cook, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: 'Over the past couple of years savers have had a torrid time, seeing interest rates fall across the board on savings accounts.' Santander's efforts to pull in more customers seem to have worked \u2013 the bank's mortgage book actually grew by \u00a33.6 billion in the first nine months of the year, to \u00a3161.6 billion.\n\nBut PPI added to the lender's woes. In what has become one of the banking industry's biggest scandals, banks have been forced to set aside huge amounts of money to cover payouts resulting from mis-sold PPI.\n\nA surge in the number of claims in the run-up to the August deadline saw banks reluctantly setting aside even more money.\n\nIn total, Santander has siphoned off almost \u00a32 billion of its profits to cover PPI claims.\n\nOverall, Banco Santander, which is listed in Spain but counts Britain as its third-biggest market after Spain and Brazil, saw profits slip 35 per cent in the first nine months of the year to \u00a33.2 billion, as the weak UK numbers weighed on its stronger Latin America performance.", "description": "The UK arm of Banco Santander, the eurozone's biggest lender, made profits of just \u00a3785m in the first nine months of this year, down 43 per cent compared to the same time in 2018.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
