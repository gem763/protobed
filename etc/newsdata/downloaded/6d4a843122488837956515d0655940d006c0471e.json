They will be talking to their counterparts. When Trump comes here I will be talking to him,' Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters at the Turkish parliament.\n\nO'Brien flew to Ankara as an emergency measure to try to stave off an escalation of Turkey's attacks on Syrian Kurds.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are due to arrive Thursday. Initial media reports described Erdogan saying he would refuse to meet with them. Those turned out to be incorrect, according to a transcript released by Turkey's presidential communications office.\n\nPompeo said Wednesday during a Fox Business Network interview that he has 'every expectation' he and Pence will meet with Erdogan.\n\nErdogan did say, however, that he may re-evaluate whether to visit the White House on November 13. Trump extended the invitation this month, but the Turkish leader complained Wednesday that 'arguments, debates, conversations being held in Congress regarding my person, my family and my minister friends are a very big disrespect.'\n\n'I am not going to talk to them. They will be talking to their counterparts. When Trump comes here I will be talking to him,' Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters at the Turkish parliament, spaking about a delegation led by the U.S. national security adviser\n\nPresident Donald Trump, pictured Tuesday with the Stanley Cup Champion St. Louis Blues, has invited Erdogan to the White House next month, a trip that could be called off\n\nThis picture taken Wednesday from the Turkish side of the border at Ceylanpinar district in Sanliurfa shows smoke rising from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain\n\nHe also said Turkey will never declare a ceasefire in northeastern Syria and that it will not negotiate with Kurdish forces it is fighting in the region.\n\nThe White House insists that the vice president will press the Erdogsan regime for a troop pullback and keep applying economic pressure through the threat of sanctions, which Trump approved this week through an executive order but hasn't yet put into force.\n\n'Vice President Pence will reiterate President Trump's commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached,' the White House said in a statement.\n\nTurkey pressed ahead with Attacks against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia on Tuesday despite U.S. sanctions and calls for it to stop, while Syria's Russia-backed army moved on the key city of Manbij that U.S. forces had abandoned.\n\nThe YPG, the key component of the forces who fought the ISIS terror army, is seen by Ankara as a terrorist group linked to Kurdish separatist insurgents in Turkey.\n\nNational Security Advisor Robert O'Brien (center) will be in Ankara on Wednesday but won't get a sit-down with Erdogan\n\nVice President Mike Pence (pictured) and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will arrive in Turkey on Thursday; Erdogan does plan to meet with them\n\nOn Monday, Trump announced sanctions on Turkey to punish it for the offensive. On Tuesday, a senior U.S. official said Washington would threaten more sanctions to persuade Turkey to reach a ceasefire and halt its military action.\n\nHowever, speaking to reporters on a flight back from Baku, Erdogan said the offensive would continue until it reaches its aims, and added that he was not worried about sanctions.\n\n'They say \"declare a ceasefire.\" We could never declare a ceasefire,' Erdogan said. 'They are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions,' he said.\n\nErdogan said he told Trump in a phone call earlier this week that he should send a U.S. delegation to Ankara to discuss their demands and try to reach an agreement. The White House sent first O'Brien, and then Pence and Pompeo.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria after a phone call with Erdogan not only cleared the way for the Turkish incursion, but it also gives a free hand to Washington's adversaries in the world's deadliest ongoing war, namely Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies.\n\nSyrian army deployments into Kurdish-held territory mark a victory for Assad and Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swathe of Syria that had been beyond their grasp through much of its eight-year-old war.\n\nAsked about the deployment of Syrian forces to the northern town of Manbij, Erdogan, who has backed Syrian rebels fighting to oust Assad, said he was not bothered.\n\n'The regime entering Manbij is not very negative for me. Why? It's their lands after all. But, what is important to me is that the terrorist organization does not remain there,' Erdogan said, referring to the YPG.\n\n'I told this to Mr Putin as well. If you are clearing Manbij of terrorist organizations, then go ahead, you or the regime can provide all the logistics. But if you are not going to do this, the people there are telling us to save them,' he added.\n\nErdogan also said that an attack from Manbij on Tuesday, which killed one Turkish soldier, was launched by the Syrian government, and that Turkey 'made the regime pay a heavy price' in retaliation.\n\nSeparately, the Turkish presidency said late on Tuesday that Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call that Turkey's operation would contribute to counter-terrorism efforts, Syria's territorial integrity, and a political solution process.", "description": "'I not going to talk to them.
