Many pointed out that native Texans were significantly more likely to be arrested than migrants in the state.\n\nDomingo Garcia, LULAC National President, said: \u201cIt is appalling that a man with a badge and gun like Sheriff Waybourn would make such ignorant and twisted racist statements influenced by his far right-wing ideology. We know that in Texas, the data shows that native-born residents are much more likely to be convicted of a crime than immigrants.\n\nUS Representative Marc Veasey, whose district includes part of Tarrant County, added: \u201cThese actions are completely unacceptable, let alone by someone who is tasked with protecting and serving our community.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
