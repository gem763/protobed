The airline says it has made pilots in the union \"a generous offer of a 11.5% pay increase over three years.\"\n\nBut pilots, according to the union, \"remain very angry with BA.\" They say the company has increased its profits \u2014 more than $3 billion annually, according to parent company International Airlines Group \u2014 on the backs of its pilots, with pay cuts and long hours.\n\nThe union, which says it represents 85% of all commercial pilots in the U.K., voted overwhelmingly to hang up their pilot caps Monday and Tuesday \u2014 and again on Sept. 27, if the acrimonious pay dispute remains unresolved at that point.\n\n\"British Airways needs to wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard,\" union General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement issued Sunday. \"They've previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\"\n\n\"But the company's leaders, who themselves are paid huge salaries and have generous benefits packages, won't listen, are refusing to negotiate and are putting profits before the needs of passengers and staff,\" Strutton added. \"This strike will have cost the company considerably more than the investment needed to settle this dispute.\"\n\nIt has been a rough couple of years for the airline, public relations-wise. Last year BA apologized for a data breach that exposed the personal information of customers involved in some 380,000 transactions; the year before, a series of IT failures caused chaos at its two major hubs out of London.\n\nThe canceled flights could affect as many as 145,000 passengers Monday, and in a lawsuit filed earlier this year the airline told a court the disruptions could cost it nearly $50 million a day. The union says that just over $6 million is what stands between the parties and an agreement.\n\nConflicting reports from the union and British Airways leave a hazy picture of where talks stand now. In its statement, the airline expressed that it is \"ready and willing to return to talks\" with the union; BALPA, meanwhile, asserted that British Airways outright ignored its latest proposal.\n\nEither way, neither side seems to have softened its public rhetoric.\n\n\"It is by all accounts an own goal,\" the airline's chief executive, Alex Cruz, told the BBC. \"It's going to punish customers, it's going to punish our brand, it's going to punish the rest of the colleagues.\"", "description": "The 48-hour walkout that began Monday could affect as many as 145,000 passengers.
