He quickly jotted down how delighted he felt before he continued with his day.\n\nThis action inspired him to devote some time each day to be on the lookout for unexpected moments of delight. He wondered if in considering and writing about delightful things his experience of life might shift.\n\nHe was right.\n\nThe few rules he gave himself were to capture his thoughts quickly and by hand, and he had to write about one delight every day for a whole year.\n\nWhat emerged was a collection of essays he published as The Book of Delights.\n\nSome of the small moments that captured Gay's imagination and gave him a glimmer of joy were watching a praying mantis on an empty pint glass on an outdoor table in a cafe, writing by hand with a lavender coloured pen, nicknames, Coffee served without a saucer, flowers placed in the hands of statues (often beside weapons), and the music of Toto.\n\n\"Watching this video for Toto, I was like, oh! These are some really average looking dudes. You know, they can really sing, they can play their instruments, but these are some really average looking dudes and isn't that nice?\"\n\nIt feels important as a sort of soul gesture but also as a political gesture to be articulating and praising and taking care of what you love. That feels really crucial. - Ross Gay\n\nWhile observing delight may seem like a quiet, personal act, Gay says it's really about sharing and connection.\n\n\"The experience of delight is a reminder of my desire to point to someone else and be like 'this amazing experience happened, or this flower smells this good, or did you taste this berry that's growing on this bush in front of the public library for anyone to have.... So for me the experience of delight is absolutely social.\"\n\nRELATED: \"If we're not doing things with our hands, we are not really living to our fullest capability.\"\n\nAs a teacher, Gay feels it is his job is to encourage enthusiasm and wonder, and to teach others to look more closely at the things around us.\n\nRoss Gay (Natasha Komoda. )\n\n\"I teach creative writing. The class I'm teaching right now, I'm calling it the 'class of wonder and care'. What I'm interested in is not proficiency, but in the sort of profound possibilities of our attention and our care. That's what I'm interested in.\"\n\nBut to fully appreciate delight, says Gay, means to also appreciate what isn't.\n\n\"There is the constant tension in The Book of Delight, and delight's opposite, or delight's absence. And throughout the book,you can kind of feel a kind of straining, that while I'm calling attention to this delightful experience or this delightful interaction or this delightful whatever, there is also always, or often, this other thing, this other stuff that is not delightful nearby \u2026 Which to me, is sort of like life.\"\n\nRoss Gay is a poet who teaches English at Indiana University in Bloomington.", "description": "After spending a year keeping track of all the delightful things he encountered, poet Ross Gay published his insights in \u201cThe Book of Delights.\u201d He says observing small joyful moments is a social and political act in a world that prefers proficiency.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300397.1569608511!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/praying-mantis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
