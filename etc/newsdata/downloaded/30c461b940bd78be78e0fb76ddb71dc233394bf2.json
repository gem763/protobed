The power-sharing executive collapsed in January 2017 because of a spat over a renewable energy policy.\n\nMonday's -- likely short -- session of the Assembly was triggered after anti-abortion lawmakers signed a petition triggering a recall, to discuss the decriminalization at Stormont. The signatures were mostly made up of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members.\n\nAbortion law in Northern Ireland is considerably different from legislation in the rest of the UK -- with the procedure carrying maximum sentences of life imprisonment, even in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormality.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said in a statement last week that she urges \"other MLAs who oppose the extreme liberalization of our abortion law, to step outside any Party shackles and join us in recalling the Assembly.\"\n\nShe added that it was \"time to get Northern Ireland moving again.\"\n\nArlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nDespite efforts by the DUP and other anti-abortion lawmakers, the recall isn't likely to affect Westminster's plans to change Northern Ireland's law, as the region would need to appoint a full new Executive and that won't happen without Irish republican lawmakers Sinn F\u00e9in, who branded the recall a \"stunt.\"\n\n\"Arlene Foster's 'proposal' to recall the assembly on Monday is a pointless political stunt, which has literally no impact unless its business is to appoint an Executive who does have the power to effect legal change,\" a spokesman for Sinn F\u00e9in told the PA news agency.", "description": "Some Northern Ireland assembly members were returning to Stormont on Monday for the first time in nearly three years in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the province's abortion law from being reformed by the UK government.", "authors": ["Bianca Britton"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170304100443-01-northern-ireland-stormont-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
