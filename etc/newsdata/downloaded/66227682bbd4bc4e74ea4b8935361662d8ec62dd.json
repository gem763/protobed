Inevitably, they require obligation and commitments and don\u2019t fit his idea of narrow transactions that serve our interests temporarily. Like Sen. William Borah (R-Idaho) and the \u201cbelligerent isolationists\u201d of the 1920s and 1930s, President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi arrives in Jordan with bipartisan congressional delegation Trump says his Doral resort will no longer host G-7 after backlash CNN's Anderson Cooper mocks WH press secretary over Fox News interview MORE sees no need for allies and does not want the burden of having to fulfill commitments.\n\nIn his worldview, others should take care of themselves. And that applies even to those like the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces who served our interests by bearing the brunt of fighting and dying in combating the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. For Trump, that\u2019s done, ISIS has been defeated, and Turkey and the Kurds are \u201cnatural enemies,\u201d so getting out of their way and letting them fight is just fine. Leaving aside the reality that ISIS prisoners are now escaping from Kurdish prisons, and their sleeper cells will exploit the chaos and re-emerge as a threat, the deeper reality is that the Trump approach is making the world more dangerous.\n\nBy not caring if vacuums form, Trump fails to understand that the worst forces, especially in the Middle East, fill those vacuums. Small wonder that Russia, Iran and Erdogan\u2019s Turkey are now doing so. In the case of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinJill Stein: 'I am not a Russian spy' Congress plays party politics regarding Syria and Saudis Pelosi, Schumer hit 'flailing' Trump over 'sham ceasefire' deal MORE and Iran\u2019s Ali Khamenei, they share the objective of driving the U.S. out of the region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe danger, however, is not just that our adversaries will take advantage of the openings that our withdrawal creates. There is something more insidious at play, as they become emboldened and our friends feel they must accommodate them. It can be no surprise that Putin visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this past week. Even as he denied there is any evidence that the Iranians are responsible for attacking Abqaiq, the most important Saudi oil processing facility, he arrived almost like a mafia don, offering to sell Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles to the Saudis \u2014 no doubt with the message that, if they buy them, Russia, unlike the Americans, can get the Iranians to limit their threats.\n\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Syria and its ability to make life difficult for the Iranians there may lend credence to Putin\u2019s message, even if there are few signs that he actually wants to limit the Islamic Republic. As for the Trump administration, the record at this point speaks for itself: Iranian or Iranian proxy attacks on oil tankers, Saudi air fields, bases in Iraq where U.S. forces are located, a U.S. drone, and even a Saudi oil facility that accounts for 5.5 percent of the world\u2019s oil (and 50 percent of the Saudis\u2019 daily output) have drawn no meaningful U.S. response. On the contrary, President Trump declared that we don\u2019t get our oil from the Gulf, so others should bear the primary responsibility for keeping the Straits of Hormuz open \u2014 reversing the policy of his Democratic and Republican predecessors. Moreover, he justified a non-response to the Abqaiq attack by saying \u201cthat was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn\u2019t an attack on us.\u201d\n\nWhen coupled with his walk-away from the Kurds, who is going to rely on the Trump administration to be there for them?\n\nAn Arab friend of mine told me that many in the region are now saying \u201cif you are counting on American cover, you are naked.\u201d Yes, we are sending 2,000 missile-defense personnel to Saudi Arabia to help protect obviously vulnerable infrastructure. The Trump explanation: The Saudis are paying for it. Of course, they are seeking to make their important facilities less vulnerable \u2014 just as they could try to make themselves less vulnerable in general by hedging their bets with the Russians.\n\nPutin\u2019s coercion, including on the Saudis, can work; ours vis-\u00e0-vis the Iranians has not. The Trump administration has conducted a policy of maximum economic pressure on Iran, believing its leaders would simply cave; they have not. Instead, they adopted a policy of maximum pressure against our friends in the area, and we have had no answer for it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor now, the Iranians are likely to up the ante in the region. They see little cost in doing so and believe it may yet force Trump to ease the sanctions.\n\nRegrettably, Iranians upping the ante in the region, with the potential for miscalculation and escalation, may not be the only result of the Trump belligerent isolation policy. In a world where the Iranians can directly attack a critical Saudi oil facility, and Turkey can decide to use force against the Kurds in Syria \u2014 with the former drawing no response from us, and the latter essentially green-lighted by the president \u2014 there are no rules. The significance of the Iranian attack on Abqaiq should be seen not just in terms of Iran crossing a threshold and drawing no response; while important, the real lesson is that, internationally, there are no norms, no limits, and anything goes. Have a problem with your neighbor? Don\u2019t fix it diplomatically, use force \u2014 and you can get away with it.\n\nThat cannot be the world we want to live it. Re-establishing limits and norms is essential. The Turkish-Kurdish ceasefire that Vice President Pence declared \u2014 and that Turkish leaders contradicted by calling it a \u201cpause\u201d \u2014 will soon be defined by what Erdogan and Putin agree to when they meet, a meeting timed to coincide with the end of the 120-hour \u201cpause.\u201d No one knows where the tens of thousands of Kurds who are in the zone that Turkey is now carving out will go \u2014 or whether they will have left the zone by the time the pause ends.\n\nThe Trump administration might have had some leverage and been able to offer some protection for Kurdish civilians, had it been willing to declare a no-fly zone over northeast Syria. But that was not in the cards, as President Trump wants out and is quite willing to leave it up to Turkey, Russia, Iran and Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad to work out things or have an ongoing conflict.\n\nNotwithstanding the president\u2019s claim that the \u201cceasefire\u201d deal was good for \u201ccivilization,\u201d more refugees will be the result, and the fighting may or may not end. The deal does, however, punctuate that the U.S. has opted out \u2014 and anything goes.\n\nIn the midst of this gloomy prospect, there is one hopeful sign: Bipartisan criticism of the administration\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds may offer a potential opportunity to begin to forge a new consensus on foreign policy and our role in the world. Perhaps this is the moment when Democrats and Republicans in Congress could come together and mandate an assessment of critical foreign policy needs.\n\nThe starting point could be emphasizing that America has a stake in preventing vacuums from forming internationally and, since we cannot do that alone, we need allies and local partners. Obviously, that cannot come from just declaring it, especially at a time when our lack of reliability will make others leery of joining us. But having a congressionally mandated study emphasize this need will send a signal that there is a consensus in this country that rejects belligerent isolationism and understands that the U.S. cannot withdraw from its responsibilities in the world.\n\nThe great irony is that if we are not to play the role of the world\u2019s policeman \u2014 and yet prevent vacuums from forming \u2014 we must find ways of enlisting allies and regional partners who will share the burden. As the Kurds have shown, that burden is measured in lives and not just dollars. We will be far less likely to be drawn into the conflicts that Trump wants to end if we have friends who believe they can join with us and not be betrayed if they do so.\n\nDennis Ross is counselor and the William Davidson Distinguished Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
