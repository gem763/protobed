The four-day festival that year was battered by frequent storms.\n\nThe work to restore the park to its condition before this year\u2019s festival includes re-sodding grooves where stages and sponsored tents were installed, and mulch installation. Other expenses include aeration, temporary irrigation and consistent watering of the grounds and replanting of shrubs that were removed for ease of access to the festival.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Organizers of the Lollapalooza music festival have received their largest bill in years to restore Chicago's Grant Park after damages caused by last month's event.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
