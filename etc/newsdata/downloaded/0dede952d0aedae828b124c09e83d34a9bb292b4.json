ON HIS HANDS' AFTER EL PASO MASS SHOOTING\n\nAfter Todd pointed out that some Democrats were hesitant to support such bans, O\u2019Rourke responded, \u201cI think this just shows you how screwed up the priorities in Washington, D.C. are.\u201d\n\nHe then brought up the 22 people were killed in a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso last month.\n\n\u201cTalking to those doctors and trauma room surgeons who treated those victims in El Paso, they said these are wounds of war\u2014that high-impact, high-velocity round, when it hit their systems, just shredded everything inside of them,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said on Sunday. \u201cI refuse to accept that, and I refuse to even acknowledge the politics, or the polling, or the fear of the NRA that has purchased the complicity and silence of members of Congress and this weak response to a real tragedy in America.\u201d\n\nEL PASO SHOOTING FATALITIES NOW AT 22 AFTER VICTIM DIES AT HOSPITAL MONDAY MORNING, POLICE SAY\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and agreed with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., saying the clip of the former O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement about AR-15s and AK-47s \u201cwill be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.\u201d\n\nButtigieg said, \u201cLook, right now we have an amazing moment on our hands. We have agreement among the American people not just for universal backgrounds checks, but we have a majority in favor of red-flag laws, high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons. This is a golden moment to finally do something.\u201d\n\nButtigieg went on to say, \u201cWhen even this president and even [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell are at least are pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hand. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke pushed back in a tweet: \u201cLeaving millions of weapons of war on the streets because Trump and McConnell are \u2018at least pretending to be open to reforms\u2019? That calculation and fear is what got us here in the first place. Let\u2019s have the courage to say what we believe and fight for it.\u201d\n\nHe later tweeted, \u201cWhen candidates say, 'At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,' sh--, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue\u2014and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country.\u201d\n\nAs O\u2019Rourke made his call to take back the rifles on Thursday night, Trump warned at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they are totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house.\u201d\n\nTrump promised that his party \u201cwill forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms,\u201d which received loud applause.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump and White House aides have discussed several gun control measures with members of Congress, including steps to go after fraudulent buyers and boost mental health assistance. A formal announcement on Trump\u2019s plan is expected as soon as this week.\n\nFox News' Ben Florance and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Democratic 2020 presidential candidate\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke defended his position on Sunday to ban assault-style weapons and impose mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and AK-47s amid growing Democratic criticism, while also pushing back at those critics, including South Bend, Indiana, Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
