Then they repeated, game after game until Sept. 8, when a near-full crowd at the Washington Mystics\u2019 regular-season finale called out to Elena Delle Donne: \u201cM-V-P! M-V-P!\u201d\n\nIt was \u201csomething that gives you chills,\u201d Delle Donne said later. \u201cI absolutely love this city and there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be. For them to have my back like that really means a lot. It was a special moment.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne was named the WNBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player on Thursday for the second time, following the most dominant and well-rounded season of her career.\n\nShe received 41 out of 43 first-place votes from the national panel of voters in sports media.\n\nDelle Donne ranked second in the league in scoring with 19.5 points per game and ranked fifth with 8.3 rebounds per game, the only player to make the top five of both categories. She became the first woman to join the \u201c50-40-90 Club\u201d by shooting a career-best 51.5% from the field, 43% from 3-point range and a ridiculous 97.4% from the free-throw line \u2014 the highest qualifying mark the WNBA has seen in 10 years.\n\nShe also averaged 2.2 assists and 1.3 blocks per contest.\n\nShe achieved all this while playing through two injuries. After suffering a bone bruise in her knee that hobbled her in the 2018 playoffs, Delle Donne missed the first game of 2019 with knee soreness. She also broke her nose in the first minute of a game in July, causing her to miss the rest of the game and the following two.\n\nThe Mystics went 0-4 in games Delle Donne wasn\u2019t available and 26-4 with the star, on their way to setting a new mark for the best record in franchise history at 26-8. Time has passed since her injuries, but Delle Donne continues to wear both a knee brace and a face mask when she takes the court.\n\nThe season-long favorite to win MVP, Delle Donne, 30, also was named the Associated Press Player of the Year last week and was an All-Star for the sixth time.\n\nDelle Donne first won the award in 2015 with the Chicago Sky and is now the first WNBA player to win MVP with two different teams. Earlier this year she said it would be \u201camazing\u201d to win the award as a Mystic.\n\n\u201cWhen you get an award like that, it\u2019s never an individual award. This isn\u2019t an individual sport,\u201d she said. \u201c[My teammates are] the ones that have really made this such a great season.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne is the third athlete representing a Washington team to win league MVP this decade, joining Bryce Harper and Alex Ovechkin.\n\nEmma Meesseman explained Monday how certain she and her Mystics teammates were that Delle Donne would win the crown.\n\n\u201cPeople say she\u2019s in the talks of MVP,\u201d Meesseman said. \u201cLike, there\u2019s no talks. She is the MVP.\u201d\n\nWhile the personal accolades mean a lot to Delle Donne, now she is vying for a piece of hardware she\u2019s never won before: a WNBA championship trophy. The Mystics lead the Las Vegas Aces 1-0 in their league semifinal series and host Game 2 Thursday night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
