Why not just run everything through the gigantic monitor I already have, otherwise known as my big-arse television?\n\nBlasting your computer\u2019s picture through a television might seem like the best solution on paper, but there are some considerations you should take into account before you cross \u201ca brand-new desktop monitor\u201d off your shopping list. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t do this, or do it well; it\u2019s just not a picture-perfect solution that works in all instances.\n\nWhat are you using your computer to do?\n\nTo help you figure out whether you should connect your PC to an HDTV, first consider what you typically do on your PC. A ton of variables factor into your daily use, but chances are you fall into one of two basic categories: a regular PC user or an entertainment user.\n\nDaily might include everything from sending a few emails to working in Photoshop all day, whereas entertainment would mean the bulk of your time is spent watching movies or playing games.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken a moment to self-reflect, let\u2019s dig a little deeper into what an HDTV means for these two types of users:\n\nA regular ol\u2019 computer user who doesn\u2019t do a ton of gaming or streaming\n\nIf you spend the bulk of your computer time browsing articles on the internet, reading email, writing, or anything similar, the biggest problem you\u2019ll have with a larger HDTV screen is its resolution.\n\nRemember, when it comes to monitors, resolution matters most. A 32-inch HDTV can sport the same resolution as a 27-inch monitor (assuming they\u2019re both 1080p), but blown up an additional five inches. This makes everything a little fuzzy and not conducive for reading. Go up to a 42-inch 1080p display, and you\u2019re going to hate what you\u2019re staring at \u2014 it\u2019ll lack crispness and clarity, and you\u2019ll question your life choices.\n\nThe other problem is ergonomics and the sheer size of an HDTV. You want your eye level lined up about two to three inches below the top of the monitor. This can be difficult with a large screen unless you\u2019re very tall or sit especially high. Plop a 44-inch television on your desk, and you\u2019ll be craning your eyes and head all around to see everything on your digital desktop, which might get real annoying, real fast.\n\nThat all said, there are plenty of instances where YouTube-watchers and programmers alike have turned to an HDTV instead of a traditional computer monitor and had a blast doing so. Here\u2019s what they typically look for:\n\n4K resolution, at minimum\n\n60Hz refresh rate, at minimum\n\nSupport for Chroma 4:4:4 subsampling (to avoid blurry text)\n\nHDMI 2.0 (and the right cables) to achieve all of the aforementioned\n\nLow input lag \u2014 a fact you\u2019ll only really be able to test out yourself once you set up the TV. Either read a bunch of reviews for what you\u2019re about to purchase or find a retailer with a strong return policy, in case the lag for things like your mouse movements drives you nuts.\n\nVESA mounting. If you\u2019re slapping a giant TV on your desk, you might want the ability to position it in better spot, rather than sitting on a stand (which might require you to crane your head up a bit).\n\nBuilt-in speakers. This one is optional, but having built-in speakers never hurts if you don\u2019t have an alternative sound setup for your computer.\n\nOn the PC side, you\u2019ll want to make sure your system can output a 4K resolution at 60Hz, at minimum. Your system should be able to do this if you have around a 7th or 8th-generation Intel CPU (if you\u2019re running integrated graphics) or a decent discrete video card \u2014 just check the specs and see what it can do (on what connection).\n\nOdds are good you\u2019ll be using HDMI for this, as I wouldn\u2019t expect most modern TVs to come with a DisplayPort connection since most TV manufacturers don\u2019t assume you\u2019re going to be hooking one up to your computer. If you only have DisplayPort on your desktop or laptop, you\u2019ll probably need an active adaptor.\n\nEntertainment\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to game or watch movies on your HDTV-turned-monitor, you have a few extra options (and considerations). Most importantly, you might want to consider using a 4K television as the second monitor in a dual-monitor setup. Hear me out.\n\nIn doing so, you\u2019d be able to keep your primary monitor for everyday use \u2014 which means you\u2019ll still be able to have a great experience for web browsing, working on spreadsheets, sending email, or whatever else it is you do. When you switch to movie or gaming mode, you can dump those onto your gigantic, nearby TV.\n\nAssuming you can drag your keyboard and mouse (or controller) to a far-enough-away point, and don\u2019t mind the experience of doing so, I think you\u2019ll enjoy this hybrid approach even more than slapping a 42+ inch TV on your desk.\n\nDepending on what you\u2019re watching (or the size of the text in your games), you might even be able to get away with a television that has lesser specs than what we\u2019ve previously identified. You\u2019re (hopefully) not staring at tiny text on your screen, so maybe the set\u2019s Chroma subsampling might not be as critical. If you\u2019re just watching a lot of movies, you might not care at all about input lag or the television\u2019s refresh rate (if it can\u2019t do 4K at 60Hz, for example).\n\nIf you\u2019re gaming, you\u2019ll definitely care about your set\u2019s input lag and refresh rate \u2014 I can\u2019t think of two more important specifications, seeing as you\u2019ll want to have as precise an experience as possible. You also might find that certain games lend themselves to a better experience on your TV than others, so be prepared for potential disappointment if your favourite title doesn\u2019t work as well as you expected for whatever reason \u2014 like slightly blurry text, for example.\n\nSince the quality of your picture is more important when you\u2019re watching John Wick or playing Doom Eternal than when you\u2019re working in a spreadsheet, you might also want to consider a television (and a video card / HDMI 2.0a setup) that can support HDR10 for more gorgeous and accurate colours.\n\nThis story was originally published on 2/10/12 and was updated on 10/17/19 with more current information.", "description": "Every time I go to buy a new computer monitor, I ask myself the same thing: Why am I doing this?
