(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nRaise your hand if you saw this coming?\n\nAfter days of impeachment fever and breathless hot takes about Trump being taken down by a non-scandal involving a whistle-blower and a call to Ukraine, we are starting to get more information about just who is involved in this. You\u2019d be completely not shocked to learn that the whistle-blower has retained the services of a lawyer who worked for Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, not as a disconnected lawyer, but on their political staffs.\n\nAnd stick around, because it gets even worse.\n\nWhistleblower is rep'd by former Schumer and HRC staffer. That's a political football.https://t.co/eInrrLfF7M \u2014 Forum Non (@ForumNon) September 24, 2019\n\nPer The Federalist.\n\nThe anonymous person who filed a formal, uncorroborated complaint against President Donald Trump for allegedly asking a foreign leader to investigate corruption related to Joe Biden now has a legal team that includes a Democratic operative who worked for Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.). Andrew Bakaj, now a managing partner at the Compass Rose Legal Group, interned for Schumer in the spring of 2001 and for Clinton in the fall of the same year, according to Bakaj\u2019s LinkedIn page. More recently, Bakaj has worked as an official in the CIA and Pentagon and specializes in whistleblower and security clearances in his legal practice.\n\nYou know what I wouldn\u2019t do if I wanted my complaint to be taken seriously and not considered partisan? I wouldn\u2019t go hire a former staffer for Hillary Rodham Clinton who also worked within the agencies in question. That seems like a bit of a conflict, especially when the entire basis of impeachment is presupposed on the condition of the unbiased nature of the whistle-blower.\n\nOh, but it doesn\u2019t end there. Here\u2019s the really good stuff.\n\nThe anonymous U.S. intelligence official accusing President Trump of improperly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is represented by two lawyers who run a group that offers financial help to fired whistleblowers. Whistleblower Aid was launched in September 2017 \u2014 eight months after Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 with an advertising blitz that involved mobile billboards being driven close to the White House, Congress, outside the Pentagon, and around the headquarters of the CIA and National Security Agency. The group\u2019s pledge of support, in addition to free legal representation including rent and mortgage assistance, media coaching, and doctor\u2019s bills and counseling, is controversial among lawyers. Critics say it violates attorney ethics.\n\nYes, you read that right. This lawyer and his group formed an organization that pays anti-Trump \u201cwhistle-blowers\u201d to come forward and lodge complaints. Further, they offer free legal representation and a myriad of other payments, including mortgage assistance for some reason.\n\nNow, I\u2019m no legal expert, but that seems pretty low brow and unethical to me. It seems like the kind of situation that would bring partisan actors out of the woodwork in order to benefit from the situation. Especially when the law will protect their anonymity the entire way.\n\nThis lawyer himself is anything but an unbiased observer.\n\nThis is really looking like a purely political move pic.twitter.com/2f6jp8QqY1 \u2014 Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) September 24, 2019\n\nThe more that comes out, the more political this looks. Let\u2019s say the whistle-blower complaint is released. By what rational is it to even be believed? It\u2019s almost certainly going to be baseless conjecture given what we have already heard. We know he/she has mislead everyone on their knowledge of the Ukraine call, with a report coming out that they never even heard the call for themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are prancing around trumpeting impeachment at the poker table while holding a pair of twos. This isn\u2019t going to end well for them. I say bring it on though.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
