Many outside forecasters agree,\u201d Powell told the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting in Denver.\n\nHe noted that inflation \u201chas been gradually firming over the past few months.\u201d\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session, Powell said \u201cclearly things are slowing a bit,\u201d but he added this might be another pause that refreshes the expansion. These slowdowns have occurred a few times in this expansion, he noted.\n\nPowell did not give any concrete guidance to investors about the Fed\u2019s plans regarding short-term interest rates, saying only that the meeting set for the end of October \u201cis several weeks away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are carefully monitoring incoming information. We will be data dependent, assessing the outlook and risks to the outlook on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\u201d he said.\n\nRepeating what the central bank has said in its policy statement since the summer, Powell said the Fed \u201cwill act as appropriate to support continued growth.\u201d\n\nThere is a split at the Fed about whether more easing or further interest rate cuts are necessary.\n\nSome on the Fed back another rate cut prior to the end of the year, believing that low rates would calm financial markets and give businesses reason to invest. Economists think that this camp includes Powell.\n\nOthers on the central bank want to wait for more clues about the health of the economy before giving it more stimulus. They\u2019re worried low rates would create what amounts to a short-lived sugar-high for the economy and foster financial imbalances.\n\nPrivate sector economists are forecasting that the economy will slow over the next 14 months. Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics see growth slipping to a 1.8% rate next year, down from the 2.6% rate seen in the first half of this year.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year by a quarter-point at the last two policy meetings.\n\nOfficials will meet again on Oct. 29-30. Investors see an 80% chance the Fed will trim rates by another quarter point to a range of 150%-175%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nTurning to short-term funding markets, Powell said \u201ca range of factors\u201d might have caused the turmoil seen last month when the cost of short-term borrowing spiked as firms scrambled to get funding.\n\nRegardless the cause, Powell said it was now time for the Fed to increase the size of its balance sheet. He said the central bank may purchase short-term Treasury bills.\n\nSome analysts call this a \u201csoft\u201d form of quantitative easing, because the Fed buys these securities from the market, but Powell bristled at this description.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase program that we deployed after the financial crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nPowell mentioned that the yield curve control, used by the Bank of Japan, might be a tool used to fight the next recession. He also suggested that the central bank wasn\u2019t interested in pushing short-term rates into negative territory, a tool used in both Europe and Japan.\n\n\u201cShort-term yield curve control is something worth looking at when the time comes,\u201d Powell said.\n\nThis is a form of an interest-rate peg, where a central bank commits to buy whatever amount of bonds it needs to in order to keep a particular part of the yield curve at its target. The BOJ has used yield curve controls to keep yields on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds around zero percent since 2016.\n\nStocks were volatile during Powell\u2019s remarks.
