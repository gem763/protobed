Barrett, Williams, B. Barrett, Ioane, S. Barrett, Frizell, Weber 2\n\nCons: Mo'unga 8\n\nCanada: 0\n\nSummary: Tournament favorite New Zealand was far too strong for minnow Canada and ran in nine tries in a devastating display in Oita. There were errors, too, with plenty of spilled balls, but the All Blacks made a serious statement.\n\nEarlier result: France 33-9 USA\n\nFrance struggled to assert its authority and at one stage midway through the second half the gap was down to just three points but Les Bleus pulled away for a bonus-point win with three tries in the final 20 minutes. France is second in Pool C behind England.", "description": "View the latest news and breaking news today for U.S., world, weather, entertainment, politics and health at CNN.com.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002081251-rugby-world-cup-usa-france-fans-super-tease.jpg"}
