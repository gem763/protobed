Good Luck With That.", "language": "en", "text": "This article was reported in collaboration with Dossier Center and Project.\n\nWarlord Khalifa Haftar began an assault on Tripoli, the capital of Libya, last April. He had seized control of vast swathes of the country with the apparent backing of Russia, the UAE, France and Saudi Arabia, so the offensive by the self-declared field marshal of the \u201cLibyan National Army\u201d raised fears that the city might fall. But five months later, the warlord\u2019s forces are still fighting in the area and appear no closer to capturing Tripoli.\n\nOne group of people who will not be surprised by this turn of events is a team of shadowy Russian operatives working for an organization heavily implicated in the Kremlin\u2019s adventures from Ukraine to the Central African Republic, Venezuela, Syria, Sudan\u2014and, not least, Vladimir Putin\u2019s covert efforts to influence the U.S. elections of 2016.\n\nThere have been numerous reports over the last two years of Russian support for Haftar, including claims made by British government officials in March this year about 300 mercenary fighters belonging to the so-called Wagner group, funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ex-con turned caterer with the benefit of huge contracts from Putin. Prigozhin has become the center of a vast network of companies, including media, \u201ctroll factories,\u201d oil and mining operations and private military contractors such as Wagner waging plausibly deniable interventions on behalf of Moscow in trouble spots all over the world.\n\nWorking in collaboration with the Dossier Centre, a London-based investigative team funded by former Russian oligarch and political prisoner Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and The Project, an independent Russian news portal, The Daily Beast has examined a tranche of internal communications from deep inside Prigozhin\u2019s Libya operation, always referred to simply as \u201cthe Company.\u201d These files, originally obtained by the Dossier Centre, offer documentary proof that Russia\u2019s military role in Libya is far more extensive than has thus far been reported.\n\n\u201c Perhaps the most significant disclosure in these files is the naming of a current Russian military officer operating in Libya. \u201d\n\nThey show that, quite apart from running guns for hire and arranging Facebook propaganda campaigns, Prigozhin\u2019s operatives lately got into the business of \u201cgovernment-in-a-box\u201d political consultancy. The Russians appear willing not only to arm but also do PR work for a variety of dubious\u2014and rival\u2014factions in Libya, yet they harbor no illusions as to the popularity or leadership qualities of any of these proxies.\n\nThey openly advocate rigging elections, for instance, to help Haftar in the likely event he runs for the Libyan presidency. But the Company certainly takes a dim view of what he\u2019s achieved thus far and of his honesty as a Russian client. It accuses the warlord of using his publicized relationship with Russia as a bargaining chip with other actors to raise his stature\u2014all the while failing to cooperate with or even hindering Company personnel.\n\nHaftar, Prigozhin\u2019s men allege, consolidates territory not by winning battles but by bribing tribal leaders and officials for the right to plant the LNA flag, using a total of around $150 million provided by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOne memo, written on April 10 this year, claims that Haftar even spread disinformation about the presence of 300 mercenaries from the Wagner Group, going as far as having Libyan National Army troops stick paper copies of Russian license plates to their vehicles in order to give the impression of Russian support. (Company employees were dispatched to peel off these fakes.)\n\nNor has the Company been the model of transparency and loyalty in its dealings with Haftar. Remarkably, it entered into an agreement with the leader of Sudan\u2019s notorious Janjaweed militia and Rapid Security Forces, which were responsible for atrocities during the Darfur genocide and the massacre of protesters in Khartoum this June, to attack forces allied to Haftar during his assault in Tripoli. The goal here apparently was to strike a cynical balance of power in Libya\u2014 \u201cequilibrium,\u201d in the Company\u2019s phrase\u2014to the benefit of Moscow.\n\n\u201c [Saif al-Islam Gaddafi] has a flawed conception of his own significance. \u201d \u2014 Russian report on the dictator's son plotting a comeback\n\nAnother set of documents outline a strategic alternative to boosting the unimpressive field marshal\u2019s political fortunes\u2014a campaign to help his opponent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi and an international fugitive from charges of crimes against humanity.\n\nHere again the Company is quietly scathing in its depiction of the man it would make president, judging Gaddafi\u2019s competence and psychological disposition unfit for the purpose. On April 3 they presented Gaddafi with a McKinsey-style PowerPoint presentation showing how he might make Libya great again. A postmortem of that encounter suggests this would be no easy undertaking. Gaddafi \u201chas a flawed conception of his own significance,\u201d the post-meeting summary states, arguing that, to work with him, the Company would have to babysit him: \u201cWe can\u2019t meet with him once a week, we need a constant presence.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to boost Gaddafi\u2019s visibility in Libya, the Company set about rehabilitating an old propaganda channel of his late father, Jamahiriya TV, which was taken off-air during the 2011 uprising. The outlet resumed broadcasting in 2012 from a location in Cairo, but suffered frequent breakdowns and interruptions. Prigozhin\u2019s men paid off its debts to both staff and satellite providers.\n\nThe Company also went about building up a social media apparatus to promote both Haftar and Gaddafi using methods reminiscent of what Prigozhin\u2019s Internet Research Agency got up to during the 2016 U.S. election. It created at least 12 different Facebook groups simultaneously working to promote both Libyans. According to one March briefing, these pages were viewed by over two million users each week, compared with the \u201cusual audience for Libyan Facebook groups\u201d of at least 250,000.\n\nPerhaps the most significant disclosure in these files is the naming of a current Russian military officer operating in Libya. An April 6 briefing report states that the Libyan National Army (LNA) had suffered heavy losses as a result of precision artillery deployed by forces loyal to the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord using advanced munitions.\n\n\u201cRepresentatives of the LNA,\u201d the document states, \u201cappealed to the commander of the Russian group, Lieutenant General A.V. Khalzakov, with a request to deploy a Russian UAV to identify the location of these guns and enable the LNA to capture or destroy them, which was denied.\u201d\n\nThis apparently refers to Lt. Gen. Andrei Vladimirovich Kholzakov, a deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Airborne Assault Forces, although the document doesn\u2019t state where exactly in Libya he is currently deployed or what his specific functions are.\n\n\u201c Prigozhin\u2019s long arm in North Africa has already rung alarm bells in Washington and Europe. \u201d\n\nBritish intelligence officials told The Sun in October last year that Russia had established two bases in Benghazi and Tobruk, with \u201cdozens\u201d of Russian GRU officers and Spetsnaz special forces troops performing \u201ctraining and liaison roles.\u201d Alexei Kondratyev, deputy chair of the Russian Senate Defense Committee, denied this, telling state media that Russia had no military servicemen in Libya and was not planning to send any, claiming that the report was an attempt to \u201cdiscredit Russia in its fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nPrigozhin\u2019s long arm in North Africa has already rung alarm bells in Washington and Europe.\n\nOn May 17 Maksim Shugalei and Samer Hassan Seifan, two Russian nationals, were arrested by the Government of National Accord and accused of attempting to interfere in domestic politics. A letter from the Libyan Prosecutor General\u2019s office seen by Bloomberg claimed that the men were carrying laptops and memory sticks that contained data related to Prigozhin\u2019s interests.\n\nAn organization in St. Petersburg, the Fund for the Defense of National Values, acknowledged that both men were \u201csociologists\u201d who had been working for them in Libya in order to \u201cobserve the situation,\u201d denying any political interference. The Fund is headed by Aleksandr Malkevich, who received press attention after he was ejected from rented offices in Washington, D.C. last June after attempting to launch a news website called USA Really, a subsidiary of RIA FAN, the news agency run out of the same former premises of the Internet Research Agency, also based in St. Petersburg.\n\nMalkevich confirmed to Foreign Policy that his employees had indeed met with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, but claimed allegations of interference were a U.S. \u201cdeep state\u201d project.\n\nAnother employee of the Fund, Aleksandr Prokofyev, was named in the Libyan prosecutor\u2019s letter. Prokofyev had allegedly been in Libya with Shugalei and Seifan, but had managed to evade arrest. He had in fact returned to Russia on May 14, three days before the arrests were made, as he was on annual leave.\n\nProkofyev told the New York-based Russian-language RTVi news channel that he had been in Libya and had met with Gaddafi, though he again denied political interference, claiming that Gaddafi was not engaged in any political activities\u2014something disproven by these Company documents.\n\nAs it happens, Prokofyev\u2019s name appears in the metadata of that April 3 summary of the Company\u2019s meeting with Gaddafi, suggesting that Prokofyev himself or someone with access to his computer drafted the document.\n\nThree other Company files The Daily Beast examined were authored or modified by Pyotr Bychkov, a member of the board of trustees of the Fund for the Defense of National Values and, according to RTVi, the head of the Prigozhin \u201cback office\u201d responsible for coordinating African operations.\n\nThe battle for Tripoli, meanwhile, persists with no sign of a breakthrough by any side, despite the Libyan National Army\u2019s insistence that the city will be taken \u201cat any moment.\u201d And, despite its serious misgivings about Haftar and attempts to countermand his lackluster campaign, Russia continues to back him. According to Maghreb Confidential, a private French intelligence portal, the field marshal was in Moscow just weeks ago, from Aug. 20 to 24, possibly to endear himself to those who clearly neither admire nor trust him.", "description": "In emails revealing Moscow\u2019s efforts to groom incompetent aspiring leaders of the oil-rich war-torn country, the cynicism would be almost laughable, but the carnage is continuous.", "authors": ["Michael Weiss", "Pierre Vaux"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568249762/190911-weiss-libya-tease_hxwd0u", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
