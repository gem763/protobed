Trump\u2019s efforts to encourage the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden lie at the centre of an impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last week.\n\nFollowing the Biden clip, the clip posted by Trump cuts to a popular, if niche, meme, based on an edit of the music video for the 2005 Nickelback single Photograph. In the original video, the vocalist Chad Kroeger holds a picture to the camera, singing:\n\nLook at this photograph / Every time I do it makes me laugh / How did our eyes get so red? / And what the hell is on Joey\u2019s head?\n\nThe meme revolves around people digitally inserting other pictures into the frame.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH! pic.twitter.com/QQYTqG4KTt\n\nIn Trump\u2019s edit, Kroeger\u2019s photograph is replaced by one taken in 2014 that shows both the Bidens on a golf course with Devon Archer, a colleague of Hunter\u2019s, labelled in the edit as a \u201cUkraine gas exec\u201d.\n\nWithin 12 hours of the video being posted to Twitter, however, it had been removed and replaced with a notice that \u201cThis media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.\u201d The video is currently available on YouTube.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time this year that the American president has been censured for infringing copyright on Twitter. In April, a campaign advert, scored with the soundtrack to the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises, was removed following a takedown notice from copyright holder Warner Bros.\n\nThe copyright removals stand in contrast to Twitter\u2019s policy about Trump\u2019s tweets, which specifically place the president above the law when it comes to enforcement of the social network\u2019s own regulations. In June, the company announced a policy to restrict, but not remove, tweets by famous politicians that break its rules about abusive behaviour.\n\nThe social network argued that these tweets were newsworthy, so that even if they were likely to cause harm, it would not be in the public interest to remove them.", "description": "US president receives copyright censure over video that took aim at political rival Joe Biden", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/404f7824777876fb4eae903f33eed9b57dbae6cc/0_168_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2aaa738ff5e60103b8909c12882b5e7f"}
