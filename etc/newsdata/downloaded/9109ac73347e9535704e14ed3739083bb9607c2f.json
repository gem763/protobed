I've always called it the topper,' the Redditor calling himself 'farmercurtis' asked.\n\nOne sniped: 'It's the crust you maniac.'\n\n'The ends,' added another.\n\n'In England, the crust, in Scotland, the heel. One expression may not be used in the other country, else howls of derision result,' wrote one.\n\n'\"The nobby end\" or \"the crust\"', shared a commenter.\n\n'Where does this come from? I have always called it a nobby but I have no idea why - or where I picked it up from,' questioned one person.\n\n'I was scrolling through and not finding this anywhere else... I was starting to think that [the nobby] was a term made up by my Dad,' one joked.\n\nPeople debated what the correct term for the end of the loaf was, which often has a thicker slice on either side sometimes known as the crust\n\nOthers debated the terms they used including ones like 'nobby', the 'heel', 'crust' and even 'bread skin' by one child\n\nFor many the thick slice proved to be perfect for toasting insisting that it should never be used for a sandwich.\n\nOne wrote that it was 'the best bit', leading another person to call them a 'sicko'.\n\nA mother wrote that her daughter calls it the 'bread skin', which one person responded: 'Your daughter has just ruined bread.'\n\nThe term appears to be different all across the globe as a previous Reddit survey proved.\n\nMost non-English speaking countries responded with different variations of 'the end slice', American responders replied with the 'heel' or the 'butt', and some from the Netherlands called it the 'kontje' which translates to the 'booty'.", "description": "A British farmer has reignited the debate about what to call the thicker slice at the end of a slice of bread after he said it is a 'topper'.
