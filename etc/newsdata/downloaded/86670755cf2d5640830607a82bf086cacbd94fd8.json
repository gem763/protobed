Nevertheless, she was confirmed in July as US ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nDoug Manchester, a San Diego developer whom Trump nominated to be ambassador to the Bahamas, told senators in a hearing that the country is a US \"protectorate,\" though it is not and has never been.\n\nOf course, other administrations, Democratic and Republican, have awarded ambassadorships to unqualified financial supporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge Tsunis, a Long Island hotelier and bundler, had to withdraw as President Barack Obama's nominee for ambassador to Norway in 2014 after he said in a confirmation hearing that Norway had a presidency, which it does not, and misidentified a mainstream Norwegian political party as a fringe group.\n\nTwo other Obama bundlers also fumbled their hearings badly, but were confirmed anyway as ambassadors to Hungary and Argentina.\n\nIn recent years, as their needs for campaign contributions have grown, presidents have relied more heavily on donors and bundlers to serve in top posts overseas.\n\nSenators, who are supposed to reject unqualified nominees, have often approved the nominations, partly out of deference to presidents - and also because the donors are often contributors to their own campaigns.\n\nRyan Scoville, a Marquette University law professor, concluded after studying newly released government documents on more than 1,900 ambassadorial appointments since 1980 that the quality of political appointees has been in decades-long decline.\n\nReagan's political appointees were more likely than appointees of the five presidencies that followed to have foreign policy experience, language skills and familiarity with running large organisations.\n\nThe average political appointee is contributing far more money - 1,400 per cent more, on average, even after inflation is considered - than in the Reagan era, Scoville calculated.\n\nMost other major powers - France, Japan, the United Kingdom - restrict their important ambassadorships to seasoned career diplomats. And the Russian leadership that Trump so admires excludes amateurs and relies entirely on professionals, such as Sergey Kislyak, who in his nine years as ambassador to Washington became legendary for his ability to reach deep into the U.S. hierarchy to extract information and make deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEspecially now, at a time when US leverage in the world is declining, the United States needs the best trained envoys.\n\nCongress should scale back the share of ambassadors who are political appointees, capping their number at no more than 10 per cent of the 189 US ambassadors. That would still leave room for presidents to pick accomplished businesspeople, politicians and others who are not career diplomats but have skills that would allow them to contribute as the nation's overseas representatives.\n\nLawmakers should add new disclosure requirements to make clear, while nominations are under consideration, how much diplomatic nominees owe to their political donations.\n\nThe State Department already posts on its website, state.gov, a rundown of nominees' credentials; it should also post the nominees' donations to both campaigns and related purposes, such as inaugural events.\n\nPresidents have come to rely on sale of these posts because they are the rewards the donors and bundlers covet most. But the costs have become too high and the practice needs to stop.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The Trump administration has given more than 40 per cent of its ambassadorships to political appointees, compared with the customary 30 per cent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4678%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_137%2C$y_74/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b14496eb951b0e4d820b90176682ec94312ee98", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
