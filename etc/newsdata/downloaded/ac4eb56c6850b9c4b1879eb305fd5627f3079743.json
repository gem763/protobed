This a free man talking.\u201d\n\nNoah couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. \u201cI was watching that, and I was like, are you shitting me? Like, of all people. I\u2019m not saying everything he\u2019s saying is wrong, but you are gonna say it? You, as Kanye West, are gonna talk shit about other rappers talking about buying \u2018foreign?\u2019 You, as Kanye West? \u2018I know Spike Lee\u2019s gonna kill me, but let me finish / I\u2019d rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig\u2019nant.\u2019 That Kanye West? Like, are you serious? \u2018You\u2019re such a fucking ho, I love it?\u2019 That Kanye West is gonna talk shit about rappers talking about fucking bitches?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree that you can have your own opinion\u2026but this is what I don\u2019t like, is when Kanye West and people like him will say, \u2018Black people in America have been brainwashed\u2026into voting for the Democrats, believing that they\u2019re victims, but we\u2019re not victims! We can vote Republican! We can do whatever we want!\u2019\u201d Noah continued. \u201cThen I\u2019m like, OK, let me get this straight: you\u2019re saying that every Black person in America is brainwashed? You\u2019re saying that seventy, eighty, ninety percent of Black people who are voting Democrat, they\u2019re brainwashed? So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re the only person who\u2019s enlightened, and all these Black people are stupidly following this Democratic-victim [narrative]?\u201d\n\nThe host then suggested West was disconnected from the wants and needs of regular Black Americans due to his immense wealth. What is more likely? The fact that these people are brainwashed, or the fact that, in America, you have to vote for the system that gives you the best chance? You only have two choices, and that does make it weird, but you only have to choices, and if you are a Black person you go, well, I\u2019m going to vote for the choice that gives me the best chance of success,\u201d said Noah, adding, \u201cYou get to a point, and it\u2019s true, when you are famous and rich enough as a Black person where it\u2019s like, yeah, your life isn\u2019t affected the same way by Republican policies. In fact, it may even be beneficial for you as a rich person to vote Republican because they\u2019re like \u2018less taxes,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll take that.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoah then turned the focus to Black women, who vote in higher numbers than any other group. In the 2016 presidential election, over 90 percent of Black women voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, whereas 53 percent of white women voted Trump.\n\n\u201cYou know who doesn\u2019t mess around with their votes in America? Black women. They don\u2019t. They do not. And I refuse to live in a world where I go, \u2018Black women have been brainwashed.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t think Black women in America have been\u2014or can be\u2014brainwashed. I think, if anything, Black women in America have the least leeway when it comes to messing around with their vote,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBlack women in America are like, no, I know where my vote needs to go because I know how important this is to me, because, as a woman and as a Black person combined, the impacts of my vote are exponentially felt. I have a higher rate of mortality when I\u2019m giving birth, I have a higher chance of not getting a loan, I have a higher chance of not getting a job, I will get exponentially less for doing the same job as somebody else. As a Black woman, I cannot afford to mess around with this vote. That, to me, is not a brainwashed person. That\u2019s not a victim.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host gave rapper Kanye West a serious reality check on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_689,w_1225,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572401495/Screen_Shot_2019-10-29_at_9.52.04_PM_xuxee8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
