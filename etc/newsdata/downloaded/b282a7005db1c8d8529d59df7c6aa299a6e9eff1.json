Back in May, Tether admitted it used its reserves to buy Bitcoin and other \u201cassets.\u201d\n\nAt the time, court documents detailed how New York Supreme Court Judge Joel M. Cohen was becoming increasingly suspicious of Bitfinex\u2019s and Tether\u2019s dealings \u2013 especially after both companies fessed up that the stablecoin wasn\u2019t entirely backed by cash, contrary to its marketing claims.\n\nMore recently, the New York Attorney General (NYSAG) ruled that Bitfinex could stop sharing documents about its use of Tether in an entirely different case.\n\nThe decision was taken after the exchange won a motion over an alleged $850 million cover-up.\n\nTether has long been at the center of rumors and conspiracy theories amongst industry insiders, and this additional (and suspiciously frivolous) class action lawsuit isn\u2019t likely to make things easier for the world\u2019s most popular stablecoin.", "description": "A brand new lawsuit alleges that cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and its sister company Tether manipulated the digital currency market.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F04%2Ftether-cryptocurrency-exchange-blockchain-bitfinex-attorney-general-sue-investigation.jpg&signature=1114c93753662427c9cf2b0d802c0ce4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
