Horrendous afternoon. It must be said that 99.9% of YTFC fans are also disgusted by what\u2019s happened as much as we are. One club, one community.\u201d\n\nEngland Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia halted twice over racist abuse Read more\n\nYeovil were leading 1-0 when Haringey\u2019s players walked off the field, with the target of the abuse reported to be goalkeeper Valery Pajetat. Ben James, a Haringey fan, was at the game and gave the PA news agency his account.\n\n\u201cWe were stood toward the other end so can\u2019t comment on what we heard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it all began when the referee gave Yeovil a penalty. It seemed like their fans were trying to wind up the Haringey goalie by shaking the net and the like.\n\n\u201cValery [Pajeta, the Haringey keeper] went towards their fans and seemed to have a bit of a conversation before coming away as if he\u2019d been hit with something. The referee then removed what looked like a bottle or a can. There was a bit of a pause while the referee dealt with what went on and players from both sides tried to quell what had gone on.\n\n\u201cThe penalty was taken and the Haringey manager marched straight on and withdrew his players as this was happening. The Haringey players seemed pretty agitated, Coby Rowe in particular having to be held back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Haringey fan, have been coming to games for a couple of years. They came back on [both Yeovil and Haringey players] to applaud the fans but that was it. But the game is abandoned. There were a few stewards but the police have been called since and are here now.\u201d", "description": "The FA Cup fourth-qualifying-round tie between Haringey Borough and Yeovil has been abandoned after allegations that a home player was racially abused", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07791da4773e6c98bc62827f10e26a5a17616b09/0_566_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8d07cae30f98064f5f491cbdc128f4e5", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
