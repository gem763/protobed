Fitch has affirmed the rating on DMDT's USD300 million 8.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024 at 'C' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. The downgrade reflects the expiry of a two-day grace period following a missed interest and principal amortisation payment on DMDT's USD79 million syndicated loan that was due on 21 September 2019. Key Rating Drivers Uncured Payment Default: Fitch believes DMDT's failure to cure the missed payment on its syndicated loan within the grace period has triggered an event of default under the syndicated loan agreement. We believe the company's current status has met Fitch's definition of an 'RD' rating, which specifies that the issuer has experienced an uncured payment default on a material financial obligation. Cross Default with Notes: DMDT failed to pay the interest on the USD300 million 8.625% notes when it was due on 12 September 2019, and we believe the company does not have the capacity to cure the missed payment within the 30-day grace period. We also believe the default on the syndication loan has triggered an event of default on the notes. Under the bond indenture, an event of default occurs if DMDT fails to pay principal or interest on any debt following a grace period, with an outstanding principle of more than USD10 million, which can lead to the note being declared immediately due and payable.Official PKPU Notice: DMDT said it has received an official notice from the Semarang Commercial Court regarding petitions for a court-enforced suspension of creditor liabilities (PKPU) against the Duniatex group, of which DMDT is a part. Fitch believes DMDT may start negotiations with its creditors to achieve a more sustainable capital structure. Derivation Summary The IDR has been downgraded to 'RD' as our definition of the rating is expiry of a grace period following non-payment of a material financial obligation. Key Assumptions Key Recovery Rating Assumptions- Fitch believes DMDT would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and would be reorganised rather than liquidated because of its nature as a manufacturing-based company- We have assumed going-concern EBITDA of around IDR1.4 trillion, equal to our estimate of the level of EBITDA necessary to service the company's post-restructuring debt obligations, maintenance capex and working-capital requirements. The going-concern EBITDA estimate was also based on our understanding that DMDT's raw materials may be sourced from independent third parties as they are considered commodities, and that related-party sales only accounted for around 20% of DMDT's revenue- An enterprise value (EV) multiple of 4x is used to calculate a post-reorganisation EV. Fitch believes this is closer to a distressed multiple, considering that other Indonesia-based textile and garment manufacturers - PT Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk (BB-/Stable) and PT Pan Brothers Tbk (B/Stable) - are trading at around 5x and 10x EV/EBITDA multiples, respectively- Around IDR1.5 trillion of secured debt as of 31 March 2019 has priority over the senior unsecured US dollar bond. On the other hand, we have assumed the settlement of the company's forward contract obligations will rank pari passu with the senior unsecured bond- 10% administrative claim to be applied on the going-concern EV- These assumptions result in a recovery rate for senior unsecured notes within the 'RR3' range. However, because Indonesia falls into Group D of creditor friendliness under our Country-Specific Treatment of Recovery Ratings Criteria, the recovery rate is subject to a soft cap of 'RR4', which maps to a senior unsecured rating of 'C' in line with our Corporates Notching and Recovery Ratings Criteria RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action:- Successful debt restructuringDevelopments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action:The IDR will be downgraded to 'D' if DMDT enters into bankruptcy proceedings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure or if it ceases operations Liquidity and Debt Structure Insolvent: Fitch believes DMDT does not have the funds to meet its immediate debt-servicing obligations and the company's access to new capital is poor. Summary of Financial Adjustments Summary of Financial Adjustments- Fitch includes advance payments, which are mostly for raw materials, as part of the working-capital calculation- Shareholder loans are not treated as debt ESG Considerations We have scored DMDT's governance sub-factors on governance structure at '5' and its financial transparency score at '4'. DMDT's governance structure was scored at '5' to reflect our view of Duniatex group's weak corporate governance, financial discipline and operational execution, which have a negative impact on the company's credit profile and is highly relevant to the rating. We gave a financial transparency score of '4' because - in combination with the other factors - the relative lack of reliable timely information affected the rating.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.
