That in turn could hurt the already fragile economy and undermine President Tayyip Erdogan's ability to stand up to international pressure against his offensive in Syria.\n\nLast year, a standoff with the United States was an aggravating factor in a 30% fall in the lira, prompting an economic recession in the country which is heavily dependent on imports as well as foreign investors flows.\n\nBy one measure, Turkey has about $36 billion in foreign exchange reserves, a number that is barely enough to defend a sustained assault on its currency.\n\n\"A shrinking pool of central bank reserves, large foreign currency rollover needs, and other economic vulnerabilities will limit Turkey's room for maneuver in Syria,\" said Karl Schamotta, director of foreign exchange strategy and structured products at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.\n\nState-owned banks are reported to have helped prop up the pressured lira in recent weeks. According to one estimate, $2 billion were funnelled into markets on a single day this week to defend the currency. Nonetheless, it tumbled 1.5% in the initial days of the invasion nine days ago before recovering some ground.\n\n\"Net reserves are negligible in Turkey,\" said Tatha Ghose, forex and emerging market analyst at Commerzbank in London.\n\n\"We assume that the Turkish central bank has no real reserve resources to fight lira weakness if and when it arises,\" Ghose said. Even countries such as Russia and China, with their much greater reserves, have found their forex firepower eroded quickly once pressure mounted, he added.\n\nTurkey's central bank declined to comment.\n\nThe deal to pause military operations in Syria has come as a respite for Turkish assets. The government has also tried to make it harder for investors to short the lira. Traders reported some Turkish banks were curbing lira supplies to overseas counterparts.\n\nYet, the relief is likely to be temporary. White House sanctions on a number of Turkish ministers and officials remain in place, a U.S. court case in which state lender Halkbank is accused of taking part in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran continues, and a host of European countries have taken steps to limit arms sales to their NATO ally.\n\nAnd with a U.S. congressional push for more sanctions going ahead full steam - including in a worst case scenario potential curbs on Turkey's sovereign debt - many investors fear the market euphoria may be short-lived.\n\nThe lira's history is littered with examples of tension with Washington dramatically amplifying exchange rate moves, while inflationary pressure - and its implications for central bank efforts to lower interest rates - are ever present.\n\nYet having just emerged from a 2018 economic crisis and a near 50% collapse in the lira's exchange rate fuelled by a stand-off between Washington and Ankara over U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson, markets are trying to gauge just how much of a financial buffer the country has to stave off a repeat.\n\nForeign reserves are crucial to a country's ability to support its currency as well as meet its import bills and external debt repayments.\n\nQuestions over its forex reserves roiled markets in the spring after a report that short-term borrowed money - or swaps - had become a substantial part of Ankara's war chest.\n\nSome investors and economists are puzzled about the best way to measure net reserves and how the central bank accounts for swaps in its calculations.\n\nWhile the latest central bank data showed net forex reserves were slightly below $37 billion, Oxford Economics/Haver calculated that actual usable forex reserves, taking into account beefed up gold reserves and commercial banks' forex requirements, stood at just $29 billion as of the end of August.", "description": "Turkey's ability to sustain its military campaign in Syria may depend in part on what happens far away from the battlefield: in the foreign exchange market.
