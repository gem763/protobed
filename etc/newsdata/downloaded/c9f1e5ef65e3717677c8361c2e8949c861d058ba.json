As of now they are still missing,\u201d Susana Rosas of Stockton, California, wrote on Tuesday morning. \u201cThe authorities do not have much to say to us.\u201d\n\nRosas posted that her daughters \u2013 Evan, Nicole and Angela Rose Quitasol \u2013 were with their father Michael Quitasol and stepmother Fernisa Sison, and thanked people for their prayers and support.\n\nCalifornia: shock and grief after at least 25 killed in boat fire off Santa Cruz Island Read more\n\nThe family of five was among 34 people presumed dead in the blaze. All were sleeping below deck when the fire started early Monday. Other victims included students from a northern California charter school, and a marine biologist who owned the diving company that was leading the tour.\n\nFive crew members were rescued, and the bodies of 20 victims have been recovered so far. Many need to be identified by DNA analysis, and officials are collecting samples from family members.\n\nEvan Quitasol was a nurse at St Joseph\u2019s Medical Center of Stockton, where her father and Sison had worked after attending nursing school at San Joaquin Delta College.\n\nRosas\u2019 husband, Chris, told the Los Angeles Times that Nicole Quitasol worked as a bartender in Coronado near San Diego and her sister, Angela Rose, was a science teacher at a middle school in Stockton, a city in northern California.\n\nThe sisters were on the trip to celebrate their dad\u2019s birthday, Chris Rosas said. He described them as \u201cthe most kind, most loving people I\u2019ve ever met \u2013 and I\u2019m not just saying that because they\u2019re family\u201d.\n\nSison also worked at the college teaching first-year nursing students full-time in 2005 and 2006 and later as an adjunct instructor, said Alex Breitler, the school\u2019s spokesman.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s devastated. It\u2019s a totally unexpected thing that happened,\u201d said Dominic Selga, Sison\u2019s ex-husband. \u201cWhat caused the fire? That\u2019s the big question; that\u2019s what we all want to know.\u201d\n\nSelga said his ex-wife\u2019s family had been on the boat \u201cfive or six\u201d times and had been diving for a decade. Selga said the two families spent Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day holidays together and called the Quitasols \u201cgreat people\u201d.\n\nAlso below deck were students from Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz. School director Maria C Reitano declined Tuesday to say how many students went on the trip, which was not sponsored by the school.\n\nScott Chan, a physics teacher at American High School in Fremont, was also on board with his daughter, said Brian Killgore, a spokesman for the Fremont Unified School District. The district said in a statement that Chan taught advanced placement physics classes for the past three years at the school and was well liked.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Chan, a physics teacher at American High School in Fremont, was aboard the ill-fated dive boat, a district representative has confirmed. Photograph: AP\n\n\u201cHis students knew him to be an innovative and inspiring teacher who developed a passion for physics among his students,\u201d the district said in a statement. \u201cHis loss is a tremendous tragedy for our school district.\u201d\n\nABC affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix reported that an Arizona couple, Patricia Beitzinger and Neal Baltz, were also on the trip.\n\n\u201cThey went to heaven doing something they loved together,\u201d Neal\u2019s father, John Baltz, told the station.\n\nBrett Harmeling of Houston said that his sister Kristy Finstad, 41, was leading the scuba tour off Santa Cruz Island, part of California\u2019s Channel Islands.\n\nHarmeling thanked everyone in a post on his Facebook page for their \u201cunconditional love and support during this incredibly tragic time\u201d.\n\nFinstad was co-owner of Worldwide Diving Adventures, a company founded by her mother in the 1970s and based in Santa Cruz, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of Santa Cruz Island.\n\nFinstad knew the area well, having done hundreds of dives in the Channel Islands, where she first swam as a toddler with her father. Harmeling described his sister to the Los Angeles Times as extremely strong-willed and adventurous.\n\n\u201cIf there was a one percent chance of her making it, she would have made it,\u201d Harmeling, 31, said.\n\nFinstad studied damselfish and corals in the Tahitian Islands, dove for black pearls in the French Polynesian Tuamotus Islands and counted salmonids for the city of Santa Cruz, where she lived. She also did research for the Australian Institute of Marine Science and wrote a restoration guidebook for the California Coastal Commission.\n\n\u201cMy mission is to inspire appreciation for our underwater world,\u201d she wrote on her company\u2019s website.\n\nShe and her husband had just returned from sailing across the South Pacific. It was part of their 10-year plan that started on the back of a napkin in 2006.\n\nThey left from the Channel Islands in 2015 on the journey and planned to return in 2018. Before they set off, Finstad wrote: \u201cOur new boss is King Neptune: when it blows we hunker down; when there\u2019s surf we paddle in; when there\u2019s rain we wash up.
