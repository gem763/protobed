But I think that maybe a deal could be struck where he was told if you don\u2019t make a replacement, then Nancy Pelosi does become president. And so, you are going to be impeached and convicted. You need to make this replacement so that the proper party remains in power.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "MSNBC contributor and former Watergate prosecutor Jill Wine-Banks on Saturday proposed a deal to allow the GOP to remain in power following the | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jill-wine-banks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
