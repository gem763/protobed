Four seats still must be attributed according to the results of votes cast abroad.\n\nThe election bucks the trend of declining centre-left fortunes and the rise of far-right populist forces seen elsewhere in Europe.\n\nA new far-right formation, Chega! or \"That's Enough!\" entered parliament for the first time, but it won a single seat.\n\nTurnout was just 54.5%, the lowest level for a general election since Portugal returned to democracy after a decades-long right-wing dictatorship was toppled in 1974.\n\nThe question now is who Costa, 58, a former Lisbon mayor, will pick as his allies.\n\nAfter the last general election in 2015, in which the PS finished second, Costa convinced the Communists and the Left Bloc to support a minority Socialist government, an unprecedented alliance that foes nicknamed the \"geringonca\", or odd contraption.\n\n'Stability is essential'\n\nDuring his victory speech, Costa said he wanted to \"renew this experience\" of an alliance with the hard-left.\n\n\"The election shows that the Portuguese like the 'geringonca', they like this political solution,\" he said as supporters chanted \"Victory!\".\n\n\"Stability is essential for Portugal's international credibility and for attracting investors. The PS will strive to find solutions that ensure this stability for the entire legislature.\"\n\nBoth the Left Bloc, which won 19 seats just as in the last election, and the Communists, which won 12 seats, five fewer than in the last polls, said they were willing to once again back the Socialists.\n\nA strengthened PS has more alternatives to get laws approved in parliament, political analyst Pedro Norton told public television RTP.\n\n\"This is an incentive for it to govern alone, by searching for ad hoc agreements\" to govern instead of forming a formal agreement, he added.\n\nThe election gave Costa another potential governing partner as the upstart People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) which has backed his budgets in the past won four seats, up from just one.\n\n'Live more comfortably'\n\nAfter coming to power in 2015, Costa undid some of the unpopular austerity measures introduced by the previous PSD-led government, in return for a $85bn international bailout that kept finances afloat after Portugal was clobbered by the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nTaking advantage of the global economic recovery, he reversed cuts to public sector wages and pensions while still managing to bring the budget deficit down to nearly zero this year \u2013 the lowest level since Portugal's return to democracy in 1974.\n\nOn his watch, Portugal's economic growth was higher than the European Union average in recent years \u2013 2.4% in 2018 \u2013 while the unemployment rate fell to 6.4%, the level before the debt crisis, but critics complain of low salaries, job insecurity and soaring property prices amid a tourism boom.\n\nRetired municipal worker Antonio Tavares, 76, said he voted for the Socialists because the government raised pensions by \u20ac50 to \u20ac100 per month.\n\n\"It's not a lot, it should be more, but that allows one to live more comfortably,\" he said after casting his ballot in Lisbon.\n\nThe PS had enjoyed a double-digit lead over the PSD for many months, but the gap between Portugal's two main parties shrunk in the final stretch of the campaign, especially after a scandal concerning former defence minister Jose Azeredo Lopes resurged.\n\nLopes was charged last week with abuse of power and denial of justice over his role in the alleged cover-up of an arms theft from a military depot in June 2017.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Portugal's incumbent Prime Minister Antonio Costa's Socialists have won a general election marked by low turnout after presiding over a period of solid economic growth following years of austerity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7951/b88b3f069c814db3b49956465f9c2c0b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
