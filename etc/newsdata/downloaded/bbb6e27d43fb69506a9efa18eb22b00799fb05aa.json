U.S. economic outlook is quite good, it still has strong fundamentals,\" he said, adding though that trade tensions remained downside risks, potentially putting off investment decisions by companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wall Street's main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks after employment and manufacturing data suggested that the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.\n\nAdding to trade concerns, the United States won approval on Wednesday to levy import tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods over illegal EU subsidies handed to Airbus , threatening to trigger a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war.
