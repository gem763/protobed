ACT awards grants to non-profit organizations with projects focused on improving local communities in the categories of Wellness, Education, or Arts and Culture. Last year, the Gannett Foundation received over 900 video submissions and gave a total of $600,000 in charitable grants to nine philanthropic organizations.\n\nThis year\u2019s charitable giving program will also award a total of $600,000 in grants, and based on feedback from last year\u2019s program, ACT was enhanced to allow participating groups to raise additional funds through a new crowdfunding component. Submissions for 2018 are being done through CrowdRise, which is owned by GoFundMe, and all campaigns will receive the funding that they raise via the crowdsourcing platform. Only campaigns that reach or exceed their goal on CrowdRise will be eligible to receive a grant from the Gannett Foundation, and the campaigns that raise the most money will be eligible to receive an additional \u201cfan favorite\u201d grant. The Gannett Foundation will ultimately select twelve grantees based on their viability, sustainability, and impact.\n\nACT is, at its core, a nation-wide effort to promote positive change in communities. The program empowers charitable organizations to magnify their messages and build support through the reach of the USA TODAY NETWORK, which includes USA TODAY and 109 local publications. Last year, organizations from over 400 different communities made submissions to ACT.\n\n\u201cA Community Thrives is one of the best examples of why the local-to-national footprint of the USA TODAY NETWORK is so meaningful,\u201d said Andy Yost, chief marketing officer, Gannett | USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cThe NETWORK is proud and honored to bolster the awareness and funding of worthy causes in local communities. We are eager to learn more about this year\u2019s projects.\u201d\n\nACT\u2019s impressive launch last year offers optimism for its potential in 2018. \u201cA Community Thrives greatly impacted our community. It was like the entire city was rallying behind us,\u201d said Kimberly Baker, Director of Development for Valiant Cross Academy \u2013 a 2017 ACT grant recipient. \u201cThis grant brought people to the table to have positive conversations about what is going right with our community. This program bonded people together for a greater cause. When we announced we had won, you would have thought our home team had won the national championship. It was a beautiful thing to watch.\u201d\n\nIn one example of ACT\u2019s ongoing engagement with its winners, the NETWORK collaborated with Facebook this December to broadcast fundraising competitions for three of its 2017 grant winners. Promise in Brevard, Mary\u2019s Magical Place, and Art at the Crossroads participated in creative challenges to raise money, and members of the NETWORK livestreamed the action.\n\nTo grow its impact this year, ACT is seeking even more involvement from local communities. To submit a project idea to the 2018 A Community Thrives program, please visit https://www.crowdrise.com/ACT2018. The submission period will close on March 15 at 11:59am ET.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2trDAQp", "description": "USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s corporate social responsibility program \u201cA Community Thrives\u201d (ACT) is aiming to make an even bigger impact in its second year.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
