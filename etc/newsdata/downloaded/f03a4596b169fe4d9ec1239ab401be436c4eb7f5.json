Or, as Baldwin called it, \u201cthe great city of Albacore, tuna capital of the United States.\u201d\n\nDismissing the impeachment inquiry into him as a \u201cDeep State conspiracy,\u201d Baldwin introduced various supporters to come up and offer their interpretations of what was actually happening. Those supporters included Mikey Day as a member of Bikers for Trump, who said to the crowd: \u201cAll this man did was shake down a foreign government to get dirt on his political enemy. I mean, is that wrong?\u201d\n\nThe crowd answered in unison: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d\n\nThe crowd replied, \u201cSorry, no.\u201d", "description": "Chance also did double duty as the musical guest, and several more surprise guests stopped by the rally.", "authors": ["Dave Itzkoff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/arts/27snl/27snl-facebookJumbo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
