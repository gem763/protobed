Yeah, pretty much.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nThen-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on Sept. 5, 2018. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nRobin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, the New York Times reporters behind the book \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d completed their \u201cinvestigation\u201d of his confirmation proceedings without a key piece of input: \u201cKavanaugh himself declined to be interviewed,\u201d reads the author\u2019s note.\n\nBehind those six words lies a longer story. In an interview Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington, Pogrebin and Kelly were asked about their efforts to secure a sit-down session with Kavanaugh. As Pogrebin told the story, they came close to finalizing terms for an interview late in the process, near the time that book was headed to the presses.\n\nYet things didn\u2019t work out. \u201cWe were on our way to Washington to speak to him,\u201d said Pogrebin. \u201cWe had finally kind of arranged for an interview. Ultimately we could not agree on terms that we felt comfortable with, and so we didn\u2019t do it, regrettably. We didn\u2019t feel like we could.\"\n\nAsked to elaborate, Pogrebin did:\n\nWe have debated whether to talk about this. But it is what it is \u2014 which is, he wanted us to say we hadn\u2019t spoken to him, and we even went to negotiate the phrasing of that, where we even were willing to say nothing, not to talk about who we spoke to, not to talk about our sources. But he wanted a line in there saying we did not, and we felt that to mislead our readers in a book about, that very much deals with issues of truth, would probably not be a good foot forward.\n\nIn a separate interview with Yahoo News, Kelly put the matter a bit more clinically: \u201cThe dispute was that he wanted us to say in the book that he had declined to be interviewed,\u201d she said, also noting that the authors worked through intermediaries to suss out Kavanaugh\u2019s interview preferences.\n\nThe bind in which Pogrebin and Kelly found themselves is as old as investigative journalism. The competing imperatives here are both compelling: On the one hand, you have to protect your sources; on the other hand, you have to be honest with the reader about who\u2019s cooperating. Over time, news organizations have dealt with the situation by writing something like, \u201cSo-and-so declined to speak for the record,\" or they might just leave out an attribution note, as Pogrebin and Kelly were prepared to do in this instance. Had they chosen the latter option, of course, they still would have faced questions about whether Kavanaugh had cooperated for the book.\n\nFamous investigative journalist Bob Woodward tells the Erik Wemple Blog that he doesn\u2019t remember any such request from one of his sources. \u201cI don\u2019t recall it happening, but it\u2019s been 48 years of reporting,\u201d says Woodward, whose books rely extensively on background and off-the-record conversations to nail down specific events, negotiations and disputes. The idea of speaking on any basis whatsoever with a source, only to turn around and write that the source declined to comment, is a no-no in the Woodward book: \u201cWe just need to be as straight about all these things as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be like in \u2018All the President\u2019s Men\u2019 saying, \u2018Mark Felt declined to comment.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhy deal with someone who would insist on such a condition anyhow? This is \u201csomebody that\u2019s supposed to be telling the truth and then they\u2019re saying, \u2018Let\u2019s engage in this minor deception,\u2019\u201d says Woodward, later adding, \u201cYou want a relationship of trust and then somebody says, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s deceive the public or my boss.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohn Cook, investigations editor at Business Insider, tells us via email, \u201cKavanaugh has been around for a while, and talked to plenty of reporters in his time. I doubt he would have made the request if it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d become accustomed to getting.\u201d Indeed: Kavanaugh is a former aide to George W. Bush and worked under independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr \u2014 meaning he knows how to talk terms with D.C. reporters. The Columbia Journalism Review noted last year:\n\nIn July, Kavanaugh acknowledged having \u201cbeen a source for several books written about the Starr investigation.\u201d Last week, he told Washington Post reporters Tom Hamburger, Robert Barnes, and Robert O\u2019Harrow, Jr., \u201cI have also spoken to reporters on background as appropriate or as directed.\u201d [Author Dan] Moldea told the Post that Kavanaugh \u201cwas the designated person\u201d the Office of the Independent Counsel \u201cputs with people like me.\u201d As evidence, Moldea kept recordings of his conversations with Starr deputies and has played them for Judiciary Committee lawyers. According to the Post, \u201cThe recordings suggest that Starr\u2019s top deputies referred Moldea to Kavanaugh for answers to questions about the Foster matter.\u201d\n\nPhilip B. Corbett, associate managing editor for standards at the New York Times,\n\nnotes that the newspaper has rules covering the sort of activity alleged by the book\u2019s authors. \u201cIn general, our guidelines for handling and describing anonymous sourcing say we should be truthful and not mislead readers. That seems to be what Robin and Kate were striving for here,\u201d writes Corbett in an email. The book, of course, wasn\u2019t controlled by New York Times rules. Washington Post Managing Editor Tracy Grant says the following section of the paper\u2019s standards document governs off-the-record-declined-to-comment subterfuge: \u201cWe must strive to tell our readers as much as we can about why our unnamed sources deserve our confidence. Our obligation is to serve readers, not sources.\u201d\n\nA separate question relates to the authors\u2019 decision to reveal the negotiations themselves. As Pogregin herself disclosed on Wednesday, the decision to talk about them was a matter of \u201cdebate\u201d between the authors. \u201c[M]aybe these intermediaries weren\u2019t sophisticated enough to force Pogrebin and Kelly to agree to treat their negotiations as off the record,\u201d notes Cook. \u201cAnd if Pogrebin and Kelly want to exploit that to reveal that Kavanaugh wanted them to lie to their readers on his behalf \u2014 fine! But you have to admit that it seems a little unsportsmanlike.\u201d\n\nOr sharp-elbowed. Or squarely in the public interest.\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: The New York Times\u2019s rocky Kavanaugh weekend\n\nPaul Waldman: No, the Kavanaugh controversy won\u2019t help Trump in 2020\n\nJennifer Rubin: Here\u2019s how to handle Kavanaugh\n\nKaren Tumulty: Don\u2019t revisit the Kavanaugh fight.
