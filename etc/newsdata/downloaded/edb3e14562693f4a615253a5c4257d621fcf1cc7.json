You probably wouldn't struggle to list Naomi Campbell or Linda Evangelista, or more recent inheritors of the title like Kendall Jenner, Adut Akech or Gigi and Bella Hadid. But now, imagine you're asked to define what makes Campbell and the Hadids \"super,\" and others who walk the exact same runways just \"models.\" Is it fame, or the fees they might command, or something more intangible?\n\nThe term has a tendency to provoke controversy: See the debate over the past few years over whether Jenner and the Hadids should rightfully be considered supermodels, given the origins of their fame in social media and reality television (for Jenner, \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\"; for the Hadids, \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\".) Model and actress Rebecca Romijn reportedly said Jenner and Gigi Hadid weren't \" true supermodels ,\" while Stephanie Seymour, one of the first wave of supers, said she'd prefer to call them \" b******* of the moment .\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 \u2013 Versace Spring-Summer 2020 Jennifer Lopez emerged onto the runway in a remake of \"That Dress\" for Versace.

The term originated, according to Phelps, \"as models started getting big, lucrative beauty contracts, in the millions of dollars.\"\n\nNaomi Campbell is one of the original supermodels, alongside Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, and Linda Evangelista.

You can see how models like that can command much bigger salaries.\"\n\nSupermodel Coco Rocha, who was cultivating her enormous online following when Jenner and the Hadids were still in high school, credits social media with the return of the super. The difference between the pre-and post-digital supermodels (Rocha is definitely a post, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram alone), is that the latter have no air of mystique. \"Nowadays, you know where they eat, you know where they shop, you know who they're dating, whereas before you knew nothing,\" Rocha says.\n\nSisters Bella and Gigi Hadid are two of the social media generation's most famous supermodels.

She runs her own training course for aspiring models, the Coco Rocha Model Camp, where attendees expect to \"learn about posing and runway as anyone would assume,\" she says. While they're certainly on the curriculum, according to Rocha, \"the majority of the classes is learning about social media and what that has to offer for us.\"\n\nIt's an approach to model school that Phelps admires, telling CNN Style, \"Thanks to social media, even models who aren't supermodels can build brands and go on to have very successful careers.\"\n\nMost models, even those who walk for the most prestigious fashion houses, won't ever reach the exalted rank of \"supermodel\" -- as Phelps explains, there are \"hundreds of thousands of models working today.\" But whether it's Naomi Campbell or Kendall Jenner they idolize, the elusive allure of the first wave or the mass online appeal of the latest, it's safe to assume one thing: \"Of course these young models dream of being a supermodel.\"", "description": "How does the fashion industry define what makes Naomi Campbell or Kendall Jenner \"super,\" and others who walk the exact same runways just \"models.\" Is it fame, or the fees they might command, or something more intangible?", "authors": ["Emily Dixon"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190603213052-06-cfda-2019-bella-hadid-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
