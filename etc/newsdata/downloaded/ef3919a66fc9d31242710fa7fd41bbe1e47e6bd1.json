That is because none of them will ever top Maybelline\u2019s Superstay Matte Ink, in the Pioneer shade.\n\nI have raved about this lipstick so many times I\u2019ve lost count. People have commented on it in the bathroom at work, at various shops, even at the dentist\u2019s office.\n\nEach time, I\u2019ve said the same thing: this lipstick has consistently exceeded my expectations. Its main virtue is that it does not smudge. And I mean that, it can handle anything that's thrown at it. I put it on most mornings around 7.30am and don\u2019t reapply until I leave work around 6pm \u2013 and even then, only a tiny touch-up at the center of my lips is needed.\n\nThe outline endures throughout the day, even if I eat a salad or an apple, lipstick\u2019s sworn enemies. I have worn this lipstick during a teeth cleaning. I have worn this lipstick while running an actual marathon. Each time, it completely surpassed expectations. If anything, this lipstick\u2019s only drawback is that it can be hard to remove, even with a waterproof make-up remover \u2013 just make sure you got all the colour off before you wipe your lips on your crisp, white bath towel.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to apply, too \u2013 sure, you can use a contour and a proper lipstick brush if you\u2019re so inclined, or you can be lazy like me and just use the provided brush, which works a charm.\n\nThe Pioneer shade is that classic red so many people are after, not too bright and not too dark. Maybelline\u2019s other shades are nice too, by the way \u2013 Pioneer has just stood out as my new essential. I have been known to buy tubes of it two or three at a time, I always have a little stockpile waiting at home, and I live in the constant fear that Maybelline will discontinue it.\n\nTo top it all off, the Superstay Matte Ink retails for $9.49, an absolute steal when compared to some of the higher-end offerings on the market right now. And it truly, genuinely does a better job for a fraction of the price.\n\nBuy Maybelline\u2019s Superstay Matte Ink in Pioneer by clicking here.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
