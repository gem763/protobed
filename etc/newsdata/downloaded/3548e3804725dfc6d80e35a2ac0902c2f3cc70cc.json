But September is almost always a month of near-perfect temperatures, and this year has been no exception. Nevertheless, the so-called \u201cClimate Strike\u201d movement chose last Friday, September 20, as the date for their big day of demonstrations.\n\nThe high temperature was an ideal 77 deg F (25 deg C). Estimates of the number of protesters that turned out range (according to the New York Times) from 60,000 (NY Police Dept.) to 250,000 (organizers). The message of the speakers was, of course, that we are in the midst of a climate crisis that must be addressed immediately by drastic and coercive government action. It seems that the organizers and leaders of the demonstrations, let alone a goodly number of the participants, have turned themselves purple with anger over unverifiable predictions of barely-perceptible future temperature increases. From the Times:\n\nRarely, if ever, has the modern world witnessed a youth movement so large and wide, spanning across societies rich and poor, tied together by a common if inchoate sense of rage.\n\nLet me assemble some of the words that were used by these people. I suppose that they somehow think that this kind of rhetoric might be convincing to the normal people who were just trying to enjoy a beautiful late summer day. Is any of it persuasive to you?\n\nFrom the ubiquitous teen-ager Greta Thunberg, quoted in Time:\n\n\u201cThis is an emergency. Our house is on fire. . . . We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse. . . . Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us. That is being sold for profit. Everywhere I have been the situation is more or less same. The people in power, their beautiful words are the same. . . . The number of politicians and celebrities who want to take selfies with us are the same. The empty promises are the same. The lies are the same, and the inaction is the same.\u201d\n\nIf that is not crazy enough for you, try these lines, also attributed to Thunberg (although I seriously doubt that she wrote them), appearing in a \u201cClimate Resistance Handbook\u201d put out in advance of the event by 350.org:\n\nI don\u2019t want your hope. I don\u2019t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. Around the year 2030, we will be in a position where we set an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, that will most likely lead to the end of our civilisation as we know it. That is unless in that time, permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society have taken place, including a reduction of CO2 emissions by at least 50%.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not focus all of our attention on the wild-eyed Ms. Thunberg. How about something from another speaker at the New York event, Vic Barrett? That\u2019s the Vic Barrett previously best known as one of the plaintiffs in the litigation dubbed by the Manhattan Contrarian as the \u201cStupidest Litigation in the Country,\u201d namely the case from Oregon seeking to have the federal courts declare a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to a \u201cstable climate,\u201d and then use that declaration to enjoin all production and use of fossil fuels. Here are some of the words of Ms. Barrett (video at the link):\n\nWe are being pushed from the lands that we settled, the lands that my family has inhabited for generations. That land will be under water in a few decades if we continue on the path we are on. . . . My future is being stolen from me. . . . Everything that I am is slipping into the sea. . . . My people face extinction. Indigenous lands all over our planet are being flooded, poisoned and destroyed.\n\nYes, we are to feel \u201cpanic\u201d over our impending \u201cextinction.\u201d Supposedly, this is the conclusion of \u201cscience.\u201d Really? Meanwhile, here\u2019s a new source of relevant data that I have not previously highlighted at this site. NOAA has a special and relatively new U.S.-only surface temperature series, called USCRN (US Climate Reference Network) based on only 114 of its very best ground thermometers, with state-of-the-art equipment and pristine siting, relatively evenly spaced around the country. By contrast to the other series from NOAA and NASA, this one has no \u201chomogenization\u201d adjustment thrown in by the climate activists in the bowels of the agencies. The series only goes back to 2005. Here\u2019s what it shows:", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever spent much time in New York, you know that it can be \r\nweather-challenged: very hot in the summer, and very cold in the winter. \r\nBut September is almost always a month of near-perfect temperatures, and \r\nthis year has been no exception.
