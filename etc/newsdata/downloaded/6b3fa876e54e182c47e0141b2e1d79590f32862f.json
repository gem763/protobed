But He Didn\u2019t Step Up To Oppose An NRA Champion.", "language": "en", "text": "Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from El Paso, Texas, is hoping a push for tougher gun laws can lift the fortunes of his struggling presidential campaign.\n\nIn the wake of the mass shooting in an El Paso Walmart that killed 22 people, he has backed more ambitious gun safety policies than any of his rivals, particularly his call for a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault rifles already in circulation.\n\nBut this new ardor on gun regulation hits a still-raw nerve for some of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s critics, who recall his neutrality in a key House race in 2018 that returned a National Rifle Association-approved lawmaker to Congress.\n\nAt the time, O\u2019Rourke was engaged in his own high-profile, grassroots-approved run for the Senate against incumbent Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nThe race to represent Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District pitted Gina Ortiz Jones, a Democrat backed by the Giffords gun safety group, against Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican who had an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. O\u2019Rourke declined to endorse Ortiz Jones, a lesbian Iraq War veteran who would have been the first Filipina-American in Congress. She went on to lose the race to Hurd, who is friends with O\u2019Rourke, by a mere 926 votes.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to know for sure what O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement would have done for Ortiz Jones, he racked up bigger vote totals than she did in a number of the 23rd District\u2019s rural counties that November, which suggests his blessing could have made a difference. The district covers 26 counties and parts of three more. A HuffPost analysis of election results found that if Ortiz Jones had attained O\u2019Rourke\u2019s totals in these seven counties \u2015 Culberson, Brewster, Val Verde, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit and Presidio \u2015 she would have netted an additional 970 votes, more than Hurd\u2019s margin of victory.\n\n\u201cI am glad that Beto is coming to this [guns] fight when so many have been organizing and making policy on it for so long,\u201d said Annie Weinberg, a former elections director for the liberal group Democracy for America, which endorsed both O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate bid and Ortiz Jones\u2019 House run. \u201cIt remains to be seen the depth of his commitment and how he is going to follow through, because he was willing to give a pass to a congressman who had an A rating from the NRA. That is a trust deficit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Beto had a chance to help elect a pro-gun control Democrat over the NRA favorite, he stayed on the sidelines,\u201d said Monica Klein, who advises progressive women running for office. \u201cHis newfound gun control activism is the kind of inauthentic posturing that turns voters off of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nScott Eisen/Getty Images Beto O'Rourke has endorsed a mandatory assault weapons buyback, among other tough gun safety provisions.\n\nSome Democrats have also faulted O\u2019Rourke for lending Hurd bipartisan credibility during the 2018 election cycle. In March 2017, after a Washington snowstorm scuttled air travel plans, the neighboring House members embarked on a buddy road trip from San Antonio, Texas, back to the nation\u2019s capital in time for important votes. The pair, who earned some viral attention with a live stream of their trip, appeared together at an official event more than a year later, at a time when O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate run and Hurd\u2019s reelection bid were in full swing.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to his congressional career, Beto was never about the issues. Beto has always been about protecting his buddies in Congress,\u201d said progressive strategist Murshed Zaheed, noting that O\u2019Rourke endorsed Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney for New York attorney general in 2018 over both progressive law professor Zephyr Teachout and Tish James, who became the state\u2019s first Black attorney general.\n\nBut other Democratic strategists have disputed the idea that full-throated support from O\u2019Rourke would have made the difference for Ortiz Jones. And as a Senate candidate, O\u2019Rourke has noted that he shared voter data and other resources with Texas\u2019 entire slate of down-ballot Democratic candidates, including Ortiz Jones. And even as he declined to officially endorse her, O\u2019Rourke spoke highly of her at campaign events where she was present.\n\nHurd, currently the only African-American Republican in the House, has taken more moderate stances on some issues than his GOP colleagues. For example, he voted against the bill that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act in May 2017.\n\nBut until recently, Hurd has stuck to party orthodoxy on guns. In a message to members encouraging them to vote for Hurd in 2018, the NRA noted, among other things, his opposition to expanded background checks and his support for a bill requiring all states to honor concealed carry permits issued in gun owners\u2019 home states. In January 2016, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Hurd blasted then-President Barack Obama for a series of executive actions tightening gun safety, including measures designed to increase background checks and keep closer track of firearms lost in transit from manufacturers to gun sellers.\n\nHurd is not seeking reelection next year. If he were, it is not clear that he would still receive an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA. This year, Hurd voted for a bill to close some major background check loopholes, such as those exempting gun shows and other private sales. He still voted against a bill to close the \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d by extending the background check period from three to 10 days. And he is still co-sponsoring the bill that would effectively prevent more liberal states from upholding their own concealed carry laws.\n\nOf course, Hurd\u2019s reelection did not prevent Democrats from taking control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, nor did his \u201cno\u201d vote on the Charleston loophole bill stop it from passing the House. O\u2019Rourke said in June that he would support Ortiz Jones if she were the Democratic nominee in the race for the now-open Texas House seat. Ortiz Jones announced in May that she would run for the seat again; Hurd announced his plans to retire at the end of his term in August.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has been candid about how the two recent mass shootings in Texas \u2015 in El Paso in early August and in the Midland-Odessa area at the end of the month \u2015 have sharpened his views on gun safety.\n\nIn a mid-August interview on CNN, O\u2019Rourke argued that the time had passed for merely deliberating bold measures like a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to people. I\u2019ve listened to that survivor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, regardless of what it does to our prospects going forward, you\u2019ve got to speak the truth and be clear about where the solutions are.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who has hovered in the low single digits in most presidential primary polls, has the opportunity to test the appeal of his gun safety pitch at the Democratic primary debate in Houston on Thursday evening.", "description": "O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t endorse Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones in her 2018 race against GOP Rep.
