And Jessica Contrera reports from what might be the most dramatic dog park in the country.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nAfter mass shootings, big-box stores are responding to public pressure\n\nWalmart will stop selling ammunition for military-style weapons and no longer allow customers to openly carry firearms in stores, joining other big-box chains after facing pressure from gun-control groups, politicians and employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven after banning the sale of military-style rifles in 2015, the world\u2019s largest retailer owned about 20 percent of the ammunition market. That share could now fall to as little as 6 percent, company representatives say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019ve seen a wave of companies deciding that they want to integrate stances on political issues, be it immigration or be it gun control, into their identity as a company,\u201d says business reporter Taylor Telford . \u201cAnd people respond really strongly to that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a VA pathologist misdiagnosed thousands of cases\n\nFor more than 10 years, the chief pathologist for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Fayetteville, Ark., allegedly misdiagnosed patients and falsified records to mask a serious drug and alcohol addiction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors have officially charged former pathologist Robert Morris Levy with three counts of involuntary manslaughter, although VA officials acknowledge that he botched the diagnosis of at least 15 patients who later died and 15 others whose health was seriously harmed. He was fired in 2018 after a dozen years of complaints.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter Lisa Rein spoke with patients of the Fayetteville VA and investigated the oversight failures that allowed Levy \u2013 as well as other doctors in the agency\u2019s sprawling network of 167 hospitals and 1,000 clinics \u2013 to compromise patient care for many years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo many of these cases were instances in which, if these people\u2019s cancer had been caught early, then it could have been eliminated or bigger steps could have been taken,\u201d Rein said. \u201cBut by the time they figured out that this mistake had been made many years ago, they had late-stage cancer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u2018most divisive dog park in the country\u2019 \u2013 maybe\n\nLast fall, Chevy Chase Village in Maryland spent $134,000 to turn a muddy triangle of land into a dog park, where pups could run off-leash in a fenced refuge. Controversy ensued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe dogs came to the park, and the dogs barked at the park,\u201d reporter Jessica Contrera says. \u201cAnd that was immediately a problem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nUp went signs decrying the sound and the parking of non-residents in the wealthy neighborhood. Residents called police to the park daily to deal with noise complaints. The Chevy Chase Village Board of Managers took details of the park down from its website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you listen to one side, the park is this total noise-fest where the dogs are barking incessantly and the owners don\u2019t care,\u201d Contrera says. \u201cAnd on the other side, this little patch of land has become this unique, beautiful community gathering spot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Taylor Telford on Walmart\u2019s response to multiple mass shootings.
