The 22-year-old finished the game 11-of-32 for 86 yards and a career-worst QB rating of 3.6.\n\nIn collecting four interceptions during the shutout, the Patriots ran their total to 18 on the year, the most for a team through seven games in a season since the 1996 Packers had 20.\n\nThanks to the defense, not Tom Brady and the offense (who had fewer than 325 yards of total offense but did notch four touchdowns), New England has a point differential of plus-175 on the season and the team is on pace to allow just 110 points on the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the blueprint of coming out each week, each day in practice, putting in the work, studying film (and) getting on the same page,\u201d said Patriots safety Devin McCourty. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about adjustments right after the coin toss of something that might come in a game. These guys are that locked in. We have to keep doing it because for the rest of the season, we\u2019re going to get every offense\u2019s best shot. They\u2019re going to be ready to go. We\u2019re not a surprise anymore, we just have to keep being locked in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy 12 hours for the Patriots as the team has reportedly acquired veteran wide receiver Mohamed Sanu from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.\n\nUsually a second or third option in Atlanta\u2019s passing game, Sanu should occupy a similar role in New England\u2019s offense behind top target Julian Edelman. Sanu has 33 receptions for 313 yards and one touchdown this season.\n\nThe addition of Sanu helps bulk up a receiving corps that is currently missing Josh Gordon (knee) and top draft pick N\u2019Keal Harry (injured reserve) and is continuing to adjust to life in the post-Antonio Brown era.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "During a 33-0 beatdown in which Darnold was caught saying he was \"seeing ghosts\" into a live mic, the Patriots capitalized on New York\u2019s six turnovers.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182559122-e1571746605556.jpg?fit=752%2C501", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
