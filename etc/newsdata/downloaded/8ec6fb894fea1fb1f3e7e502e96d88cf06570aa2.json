It was a test case for a TV alternative alongside Dish\u2019s DISH, -1.72% Sling TV, and, later, a slew of copycats from AT&T\u2019s T, -1.12% DirecTV , Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL, -2.20% YouTube, Hulu and others.\n\nThese services were initially heralded as the future of TV as cable cord-cutting ramped up. They offered popular TV networks for less than you\u2019d pay a cable company. Signing up and canceling were easy, with no need for a cable guy to come to your house.\n\nBut customer growth has slowed and even dropped for many of these services as prices rose and they added more channels, coming closer to their traditional TV counterparts. AT&T\u2019s version, formerly known as DirecTV Now, today AT&T TV Now, has dropped customers for four straight quarters, losing more than 700,000 subscribers as it rolled off deep discounts.\n\nResearch firm MoffettNathanson estimates the total market at about 8.4 million. There are about 86 million traditional TV households.\n\n\u201cThe market is due for a shakeout,\u201d MoffettNathanson\u2019s Craig Moffett said of the online-cable substitutes, which initially charged customers less than they paid for their programming. When they raised prices, customers left. \u201cIt was a Catch-22 from the beginning. They were unrealistically priced.\u201d\n\nSony SNE, +0.30% did not release how many customers Vue had, but it was seen as a small player. It will shut down in January.\n\nThe industry\u2019s latest hope for a successor to cable or satellite TV and a counter to Netflix NFLX, -0.23% has now shifted to streaming services, including new entries from Disney DIS, -0.80% , Comcast CMCSA, -0.20% and AT&T. Apple\u2019s AAPL, -2.31% version launches Friday.\n\nIncreasing competition for people\u2019s dollars from all those services will put more pressure on the online-cable services, said Pivotal Research\u2019s Jeff Wlodarczak.\n\n\u201cThe only way to innovate in pay TV is to try to follow Netflix,\u201d Wlodarczak said. \u201cYou can\u2019t innovate in pay TV. It\u2019s too firmly ensconced.\u201d", "description": "Sony is shutting down its pioneering online-cable alternative, PlayStation Vue, citing the high cost of content and the difficulty of reaching deals with...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX412_sony10_ZG_20171031223851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
