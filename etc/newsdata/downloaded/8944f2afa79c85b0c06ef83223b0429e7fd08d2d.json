Ilhan Omar (D-MN) confirmed her rumored endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in a formal video released Wednesday morning.\n\nShe told her followers Sanders is the \u201cthe only candidate who has built a movement,\u201d adding the socialist senator\u2019s vision will help establish the America she dreamt of, which is \u201cnot a reality yet.\u201d\n\nSanders teased an endorsement from freshman lawmaker Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, and reports surfaced quickly after, indicating Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Omar would be endorsing the socialist senator\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nOmar tweeted a video of her formal endorsement on Wednesday:\n\n.@BernieSanders isn\u2019t fighting to win just one presidential election \u2014 he\u2019s fighting for the soul of our democracy. Here\u2019s more on why I\u2019m so proud to give Bernie my endorsement for president of the United States: pic.twitter.com/1NLMPnzS1x \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI am so proud to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for president,\u201d Omar said, describing the Vermont lawmaker as \u201cthe only candidate who has built a movement and continues to build a movement that transcends gender, ethnicity, and religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we know in order to take on Trump, we\u2019re going to need a unifier\u2013 someone who understands what the fight looks like and someone who is ready to defeat him,\u201d she continued, adding that she was \u201cone of the people inspired\u201d by the movement Sanders created.\n\n\u201cI was one of the people inspired by the movement that the Senator has built. There was an America that I dreamed about. There is an America that most people believe in,\u201d she said, adding that is just \u201can ideal\u201d and \u201cnot reality yet.\u201d\n\nOne of the most \u201camazing\u201d things about the socialist senator, Omar said, is \u201che understands that we have to find solutions to our greatest problems.\u201d She touted him as the only candidate who is proposing to cancel all student debt, provide universal school meals, stop \u201cendless wars,\u201d fight for human rights, and hold everyone accountable \u201cregardless of if they\u2019re an ally or a foe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not just the fight for our lives. This is the fight for our democracy. This is the fight for a better future. One we can all be proud of,\u201d Omar concluded:\n\nBernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography. I know this from experience \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with him up close on bold progressive reforms. I\u2019ve seen the values that motivate his fight for progress. \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 16, 2019\n\nBernie is also well aware that America doesn\u2019t suffer from scarcity \u2014 we suffer from greed. Together we brought forward legislation to cancel all $1.6 trillion of student debt and pay for it with a small tax on Wall Street speculation. \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 16, 2019\n\nFor all these reasons and more, I have no doubt that @BernieSanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020. Let\u2019s get him elected! \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 16, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez is expected to formally endorse Sanders on Saturday.", "description": "Far-left \"Squad\" member Rep.
