Both time-consuming and frustrating, it is one of the most hated chores across the nation.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to FEMAIL, Kegan Kimball, from London, who runs dry cleaning services Laundryheap, has shared his top tips which are cost-effective, quick and easy.\n\nThey include everything from adding ice cubes into the tumble dryer to help de-crease clothes and using foil to half the time spent ironing.\n\nKegan Kimball, from London, who runs dry cleaning services Laundryheap, or a dry-cleaning company gave his best tips on how to reduce your ironing time.

SPRAY WITH VINEGAR AND WATER\n\nThis natural solution will suit the most eco-friendly of clothes owners.\n\n'This one\u2019s for those who like to keep things natural,' Kegan said. 'Pour one part white vinegar and three parts water into a spray bottle, shake and spritz over dry creases. Allow them to dry.'\n\n'As it does, the creases will start to disappear. Vinegar is also a natural disinfectant so a great way to freshen up clothes in between washes.'\n\n2. THROW AN ICE CUBE INTO THE TUMBLE DRYER WITH YOUR CLOTHES\n\nThis time-effective tip works every time and will save you precious minutes.\n\n'If you\u2019re lucky enough to own a tumble dryer, throw an ice cube in with dry clothes that need de-creasing and set the timer for ten minutes,' the expert explained.\n\n'The heat will melt the ice and release steam; effectively de-creasing your clothes whilst you get on with more important things.'\n\n3. PLACE SOME FOIL UNDERNEATH YOUR CLOTHES AS YOU IRON\n\nThis surprise trick is the best way to iron both sides of an item of clothing at the same time.\n\n'Another time-saving trick is to lay a sheet of foil between your clothes and the ironing board,' he explained. 'As you iron one side, the heat will conduct and warm the other side.'\n\n'This will save your from having to iron both sides and getting the time it takes to decrease any \u201cmust-iron\u201d clothes in half.'\n\nNINE HANDY HACKS 1. Spray with vinegar and water 2. Add ice cube into tumble dryer 3. Place foil underneath clothes before you iron 4. Hold crease clothes above a kettle whilst it boils 5. Lightly dampen clothes and blow-dry 6. Use hair straighteners on visible creases 7. Hang clothes up fresh out of tumble dryer 8. Iron while in the shower 9. Don't wait for clothes to dry before you iron\n\n4. HOLD CREASED CLOTHES ABOVE A KETTLE WHILST IT BOILS\n\nKegan also offered his words of advice on how to make the most out of kitchen gadgets - including kettles.\n\n'Hold smaller creased items such as camisoles or silk shirts over the kettle whilst it boils for a quick blast of hot steam,' he said.\n\n'Keep your hands clear of the steam, or wear oven gloves, to protect you from any risk of burning. Then enjoy your tea guilt and crease-free.'\n\n5. LIGHTLY DAMPEN CLOTHES AND BLOW-DRY\n\n'For a quick fix, turn to your blow-dry, Kegan said. 'To shift creases quickly, hang the item up and lightly flick some water on your creases.'\n\n'Then, give the clothing a quick blowdry on a hot setting. The water will relax the material slightly whilst the hairdryer offers the best, and most cost effective alternative to a handheld steamer.'\n\n'Plus, it\u2019s done in seconds and you can throw the clothes straight on afterwards.'\n\n6. USE HAIR STRAIGHTENERS ON THE MOST VISIBLE CREASES\n\nThis classic move is very time-effective, according to the laundry expert.\n\n'Where most people go wrong is trying to iron an entire item with handy, but ultimately too small, hair straighteners,' said Kegan.\n\n'Instead, pinpoint your most visible creases and work on those instead. If your collars and cuffs are in good order, you can fool anyone into believing the wrinkled sight under your trusty jumper is too.;\n\nHe added: 'Just be careful not to hold the straighteners on for too long, as singed sleeves are not a good look.'\n\nKegan Kimball from Laundryheap advises to pop an ice-cube in your tumble-dryer in order to reduce ironing time.

HANG THEM UP WHILST THEY'RE HOT FROM THE TUMBLE DRYER\n\nA good trick to save time on ironing is to be quick in getting your clothes out of the dryer.\n\n'Folded clothes look pretty and are great for organising, but if you want to keep your clothes crease-free for longer, hanging them up is best,' Kegan said.\n\n'But make sure you do so while they\u2019re still hot from the tumble dryer, so you can manipulate what shape they take when cooled. Crease-free clothes and an easily-navigable wardrobe.'\n\n8. IRON WHILE YOU'RE IN THE SHOWER\n\nAnother of the expert's tips involves ironing whilst in the shower - and is a good way to optimise your time.\n\n'For light creases, just hang up your clothes in the bathroom and take a hot shower,' he said.\n\n'Make sure you keep any windows closed to achieve the same benefits of a steam iron - without even having to switch one on.'\n\n9. DON'T LET CLOTHES DRY FULLY BEFORE YOU IRON THEM\n\nFor those of us who don't own a tumble-dryer and let garments dry on a clothes horse, there's no point in waiting for the items to dry fully before you set to work ironing.\n\n'The next time you dry your clothes, either by tumble dryer or clothes rack, don\u2019t let them dry fully before you iron,' Kegan said.\n\nHe added: 'Don\u2019t let the sizzle of the iron hitting the cloth deter you, the residual moisture works wonders in creating steam, which will in turn remove creases better, and keep them crease-free for much longer.
