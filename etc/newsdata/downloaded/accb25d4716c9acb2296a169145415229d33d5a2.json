Kennedy wasn\u2019t the only man in Jackie Kennedy Onassis\u2019 life who had a wandering eye.\n\nAccording to the former first lady\u2019s pal Carly Simon, Jackie also had to reportedly endure with Aristotle Onassis\u2019 being unfaithful during their marriage, which lasted from 1968 until his death in 1975 at age 69.\n\nThe celebrated singer released a new memoir on Tuesday titled \u201cTouched by the Sun: My Friendship with Jackie,\u201d which details the style icon\u2019s thoughts about both of her husbands, as well as her two children.\n\nELTON JOHN HIJACKED ROLLING STONES CONCERT HIGH ON COCAINE; KEITH RICHARDS WAS NOT HAPPY\n\nAccording to Simon, it was John F. Kennedy Jr. who introduced his mother to her on Martha\u2019s Vineyard back in 1983. The two remained close until Onassis\u2019 death in 1994 at age 64.\n\nSimon, 74, claimed the notoriously private Onassis confided in her about the Greek shipping magnate. According to Simon, Jackie said Aristotle flaunted his affair with opera singer Maria Callas by \u201cdousing himself with cologne\u201d before he flew six hours to see her.\n\n\u201cI would not have let Jackie marry Ari if I had known her at the time,\u201d Simon wrote, according to UK\u2019s Daily Mail. \u201cI would have done something to disrupt the courtship.\u201d\n\nCARLY SIMON\u2019S PAL JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS SAID JFK MADE \u2018STUPID MISTAKES,\u2019 ARISTOTLE ONASSIS WAS \u2018VERY SEXY\u2019\n\nSimon believed Aristotle grew tired of his second wife and it didn\u2019t take long for him to find himself in the arms of his longtime love.\n\nAccording to Onassis, Aristotle would tell his wife he had to travel to England to monitor his shipyards. However, she knew from the scent of his cologne he wasn\u2019t telling the truth.\n\n\u201cIf she was going to meet him at the airport, I mean, he could\u2019ve reapplied it,\u201d noted Onassis about Aristotle meeting up with Callas. \u201cI think he wanted me to know I wasn\u2019t everything to him. He didn\u2019t want to leave me completely \u2014 not entirely in case I turned into the ideal mate he hoped he\u2019d married.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times previously reported Callas and her manager-husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini separated in 1959 after she became romantically involved with Aristotle. The marriage was annulled six years later.\n\nCARLY SIMON REVEALS SEAN CONNERY ASKED FOR M\u00c9NAGE-\u00c0-TROIS WITH HER SISTER\n\nCallas and Aristotle had apartments near each other in Paris before Aristotle married Onassis. The outlet reported Callas said little about the marriage except she and Aristotle were still good friends.\n\nOnassis and Aristotle married five years after Kennedy\u2019s 1963 assassination.\n\nCallas died in 1977 at age 53 from a heart attack in Paris. Many have since speculated Callas actually passed away from a broken heart.\n\nBut Simon noted Aristotle\u2019s marriage to Onassis wasn\u2019t always tumultuous. In fact, Onassis once described how Aristotle came at the right time in her life.\n\nELTON JOHN WRITES QUEEN ELIZABETH SLAPPED HER NEPHEW ACROSS THE FACE IN FRONT OF HIM IN NEW BOOK\n\n\u201cHe saw himself as Odysseus and I was no one to argue,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was so in need of the kind of protection he was offering. I wanted it for [my children] Caroline and John. That\u2019s what a woman innately knows \u2014 she has to protect her children in any and every way, no matter how far away from your innate self you have to go.\u201d\n\nBut there was more to Aristotle than his wealth that lured Onassis, claimed Simon.\n\n\u201cShe said he was very sexy \u2014 he would sing to her on his yacht and take her to great places to make love,\u201d Simon recalled. \u201cShe knew marrying him was the bad-girl move. In a way, I never knew whether she was sticking up for her own decision or whether she really loved him.\u201d", "description": "President John F.
