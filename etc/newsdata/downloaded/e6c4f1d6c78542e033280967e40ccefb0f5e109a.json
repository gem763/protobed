But some are having second thoughts after allowing Trump to run roughshod over Congress\u2019 appropriations power.\n\nUnlike aid for Puerto Rico or Central America, Ukrainian assistance is something the GOP cares about as much as Democrats do. Second, unlike Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers to build his border wall, the president\u2019s goal in this case had less to do with some shared goal for his party \u2014 such as slowing immigration \u2014 and more his political self-interest\u2026\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the committee, is a highly educated attorney with a Phi Beta Kappa pin and degree from Oxford. He vowed to \u201cburn fresh hell\u201d if future aid to Ukraine were withheld again by the White House. Yet in the same voice, he plaintively turned to committee Democrats like Durbin and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, asking them to explain what the stall had been about.\n\nProviding no answer, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) assured his colleagues that the White House had learned its lesson and there would be no future delays in aid for Ukraine. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got the message. If you are listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you\u2019re gonna get the money,\u201d Graham said.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Rogers", "Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
