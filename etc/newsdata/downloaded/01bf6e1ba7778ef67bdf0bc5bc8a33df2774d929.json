The allegation surfaced just days after another woman, Brown\u2019s former personal trainer, filed a civil lawsuit accusing Brown of sexual assault and rape during a series of incidents that occurred in 2017 and 2018.\n\nRepresentatives for Nike, Electronic Arts and Pepsi did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations against Brown, who has appeared in campaigns for all three companies.\n\nA Facebook representative said the company\u2019s business dealings with Brown ended in 2017, when Brown was briefly tapped to publish content to promote launch of \u201cFacebook Live.\u201d Campbell Soup said its deal with Brown expired in May 2018, while Pizza Hut said its partnership with Brown during the 2018 season had a one-year term and has since expired.\n\nHelmet maker Xenith ended its partnership with Brown, who was set to wear their product on the field this season, just days after the deal was announced. The decision came shortly after the civil lawsuit surfaced. Posts promoting the endorsement deal were deleted from Xenith's social media accounts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NFL has an active investigation into the allegations made by Brown\u2019s personal trainer, and league officials are expected to meet with her in the coming days. While the nature of the allegations sparked speculation that Brown could be placed on paid leave pending the outcome of that investigation, Brown made his debut for the Patriots on Sunday, catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins. He left after the game without speaking to reporters.\n\nBrown wasn't placed on the commissioner's exempt list in part because no criminal charges have been filed against him, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBrown\u2019s attorney, Darren Heitner, addressed Sports Illustrated\u2019s report in a statement posted on social media on Monday.\n\n\u201cAntonio Brown has reviewed the sexual misconduct allegations made by an unnamed artist included in a recently published Sports Illustrated article and denies that he ever engaged in such activities. There will be no further comment at this time,\u201d Heitner said.\n\nThe Sports Illustrated report detailed various instances of alleged misbehavior or misconduct in Brown\u2019s past, including alleged domestic incidents and unpaid debts.\n\nThe artist said Brown commissioned her in June 2017 to paint a mural at his Pittsburgh-area after he spotted a portrait of himself that she had painted while attending a charity auction to support the National Youth Foundation. The woman agreed to the job and said she was initially happy with Brown\u2019s interest in her work.\n\nBut after \u201cuncomfortable\u201d flirtations during her first day of work on the mural, the woman alleges that on her second day of work, Brown appeared behind her \u201cnaked, with a hand cloth covering his [genitals]\u201d \u2013 a move she interpreted as a \u201cclear sexual come-on,\u201d according to the magazine.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ve been tried [by men] a lot of times, so I just kept my cool and kept painting,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter that, it all ended abruptly.\u201d\n\nThe woman said Brown paid her $2,000 for her two days of work and ceased communication. National Youth Foundation co-founder Sophia Hanson said Brown never paid the $700 he pledged to purchase the painting at the charity event.\n\nIn a separate incident detailed by Sports Illustrated, Brown\u2019s former doctor, Victor Prisk, alleges that Brown \u201cfart[ed] in his face\u201d during one consultation in August 2018 and owes him $11,500 in unpaid fees. Prisk is currently suing Brown for the money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "An artist who spoke to Sports Illustrated on condition of anonymity said Brown exposed himself to her in 2017 after hiring her to paint a mural in his Pittsburgh-area home.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Antonio-BRown-Patriots.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
