We\u2019ve been equally involved in every stage of the process too, starting with researching savings accounts.\n\n\"We also got advice from our parents and friends, again, we did this together, so that we were always at the same stage and page as one another.\n\n\"We worked out what size deposit we needed (and could afford) halved it and divided that by how many months we want to be saving for in an ideal world.\n\n\"We also used spreadsheets to budget for upcoming months to ensure we could always meet that figure, but this also helped us when we could add more into the fund too. I also stopped looking at expensive cars I could put on finance.\"\n\nAnd surprisingly, he said renting actually helped.\n\n(Image: supplied via Emma Munbodh)\n\n(Image: supplied via Emma Munbodh)\n\n\"It\u2019s so important to have a proper understanding of the value of the money before buying your first home.\n\n\"Renting was really good for in terms of preparing financially for bills. Since we moved back home to save, we\u2019ve continued to pay rent to Annie\u2019s parents and bought our own food, so we\u2019re very much used to paying our way.\"\n\nWhen it came to putting down an offer, he said negotiation is key.\n\n\"The most important thing to remember is that most developers have a \u201ctarget price\u201d, which is usually quite a lot less than the asking price.\n\n\"We started ridiculously low (with an offer we knew would get a straight rejection) and then slowly worked our way up. That way we still got it considerably under asking price, but the developers feel like they\u2019ve talked you up a bit.\n\n\"After viewing what felt like a million properties, we\u2019ve now had our offer accepted on the home we want, so the next step the mortgage! We\u2019re keeping our fingers crossed for a smooth ride.\"\n\nHarry said above all, his top tip is to open a Lifetime ISA as soon as possible.\n\n\"Get it open, stick a tenner in it and don\u2019t worry about if you really can\u2019t much save right now, but get it open,\" he said.\n\n(Image: supplied via Emma Munbodh)\n\nAnd once they're in the property, he says the bargaining won't stop.\n\n\"After we finished saving for the house deposit, we didn\u2019t stop saving. We carried on saving the same amount or more into a separate savings account each month to set aside money for decorating and furnishing.\n\n\"It really does add up if you\u2019re starting from scratch with no existing bits of furniture, but as we keep telling people, if you budget you can do it!.\n\n\"We'll be buying our furniture in the Black Friday, Boxing Day and January sales,.\n\n\"We've made a list of everything we absolutely need for the move-in date and everything else that we can afford to wait for, which has been really helpful too.\n\n\"Our immediate budget for the moving day is about \u00a32,500. This will allow for a lovely sofa and bed and then leave enough for the other essentials that we\u2019re not as fussed about like a dining table, coffee table, TV unit, chest of drawers etc.\n\n\"We\u2019re also lucky to have built in wardrobes, if not we\u2019d need to allocate even more.\n\n\"Facebook Marketplace is a goldmine. We've also recently discovered an independent store local to us that refurbishes old furniture and sells it on cheaply - so keep your eyes peeled.\"\n\nHarry\u2019s top tips for first-time buyers\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAs well as your deposit, it's important to take into account the additional costs of moving home, such as a conveyancer, which will cost hundreds and possible even more, experts say.\n\n\"When buying a home, it\u2019s important to ensure you\u2019ve got the costs of surveying, legal fees and room for negotiation on the price covered first,\" Alex Beavis, head of mortgages at Skipton Building Society said.\n\n\"Getting used to your new outgoing expenses that come with buying a home means you can quickly work out how much you can comfortably afford to spend on a monthly basis.\"\n\nHere are Harry's top money-saving tips to get you started.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Harry and his partner Annie are just weeks away from picking up the keys to their new build three bed property in Norfolk - bought using two Lifetime Isas and the Help to Buy scheme", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Supplied Via Emma Munbodh"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747847.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_How-I-bought-my-first-home-at-22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
