He left the restaurant along with most of the customers to see what had happened.\n\nThere was \"a lot of confusion\" on the street in front of the nightclub, Alhariri said. People were running and scattering, although he said no one was screaming and there weren't any more shots fired.\n\nEveryone who left the restaurant quickly ran back inside, Alhariri said. They were joined by a number of people who were scared by the gunshots and wanted to hide, he said.\n\nSt. Catharines Mayor Walter Sendzik called the shooting a \"shocking tragedy\" that has shaken the city.\n\nWhile many of us are waking this morning from an amazing Grape and Wine weekend, a shocking tragedy has shaken our city. Early this morning there was a shooting downtown and 6 people were seriously injured.
