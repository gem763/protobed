He never raises his voice, and rarely strays into hyperbole.\n\nThat made his quietly delivered outrage at the news of Trump's Ukraine dealings last week even more impactful.\n\nTrump's July demand for a \"favor\" from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky reflects \"a classic mafia-type shakedown of a foreign leader,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"This is how a mafia boss talks: 'What have you done for us?'\"\n\nTrump's approach to Schiff is the polar opposite. Last year, he crudely dubbed the Democrat \"little Adam Schitt,\" and in recent days has accused Schiff of \"illegally\" making false statements about the president.\n\n\"I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\" he said in a tweet on Sunday.\n\n- 'Logical, linear' -\n\nAs mild-mannered as he appears, Schiff has proven to be a focused, determined investigator, and tough as a bulldog. He's a fit cyclist who at 50 completed a triathlon.\n\nPelosi called him \"logical, linear, measured but forceful.\"\n\nHis determination reflects his experience in the early FBI prosecution.\n\n\"I learned a lot about Russian tradecraft: how the Russians operate, who they target, the vulnerabilities they look for,\" he recounted earlier this year to Zach Dorfman of the Aspen Institute Cyber and Technology program.\n\nHe focuses, however, beyond Russian election meddling to what he sees as the crux security risk: does a foreign government have leverage over a US official?\n\n\"Many Americans have expressed deep concerns that foreign powers -- especially Russia -- cultivated or possessed financial leverage or influence over President Trump or his associates,\" he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in April.\n\n\"It is up to Congress to assure that the president and his associates work for the American people and not for some undisclosed personal or foreign interests.\"", "description": "Three decades ago, Adam Schiff -- the Democrat leading the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump -- prosecuted the first FBI agent ever jailed for spying for Moscow.
