A State arises when society cannot solve its problems; it\u2019s a badge of lost innocence. Think of tribal societies, they don\u2019t have a big State standing over them, yet they function perfectly. States are always imposed: ultimately, it\u2019s a gang of men with arms that holds entire society hostage and says \u2018you need protection, we are here to protect you.\u2019 But when you think about it, the only protection ordinary people need is precisely from such armed entities Philosophers like Hobbes argued that we are, 'in a state of nature' , fundamentally violent and lawless, therefore, we require a State. Such ideas are a libel upon the human race, created by Europeans in their so-called Enlightenment.\n\n\n\nThey imposed this adversarial, conflictual model on all of us, whereas we are exactly the opposite. For instance, in economics, we learn that we are covetous, competitive and grasping. These are attributions, completely false. We are fundamentally cooperative, emotional, and kinship-driven and all these things are antithetical to European Modernism (EM). We can live richer lives if we threw all that baggage away.\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Every culture differs from some other culture by slight variations. It\u2019s a human trait of doing things slightly differently from somebody else. Societies are collectivities and they take pains to distinguish themselves in art, music, and social expression. That\u2019s because we have a powerful social need to express ourselves in multiple ways: and it\u2019s that difference that European Modernists want to erase.\n\n\n\nThey want a homogeneous, universalised system that can be marketed and ruled over. Homogenisation has a very canny political purpose, but we are not at all homogeneous. Think of linguistic diversity, cultural and religious diversity. We are richly diverse by nature and I certainly don\u2019t want to see it stamped out by the banalities of EuroModernisation.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of postmodernism?\n\n\n\n\u25a0 We are still in a modern world, by that I mean we are still in a European world. Postmodernism is a leap of imagination on the part of a few, if highly vocal, disaffected intelligentsia. This is a curious thing; the moment Europe imposes its model of Enlightenment on the world, immediately their own humanist intelllectuals found a utopian strain, a critical movement. It\u2019s a sort of loyal opposition within the system. But PostModernists leap over that and go even beyond the excesses of modernism, to the point where it becomes abject nihilism.\n\n\n\nAt least modernism has a structure; it\u2019s exploitative, powerful, dominative; but in postmodernism, it is as if anything goes. Therefore, you can\u2019t have enduring values of any kind or you cannot have any universal values, but you can invent/adopt anything. You can be a Buddhist today, tomorrow you can pick up a gun and do something else and it\u2019s all justified as if it is leading to some special personal salvation. Instead, we could aim at an understanding of the world, have respect for community, and craft simple values by which one can live and be hospitable: tribal societies have always been built upon such criteria. All these are extinguished now in the guise of the EuroModernist \u2018invent yourself in any way you like' credo.\n\n\n\nIt is simply corrosive, Asocial Individualism.\n\n\n\nPostmodernism is the window to get into transhumanism which is even more deadly than modernism. They want to put microchips in us and make us like cyborgs, an extension of machines, because then, we can, supposedly, live forever. These are antihuman, dystopian, nihilistic fantasies. The Enlightenment began this process. We have descended from apes, but in Judeo-Christian thinking we are descended from God, cast in the image of the Maker. As a consequence, we are not supposed to have instincts or essences, as our animal cousins do. EuroModernists secularised religious fantasies: for Christianity it is heaven, and for (some) Marxists it\u2019s Communism, but it is more or less the same idea. They think they can draw up an agenda and mould people any way they like: and this leads to turning our backs to the reality of who we are, as humans, at horrible human and social cost.\n\n\n\nIs it not what right-wing politicians are doing in India?\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Is there a right wing in India, at all? Are we defined in the same left-right way as Europeans are? It is my impression that what you are talking about is Hindu revivalism and that is not the same as right or left. We are adopting European lenses.\n\nIn Europe, the Church and secular forces fought a battle for some very specific, historical reasons. In ancient Indian culture, there was no obvious conflict between science and Church (religion). In fact, ancient Vedic mathematical formulas were invoked as prayers in religious (ceremonies). So, such a conflict is not universal nor is it generic; it was just a European happenstance and they have generalised it. We can\u2019t take that view; we have to see the actual content. All religions that have come from India are not religion per se, rather they are deep intellectual systems. They don\u2019t say that \u2018believe us or you'll rot in hell\u2019: instead, they say, \u2018think about it.\u2019 Hinduism is a philosophical set of ideas, you can agree or disagree with it, which is why it has myriads of sects, and that\u2019s fine. Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism are also, basically, thought systems, they are not faith-based; they are thinking systems. We should not use European categories to judge ourselves. As in the case of Islamic revival in West Asia, religion sometimes is really a vehicle for nationalism.\n\n\n\nI went to Jawaharlal Nehru University and gave a talk to the faculty, and one of them said \u2018Oh, we are Third World.\u2019 I said \u2018What is wrong with you? Where did you get the idea? Go look at the Taj Mahal, is it Third World?\u2019 We have absorbed their critiques of ourselves. Our Left-wing colleagues are not in touch with the spirit, the geist of India. The Great Error of the so-called Left , in India, was to abandon culture to the so-called Right. India was never a nation, never a State: and now it has become that, largely through historical accident. Integrity for us human beings lies in face-to-face relations, what the Germans call Gemeinschaft societies, whereas Gesellschaft societies are an abstract, Modernist idea, we can\u2019t really relate to. One has to think it through: you are asked to die for your country; but will your country die for you? No, it won\u2019t, there is something asymmetrical about that but that\u2019s not true for a tribe. There are some natural affinities we possess, as humans, that help form certain kinds of communities. I have no loyalty to any nation, or State, because that requires a particular kind of a mental leap, usually achieved via force or propaganda, but I don\u2019t need to be told, or brainwashed, to be loyal to my mother or sister or children, for that comes naturally.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/749771-1350-420-5/no-need-for-a-state.img", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
