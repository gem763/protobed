Iran denies being behind the tanker explosions.\n\nThe U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Saturday, an attack struck the world's biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia.", "description": "It said that Iran sent the diplomatic note to the Swiss on Monday.
