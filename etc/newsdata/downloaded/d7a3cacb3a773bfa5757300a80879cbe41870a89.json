Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 that is old and outdated.\n\nMichael Moore addressed some of the common critiques of Sanders \u2014 most specifically, that he is \u201ctoo old\u201d and unhealthy to be president. Moore dismissed both arguments, declaring that he is \u201cglad\u201d that Sanders is 78 and calling the Electoral College \u201ctoo old.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s 78, and we will benefit for his wisdom and his experience and his knowledge and his love for the American people,\u201d Moore said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for President of the United States,\u201d Moore continued, addressing what he believes is really \u201ctoo old\u201d in the country.\n\n\u201cWell here\u2019s what\u2019s too old. The Electoral College is too old. That\u2019s what\u2019s too old,\u201d the Fahrenheit 11/9 director said. \u201cA $7.25 minimum wage\u2013 that\u2019s too old. Women not being paid the same as men\u2013 that\u2019s too old.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands and thouands of dollars in student debt. What is that?\u201d he asked, to which the crowd shouted, \u201ctoo old!\u201d\n\n\u201cA $10,000 deductible for your health care. What is that?\u201d Moore asked again, with the crowd shouting, \u201ctoo old!\u201d\n\n\u201cSuper delegates. What\u2019s that? Fossil fuel. What\u2019s that? That\u2019s what\u2019s too old!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nMoore also addressed the concerns over Sanders\u2019 health.\n\n\u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore said, later chanting, \u201cGreen New Deal!\u201d", "description": "Anti-Trump filmmaker Michael Moore said that the Electoral College \u2013 not Bernie Sanders \u2013 is old and outdated.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/michaelmooretooold1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
