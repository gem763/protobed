Ao Ba Nian has taken this maxim and made it a focal point by using ingredients, such as the bones from pork and chicken and wild mushrooms that are slowly simmered for more than eight hours to release every ounce of their flavors.", "description": "Spicy hotpot's broth is usually only for boiling ingredients, but at Ao Ba Nian Hotpot restaurant, the soup is also for sipping-and it's quite tasty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/11/5d9fd2cea310cf3e97a090c4.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
