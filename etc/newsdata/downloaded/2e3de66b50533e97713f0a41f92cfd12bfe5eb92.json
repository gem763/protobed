High-profile efforts, like a Nike campaign featuring NFL star Colin Kaepernick, have further elevated the company to Gen Z, Carvalho told Business Insider in September.\n\n\"Nike has become not just a commodity, but a statement,\" he said. \"When you try to reach a new young consumer on their playing field and on their terms, it's no longer simply putting out a great product. You now have to be a company that can stand behind something because the consumer today is demanding that.\"\n\nHowever, while recent buzzy ads have helped the brand gain traction, it turns out teen enthusiasm for Nike is more than just a flash in the pan \u2014 Piper Jaffray found the retailer has managed to solidify an enduring place as the top spot in their hearts for the past nine years.\n\nUltimately, Nike's success with teens is a microcosm of the company's larger gains with North American consumers, both young and old. In September, the brand exceeded Wall Street expectations with North American sales that grew by 4% in the first fiscal quarter of 2020.\n\nAccording to experts, another key factor for this growth is Nike's experimentation with design \u2014 including incorporating eco-conscious fabrics and designs \u2014 as well as its concerted effort around inclusivity like recently featuring plus-size mannequins for the first time.\n\n\"Nike is figuring out how to extend its brand image in authentic ways which is enabling it to gain new customers,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note after Nike's earnings call in September. \"Nike is further defining itself not just as a sports brand, but also a health & wellness brand. We think it's working.\"", "description": "Nike dominated in Piper Jaffray's semi-annual survey of teen shopping habits, receiving top spots in favorite apparel and footwear.", "authors": ["Bethany Biron"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0903b4af90922fe03e8e2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
