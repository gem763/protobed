Then they\u2019ll host a rally and hold a flag-raising ceremony, presumably of their \u201cstraight pride\u201d banner.\n\nOn the event\u2019s Facebook page, the group wrote: \u201cCelebrate the diverse history, culture, and contributions of the straight community! The Straight Pride Event will be held to achieve inclusivity and spread awareness of issues impacting straights in Greater Boston and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe organizers speak about straight people as an oppressed group, extol traditional gender roles, and praise straight people for \u201cpreventing extinction.\u201d Photos they have shared representing \u201cstraight pride\u201d are predominantly of white couples and families.\n\nThis narrative of victimhood is common for far right spaces. These talking points range from outright hatred of LGBTQ people, that is tied to what white supremacists see as a weakening of the white race, to a more subtle opposition against a \u201cliberal agenda\u201d which includes any celebration of LGBTQ people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrans people in particular, are increasingly the target of hate by far right groups. In June, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on hate groups \u201cramping up\u201d their demonization of trans people. The SPLC said white supremacist groups are using more violent language as movements for trans equality become more visible and support for transgender rights grows.\n\nFor instance, Neo-Nazi Christopher Cantwell wrote on Telegram recently that, \u201cAssisted suicide is the only help you can give trannies.\u201d And Daily Stormer editor Andrew Anglin encouraged trans people to kill themselves last year.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just neo-Nazi and white nationalist figures on the far right who have become also become more vocally transphobic, according to the SPLC report. Figures on both the \u201calt-right\u201d as well as the \u201calt-lite\u201d try to couch their transphobia in humor, or frame the fight for trans equality as out-of-control political correctness.\n\nThe alt-right, according to the Anti-Defamation League, rejects \u201cmainstream conservatism in favor of politics that embrace implicit or explicit racist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist ideology.\u201d\n\nThe alt-lite tends to shy away from the expression of outright white supremacist views but \u201care in step with the alt right in their hatred of feminists and immigrants, among others,\u201d the organization says. It tends to focus on \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Resist Marxism, a group that organizers are tied to, is one example of an alt-lite group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, said this year\u2019s Pride celebration in Detroit, where armed neo-Nazis met parade-goers with homophobic slurs, was intended to gather momentum and backing for their extremist worldview. Those Neo-Nazis were part of the National Socialist Movement, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has said is one of the largest and most prominent Neo-Nazi groups in the United States.\n\nThere has been another attempt to host a straight pride parades but it was largely unsuccessful. Last week, in Modesto, California the National Straight Pride Coalition organized a straight pride rally which drew about 20 participants and a much larger number of counter protesters. Many more people came to protest the event.\n\nThe organizer of the Modesto rally, Don Grundmann, defended his coalition as \u201ca totally peaceful racist group\u201d \u2014 a description offered without a hint of irony.\n\n\u201cHardcore white supremacists and their animosity toward the LGBTQ community is established,\u201d Segal said. \u201cYou also have these virulent online communities that peddle in white supremacist ideas that glorify violence that seek to normalize anti-LGBTQ sentiments, which has a large impact as well.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMany people are absorbing this online and getting their worldview out there, which is a problem with many issues including this. But then there\u2019s a set of groups that don\u2019t fit neatly into white supremacy that people have called the alt-right and a movement is more alt-lite, which also has an agenda opposed to PC culture, liberalism, multicultural, feminism, and that also often results in the demonization of the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nSegal added said straight pride parades are not unlike the right\u2019s embrace of the phrase \u201cWhite lives matter,\u201d and are meant to convey that the view that oppressed groups should not be afforded special status. And as with many far-right agendas, they make frequent use of memes and try to mask their hate with levity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s hardcore extremists, whether it\u2019s the alt-lite types, it\u2019s an effort to promote their agenda through humor and irony. In many ways there are elements of this event that seem like a trolling attempt,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the parade\u2019s name and memes focus on sexuality and not gender, one of the organizers has said that he doesn\u2019t want kids to be taught that gender is something that is determined by each individual, a statement that appeared to conflate gender and sexual orientation.\n\nSamson Racioppi, one of the organizers, complained to the Boston Globe about a Netflix show featuring drag queens and a friend\u2019s preteen daughter thinking about her gender. He said that straight people have been \u201cdisregarded\u201d and felt the program to be a \u201cform of attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople need to be reassured that even though there\u2019s all this mixed messaging, it\u2019s still perfectly natural to identify as a heterosexual,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother of the organizers, Mark Sahady, with the group Resist Marxism, was seen on video grabbing a trans woman at the Boston Women\u2019s March in January.\n\nA group called Solidarity Against Hate-Boston, which is staging a counter-demonstration on Saturday, flagged Resist Marxism in a statement in June.\n\n\u201cRM is an attempt to emulate the right-wing violence culture on the west coast. They have failed because we\u2019ve met them with overwhelming numbers of counterprotesters,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cEven then, they\u2019ve been violent \u2014 choking, shoving, punching \u2026 They have tried to disrupt DSA (Democratic Socialists of America) meetings, trans rights rallies, & immigration rights rallies. That things haven\u2019t gotten more violent is a testimony to the work people in the city have done to counter these actions, and RM\u2019s own incompetence.,\u201d Solidarity Against Hate-Boston said.\n\nSahady also has ties to groups like the Proud Boys, the New Hampshire American Guard, and the Massachusetts Patriot Front. The Proud Boys group, which has assaulted antifascists, also has engaged in transphobic speech.\n\nGavin McInnes, who founded the group but claims to have left it in 2018, has called trans people \u201cmentally ill gays who need help, and that doesn\u2019t include being maimed by physicians\u201d and \u201cgender [use of the N-word].\u201d\n\nSahady himself has used violent rhetoric. Like many far-right figures, he appeared to refer to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who killed at least 120 political dissidents by throwing them from helicopters, and suggested that Republicans should throw \u201canti-American communists\u201d out of helicopters.\n\nDuring the Rally for Free Speech in July that was planned by the Proud Boys and several far-right personalities, Brandon Sullivan, who was seen with Super Happy Fun America, reportedly threatened Black Lives Matter protesters and punched an antifascist.\n\nAhead of a Central Maine Pride Festival event held in May in Waterville, Maine, Resist Marxism posted on Facebook \u201cAttention Patriots in Maine\u201d to let people know that a drag queen planned to come in and read children\u2019s books.\n\nIt has been a common tactic among the far right to disrupt \u201cDrag Queen Story Hour\u201d events like this one. Drag Queen Story Hour is a national program which aims to capture \u201cthe imagination and play of the gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, white nationalist Paul Nehlen urged his followers to \u201cGet photos of all the degenerate parents who take their kids to this filth. Get their license plates, anything else you can.\u201d\n\nSegal said that alt-lite and alt-right groups and speech can lead people to more extreme white supremacist spaces.\n\n\u201cI think in some ways groups like Resist Marxism, the Proud Boys and other groups like them are sort of a gateway into more extreme groups \u2026 We consider [Proud Boys] to be an extremist group because of the violence that has been associated with them,\u201d Segal said.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t tend to just flip a switch and become white supremacists. So the normalization of hateful tropes, whether it\u2019s anti-Semitism or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-LGBTQ sentiment, those who embrace that get one step closer to the more extreme views.\u201d\n\nAnti-feminist and anti-LGBTQ views tend to go hand-in-hand on the far right. A religious far right group, Patriot Prayer, which Proud Boys has provided security for, has also engaged in transphobia. Last year, Patriot Prayer organized a rally called \u201c#HimToo\u201d in response to what they called \u201cfalse rape allegations,\u201d which engaged in misogynistic and anti-trans language.\n\nThe ADL\u2019s Segal said that all forms of bigotry need to be considered when looking at people\u2019s radicalization into extremist groups. Much like the Red Pill Movement, a group associated with anti-feminist and misogynist views, men\u2019s rights activists, and \u201cincels,\u201d or involuntary celibates, can help usher people into more far-right spaces, so can transphobia and the idea that cis and straight people are oppressed by the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at extremist groups, we tend to look at racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry and misogyny tends to be overlooked as an indicator that someone is going down that path of radicalization,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think absolutely the same is true for those who engage in transphobic speech or anti-LGBTQ sentiment more broadly. These are all forms of hatred that are not only embraced by the extreme, but that they rely on to attract the next generation of followers,\u201d Segal said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for people to speak out against these forms of hatred.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/straight-pride.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
