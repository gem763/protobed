Fiona Tomas speaks to the experts on the missing post-natal research\n\nWhen Saracens rugby player Jade Knight ran her first 5km after the birth of her son, she was plagued by urinary incontinence. Pregnancy and birth had caused a weak pelvic floor \u2013 the group of muscles that span the bottom of the pelvis \u2013 leading to stress incontinence, a condition affecting around a third of mothers.\n\nEmbarrassed, Knight religiously wore black leggings when she returned to training out of fear she would leak in front of her team-mates. \u201cUnless I speak about it I don\u2019t think anyone else is going to,\u201d she says. Even as a qualified midwife, she was astounded at the toll pregnancy had taken on her body.\n\nWith a severe lack of evidence and information on how exercise impacts post-partum sportswomen, Knight was determined to start a conversation around pelvic-floor health. In 2016, an International Olympic Committee expert group flagged the \u201curgent need\u201d for more research in the area in its only consensus statement to date on the subject, citing women in India and Nepal lifting heavy loads as the only example of how an early return to physical activity after childbirth can increase the risk of urinary incontinence. Although its SmartHER programme aims to connect more experiences of post-natal athletes, the English Institute of Sport has yet to conduct any research that might benefit them.", "description": "With pregnancy taking a heavy toll on the body, elite athletes face many challenges to make a full comeback.", "authors": ["Fiona Tomas", "Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/16/ss-composite-image-2019-10-16-20-27-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
