Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!),\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nThe hotly anticipated jobs report also landed amid a raft of worrisome economic data showing Trump\u2019s trade wars have put a dent in the business environment and suggesting hiring should slow in the coming months.\n\nBut Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said Friday that although the economy \u201cfaces some risks, overall it is\u2026 in a good place.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s job \u201cis to keep it there as long as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nAverage hourly wages fell by a penny to $28.09 last month, well below economists\u2019 expectations, putting an end to a year-long string of steady gains and limiting consumers\u2019 spending power in the coming months.\n\n\u2013 As good as it gets? \u2013\n\nDespite the slight drop in the month, Trump hailed the increase in wages over the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cWages are up by almost 3 percent. That\u2019s a fantastic increase for everybody out there working. We\u2019re very happy about those numbers,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nBut meanwhile the mining sector added no workers after three straight months of layoffs, and the auto sector shed workers for the fourth month in a row.\n\n\u201cJob growth is set to slow much further,\u201d Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cThis is as good as it\u2019s likely to get until the trade war is resolved.\u201d\n\nBut given the dwindling supply of workers in the US economy, some groups continue to benefit: Unemployment among Hispanics fell to its lowest level since records began in 1973.\n\nAnd for workers without a high school diploma, the jobless rate fell to the lowest since records began in 1992.\n\nThe latest data did not reflect the nationwide strike launched last month by General Motors employees, who walked off the job the week after the survey for the September jobs report was conducted.\n\n\u2013 Exports slow \u2013\n\nIn a separate report also released Friday, the Commerce Department said the yawning US trade deficit rose by nearly $1 billion in August as weakening foreign demand and the churning trade conflict ate into US export growth.\n\nHowever, Trump said there is a \u201cvery good chance\u201d to reach a trade deal with China soon.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut the unexpected trade deficit increase could weigh on GDP calculations for the third quarter, with a global economic slowdown expected to weaken US exports while the strong US dollar has fueled imports.\n\nAs a result, the US trade balance crept 1.6 percent higher to $54.9 billion for the month, surpassing economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nImports increased 0.5 percent, while exports rose 0.2 percent, rising more slowly than in July.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 America\u2019s jobless rate tumbled in September to its lowest level in 50 years, according to government data released Friday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/47742f_groups-including-hispanics-workers-high-school-diploma-are-benefitting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
