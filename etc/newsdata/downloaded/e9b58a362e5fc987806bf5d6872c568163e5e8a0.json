(BHP.AU), the world's biggest mining company by value, jumped as much as 6% to 39.34 Australian dollars (US$27.05) a share early Monday following a surge in crude oil prices.\n\nBHP, a major producer of commodities such as iron ore and steelmaking coal, has a substantial oil-and-gas division that sets it apart from most of its peers and accounted for roughly 15% of the company's underlying earnings in fiscal 2019.\n\nThe jump, which followed a 13% surge in Brent crude prices following an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, took BHP's Australian stock to its highest intraday value since Aug. 1.\n\nWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 15, 2019 20:42 ET (00:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
