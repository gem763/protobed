Yet the campaign finance scandal has added to infighting in a party packed with political newcomers.\n\nTuesday's probe comes amid a public spat between the president and Bivar, with Bolsonaro threatening to leave the party. Last week, Bolsonaro and PSL lawmakers dissatisfied with Bivar requested information on the party's finances.
