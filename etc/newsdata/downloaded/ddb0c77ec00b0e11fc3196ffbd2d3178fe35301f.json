Georgia Clark is \u2013 or rather, was \u2013 an English teacher in the Fort Worth School District in Texas. Unfortunately for her, the school board has voted unanimously to fire her from her job. Strangely enough, this was the second time they had voted to fire her, but the original decision in June had been tabled.\n\nSo what was her crime? She tweeted at the President, saying that her school had been overrun by illegal immigrants. And no, we\u2019re not kidding. (Washington Times)\n\nA school board in Texas has voted to fire a teacher who had told President Trump that her school had been taken over by illegal immigrants. Georgia Clark has been fired from the Fort Worth Independent School District \u201cimmediately,\u201d the board reported Tuesday evening on its Twitter feed, without further elaboration. Ms. Clark, an English teacher at Carter-Riverside High School, had written in some quickly deleted tweets addressed to Mr. Trump that her school had been \u201ctaken over\u201d by \u201cillegal students from Mexico.\u201d She added that Mr. Trump had won the election \u201con the promise that a wall would be built to protect our borders.\u201d\n\nThe text of the now-deleted tweet that got her in trouble went on to say that Donald Trump \u201cwon the election on the promise that a wall would be built to protect our borders.\u201d\n\nThere should be one question immediately leaping to mind for anyone who follows stories about our education system. You can fire teachers? Normally, as soon as someone tries to fire a teacher their union swoops in like a vulture and either halts the process or files a lawsuit. Sometimes that includes teachers who have been accused of \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d with students. Look no further than the infamous \u201crubber rooms\u201d in New York for classic examples.\n\nBut somehow, when this teacher put something up briefly on her personal Twitter account and associated herself with the President, they were able to drop her like a hot potato. Even if Texas is still a red state, the teachers\u2019 unions and public school systems generally are blue. In that regard, perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. If the teacher is trying to appeal the decision and gets no support from her union, that will probably tell you all you need to know.\n\nOf course, this might not necessarily turn out to be an unhappy ending for Ms. Clark. Now that the media is getting hold of the story, it might show up on Fox News or in the President\u2019s timeline. And how do you think President Trump will react to the news that a Trump loving, border wall supporting Texas teacher was fired for her loyalty to his cause? No, the President can\u2019t order the school to hire her back. But she might wind up as the next deputy undersecretary of education or something.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m kidding. Maybe. Or maybe not.", "description": "Wait... we can fire teachers now?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trump-doral.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
