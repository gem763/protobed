Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the restrictions \u201ccomplement\u201d the Commerce Department\u2019s actions.\n\nChina\u2019s embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. China has consistently denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes added to losses after the State Department's announcement, with the S&P 500 index .SPX closing down about 1.6%. Investors feared the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing could doom efforts to get the trade negotiations back on track.\n\nU.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators had been due to meet in Washington for a second day of talks on Tuesday, laying the groundwork for the first minister-level meetings in more than two months later this week.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported China had tamped down expectations ahead of the talks scheduled for Thursday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, saying the Chinese delegation could leave earlier than planned because \u201cthere\u2019s not too much optimism.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, China warned the United States to stop interfering in its affairs. China will continue to take firm and resolute measures to protect its sovereign security, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular media briefing without elaborating.\n\nProspects for a breakthrough in the on-again, off-again trade talks sagged after the Commerce Department\u2019s blacklisting announcement on Monday. Hikvision (002415.SZ), which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest maker of video surveillance gear, was among the firms targeted.\n\nThe listing bars the firms from buying components from American companies without U.S. government approval, a potentially crippling move. It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons.\n\nWashington is also moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds, Bloomberg reported.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump poses for a photo with China's President Xi Jinping before their bilateral meeting during the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019.

And yet, unless we act now, we are risking a potential more massive slowdown,\u201d Georgieva, who took over as IMF chief this month, said at an event to preview the IMF and World Bank autumn meetings next week in Washington.\n\nLOOMING TARIFF HIKES\n\nThe trade talks in Washington are taking place days before U.S. tariffs on $250 billion (204.8 billion pounds) worth of Chinese goods are slated to rise to 30% from 25%. President Donald Trump has said the hike will take effect on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\nTrump, who has embraced protectionist policies as part of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda aimed at rebalancing global trade and boosting U.S. manufacturing, said on Monday a quick trade deal with China was unlikely, and that he would not be satisfied with a partial agreement.\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies\u2019 access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nTrump launched a new round of tariffs after the last high-level talks in late July failed to result in Chinese agricultural purchases or yield progress on substantive issues. China quickly responded with tariff increases of its own.\n\nWith no signs of any significant momentum in the talks, the world\u2019s two largest economies could be braced for an open-ended trade dispute, an idea that is gaining currency in some circles.\n\n\u201cI can feel that Chinese society has low expectation for real breakthrough in the new round of trade talks. Most people think alternate trade war/trade talks will be a normal thing between China&the US,\u201d Hu Xijin, the editor of China\u2019s state-run Global Times newspaper, wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnother flashpoint in U.S.-China relations erupted over the weekend when an official with the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets wrote a tweet in support of Hong Kong democracy protests. The tweet, which was quickly deleted, sparked a backlash in China and a rebuke from the National Basketball Association, which in turn faced U.S. criticism that it was allowing free speech to be censored for commercial reasons.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Aides set up platforms before a group photo with members of U.S. and Chinese trade negotiation delegations at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China February 15, 2019.
