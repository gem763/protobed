But its most popular release is the participation survey, which is used to monitor and respond to trends, such as changes in a sport\u2019s popularity.\n\nThe federation has compiled the survey in its current form since 1971 using numbers it receives from 50 state high-school associations and the District of Columbia. The reports are voluntary. The instructions for collecting the data are sparse. And the number of schools that respond varies from year to year.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the state associations to figure out what to do when schools fail to report, and some fill in the gaps with estimates.\n\nThat\u2019s true for Texas, California, Ohio and Illinois, four of the Top 5 states with the largest numbers of high-school sports participants. New York, the remaining state in the group, doesn\u2019t use estimates.\n\n\u201cWe see weird stuff from year to year, and we have to call a state and ask what\u2019s up,\u201d said Bruce Howard, the federation\u2019s director of publications and communications. \u201cThis year, it was Texas girls\u2019 basketball.\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey, which was released earlier this month, participation in girls\u2019 basketball fell to 399,067 nationally, down from 412,407 the previous year, a decrease of 13,340 participants.\n\nIt was the lowest in 25 years, the federation reported, and the drop was largely attributable to Texas, which said that 10,636 fewer girls played basketball there, representing a 20% decrease in the state and accounting for the bulk of the national decrease.\n\nTexas wouldn\u2019t divulge its method of estimation, nor would it reveal how many of its 1,444 schools failed to provide data last year. But it said the procedure likely contributed to the apparent decrease.\n\n\u201cWe think there has probably been a decline in girls\u2019 basketball participation, but we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s as drastic as those numbers suggest,\u201d said Jamey Harrison, deputy executive director of the University Interscholastic League, which administers athletic contests for the state\u2019s public primary and secondary schools. \u201cWe believe our process of making estimates is better.\u201d\n\nDr. Harrison also said the trend toward specialization may have played a role, with more students choosing to focus on fewer sports.\n\nAlthough Texas declined to discuss its methodology, the other Top 5 five states described their approaches.\n\nThe California Interscholastic Federation said it inflates the number of participants reported for each sport based on the percentage of schools that don\u2019t report. For example, if 80% of schools submitted basketball participation figures, the total would be increased by a flat percentage to approximate total participation. The figures aren\u2019t weighted to reflect differences in school enrollment or previous athletic participation.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you noticed a drop-off in high-school sports participation in your area? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe Ohio and Illinois high-school athletic associations said they take the data they receive, calculate the average squad size for each sport and multiply the number of missing schools by the averages to approximate their figures.\n\nThe New York State Public High School Athletic Association said it hasn\u2019t used estimates in any of the past four years. It reports only the numbers it receives, and last year 100% of its member schools provided data.\n\nA final wrinkle in the participation survey is that it doesn\u2019t represent the number of student athletes. An athlete who plays four different sports will be counted in each one\u2014making a single student count as four participants.\n\nBecause of that, even if participation did fall, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean fewer kids played sports. But there is evidence that some sports have lost players, even if the aggregated data are less than precise.\n\n\u201cFootball is noticeably down,\u201d said Tim Stried, director of communications for the Ohio High School Athletic Association. \u201cWe have eight schools in Ohio playing eight-man football. That\u2019s a new phenomenon.\u201d\n\nMore than a million boys compete on traditional 11-player teams in the U.S., making it the second largest high-school sport behind outdoor track and field. But nationally, 11-player football participation was down 3% over the previous year, according to the survey, and Ohio reported a decrease of 7%, which Mr. Stried believes is accurate.\n\n\u201cWe never had any eight-man teams in the \u201970s, \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe seven or eight years ago, a couple of schools dropped down to play eight-man. Now, it\u2019s up to eight schools.\u201d\n\nAnd that, he said, is real data.\n\nWrite to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com", "description": "A long-running survey of U.S. high-school sports participation made headlines this year by reporting that participation was down for the first time in three decades.
