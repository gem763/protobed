You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe argument is a sound one \u2013 if we\u2019re going to consume goat dairy products we should eat some goat meat too, because it\u2019s criminal to senselessly waste life.\n\nThere are an estimated 108,000 commercial dairy goats in the UK \u2013 and when they reproduce there\u2019s a 50:50 chance they will produce a male, whose fate may not be to live beyond a few days.\n\n\u201cWaste is built into the food system but people don\u2019t make the connection between consuming dairy products and death. I\u2019ve talked about this every day for seven years and I still see blank faces when I mention the issue of males in a dairy system,\u201d says James Whetlor, founder of goat meat supplier Cabrito (the Spanish word for young goat).\n\nWhetlor and his partner, Sushi, set up Cabrito in 2012 to create a market for these young billies, starting with four goats in a field.\n\nThey now work with a network of top chefs and one of the largest commercial dairy groups in the UK, Delamare, taking just under 30 per cent of the 25,000 billy goats they produce from four of their farms.\n\nWhere to eat goat out this October Heritage, Sussex\n\nHeritage.restaurant River Cottage, Axminster\n\nrivercottage.net/restaurants/axminster GOAT, Croydon\n\ngoatbychefjamescochran.com Temper, Soho\n\ntemperrestaurant.com Brigadiers, City\n\nbrigadierslondon.com\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to blame the farmer for euthanising billy goats, but we\u2019re all responsible for allowing goat dairy farming to grow with a 50 per cent mortality rate,\u201d Whetlor says.\n\nTough rep\n\nAlthough goat makes up to 60 per cent of red meat eaten worldwide, here it still has a reputation for being tough \u2013 mainly because we associate it with curries and stews made with nanny goats used for meat once they no longer provide enough milk.\n\nWhetlor says: \u201cThe entire UK farming structure is built around wool and sheep; goat never got a look in. Goat meat is still seen as inferior \u2013 so much so that my mum won\u2019t touch it.\u201d\n\nBut six-month-old kid is different. It\u2019s low in fat, high in protein and iron; taste wise it\u2019s somewhere between lamb and venison.\n\nThe future of artisan production lies in restaurants. They are run by people by people who care about provenance, ethics and quality more than they do about price James Whetlor\n\nSo far, the key to Cabrito\u2019s success is the support they get from some of the UK\u2019s most respected chefs.\n\n\u201cNeil Rankin\u2019s smoked goat tacos at Temper made goat cool. That made me realise the power chefs have to influence positive change in the food system. We are very lucky to get so much support and I think it reflects just how important sustainability is to this generation of chefs,\u201d says Whetlor.\n\n\u201cThe future of artisan production lies in restaurants. Restaurants are run by people with a passion for food. Men and women who care about provenance, ethics and quality more than they do about price.\u201d\n\nWe also tend to be much more willing to try something new if we trust the reputation of the restaurant or person that\u2019s cooking for us, rather than experimenting at home.\n\nOttolenghi\u2019s slow-roasted goat, beluga lentils and green olive salsa is good enough to make you question everything you ever thought about this under-appreciated meat. The smell of River Cottage at Axminster\u2019s slow-braised West Country goat and apricot tagine, served with English spelt, lentils, fresh herbs, organic yoghurt, flatbreads will have your mouth watering.\n\nBut, contrary to another common misconception, goat doesn\u2019t have to be slow cooked. Kid chops, for example, can be particularly succulent simply rubbed with butter, seasoned with salt and pepper and griddled for a few minutes on either side.\n\nAs Whetlor says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about penance, you should feel good about the food you\u2019re eating.\u201d\n\nIndoor vs free-range\n\nWhether we should be rearing goats commercially for dairy in the first place is an important consideration. The majority of goat products come from indoor systems with kid goats reared in barns and necessarily weaned on milk powder replacement.\n\nCommercial cow dairy farms that operate in a similar way are heavily criticised by supporters of free-range farming \u2013 including myself.\n\nWhetlor says he and his partner, both from Riverford Cottage backgrounds, had a long chat about whether they should get involved in a non-free range business before they launched Cabrito. But, he believes the indoor vs outdoor argument is not so black and white when it comes to goats.\n\nIn the introduction to his cookbook Goat, Whetlor dedicates a lot of time to the ethical issue of animal welfare.\n\nHe says: \u201cI am emotionally a \u2018free ranger\u2019 and still believe that housing pigs, sheep and cows all year round is unnecessary and wrong, but goats are different\u2026 In short, if you have free-range goats you are going to have more vet intervention and medication. Goats have not evolved for a British climate.\u201d\n\nHe goes into detail about the problems with goats feet, which aren\u2019t designed for soft, often wet ground and therefore are susceptible to infection.\n\nHis reasoning is supported by Dr David Harwood, senior vice president of the Goat Veterinary Society, who also explains: \u201cCows and sheep are grazing animals, they eat grass. Goats are browsing animals who will eat the likes of thistle and branches as well as grass, this means they don\u2019t build the same levels of immunity and are highly susceptible to worms.\u201d\n\nWhere to buy goat to eat at home Cabrito\n\ncabrito.co.uk Just Kidding\n\ncotswoldkidmeat.com Long Meadow Goats\n\nlongmeadowgoats.co.uk Organic goat meat, not from a dairy system\n\nhello@daynesfarm.co.uk\n\nIn some cases Harwood says worming is needed every three weeks, so from a health and business point of view indoor farming is considered to be an acceptable option for commercial dairy farms, as long as the goats have the enrichment they need to satisfy their curious nature.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to draw solid conclusions on good goat husbandry as published studies of goat health, welfare and production remain scarce.\n\nCompassion in World Farming doesn\u2019t yet have a public policy on goats because the industry is tiny compared with the 10 million cows and 34 million sheep farmed each year in the UK.\n\nTheir research manager and former vet specialising in goat farms, In\u00eas Adjuda, says they do have an internal one and the preference would always be for goats to be outside. If the goats are kept inside they need barrels to climb and things to hide under for mental stimulation because they are curious, social creatures who like to play from as early as one-to-two weeks old.\n\nHugh Fearnley-Whittingstall writes a spirited forward for Whetlor\u2019s book celebrating Cabrito\u2019s work, but says:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said [Whetlor] and I don\u2019t have differing views in some areas \u2013 I don\u2019t feel quite so sanguine as he does about zero-grazing systems for goats, for instance, and I will always prefer both milk and meat from animals that have lived outside and fed on natural forage for a significant part of their lives.\u201d\n\nThere are examples of goats raised successfully in free-range systems. These include Just Kidding and Long Meadow Goats, who also both take kids from indoor dairy systems and rear them largely outdoors on a grass-based diets, once they have been weaned.\n\nThis means the goats take longer to put on weight, so they are typically a few months older when killed for meat.\n\nThe meat tends to be leaner, with less fat than indoor bred goats.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day our plight is the same as Cabrito\u2019s,\u201d says Charlotte Mercer from Long Meadow Goats. \u201cWe want to give these kids a chance at life and to run a sustainable business.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that if we\u2019re consuming goat dairy products, we should eat goat, too.\n\nAs the industry develops we need to ensure it doesn't intensify so all kids reared for meat are given a life worth living.\n\nGoatober.com; Lizzie is founder of ethical lifestyle website BICBIM bicbim.co.uk", "description": "This month the likes of Ottolenghi and River Cottage will be championing a key ingredient on their menus \u2013 goat.\u00a0 Sustainably minded restaurants and pubs across the UK are making goat a feature of their menus for a small but growing month-long \u201cfeastival\u201d, Goatober.
