Democratic presidential hopefuls rolled out climate change plans that would go further than policies Obama implemented. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Energy & Environment Democrats split from Obama playbook with aggressive climate plans\n\nDemocratic White House hopefuls are rolling out aggressive climate change plans that show a sharp break from former President Barack Obama by seeking to prohibit new fossil fuel production on federal lands.\n\nThat represents a U-turn from the Trump administration's focus on driving up U.S. fossil fuel production and would go further than climate policies implemented by Obama, who often extolled the rising U.S. energy production from fracking during his tenure in the White House.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAll 10 candidates participating in CNN\u2019s climate change town hall Wednesday, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have proposed halting new leases to tap into energy deposits on millions of acres both onshore and off the coasts, a sign that the party has adopted the position of green groups that long pushed to keep fossil fuels in the ground.\n\n\u201cEverything has gone to 11,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a group of oil and gas companies. \u201cYou pick a topic and it\u2019s like President Obama might as well have been a Republican.\u201d\n\nFederal land is one of few areas where an administration can shift energy development in a major way without relying on action from Congress. Fossil fuels from lands under the federal government's control accounted for about one-quarter of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions between 2005 and 2014, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It\u2019s also a cash cow: revenues from federal oil and gas output topped $8 billion in 2018, according to the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.\n\nBut as the latest reports from scientists in groups like the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ramp up warnings that time is running short to avoid catastrophic warming, a new group of young activists in organizations like the Sunrise Movement have joined older environmental groups to press Democrats to take aggressive steps.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama was a friendly target for climate campaigning, but he was never the climate champion we needed. We should have seen the promises candidates are making now a decade ago,\u201d said Jenny Marienau, political campaign director with 350Action.\n\nEnergy lobbyists say instituting an outright ban through executive order or some other policy mechanism would likely violate several laws \u2014 though that hasn\u2019t dissuaded candidates such as Warren, who said she would issue a moratorium on new leases her first day in office.\n\nAnd a president can't simply evict energy companies from ongoing operations on federal land without giving them compensation, so the thousands of existing leases would likely remain in place. Companies can also hold onto leases for 10 years at a time.\n\n\u201cAlmost every candidate has committed to immediately or rapidly ending leasing on public land and we trust that they\u2019ll find the mechanisms,\u201d Marienau said.\n\nSome candidates have acknowledged that legal obstacle on canceling existing leases, and Warren and Biden have said they would block only new fossil fuel leasing. But Sanders\u2019 climate plan said he would \u201cimmediately end all new and existing fossil fuel extraction on federal public lands,\u201d while Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) envisions \"phasing out\" existing leases.\n\nEnergy lobbyists and attorneys acknowledge that a president has many ways to frustrate energy companies within the confines of the laws.\n\nThe Mineral Leasing Act encourages, but doesn\u2019t require, leasing federal land for mineral development. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act promotes using land for multiple purposes, but doesn\u2019t dictate how. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act directs leasing of offshore waters for energy development \u201cin a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cA new president could certainly make it much more difficult to drill and produce on federal land, but an outright pulling of the emergency brake is going to be very difficult to implement,\u201d said Larry Nettles, an environmental law attorney at Vinson & Elkins LLP in Houston.\n\nThe Obama administration exploited that legal latitude, adding carbon costs to environmental reviews and other hurdles for fossil fuel projects. It required rounds of public meetings for finalizing federal land management plans. It proposed new rules on oil and gas producers to reduce methane pollution on federal land.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

And indeed that\u2019s what they did in the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nShutting down new or even existing drilling on federal land would have little impact on overall U.S production, since the vast majority of oil and gas production is on private land in Texas, North Dakota and other states, said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst at Raymond James. Any such ban would also be in danger of being reversed when a new administration comes in.\n\nOverall oil and gas production on federal land fell every year between 2009 and 2017, according to the Congressional Research Service. That downturn came as companies poured money in fracking at shale fields that lied largely on private land rather than places like the Gulf of Mexico. Less than a quarter of U.S. oil production comes from federal acreage currently, and only about 13 percent of natural gas.\n\n\u201cRegulatory changes are not only limited in scope, but limited in time,\u201d Molchanov said. \u201cIt can be undone just as easily it as originally done. Anything truly game changing would have to get through Congress.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have sought to take on the issue. The House Rules Committee announced on Tuesday that next week it would consider amendments to extend a moratorium on drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, prohibit energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and prevent exploration off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n\nThose efforts aren't likely to advance in the Republican-held Senate, which polls suggest will remain in GOP control after 2020. Without help from Congress, there are limits to what a Democratic president could actually do to eliminate federal oil, gas and coal production.\n\n\u201cI can see them finding it very difficult to implement it and focusing on other issues,\u201d said McKie Campbell, a former staff director for Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \u201cI think both sides have gone towards extremes, which is very bad. Right now there is tremendous pressure to sort of swear allegiance to things.\u201d\n\nBiden, Warren, Sanders and others have said they\u2019d bring back and strengthen Obama\u2019s methane rules. They have also pledged to prioritize wildlife conservation over energy development, a policy maneuver that could effectively shut out oil, gas and coal, Nettles said.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Biden said he wants those rates to reflect the cost of climate change.\n\nBut the party\u2019s environmental faction warned that simply returning to an Obama climate strategy won\u2019t cut it.\n\n\u201cThere is a pitfall now by candidates saying we are going to undo everything the Trump administration has done and go back to the Obama policies, because they were never strong enough,\u201d Marienau said.\n\nFlexing agency discretion in those ways can make it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to operate on federal land, said Dan Naatz, senior vice president of government relations and political affairs with the Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n\n\u201cIt certainly has us concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our work cut out for us.\u201d", "description": "All 10 candidates participating in CNN\u2019s climate change town hall Wednesday have proposed halting new leases to tap into energy deposits.", "authors": ["Zack Colman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/88/ec/ab4e37084a119e8ab47777b0822d/20190904-barack-obama-gty-773.jpg"}
