Bernie Sanders\u2019 belated disclosure of his recent heart attack served as the latest instance of a public figure grappling with whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to talk about a serious health problem on the job.\n\nThe 2020 presidential candidate canceled his events last week after being hospitalized for chest discomfort; his campaign said days later that it was actually a heart attack.\n\nThe recuperating senator plans to participate in next week\u2019s Democratic debate, as his supporters reportedly urge him to dial back the campaigning and speak candidly about his health, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\u2018I want people to pay attention to their symptoms: When you\u2019re hurting, when you\u2019re fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.\n\nThe 78-year-old Vermont lawmaker told reporters on Tuesday that he had been \u201cdumb\u201d to disregard the fatigue he had felt over the past month or two. \u201cI should have listened to those symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to pay attention to their symptoms: When you\u2019re hurting, when you\u2019re fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.\u201d\n\nSanders, whose hospitalization spurred discussion about his age and overall health, was the latest politician or celebrity to navigate the disclosure of a health condition or diagnosis: TV personality Jonathan Van Ness, for example, last month revealed he had been diagnosed with HIV years earlier, calling himself a proud \u201cmember of the beautiful HIV-positive community\u201d who now feels the need to talk openly about his status.\n\nAnd \u201cJeopardy\u201d host Alex Trebek, who disclosed his Stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis in March and said he was in remission two months later, has publicly endured setbacks in his cancer treatment and mused about his own mortality. He told CTV last week that his chemotherapy had taken a tangible physical toll \u2014 suggesting it could one day keep him from hosting the quiz show \u2014 and said he sometimes regretted revealing his illness.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little too much Alex Trebek out there,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile experts stress that every person\u2019s situation is different, here are some general tips to help guide how you discuss and manage health issues in the workplace:\n\nDecide whether to disclose your condition to coworkers. This depends on a variety of factors, including your job, your personal communication style, whether the condition impacts your performance, whether you think you will be marginalized for your disclosure, and the possibility that the situation will eventually resolve itself, said Rosalind Joffe, a career coach who works with people living with chronic health conditions. If your work performance begins to suffer because of your health, it\u2019s best to \u201cstay out in front of the conversation,\u201d said Joffe, whose own health conditions include multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and glaucoma.\n\nThis can help prevent coworkers from jumping to incorrect conclusions from, say, your lateness to work, stumbling or looking fatigued \u2014 and, instead, suspect that you\u2019re uninterested in your job or have a substance-abuse problem, she said. You might be better off providing a simple, matter-of-fact explanation of your condition, she said, focusing on how the illness impacts you rather than getting into the weeds of medical jargon.\n\nDon\u2019t divulge more than you need to. The less you tell your coworkers about your personal life, the more power you have to control your own narrative at work, said human-resources consultant Laurie Ruettimann. \u201cBe real intentional in how you craft that story, and only give as much information as answers the question or addresses the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be your own PR agent.\u201d\n\nAfter all, she added, your colleagues are not your friends or family members, however much they might feel that way. It\u2019s inappropriate to place that kind of weight on them, she said, and unwise to entrust your confidential information with someone who could later act in bad faith or accidentally violate your confidence.\n\nIf you need reasonable accommodations, speak up. \u201cWhile it seems like it\u2019s going to hurt to ask, asking is the first step to getting you what you need \u2014 so please ask,\u201d employment attorney and HR consultant Kate Bischoff said. Talk to your physician about what you can and can\u2019t do in the workplace, she added, and then initiate a conversation with your supervisor or HR department about arranging accommodations.\n\nArrive with a plan for the kinds of \u201cworkarounds\u201d that might be realistic within your work setting, added Joffe, \u201cso that it doesn\u2019t fall on someone else to figure out how you can do your job.\u201d For example, do you need work flexibility, a standing desk or a work space closer to the restroom? (The federal Office of Disability Employment Policy\u2019s Job Accommodation Network is a helpful resource.)\n\nIn formulating such a plan, envision worst-case scenarios for how your condition could impact you at work \u2014 and then include potential solutions to those problems, Ruettimann said. Seek guidance from colleagues who you know have navigated your organization\u2019s accommodations process, she added, and tap into your employee-assistance program (EAP) for advice.\n\nBut remember: \u201cIt\u2019s only going to work if you can do the job as it is currently described,\u201d Joffe said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up most likely losing that job, one way or another, if you can\u2019t do it. Only you know what your capacity is.\u201d If you believe you can do it, then go ahead and plan for your return to work, she said \u2014 with or without workarounds.\n\nBe aware of how people perceive your ability to do your job. If someone is making an untrue or unfair assumption about you based on your illness, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be brave in the moment and call it out,\u201d Ruettimann said. \u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk about it, but don\u2019t let it slide \u2014 one assumption taken the wrong way becomes the norm.\u201d\n\nIf you believe you\u2019re being treated differently or discriminated against, your employer has a responsibility to fix the situation, said Bischoff. Ruettimann advised tackling the problem \u201cas locally as you can,\u201d whether that means saying something to the individual who is treating you differently, talking to HR, or escalating your complaint through your corporate HR structure\u2019s chain of command. EAPs often provide coaching, advising, legal advice and financial resources, she added.\n\nYou can also file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and/or your state or local employment-discrimination agencies. But Joffe said that while the EEOC route \u201ccan be very effective if you have a very provable case,\u201d it can be more complicated with an \u201cinvisible, waxing-and-waning chronic illness.\u201d \u201cI have never met anybody who has gone to the EEOC with a claim like that and had anything positive come out of that,\u201d Ruettimann added.\n\nIf you have the luxury of being able to find a different job, that\u2019s often the best option, Joffe said. Then again, if it\u2019s only one or two people giving you trouble, sometimes \u201cyou\u2019re better off staying in a place where they value you and they\u2019ll work with you.\u201d", "description": "\u2018I should have listened to those symptoms,\u2019 said Sen.
