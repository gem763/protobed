Fifty-seven percent of Yang\u2019s potential supporters are considering Sanders, according to a recent Ipsos/FiveThirtyEight poll. The mutual interest works in the other direction, too: 16 percent of Sanders\u2019 potential voters are eyeing Yang.\n\nThough Sanders and Yang differ in significant ways, they\u2019re both running anti-establishment campaigns that speak to an electorate frustrated with the status quo, wary of Democratic insiders, and looking for economic help. For Sanders, their overlapping bases may give him a small boost if Yang drops out of the race down the road or if he works to woo the so-called #YangGang.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential threat to Sanders even if Yang continues polling in the single digits. If Yang shaves off a few percentage points from Sanders\u2019 voting bloc, particularly in early-primary states such as New Hampshire, that could turn a second- or third-place finish into something worse.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
