Her new political allies should be too | Stephen Buranyi", "language": "en", "text": "Greta Thunberg has made a lot of enemies. They are easy to recognise because their rage is so great they cannot help making themselves look ridiculous. Thunberg\u2019s arrival in the US earlier this month set off rightwing pundits and then the president himself. The conservative provocateur Dinesh D\u2019Souza compared her look to a Nazi propaganda poster; a Fox News guest called her a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child\u201d being exploited by her parents; and Trump mocked her on Twitter as a \u201chappy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\u201d, after a speech in which she urgently laid out the dismal prospects for her generation\u2019s future.\n\nTHE GRETA THUNBERG PROBLEM, so many men freaking out about the tiny Swedish climate demon | First Dog on the Moon Read more\n\nThese are the latest attacks, but they aren\u2019t the darkest, or most unhinged. Arron Banks intimating that she might drown crossing the Atlantic in August might be the single worst example \u2013 or you can stare directly into the abyss by witnessing the depraved abuse Thunberg receives across the social media networks.\n\nHer many supporters seem baffled about why Thunberg triggers these attacks. \u201cWhat is it about Greta?\u201d they ask, puzzling over her apparent innocuousness; this slight girl with her oversized coats and hand-painted sign who insists we should simply \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d. Thunberg\u2019s age and gender undoubtedly annoy her critics, but they\u2019re melting down because she explicitly makes the connections that scientists are generally unwilling to make. Namely that their scientific predictions for the climate, and the current economic and political order, may not be compatible.\n\nLast year\u2019s IPCC report warned there were just 12 years left to avoid irreversible damage to the climate. Thunberg refers to this often, updating the count as if it were a timebomb strapped to the chest of her entire generation: the closer it gets to zero, the more radical action seems justified.\n\nPlay Video 1:18 'We've become too loud for people to handle': Greta Thunberg to Montreal climate strikers \u2013 video\n\nIt\u2019s a moral argument, fundamentally, that assumes the climate crisis will be worse than any disruption caused by addressing it. Carbon moves the deadly clock forward, and anything that facilitates that must be bad. She judges long-touted paradigms of \u201cgreen growth\u201d and market-based solutions as failures by this simple measure. \u201cIf solutions within this system are so impossible to find then maybe we should change the system itself,\u201d she said at the UN climate conference in Katowice last year.\n\nThe right doesn\u2019t just mindlessly explode at every climate activist. Thunberg has none of the unthreatening geniality of Mr Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore, or the various Hollywood celebrities who have taken on climate as a cause. She styles herself as a climate populist: she invokes a clear moral vision, a corrupt, unresponsive system \u2013 and has a knack for neatly separating an \u201cus\u201d and a \u201cthem\u201d. When she spoke of her supporters \u201cbeing mocked and lied about by elected officials, members of parliament, business leaders, journalists\u201d, she was drawing now-familiar political lines against the elite.\n\nThis framing releases ordinary people from complicity in the climate crisis, just as other populisms release them from blame for their economic or social fate, and directs that feeling towards a political enemy. \u201cSome people say that the climate crisis is something that we all have created. But that is just another convenient lie,\u201d Thunberg told attendees at Davos earlier this year. \u201cSomeone is to blame.\u201d A 2017 report showing that just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 has become a popular reference among protesters. The alchemy of populism is that powerlessness fuels anger rather than despair.\n\nThunberg\u2019s critics previously understood exactly what to expect from the climate issue. Even if they didn\u2019t follow it closely, they could intuit, as most people could, that the mainstream channels of communication were gunked up with denial and obstruction, and international negotiations were governed by a politics that was accommodating to the status quo. Despite the lofty promises, no one believed anything would change. It isn\u2019t just that Thunberg has made climate politics popular, she has \u2013 for the first time since the early days of the climate justice movement \u2013 made them populist on a large scale, something these people rightly see as a threat to the more liberal order that suited them fine. A good reactionary recognises the potential vehicle for real change, and they hate it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau praised Greta Thunberg last week while unveiling new climate policies that fell short of her goals.

Justin Trudeau, for example, praised her last week while unveiling new climate policies that fell short of Thunberg\u2019s goals. After meeting with him, she claimed Trudeau was \u201cnot doing enough\u201d on climate \u2013 and she has previously called his government\u2019s doublespeak on climate policy \u201cshameful\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where Thunberg\u2019s politics lie, or where they will go in the future, but her rhetoric mirrors the left of the environmental movement, a wing of which has long cautioned that reductions in consumption and growth will be required to deal with the climate crisis. \u201cYou only speak of a green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular,\u201d she told delegates at the UN climate conference in Katowice last year, criticising the \u201csame bad ideas that got us into this mess\u201d, and telling them to pull \u201cthe emergency brake\u201d.\n\nEarlier this month in New York she continued the critique in front of world leaders. \u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can think of is money and fairytales of eternal growth: how dare you,\u201d she said, visibly angry.\n\nThis is worth pointing out \u2013 not to claim Thunberg for any particular political faction, but to note that her main rhetorical targets are not denialist wingnuts, but the same mainstream politicians who invite her to speak and praise her activism. They beam at her as if she were their own child, and, perhaps in a similar way, they don\u2019t appear to hear her when she says it\u2019s their fault her life is ruined. It\u2019s the reaction of a group who have long considered themselves on the correct side of the climate divide, and thus, of history. As if a grand \u201cwe tried\u201d would satisfy the generations after them.\n\nThunberg\u2019s great contribution is to convince the wider public of the bankruptcy of that outlook, and to indict years of missed targets as the failures that they are. Politicians don\u2019t appear to take this shift, or her, very seriously. They\u2019re happy to bask in her light, perhaps convinced this new insistence on immediacy will pass, as all the others did.\n\nIn her latest speech, Thunberg promised change was coming, \u201cwhether you like it or not\u201d, although it\u2019s not clear she has a plan for how. For the moment she and the movement she has invigorated are in a strange place, commanding immense popular support for a radical cause, and simultaneously praised by the very people they identify as the problem.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a London-based writer and a former researcher in immunology", "description": "Liberal leaders line up to praise her.
