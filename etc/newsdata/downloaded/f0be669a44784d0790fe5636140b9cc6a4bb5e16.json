Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential contender, asked the company to consider suspending Trump\u2019s account, claiming his online communications \u201cput people at risk and our democracy in danger.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe dispute stems from Twitter\u2019s announcement this summer that it would label tweets from world leaders whose comments violate site policies, including those designed to prevent harm and abuse. The rules were designed to strike a balance between the public\u2019s right to know and Twitter\u2019s efforts to ensure hate speech, misinformation and other troubling content do not go viral.\n\nAD\n\nBut Twitter\u2019s application of the policy ultimately invited widespread criticism, after the company opted not to label a number of Trump\u2019s tweets that Democrats and digital watchdogs saw as improper. In July, for instance, the president told four congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries, a tweet widely viewed as a racist attack in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules against hate speech.\n\nIn an attempt to clarify its rules, Twitter said Tuesday it would take enforcement actions against \u201cany account\u201d in certain, dire circumstances, including instances when a world leader threatens a user with direct violence or publishes private information, such as a home address.\n\nAD\n\nBut Twitter also noted there were cases when the company may not act, such as when heads of state have \u201cdirect interactions\u201d with their peers or engage in \u201cforeign policy saber rattling on economic and military issues,\u201d which it said are not violations of rules. Nor would the company seek to \u201cdetermine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,\u201d it said.\n\nAD\n\nFor those tweets that are labeled as violations, Twitter said it would also take steps to limit their spread on the site: Users would not be able to retweet or like that content, for example. The company said it has not yet applied this label.\n\n\u201cWith critical elections and shifting political dynamics around the world, we recognize that we\u2019re operating in an increasingly complex and polarized political culture,\u201d Twitter said. \u201cThese are constantly evolving challenges and we\u2019ll keep our policies and approach under advisement, particularly as we learn more about the relationship between Tweets from world leaders and the potential for offline harm.\n\nAD\n\nThe clarification didn\u2019t immediately satisfy the company\u2019s critics. In response to Twitter's updated policies, Ian Sams, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said, \"When Trump is using his tweets to make threats, incite violence and intimidate witnesses, this is insufficient.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe request for stricter enforcement of company guidelines \u2014 and the update from Twitter \u2014 have come amid rising Democratic anger with the laissez-faire attitude adopted by technology giants toward politicians. Trump has made prolific use of the platforms, bypassing mainstream gatekeepers to speak directly to his supporters.\n\nIn an Oct. 1 letter to Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Harris. a former attorney general of California, cited examples of Trump\u2019s tweets that disparaged the whistleblower who brought forth concerns about the president\u2019s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nAD\n\nTrump described the individual, who is a member of the intelligence community, as a \u201cso-called \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019\u201d and said, \u201cI deserve to meet my accuser.\u201d He also leveled a baseless accusation of treason, which can carry the death penalty, against Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who is leading the impeachment inquiry that could threaten his presidency.\n\nAD\n\nHarris said the messages amounted to an attempt \"to target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower.\"\n\n\"Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior,\" she wrote. \"And when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.\"\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook declined a request from former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to take down a Trump ad that included a debunked claim about his family\u2019s involvement with a Ukrainian gas company. The company cited its policy of exempting political speech from its fact-checking program.\n\nThat drew a rebuke from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has proposed breaking up Silicon Valley giants in her bid for the Democratic nomination. She called Facebook a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine.\u201d\n\nThe update from Twitter on Tuesday shows, however, that the conundrum facing social media companies extends far beyond paid advertising. The megaphone they offer politicians \u2014 including those with a penchant for mistruths \u2014 can be just as valuable, and just as fraught.\n\nAD", "description": "Twitter said Tuesday it would limit the reach of some tweets from world leaders who violate its rules, stressing that top government officials \u201care not above our policies\u201d at a moment when critics have clamored for the company to take more aggressive action against President Trump.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1QFmPYgjZ4gKeQNuewzXzhWjWIA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZHDE7XKV4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
