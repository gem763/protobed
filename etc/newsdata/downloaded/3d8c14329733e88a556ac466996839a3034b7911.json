The only way to turn it on is by enabling dark mode across all of iOS.\n\nOpen the Settings app. Search Dark and click Appearance (or find Display & Brightness in the third set of options). Select Dark instead of Light. You can also turn on Automatic to automatically switch to dark mode at sunset, and back at sunrise.\n\nIf Instagram hasn\u2019t turned dark yet, then you need to update to the latest version:\n\nOpen the App Store app. Click your user icon in the top right. This opens the Account tab. Scroll down to the Available Updates section. Tap Update All, or the Update button next to Instagram.\n\nAnnoyingly, iOS\u2019s Dark Mode is all-or-nothing. You can\u2019t turn it on or off for any native apps, or for many third-party apps. But you can add a Control Centre button to toggle it on or off system-wide:\n\nOpen the Settings app. Select Control Centre from the third set of options. Tap Customise Controls. Find Dark Mode under More Controls. Hit the green plus sign.\n\nNow you can flip Dark Mode on and off at will. Go stare at your pretty pictures in the dark.", "description": "iOS: Instagram just updated with dark mode, so you can stare at people\u2019s brightly coloured holiday photos and ads for horrible coffee tables surrounded by inky black, like you\u2019re developing film in a darkroom.
