Might that mean the global elite would have to give up their cushy-albeit-carbon-heavy private jet travels?\n\nIndeed, say the staff.\n\nIn an open letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the 2,000 or so staffers, under the header Young UN Agents for Change, wrote: \u201cOur commitments need to be more ambitious and at least as concrete as those of the UN Member States and no-party stakeholders attending the UN Climate Action Summit. \u2026 [L]et us look at our own impact and take bold steps to address the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nThe letter comes as Reuters reported the world body emitted roughly 2 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2018 \u2014 a carbon footprint that\u2019s larger than what\u2019s left behind by some entire U.N. member states, such as Malta and Liberia.\n\nAnd it\u2019s largely due to travel.\n\n\u201cAmong 10 issues identified by Young UN are travel allowances, which \u2026 should be scrapped \u2018in order to disincentivize travel by UN employees and UN meeting participants motivated by financial gain,\u2019 \u201d Reuters wrote.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only the carbon footprint the U.N. needs to reel in; it\u2019s spending on perks.\n\nTravel allotments for each and every global body traveler can surpass $400 a day. That\u2019s a whole lot of food. That\u2019s a pretty cushy padding.\n\nSo what\u2019s been the United Nations\u2018 response to this public shaming and outing of hypocrisy? Pretty much as expected.\n\nPolitical hogwash.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary-General welcomes the initiative of Young UN on climate action in the UN system,\u201d came a statement from Guterres\u2019 office, Reuters reported. \u201cThe Secretary-General is committed to lead by example and calls for transformative action to address the climate crisis, including on the part of the UN system and Secretariat itself.\u201d\n\nIn other words: We\u2019re Big Government. We don\u2019t have to change.\n\nWith this, it\u2019s not so much that U.N. elite fly the friendly skies whenever, wherever and with whomever they please. Rather, it\u2019s that these same U.N. elite who cry about carbon footprints from thee and me nevertheless don\u2019t direct that same sort of alarmism toward themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hypocrisy of the worst kind. And these U.N. staffers raise a good point: If the United Nations\u2018 notables can\u2019t practice what they preach about the climate, they either ought to quit the practice \u2014 or quit the preaching.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
