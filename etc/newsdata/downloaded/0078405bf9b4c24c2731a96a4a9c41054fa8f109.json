The move is intended to alleviate some of the pressure of negative interest rates on the balance sheets of European banks, which have seen profits squeezed by the persistent low rate environment. More details on the tiering system are expected at a press conference later this afternoon.", "description": "The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a massive new bond-buying program Thursday in a bid to stimulate the ailing euro zone economy.", "authors": ["Elliot Smith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105843252-1554895393540mariodraghiecbmarch2019.jpg?v=1554895469", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
