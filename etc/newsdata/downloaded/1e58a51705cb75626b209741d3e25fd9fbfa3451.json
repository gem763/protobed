(AP) - Early reports from the West Virginia Lottery Commission show a slow start to mobile sports betting in the state, with the apps earning less than 4% of what three on-site sportsbooks garnered.\n\nThe Charleston Gazette-Mail reports data for the week ending Aug. 31, when two mobile apps launched, shows the apps produced about $25,000 in revenue. On-site sportsbooks at three of the state\u2019s five casinos earned nearly $649,000 in revenue that same week.\n\nData for this past weekend shows mobile app players wagered a total of $1.12 million and collected nearly $1.1 million in winnings. The apps\u2019 revenue totaled about $28,000, a number likely deflated by Sunday\u2019s first full day of NFL games and major upsets. Lottery Director John Myers says he expects mobile play to grow.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Charleston Gazette-Mail, http://wvgazettemail.com.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Early reports from the West Virginia Lottery Commission show a slow start to mobile sports betting in the state, with the apps earning less than 4% of what three on-site sportsbooks garnered.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
