Given the particulars of the claims are not yet public, I can offer no further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for News Group Newspapers (NGN)\u2014the publishers of the Sun and the now-defunct News of The World\u2014said: \u201cWe confirm that a claim has been issued by the Duke of Sussex.\u201d\n\nThe BBC reported that Harry\u2019s \u201callegations against NGN predate 2010, but it is not yet clear when his claims against the Mirror date from.\u201d The phone hacking may even date as far back to the early 2000s, when Harry was a teenager.\n\nByline Investigates reported, \u201cIn addition to Murdoch\u2019s The Sun and defunct News of the World, the Duke is also suing the publishers of The Mirror titles over unlawful newsgathering activities that stretch back to the editorship of controversial former editor-turned-celebrity Piers Morgan.\u201d\n\nMorgan, currently an anchor on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, did not immediately return the Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.\n\nHe denied phone hacking at the Leveson Inquiry into the ethics of newsgathering in the British press, which led to criminal convictions.\n\nHowever, Morgan, who bitterly claims Markle \u201cghosted\u201d him after striking up an initial friendship, has become a relentless critic of Prince Harry and Meghan on the ITV breakfast show and via his Daily Mail column; his latest was headlined \u201cStop playing the victim, Harry\u2014you and Meghan brought the negative press on yourselves, and just when you turn things around, you ruin it all.\u201d\n\nMorgan has called Markle \u201ca self-obsessed professional actress who has landed the role of her life and is determined to milk it for all she\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nA legal insider told Byline Investigates: \u201cPiers Morgan has been critical of Harry and Meghan's recourse to law this week against the Mail on Sunday. However, most of the Mirror hacking and blagging of Harry and his loved ones, allegedly happened under his watch.\u201d (\u2018Blagging,\u2019 in this context, means posing as someone to obtain personal information about them without their consent.)\n\nOne Mirror source told The Daily Beast: \u201cPiers is at the crux of this. Harry is incensed over his constant columns on Mail Online and his TV attacks on GMB. Piers does not hold back in his contempt for them.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter on Friday, Morgan first accused the actor Hugh Grant of spreading \u201cdisgusting lies\u201d when Grant shared the Byline Investigates story, foregrounding the negative quote about Morgan. Later, Morgan posted a picture of himself with a glass of wine and cigar and the hashtag, \u201cHappy Smile Day.\u201d\n\nA senior employee at one of the named outlets, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so, told The Daily Beast that they did not believe the allegations related to specific allegations of phone hacking, or phone hacking that had taken place in recent years, but rather to an inference of phone hacking based on the publication of private information.\n\nThe source said they did not have detailed knowledge of the complaint lodged by Harry and was basing their speculation on previous legal actions by other claimants.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe papers were lodged a week ago. Since 2011 there have been a steady stream of civil cases, and usually they don\u2019t actually have direct evidence of phone hacking, they just say, \u2018Well, in 2005 you published this story that you couldn\u2019t possibly have known about unless you had hacked my phone.\u2019\n\n\u201cI suspect this is similar. Now we\u2019re being traduced as phone hackers but in the vast majority of cases someone had actually told us the story and we hadn\u2019t hacked anyone\u2019s phone. Usually the lawyers just settle anyway, because it\u2019s easier, but for some reason Harry has obviously decided he wants to make a big public statement out of it.\n\n\u201cThe general view is that it\u2019s just some vendetta he has got. But what is he so cross about? What does it pertain to? It\u2019s like he has gone mad. I mean, if you actually read the papers we do the most fawning coverage of Meghan and Harry. It\u2019s infuriating.\n\n\u201c Harry is making himself newsworthy. He seems to have lost the plot with the press. This is a very aggressive and odd move and is obviously being driven by the way the press has covered Meghan. This is payback \u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely get the impression he is doing this without consulting anyone, just like he did with the statement this week and the action against the Mail on Sunday. He is just launching his own actions and he is going to drag the whole royal family down with him. \u201c\n\nA former royal correspondent told the Daily Beast: \u201cHarry is making himself newsworthy. He seems to have lost the plot with the press. This is a very aggressive and odd move and is obviously being driven by the way the press has covered Meghan. This is payback.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s legal actions could not only lead to him taking the stand, but also a return to the British courts of the main players of the original British phone hacking scandal, including Morgan and Rebekah Brooks, CEO of News UK, the renamed News International, which publishes Murdoch's British newspapers, The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sun, and the now-deceased News of the World.\n\nBrooks is a former editor of The Sun and the News of the World, and resigned as CEO of News International in 2011 after the Leveson Inquiry, before being re-installed as CEO of News UK in 2015.\n\nMarkle\u2019s legal action against The Mail on Sunday and Associated Newspapers, announced earlier this week, is over the \u201cmisuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.\u201d\n\nThe case is being funded by the Duke and Duchess privately, and any money resulting from the case will reportedly be given to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, The Mail on Sunday said it stood by its story \u201cand will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201c I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person \u201d\n\nIn a statement notable for its raw emotion, Prince Harry wrote that his wife has become \u201cone of the latest victims of a British tabloid press\u201d\u2014which he said has waged a \u201cruthless campaign\u201d against her. \u201cThe contents of a private letter were published unlawfully in an intentionally destructive manner to manipulate you, the reader, and further the divisive agenda of the media group in question,\u201d Harry wrote. \u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behavior, because it destroys people and destroys lives.\u201d\n\nHarry wrote that he feared \u201chistory repeating itself,\u201d referring to how his late mother, Princess Diana, was treated by the press. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d", "description": "Prince Harry\u2019s lawsuits against the Sun and Mirror add to Meghan Markle\u2019s against the Mail on Sunday.
