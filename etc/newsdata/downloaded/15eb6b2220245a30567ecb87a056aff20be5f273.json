An announcement was made over the stadium\u2019s public address system calling on the abuse to stop during the first half and referee Ivan Bebek temporarily halted proceedings just before half-time. Despite the abuse continuing in the second half, England played on and won the match 6-0.\n\nThe FA said in its statement that better education was the long-term solution to tackling the problem, adding: \u201cOur priority remains our players, support team and fans and we will do all we can to ensure they never have to endure such circumstances again.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge Uefa\u2019s ruling today, a huge challenge still exists around racism and discrimination in society. Football has its part to play, and must do so, but it is for all to recognise the seriousness of the problem.\u201d\n\nPiara Powar, the executive director of the Fare Network whose spotters provide evidence to Uefa on incidents of discriminatory behaviour, felt Bulgaria should have been disqualified.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the speed of this decision but we are disappointed Bulgaria will not be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying competition given their previous record and obvious inability to deal with the problems they face,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe think the evidence and circumstances of this match would have justified European football being given a stronger signal on the need to tackle racism.\u201d\n\nThe BFU, for its part, said the sanctions would have been more severe but for the \u201cdiligent and competent work\u201d of the federation.\n\nIt added: \u201cWe sincerely believe that in the future, Bulgarian football fans will prove with their behaviour that they have unjustifiably become the subject of accusations of lack of tolerance and respect for their opponents.\u201d\n\nThe Bulgarian federation was also fined 10,000 euros (\u00a38,619) for causing disturbance during a national anthem, while the English Football Association was fined 5,000 euros (\u00a34,309) for the same offence.\n\nThe charge against the FA related to an insufficient number of travelling stewards will be heard on November 21 after the association requested more time to present its defence.\n\nThe punishment handed to Bulgaria came on the same day that Hartlepool were charged by the FA over alleged racist abuse by some of their supporters towards Dover player Inih Effiong during a National League game on September 21, and as a Burnley fan faced trial in Brighton accused of racially abusing Albion defender Gaetan Bong. Nathan Higgins, 19, denies the charge.\n\nPA", "description": "Uefa\u00a0has \u201cmissed an opportunity\u201d to get tough on racism after it ordered Bulgaria\u00a0to play their next home qualifier behind closed doors over the racist behaviour of their fans during the Euro 2020 match against England.", "authors": ["Jamie Gardner"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/23/18/kick-it-out.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
