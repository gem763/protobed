He told reporters he is \u201cfeeling good\u201d and should be able to face his former team.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty confident in saying that,\u201d Peterson said. \u201c(Monday) was rough. I really didn\u2019t know. I woke up this morning feeling really good. The swelling I had went down tremendously and I was able to get some cardio in today and the hydro works. I felt good. We got two more days just to heal and do the necessary things the training staff are going to put me through.\u201d\n\nPeterson spent 10 seasons in Minnesota, becoming one of the best running backs of his generation. He is the last non-quarterback to win the MVP, doing so in 2012 when he rushed for 2,097 yards \u2014 the year after tearing his ACL.\n\nPeterson, who suffered the ankle injury in Sunday\u2019s loss to the San Francisco 49ers, said \u201cof course\u201d when asked if there\u2019s added motivation to play since this week\u2019s opponent is the Vikings.\n\n\u201cOf course I want to play against Minnesota,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI was there for 10 years. 98% of the guys on the defense, I played with those guys. It\u2019s going to be exciting to get out there and compete against those guys for four quarters.\u201d\n\nThursday won\u2019t be the first time Peterson will make his return to U.S. Bank Stadium. He did so as a member of the New Orleans Saints in 2017, the year the Vikings released him. Peterson said the reception from fans was good then and experts a similarly warm welcome this time around. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything else from Minnesota Vikings fans,\u201d he said.\n\nInterim coach Bill Callahan called Peterson\u2019s injury \u201cday-to-day.\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old was one of seven Redskins who didn\u2019t practice Tuesday, including Chris Thompson (toe), Josh Norman (thigh), Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring), Montae Nicholson (ankle), Wes Martin (chest) and Deshazor Everett (ankle).\n\n\u201c(Peterson) feels pretty confident about it, so if that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s really positive,\u201d Callahan told Minnesota reporters on a conference call.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
