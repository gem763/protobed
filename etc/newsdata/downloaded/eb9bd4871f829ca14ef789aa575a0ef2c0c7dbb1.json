He said there were \"no circumstances\" in which he's ask for one. He said he's \"never\" beg for one. And he told MPs simply: \"I will not ask for another delay.\"\n\nEvery one of those statements has been exposed as untrue.\n\nSo for the record, here are 9 times Boris Johnson said he wouldn't delay Brexit - plus a few more for his top allies.\n\nJune 25: \"We are getting ready to come out on October 31. Come what may. Do or die.\"\n\nSeptember 2: \"There are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\"\n\nSeptember 3: \"We will leave by 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSeptember 4: [No10 source at official press briefing]: \"The PM has been clear that he will not go to Brussels to ask for an extension.\"\n\nSeptember 5: \"[Delay?] I'd rather be dead in a ditch.\"\n\nSeptember 6: [Asked if he'll carry out Parliament's instructions to delay] \"I will not. I don't want a delay.\"\n\nSeptember 6: \"[MPs] just passed a law that would force me to beg Brussels for an extension to the Brexit deadline. This is something I will never do.\"\n\nSeptember 9: \"I will not ask for another delay.\"\n\nSeptember 10: [Treasury minister Simon Clarke, speaking on government's behalf]: \"The government is very clear that we will not under any circumstances be asking for an extension and that is the absolute bottom line.\"\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nSeptember 16: \"We're going to come out on October 31 and it's vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won't go on remaining in the EU beyond October.\"\n\nSeptember 25: \"We will come out of the European Union on 31 October, and we will not be extending.\"\n\nOctober 19, 3.30pm: [Conservative Party on Twitter ]: \"The Prime Minister will not ask for a delay.\"\n\nOctober 19, 10pm: \"Dear Mr President... the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50 (3) of the Treaty on European Union. Yours Sincerely, Prime Minister.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson repeatedly claimed he wouldn't ask Brussels for a delay to the October 31 Brexit date.
