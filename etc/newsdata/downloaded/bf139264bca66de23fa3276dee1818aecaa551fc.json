I agree that his performance was not too good in recent times but what about his achievements which he marked for this country,\u201d a supporter questioned while talking to the ARY Sports.\n\n\u201cRemoving him from ODI and Test is somewhere acceptable but can the PCB give any valid reason behind removing him from T20I captaincy? He has won 12 T20I series out 14 for you,\u201d another fan lamented.\n\nThe fans appealed to the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan to look into this matter and call back Sarfraz as captain in shorter format of the game. \u201cWe would like to request PM Khan to look into this matter as merit has been overlooked,\u201d fans appealed.\n\nKarachiites chanted the slogans of \u2018Justice for Sarfraz\u2019 and \u2018Sarfraz Zindabad\u2019. On the other hand, they also bashed former pacer Shoaib Akhtar who called the people of Karachi \u2018coward\u2019.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the PCB removed Sarfraz from all formats with immediate effect. Azhar Ali has been made captain in Test cricket while Babar Azam will lead the national T20I team till the upcoming T20 World Cup in Australia.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Cricket fans in Karachi gathered outside former captain Sarfraz Ahmed's residence to throw a protest in favor of him and against the policies of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Saifi-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
