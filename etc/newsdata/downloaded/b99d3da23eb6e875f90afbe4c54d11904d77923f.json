I thank God that I could visit al-Aqsa mosque and pray inside the mosque.\u201d\n\nThe Dome of the Rock is built where the Prophet Mohammad is said to have ascended to heaven and it encompasses the Foundation Stone, a rock holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. Jordan has custodianship of the holy sites.\n\nThe area is one of the most sensitive sites in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is revered by Jews as Temple Mount, the site of two biblical Jewish temples, and is situated in a part of Jerusalem captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move that has not been recognised internationally.\n\nThe Saudi players are due to face the Palestinian national team in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday for a World Cup qualifying match.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Players from Saudi Arabia\u2019s national soccer team traveled to Jerusalem\u2019s Old City on Monday to pray at one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Soccer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
