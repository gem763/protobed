They won for developing a device that lets first responders safely collect potentially hazardous needles left behind by opioid and other drug users.\n\nThe device itself, 3D-printed at the school, is a small plastic box, about the length of a syringe and a few inches wide. The box is placed over the needle, then squeezed to pick up the syringe.\n\nKENTUCKY MIDDLE SCHOOLERS DESIGN 3D-PRINTED DEVICE TO HELP FIGHT OPIOID CRISIS\n\n\u201cWe have an open order as soon as we can provide it. Every police car in the city will be equipped with our device as soon as we can get them to [the police department],\u201d John Leistner, a teacher at Ashland Middle, told Fox News in an interview on Thursday.\n\nThe school is trying to come up with a cost-efficient way to manufacture the device after prototyping it on the school\u2019s 3D printers.\n\nDuring the process of developing the device, the students also created an online database where people can report where they find used needles. The goal was to map the areas where needles can be found.\n\nGOOGLE TAPS TECH TO HELP BATTLE OPIOID CRISIS\n\n\u201cThe Ashland Police Department has been on board with our project since Day 1,\u201d Aubree Hay, a student at Ashland Middle School, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cWe passed off our database to Ashland Police Department. Right now they are updating the map as we speak,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe database is just a Google map with pins where needles have been found. Right now [the police department is] actually entering pins where needles have been found in our area,\u201d she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A middle school in Kentucky has built an online database to compliment a needle-collecting device they developed.", "authors": ["Brooke Crothers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/Syringes-San-Francisco-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
