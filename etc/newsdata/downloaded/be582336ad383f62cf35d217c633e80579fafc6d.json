Omar objected and said the video of her dancing to Lizzo\u2019s hit Truth Hurts was in fact shot at a Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington on a different date.\n\nOmar, a Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, posted on Twitter: \u201cThis is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress. The president of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk. What is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation?\u201d\n\nTrump has made several racist attacks to demonize Omar, a Muslim, along with other members of what is known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, all women of color.\n\nIn his retweet of Williams\u2019s original post, the president asserted: \u201cIlhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post noted Williams has a history of spreading conspiracy theories, including one last month that suggested the death of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein might be linked to former president Bill Clinton. Trump retweeted that claim and defended Williams as \u201ca very highly respected conservative pundit\u201d with \u201chalf a million followers\u201d on Twitter, the Post added.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s annual legislative conference took place between 11 and 15 September. Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), tweeted the video of Omar dancing at one of the CBC events on 13 September with the caption: \u201cCan someone name something better than Ilhan Omar dancing to Lizzo? Because I can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d\n\nThe PCCC responded to Trump with a post that said: \u201cOur co-founder Adam Green posted this video from a CBC event on Sept 13, and Ilhan Omar retweeted it. Today Donald Trump tweeted that she \u201cpartied on the anniversary of 9/11.\u201d This is an abhorrent lie that endangers a member of Congress. Twitter must remove Trump\u2019s tweet now.\u201d\n\nPolitical commentator Zerlina Maxwell wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe president just RT\u2019d a lie. We all know this video of Ilhan is from this weekend because we saw them post it in real time.\u201d", "description": "Democrat denounces president\u2019s lies after he retweeted post that falsely claimed Omar was shown partying on 9/11 anniversary", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/147474e5e7fc8d90f1536a81a98e1b609d0adf0f/0_103_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=446ec9679908ac97f2737f59a18c927d", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
