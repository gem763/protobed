At one time or another, someone has tried to ban them from classrooms and public or school libraries.\n\nThe American Library Association launched Banned Books Week in 1982 to celebrate the freedom to read. Libraries, bookstores, publishers and teachers across the country use the week \u2014 this year it\u2019s Sept. 22-28 \u2014 to highlight great books that people have banned and to spark a discussion about censorship. At Common Sense Media, we think reading banned books offers families a chance to celebrate reading and promotes open access to ideas, both of which are keys to raising a lifelong reader.\n\nWhy do people ban books? Often it\u2019s for religious or political reasons: An idea, a scene or a character in the book offends their religion, sense of morality or political view. Some folks feel they need to protect children from the cursing, morally offensive behavior or racially insensitive language in a book. Or they think a book\u2019s content is too violent or too sexual.\n\n[I don\u2019t censor the books my children read. I think they\u2019ll be stronger for it.]\n\nThe Civil War novel \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage\u201d has been banned for its graphic depictions of war. The edgy teen bestseller \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d has been banned for its descriptions of sexual behavior and alcohol and drug use. Profanity and an explicit scene featuring oral sex got \u201cLooking for Alaska\u201d on a banned list.\n\nWho is challenging these books? Parents, school board members, individuals, groups \u2014 yet what\u2019s considered offensive may depend on the era or specific community. As the ALA argues, these challenges pose a threat to freedom of speech and choice \u2014 freedoms Americans hold dear and are worth standing up for.\n\nHere are five good reasons for kids to read banned books:\n\nToday\u2019s edgy is tomorrow\u2019s classic. Original work pushes boundaries in topic, theme, plot and structure. What\u2019s shocking today may be assigned in English class five or 10 years from now if it has true literary merit. \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d is a high school staple today, but it was shocking when its gin-soaked pages were published in 1925.\n\nThere\u2019s more to a book than the swear words in it. Many books have been banned for language that your kid has encountered before or will encounter soon. Even potty humor (like in \u201cCaptain Underpants\u201d) has caused people to call for a ban. A character\u2019s language may add realism to the story, or it may seem gratuitous or distracting \u2014 your kids can make their own judgments.\n\nKids crave relatable books. Banned books often deal with subjects that are realistic, timely and topical. Young people may find a character going through exactly what they are, which makes it a powerful reading experience and helps the reader sort out thorny issues such as grief, divorce, sexual assault, bullying, prejudice and sexual identity. The compelling teen rebels story \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d has been banned, yet many middle-schoolers cite it as the book that turned them into readers.\n\nControversial books are a type of virtual reality. Exploring complex topics such as sexuality, violence, substance abuse, suicide and racism through well-drawn characters lets kids contemplate morality and vast aspects of the human condition, build empathy for people unlike themselves and possibly discover a mirror of their own experience. \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d is an eye-opening story of an African American family facing racism in 1930s Mississippi, yet it has been banned for having racial slurs.\n\nThey\u2019ll kick off a conversation. What did people find so disturbing in a book that they wanted to ban it, and to what extent was it a product of its time or did it defy social norms of its era? For example, the Harry Potter books were banned by people who felt they promoted magic. Reading a challenged book is a learning experience and can help your kids define their own values and opinions of its content.\n\nThis piece first ran at Common Sense Media.
