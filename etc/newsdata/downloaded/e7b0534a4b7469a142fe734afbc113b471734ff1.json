Razumilov, \"no longer wants to continue with the case\", she told reporters at the court.\n\nGusnieva said Razumilov faced pressure online after \"haters found his information\" and \"Apple supporters began to write to him\".\n\nHe decided not to go forward because he would have needed to attend forthcoming hearings.\n\nIn the original complaint, Razumilov claimed to have been turned gay after he ordered Bitcoins through an iPhone app but received a different currency called \"GayCoin\" with the note: \"Don't judge until you try.\"\n\nHe subsequently broke up with his girlfriend and began a relationship with a man which made him ashamed, Gusnieva said.\n\nHe had been initially seeking 1m rubles ($15 560) in damages from Apple.\n\nAn Apple representative at Thursday's hearing did not make any comments to the media.\n\nHomophobia is widespread in Russia where reports of rights violations and attacks on LGBT people are common, though there are gay scenes in major cities.\n\nMoscow in 2013 introduced a law against \"gay propaganda\", which officially bans the \"promotion of non-traditional lifestyles to minors\" but in effect outlaws LGBT activism.", "description": "A Russian man who filed a lawsuit against Apple after claiming an iPhone app turned him gay has withdrawn his complaint due to privacy fears, his lawyer says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9435/9508511262844ababacf26d466687831.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
