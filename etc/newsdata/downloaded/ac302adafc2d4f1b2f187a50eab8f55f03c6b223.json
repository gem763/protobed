(JBSS3.SA), due to alleged ties with the Venezuelan government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker spreads salted meat which will be dried and then packed at a plant of JBS S.A, the world's largest beef producer, in Santana de Parnaiba, Brazil December 19, 2017. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker\n\nSenators Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review transactions by JBS, which has bought several American meat companies in recent years, Rubio\u2019s press office tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis meat-processing conglomerate has engaged in illicit financial activities and has business ties with the Maduro regime,\u201d the Twitter post said.\n\nA JBS representative did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuela\u2019s Information Ministry also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s government has imposed sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials as well as state oil company PDVSA in an effort to remove Maduro, whom it accuses of fixing elections last year and abusing human rights in the oil-rich nation.\n\nIn August, Washington froze all Venezuelan state assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on any company continuing to do business with the government.\n\nThe senators said in their letter to Mnuchin - made public on Tuesday - that CFIUS should investigate the business transactions among JBS, the Venezuelan Corporation of Foreign Trade (CORPOVEX) and Diosdado Cabello, a powerful ally of Maduro who is under U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe senators did not provide any further details about the alleged transactions.\n\nThe senators said JBS had engaged in the bribery of public officials in Brazil to obtain funds to expand abroad, acquiring in recent years U.S. meat-packer Swift Foods Co and chicken producer Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp.\n\nBrothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, founders of JBS\u2019s holding company J&F, signed plea bargain and leniency deals in May 2017 in which they confessed to running a political bribery ring in Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe ask CFIUS conduct a review of JBS SA\u2019s acquisition of U.S. companies to assess the implications for security and safety of America\u2019s food supply and, in turn, our national security,\u201d the senators said in their letter.", "description": "Two U.S. senators called on the U.S. Treasury on Tuesday to open an investigation into the world's largest meat processing company, Brazil's JBS S.A. , due to alleged ties with the Venezuelan government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438627419&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971Y9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
