Human Rights Award", "language": "en", "text": "The European Parliament on Thursday awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Uyghur academic Ilham Tohti, currently serving a life sentence in China on charges of promoting \u201cseparatism\u201d in the northern region of Xinjiang.\n\nA former professor of economics at a Beijing university, Tohti was an outspoken critic of the Chinese communist regime\u2019s repression of the Uyghur minority. In 2014, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of advocating separatism, in a trial that provoked widespread condemnation from foreign governments and human rights organizations.\n\n\u201cTohti has dedicated his life to advocating for the rights of the Uyghur minority in China. Despite being a voice of moderation and reconciliation, he was sentenced to life in prison following a show trial in 2014,\u201d said EU Parliament President David Sassoli \u201cBy awarding this prize, we strongly urge the Chinese government to release Tohti and the respect of minority rights in China.\u201d\n\nPrior to his arrest in January 2014, Tohti founded and ran the UighurOnline website, which wrote in Uyghur and Chinese about issues facing the region\u2019s population. The EU notes that during his career, Tohti was a \u201cproponent of dialogue and advocate for the implementation of regional autonomy laws in China,\u201d while at the same time \u201cvoice of moderation and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nLast September, the 49-year-old academic also won another of Europe\u2019s top human rights awards, the Vaclav Havel prize, for \u201cgiving the entire Uighur people a voice.\u201d\n\nOver one million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have been detained by Chinese authorities across Xinjiang since 2017. They have consequently been placed in concentration camps aimed at indoctrinating them into the ideals of the Chinese communist regime, forcing them to disavow their allegiance to Islam, engaging in slave labor, receiving forced sterilization or birth control, and, some reports suggest, being used as live organ donors.\n\nBeijing vehemently disputes claims that the camps are intended as a repressive apparatus, insisting they are instead \u201cvoluntary de-radicalization camps\u201d and \u201cvocational training centers\u201d intended to integrate interns into Chinese society. They also argue the camps remain a necessary measure to fight terrorism following various Islamist inspired attacks over the past decades.\n\nThe award provoked fury from Beijing, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying telling a press briefing Friday that Europe had awarded a \u201cterrorist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that Europe can respect China\u2019s internal affairs and judicial sovereignty, and avoid celebrating a terrorist,\u201d said Hua. \u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly this prize is, what it\u2019s importance, value or impact are.\u201d\n\nThe Sakharov Prize is named after the Soviet physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov and has been awarded annually since 1988 to individuals who have fought for \u201chuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nOther nominees for the 2019 prize included Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, the Brazilian LGBT activist Jean Wyllys and the Restorers, a group of student app developers from Kenya.\n\nPrevious winners of the award have included the Pakistani schoolgirl and women\u2019s rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai (2013), Cuban dissident Guillermo Fari\u00f1as (2010) and two Yazidi women who escaped Islamic State (2016).\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The European Parliament on Thursday awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the Uyghur academic Ilham Tohti.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Tohti-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
