The boxes were rumored to have been transferred to a small sheriff\u2019s office in Geauga County, Ohio, but Mr. Dean was told he would need a court order if he ever hoped to see them. His collaborator on the project, a 50-year-old mother of three named April Balascio, thought she might have better luck.\n\n\u201cTurns out it\u2019s very helpful to have the daughter of the murderer on your reporting team,\u201d said Mr. Dean on the podcast, after describing how Ms. Balascio was able to gain access to material about her father\u2019s cases. The boxes held a gold mine for an audio story: 60 cassettes with recordings of Ms. Balascio\u2019s father, who died in 2011 while serving a life sentence for the five murders he admitted to after his daughter turned him in.\n\nEver since \u201cSerial\u201d set the Internet aflame in 2014, generating hundreds of millions of downloads and putting podcasting on the map, true crime has been a staple of the medium. But \u201cThe Clearing\u201d marks a departure from the typical audio whodunit, because the story is told from the perspective of Ms. Balascio. It was produced by Pineapple Street Media in collaboration with Gimlet Media. (The Wall Street Journal has a content partnership with Gimlet Media.)\n\nMs. Balascio, here at age 6 in the mid-\u201970s, wanted to debunk some of the outrageous claims about her father and draw attention to unsolved murders that she suspected he may have committed. Photo: April Balascio\n\n\u201cThe Clearing\u201d invites listeners to follow along on Ms. Balascio\u2019s journey, exploring how, in 2009, she confirmed her lifelong suspicion that her dad was a murderer and then, over the course of the podcast, reckoned with the long-term damage he wrought on the families of his victims. Along the way, she, Mr. Dean and co-producer Jonathan Menjivar traverse the country trying to link Edwards to cold cases in which he may have been implicated.\n\n\u201cKnowing that April wanted to be really involved, and part of the whole process, that\u2019s what made us say, \u2018We should definitely do this podcast,\u2019 \u201d says Jenna Weiss-Berman, co-founder of Pineapple Street Media. Although she had tended to steer clear of the true-crime genre, she felt that Ms. Balascio\u2019s personal connection to the story would \u201cset it apart from a lot of those \u201848 Hours\u2019-style mystery shows.\u201d The strategy paid off: The podcast has remained in iTunes\u2019 top 10 since it debuted in July, frequently spiking to No. 1 during its run through August.\n\nAs podcasting has grown up over the past five years, a handful of stories like \u201cThe Clearing,\u201d told by people who are part of the narratives they are spinning, have become hits. The No. 1 podcast on iTunes for much of the summer was Wondery\u2019s \u201cThe Shrink Next Door,\u201d in which journalist Joe Nocera tells the story of his former neighbor in the Hamptons, an unusual psychiatrist. In Pineapple Street\u2019s surprise hit \u201cMissing Richard Simmons,\u201d documentary maker Dan Taberski tried to find out what happened to the 1980s fitness icon, who was friendly with Mr. Taberski before vanishing from public life.\n\nFitness guru Richard Simmons, in New York in 2006, became the subject of a podcast after he disappeared from public life.

Owing to the intimate nature of podcasting, where the narrator speaks directly into listeners\u2019 ears, it\u2019s a natural place for what Wondery\u2019s chief operating officer Jen Sargent calls a \u201c \u2018Hey, can you believe this happened to me?\u2019 story.\u201d\n\nMs. Weiss-Berman has started asking people pitching podcast ideas to explain why the subject is important to them, and how they can incorporate that into the story. More than half of the seven podcasts that Pineapple Street plans to release next year will feature narrators with \u201ca very obvious connection\u201d to the stories they are telling.\n\nStill, having an involved narrator can be a challenge for producers who want to generate emotionally resonant content that isn\u2019t tinged with bias, or the perception of it. For \u201cThe Clearing,\u201d that meant having Mr. Dean, a magazine journalist, narrate the podcast while Ms. Balascio served as a frequent contributor and protagonist. Mr. Dean was rigorous about fact-checking Ms. Balascio\u2019s memories, visiting locations where she grew up and seeking supporting accounts to back up her suspicions. \u201cI was never going to assume that just because [Ms. Balascio] said something it was true,\u201d he says.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Why can a narrator with a personal connection to the story make a podcast compelling? What real-crime stories would you like to hear recounted in podcasts? Join the discussion below.\n\nMr. Dean met Ms. Balascio at an Ohio attorney\u2019s office in early 2016, when he was working on a magazine piece about her father, an under-the-radar serial killer who was rumored to have been involved with an array of murders ranging from JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey to Laci Peterson. At the time, Ms. Balascio was being contacted by various lawyers seeking her help in getting their clients\u2019 convictions overturned.\n\n\u201cAfter I sent an email to [convicted murderer] Scott Peterson\u2019s lawyer for the third time, I got in touch with Josh and said, \u2018I\u2019m finally ready to talk,\u2019 \u201d says Ms. Balascio, who wanted to debunk some of the outrageous claims about her dad. She also hoped to draw attention to unsolved murders that she suspected he may have committed. \u201cMy dad had become the boogeyman of all serial killers and it was driving me crazy,\u201d she says.\n\nThat meeting became a three-year partnership working on a story that she and Mr. Dean planned to tell in a magazine article or a co-written book. Ultimately, they chose neither. Mr. Dean felt that the lack of a clear ending, stemming from the still-unsolved cases, would make it an unsatisfying read. \u201cIt struck me that this might be a great subject for a podcast,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about podcasts: They don\u2019t need a perfect ending. \u201cAs long as the journey is fun and engaging you don\u2019t have to have it all wrapped up in a bow,\u201d Ms. Weiss-Berman says.\n\nMs. Balascio and Mr. Dean didn\u2019t solve any cold cases while making \u201cThe Clearing.\u201d But they did focus attention on some unsolved murders, raised interesting questions and formed friendships with the families of some victims. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep going\u2014this isn\u2019t over for me,\u201d says Ms. Balascio, who is writing a memoir. Thanks to the podcast, she recently received a credible tip about an unsolved murder that she\u2019s chasing down with the help of police.\n\n\u201cIf we solve a crime,\u201d Mr. Dean says, \u201cwe will for sure do another episode.\u201d\n\nCan You Believe This Happened to Me?\n\nPodcasts with a personal connection:\n\n\u201cThe Clearing\u201d (Pineapple Street Media/Gimlet)\n\nApril Balascio, an Ohio-based mother of three, describes how she figured out that her dad was a serial killer and crosses the country with journalist Josh Dean to investigate her father\u2019s crimes and their effect on victims\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cThe Shrink Next Door\u201d (Wondery)\n\nJoe Nocera, a columnist at Bloomberg, examines what was really going on with his former neighbor, a psychiatrist with some highly unorthodox methods.\n\n\u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d (Pineapple Street Media)\n\nFilmmaker Dan Taberski tries to find out what happened to fitness guru Richard Simmons, whose \u201cSlimmons\u201d classes he took regularly in Los Angeles before Mr. Simmons vanished from public life.\n\n\u201cSurviving Y2K\u201d (Pineapple Street Media)\n\nIn this follow-up to \u201cMissing Richard Simmons,\u201d Mr. Taberski examines the chaos surrounding the turn of the century, including a moving narrative about a Y2K-inspired transformation of his own life.\n\n\u201cOver My Dead Body: Joe Exotic\u201d (Wondery)\n\nJournalist Robert Moor tells the wild story of Joe Exotic, a rogue zoo proprietor he has been covering for years, and who was recently convicted of attempted murder.\n\nWrite to Rachel Dodes at rachel.dodes@wsj.com", "description": "A serial killer\u2019s daughter is among individuals adding a thrilling personal perspective to \u2018The Clearing\u2019 and other hit podcasts.", "authors": ["Rachel Dodes", "Rachel.Dodes Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107039/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
