The little film clips we post about ourselves. Our own mini reality shows. The window to our souls. The vehicle through which people can watch us, and we can watch them watching us, and they can watch us knowing that we know they\u2019re watching us, meaning everyone can keep tabs on who\u2019s watching who, and how quickly. I can\u2019t remember how we got to this point, but here we are and it\u2019s happening.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons people post IG stories. Maybe you look fit and need to share your perfectly contoured face with others. Maybe you are legally contracted and need to hit a certain number of swipe-ups to a fast fashion store from which you'd never actually buy anything yourself. Maybe you're feeding a small furry animal, and it feels right to share the experience. Or maybe you just want to check if the people you recently banged are still interested, so you upload something innocuous like a meme, and wait to scan the list for names.\n\nReally though \u2013 like your style of clothes and choice of haircut \u2013 the IG story is an extension of your identity. It lets people know exactly what sort of person you are; what you do behind closed doors, what your mates look like, what sort of food you eat, what you find funny. This is who we all are:\n\nCONSTANT SCREENSHOTS OF SONGS FROM SPOTIFY\n\n\u201cGuilty pleasure!\u201d you write, in the scrawly neon font, a few raised hand emojis over a screenshot of \u201cCircles\u201d by Post Malone. \u201cCompletely underrated!\u201d you write in the next clip, over an American hardcore album from 2005. \u201cFINALLY!!!\u201d you put in all caps, over some Cardi B that just came out. Stop screenshotting Spotify for one single second and just listen to the music. Either you aren\u2019t aware that no one cares, or you don\u2019t give a shit. See also: distant, blurry gig footage, inexplicably for about five videos people have to tap through.\n\nIN BED WITH A FACE MASK, CAMERA ZOOMING IN AND OUT ON YOUR OWN FACE\n\n'This isn\u2019t depression, this is self care!' you think to yourself, after spending the fifth consecutive night in a row in your bed with a face mask on, occasionally taking breaks from doing Buzzfeed quizzes and astrology deep dives to post yet another vid of you staring blank-faced into the camera void. If only you'd paid attention to the ingredients list and clocked that putting both parfum and glycolic acid on your face for five days running would wreak havoc on your skin for the next week.\n\nHOLIDAY PICS OF SUNNY BEACHES, A BOOMERANG OF YOU HOLDING A COCKTAIL SOMEWHERE (ITALY?), AEROPLANE WINDOW SHOTS\n\nYou are in your late twenties or thirties. You have a career, possibly own a dog. You seem content, almost as if you\u2026 have your life together? There is simply no other explanation as to why you use Insta stories in the way previous generations used disposable cameras.\n\nAN ONSLAUGHT OF MEMES\n\nWhat this says about you largely depends on the quality of memes. If you are just screenshotting whatever @poundlandbandit made that day, then fine, yes, you too like to have a laugh. If you are posting meme after meme of niche and funny material about depression, astrology and/or Communism then you are obviously a legend and the reason I haven\u2019t thrown my phone out the window.\n\nTHIRST TRAPS\n\nThere are endless types of thirst trap. The dewy, glowy no make-up ones. The casual, before bed, small amount of tit on display ones. The ones you take in the mirror just before you go out. Whatever the case, thirst traps are the best type of story because you\u2019re basically saying \u201clook how fit I am, give me attention\u201d and that\u2019s an existentially radical way to behave in a world that constantly makes us feel like shit.\n\nART GALLERY TRIPS, HEALTHY LOOKING PLANTS, A BLACK COFFEE NEXT TO A CASUALLY PLACED COPY OF THE ARGONAUTS BY MAGGIE NELSON\n\nYou are essentially who I think I could be if I wasn\u2019t always broke, borderline alcoholic and could be arsed.\n\nCONSTANT OVERSHARING ABOUT SEX, DRUGS, MENTAL HEALTH, MONEY, FAMILY\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping with this guy and he literally just msged to say he has herpes even though we\u2019re not poly WTFFFF??\u201d you write over a close up of your unimpressed face, before uploading screenshot after screenshot of the Whatsapp conversation, with annotations. When people reply, you upload those too, with hand clap emojis. You\u2019ve been this way your entire life, but the only difference is now technology has evolved enough for you to be able to do it constantly, without interruption, forever.\n\nRANDOM SHIT, LIKE A CLOSE UP OF A LEMON OR A DISCARDED TROLLEY AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD\n\nWe get it. You did Fine Art at Goldsmiths and don't like people.\n\nYOU SEEMINGLY ALWAYS AT THE CLUB\n\nThese stories always start off innocuously enough. A few mates on a sofa drinking cans. Maybe someone dancing to Lizzo on a kitchen chair as it approaches midnight. Fast forward six hours and the story bar at the top resembles a tiny row of ants. Every clip is bodies on a dancefloor, techno pumping in the background. It's the ones at the end which are truly haunting. There\u2019s a blurry pic of your flatmate\u2019s tit out. Is that someone doing coke, \u20182h\u2019 ago? It is now 9.12AM. I have no idea how you manage to hold down a job so you can afford to do this three times a week, at least.\n\nJUST PHOTOS AND VIDEOS OF YOUR DOG\n\nYou're a rare pure soul who doesn't need superficial validation to make yourself feel good \u2013 you just use IG stories for sharing the things you love, which is your dog. Occasionally you might post a pic of your roast dinner with \"YUM!\u201d written at the top, or some nice shells you found at the beach. It's semi annoying having to constantly swipe past yet another video of you throwing a ball at this little dribbling beast, but then I remember that the world is dying and you're just out here, enjoying life's simple pleasures.\n\n@daisythejones / @m.parszeniew", "description": "Another onslaught of screenshots from Spotify?
