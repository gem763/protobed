Party election posters have been torn down, allegedly by the pro-Makhado group.\n\nThe pro-Makhado group is boycotting the election because it wants the area to be returned to the Makhado municipality.\n\nResidents are divided over whether they should vote in the election.\n\n*Patricia Chauke (28) was surprised when asked if she was going to vote.\n\n\u201cHow do we vote when we have not registered? The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] was supposed to come and register us. We are still waiting for the IEC.\u201d\n\nChauke said she had not voted in her life.\n\n\u201cI feel like a foreigner in my own country. I think we should be allowed to participate in the elections.\u201d\n\nBut Graheim Ngobeni (25) said residents had been told by the pro-Makhado group not to participate in the elections.\n\n\u201cWe have been told that we are not going to vote. I am not going to vote because I don\u2019t know what will happen to me or my family if I defy them,\u201d he said, while puffing on a cigarette.\n\nIn Vyeboom village, next to the town of Vuwani, we meet *Sam Mukondeli (28), who said the pro-Makhado group had not given the community any proper explanation about why they should not vote.\n\n\u201cWe as the community want to vote. We have that spirit of voting. Voting is important to us. After elections there is a change.\u201d\n\nHe said the last time the pro-Makhado group consulted them was in 2016.\n\n\u201cThey have previously consulted us through mass meetings. This time around they are not even consulting us,\u201d Mukondeli said.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are saying we are going to vote because we have not been told or consulted that we are not going to vote.\u201d\n\nA traditional leader from Vyeboom village, Musanda Makhado, appeared surprised about the fuss over whether residents should vote or not.\n\n\u201cI want to vote for the president so that the issue of demarcation can be resolved. We are not voting for the local municipality,\u201d he said.\n\nMakhado, who was fetching kids from a cr\u00e8che in the area in his old battered white Nissan 1400, which has seen better days, said he had encouraged his subjects to vote in the election.\n\nA member of the pro-Makhado group said the decision to boycott the election was being imposed on the community.\n\n\u201cThe feeling on the ground is that people want to vote but those in the leadership are saying no.\n\n\u201cThere is no more proper engagement and consultation between the leadership and the constituency.\n\n\u201cSome members of the community are asking why they are not voting. Who are you going to call after May 8?\u201d\n\nIEC worries\n\nCity Press has learnt that the pro-Makhado group prevented the IEC from using schools in the Vuwani area during the registration period.\n\nAs a result, in some areas they registered only 40 voters. The IEC said there were three areas where not a single person registered to vote.\n\nThe number of voters in the Vuwani area registered to vote next month is estimated to be only 800.\n\nVoting stations in Vuwani featured high on the list of 650 hot spots countrywide during the municipal elections in 2016.\n\nLimpopo electoral officer Nkaro Mateta said school principals were being intimidated.\n\n\u201cThey would always say please go and talk to the task team. Schools can\u2019t be controlled by some task team.\n\n\u201cWe should talk to the school governing body and not a task team. The governing body is governor of that particular school and it should have a say on whether elections will happen in that school or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Arnold Mulaudzi, the pro-Makhado group deputy chairperson, gave the IEC a middle figure, saying the schools in Vuwani were built by their parents.\n\nMulaudzi said: \u201cThose are our schools. Even those schools which were burnt during the election were built by communities.\n\n\u201cThe community felt that since we are not participating in this election we will just have to keep our churches and schools closed.\u201d\n\nHe said by giving the IEC accommodation it would mean that the commission was welcome in the area.\n\n\u201cThey are not welcome. Our wish is that they don\u2019t even have to pitch here during election day.\u201d\n\nANC Vhembe regional secretary Anderson Mudunungu said the stance taken by the pro-Makhado group to boycott elections amounted to \u201cfoolishness\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople love their president comrade [Cyril] Ramaphosa and they want to vote for him. They are fooling themselves. We are going to campaign.\n\n\u201cDemarcation issues are issues that should be corrected by the government.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t want to vote, who is going to fix their issues?\u201d\n\nHe said Vuwani residents were now writing to Collins Chabane municipality demanding services.\n\n\u201cThe place has become filthy and there are children and old people,\u201d Mudunungu said.\n\nAnother concern for the IEC was that communities in Mokopane, Moletsi, Makotopong and Tubatse had also threatened to boycott the elections.\n\nCommunities there were enraged because they said the government had failed to fulfil promises made last time around.\n\n\u201cWe have explained to them whatever issues they want to raise they must direct them to the relevant government departments. The IEC is just here to promote democracy and run elections,\u201d Mateta said.\n\nShe warned that unless the government acted on some of the things that communities were raising, the IEC would not be able to run free and fair elections.\n\n\u201cThere will be threats on the ground and people might not fully participate in elections. Please communicate with these communities and advise them when they should expect that road or water.\u201d\n\nThirty-four political parties are contesting in the Limpopo province compared with 20 parties which contested in the last election.\n\nVBS scandal\n\nAbout 40km from Vuwani lies Thohoyandou in the Thulamela municipality where VBS had most clients.\n\nA security guard at the VBS branch in Thohoyandou told City Press that clients still visited the bank.\n\n\u201cSome come to pay their bonds and for their cars,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen City Press visited the branch there was just one consultant helping a couple. The ATM machines were not working.\n\nA VBS minority shareholders\u2019 forum convened a meeting at the Thohoyandou-based Black Leopards FC offices to discuss how to recover the funds from the collapsed bank.\n\nThe meeting, which lasted for more than three hours, was attended mostly by the elderly. Many of them said they had invested funds ranging from R10 000 to R10 million.\n\nOne of the clients, who referred to herself only as Mummy, said she invested R500 000 with the bank but got out only R100 000.\n\nShe said she would still vote for the ANC whether they recovered their monies or not.\n\n\u201cThe ANC is our organisation. It is the organisation of Nelson Mandela. What if we vote for other sharks and they come and steal our money?\u201d\n\nAnother client said many people had lost interest in the election.\n\n\u201cWe feel let down by the ANC. Up until today those who have stolen our money have not been arrested,\u201d the client said.\n\nLast month creditors submitted their claims to the Master of the High Court in Polokwane in a bid to recover money owed to them.\n\nThis came after the SA Reserve Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority had issued an application in the Pretoria High Court for VBS to be finally wound up in November last year.\n\nVBS was placed under curatorship on March this year because of a serious \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d. The initial findings of the curator revealed significant financial losses in VBS.\n\nVBS minority shareholders\u2019 forum chairperson Aubrey Mulaudzi said they wanted an independent liquidator to be appointed.\n\n\u201cThe curator with the Reserve Bank wanted to appoint the same curator who was doing curatorship in the bank. We disagreed with them. He can\u2019t be a referee and a player. We say he can\u2019t be a curator and a liquidator,\u201d Mulaudzi said.\n\nThe forum had appointed lawyers to represent it in the VBS fight in court.\n\nThe Prudential Regulation Authority was said to favour Anoosh Rooplal, who led the VBS curatorship to be appointed as a liquidator.\n\nThe collapse of VBS had a devastating effect on poor rural communities. Now, there were fears in the ANC ranks that the VBS scandal might harm the party at the polls.\n\nMatome Moremi, ANC Youth League deputy provincial secretary, admitted that the scandal had caused huge damage to the ANC.\n\n\u201cWe must not underestimate it and think it will not matter. But we made some strides to try to correct it in the ANC. We have fired people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe youth league in the province was the first to call for action against ANC leaders implicated in the VBS scandal.\n\nMoremi said it was possible that voters would think about how they lost their money before they cast their votes.\n\n\u201cIt has affected our voters. These are the people who are supposed to vote for the ANC.\u201d\n\nTribalism fear\n\nThe province has always had undercurrents of tribalism between the Pedi-, Venda- and Tsonga ethnic groups.\n\nBefore the first democratic general elections in 1994, the province included the Lebowa, Venda and Gazankulu homelands, which were designed along ethnicity.\n\nWhen the ANC came into power, it tried to unify the province.\n\nBut, a new wave of tribalism was brewing, some of it blamed on the new municipal demarcations.\n\nThe call for a female premier to replace the incumbent Stanley Mathabatha had also heightened tribal divisions, with those supporting former Vhembe district mayor Florence Radzilani, arguing that the province had not had a Venda premier.\n\nMathabatha said whether a premier was Pedi, Venda or Tsonga mattered to some people.\n\n\u201cTo me it does not. But, to some people it does. I don\u2019t know why. I feel that you need to appoint a person as a premier if that person has got the necessary credentials,\u201d Mathabatha told City Press.\n\nHe said ethnicity was a social problem not only in the province but internationally.\n\nANC Youth League deputy provincial secretary Moremi echoed similar sentiments, saying: \u201cIt does not matter to us whether a premier is a Pedi, Tsonga or Venda as long as it is a capable person who can take the province forward.\u201d\n\nThe youth league had resolved that Mathabatha continue as the premier after the election.\n\nMoremi said: \u201cThis is so that we are able to groom nicely any other successor regardless whether that person is a womanor Pedi. He had to correct many things that were wrong whenhe got in.\u201d\n\nThe DA-led coalition\n\nThe DA-led Modimolle/Mookgophong municipality, which was placed under administration by the provincial government last year because it was technically bankrupt, was spending close to R16 million on salaries a month.\n\nIt had been governed by coalition governments since the ANC failed to get 50% in the municipal elections in 2016.\n\nThe DA, with the EFF and the Freedom Front Plus, voted for a DA mayor, Marlene van Staden.\n\nThe municipality\u2019s financial woes were compounded by the fact that when Modimolle and Mookgophong municipalities were amalgamated after municipal elections, some positions were duplicated.\n\nIn the beginning the Modimolle/Mookgophong municipality had two municipal managers, a pair of chief financial officers and many technical managers.\n\nThis meant that the municipality had to pay twice for the same position.\n\nVan Staden told City Press that the resultant huge salary bill had put a financial burden on the municipality.\n\n\u201cI say in every meeting for all the needs that you guys are listing I wish I had money. I had to prioritise basic things.\n\n\u201cMy largest expense in the municipality was salaries. People get angry when they hear that we have a very large salary bill.\n\n\u201cThe two former municipalities each had a full staff complement and they were just amalgamated to one municipality. We are not allowed to retrench anybody. No salaries were decreased. We were double parked in nearly all our positions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t how many municipalities in South Africa have money. But we are definitely not one of them. We are struggling.\u201d\n\nAlthough coalition governments had never been perfect, Van Staden said, political parties had decided to put politics aside and deliver basic services to the people.\n\nThe DA had often been criticised for forming a coalition with the EFF. There was an ideological chasm \u2013 including the expropriation of land without compensation \u2013 between the two parties.\n\nVan Staden said: \u201cOnce you are here you are actually not here for politics. You are actually just here for basic service delivery.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to give people water, electricity, pick up rubbish, clean parks and things like that. We are not supposed to be playing politics.\u201d\n\nShe asserted that EFF councillors stayed with the people and knew when there were water and electricity problems.\n\nContinuing the fight\n\nIn extension 12, an informal settlement which the EFF claimed it had created, residents complained about lack of water, electricity, roads and jobs.\n\nSeveral residents told City Press that EFF leader Julius Malema was the only leader who could take them to a place of \u201choney and milk\u201d.\n\nMaria Matlatsi (49) called on Malema to continue fighting for them.\n\n\u201cInitially the ANC wanted to sell stands for us here. We were elated when EFF leaders told us to come and stay here for free,\u201d said Matlatsi, who works as a security guard.\n\nEFF provincial chairperson Jossey Buthane said the party had stood by its actions, words and commitments.\n\n\u201cWe said that we will give people land and we have given some a portion of land,\u201d Buthane said.\n\n\u201cPeople are staying in Malema View in Bela-Bela, extension 12 in Modimolle and some other parts of the province. That is because of the EFF contribution. That we have done without us being in government.\u201d\n\nButhane said: \u201cHere in Limpopo when people are in trouble they come to the EFF. We have done our part. It is now left to the citizens of Limpopo to play their part properly in the general elections next month. If they don\u2019t play it properly they must not cry.\n\n*Not their real names", "description": "Financial scandals at the now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank, long-standing tribal issues, and unrest in Vuwani and Modimolle-Mookgophong local municipality are matters confronting potential voters in Limpopo.", "authors": ["Ngwako Modjadji"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8626/f36a72be4fb344b3a9a110d027b1f962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
