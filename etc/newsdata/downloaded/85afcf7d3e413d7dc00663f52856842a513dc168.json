Fold out steps are incorporated in the grill section below the door\n\nThe concept's design was inspired by U.S. streamliner trains that ran from 1936 until 1959 and were a prime example of Art Deco industrial design.

Hyundai will start exploring opportunities in the United States commercial vehicle market\n\nEdward Lee Head of Hyundai Commercial Vehicle Business Division said: 'Today at this show, by showing HDC-6 Neptune, the first hydrogen-only concept for Hyundai Motor Company's commercial vehicles, we will start exploring opportunities in the United States commercial vehicle market.\n\n'Furthermore, we are willing to work with other partners to pave the way to establish a hydrogen ecosystem for CV (commercial vehicles).
