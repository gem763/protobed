When he is cheated out of his opportunity to meet his idol, Moose's actions begin to take a dangerous turn.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC at Cannes last year, Travolta said: \"Moose was one of my best experiences. Fred Durst is stunningly gifted as a director and as a human being he was capable of communicating differently from anyone else.\n\n\"I loved Moose; it's phenomenal. Moose is an eccentric special needs character who's obsessed with a movie star. I can't describe how special this character is; he's one of my favourite characters I've ever played. I loved working with Fred.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMost critics could not summon up Travolta's enthusiasm, however.\n\nRex Reed, writing in Observer in the US, described the film as \"a disaster\", while the Chicago Sun-Times critic, Richard Roeper, wrote: \"This drifts into the category of campy oddity, leaving us once again waiting and hoping for John Travolta to find his next great part.\"\n\nThe New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski wrote: \"Travolta, earnest but ridiculous, spends his time furiously rocking back and forth and bellowing to the heavens.\n\nHe continued: \"I'll give Travolta this: He commits. This is not a flattering project for him, and the actor is obviously deeply invested in the material. He produced it. But he needs a director who will tell him to rein it in.\"\n\nWall Street Journal's John Anderson was more impressed though: \"One can understand the draw of The Fanatic for someone like Mr Travolta: It calls for full immersion, mentally and physically. And he pulls it off.\"\n\nStar cast\n\nThe Fanatic is only playing in a small number of cinemas before being made available on premium video-on-demand (VOD) on 6 September.\n\nEven still, the film is faring worse than Travolta's other recent releases, In A Valley of Violence (2016) and Killing Season (2013), both of which were also dual theatrical/VOD titles.\n\nIn A Valley of Violence, which co-starred Ethan Hawke, took $29,343 from 33 cinemas on its first weekend, eventually making just $53,647.\n\nKilling Season, co-starring Robert De Niro, took a similar amount, with a final tally of $53,646.\n\nTravolta's last film, Gotti, had a traditional release but that only took a total of $4.3m (\u00a33.6m) domestically.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
