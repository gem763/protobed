They were joined on stream by a monkey. The monkey threw up on a developer.\n\nFor most of the stream, Antonio the spider monkey seemed content to sit on people\u2019s shoulders and eat mealworms thrown to him by his handler. He seemed like a chill monkey, and his handler said that he\u2019s very relaxed around humans. He took a particular liking to developer Rare\u2019s video manager Jon McFarlane, who was sitting on the far right.\n\nAs senior producer Joe Stevens joined the stream to go over the features that are being added to the game along with pets, Antonio the spider monkey hopped over to McFarlane\u2019s shoulder and threw up on his face, chest and arm.\n\nHe then jumped to McFarlane\u2019s other shoulder to throw up some more. \u201cA great choice to wear a grey t-shirt,\u201d McFarlane said after he cleaned his now monkey puke-stained shirt with a napkin. Check it out in the video below at around 27:46.\n\nYou know when you see something and you think, \u201cThey must have prepared for a particular scenario that is very likely to happen,\u201d and then they just haven\u2019t, like that kid trying to cut open an apple with a samurai sword next to an inflatable pool? The people involved must have known something would go wrong, but no one stopping it makes it all the funnier. \u201cThat is what we expected to happen,\u201d one of the developers even says as everyone smiles politely through the situation.\n\nWild animals do not give a shit about human decorum, and monkeys, who are especially smart, love to fuck with people. I love this clip and will cherish it forever. Hopefully Rare picks up McFarlane\u2019s dry-cleaning bill.", "description": "Today some Sea of Thieves developers did a livestream to discuss the game\u2019s new store and purchasable pets.
