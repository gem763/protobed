Presented by the National Cannabis Roundtable\n\nWelcome to the POLITICO Pro Cannabis preview newsletter. Free access to the preview newsletter is available through Sept. 30, 2019.\n\nQuick Fix\n\n\u2014 Criminal justice reform is the tipping point for cannabis legislation on Capitol Hill right now, and it\u2019s playing a huge role in whether a bill to help provide banking to cannabis businesses will get a floor vote this fall.\n\n\u2014 Cannabis lobbying is booming in Washington. A record 116 groups hired lobbyists to make their case to Congress and federal agencies on marijuana- and cannabis-related issues in the second quarter of 2019.\n\n\u2014 Former House Speaker John Boehner told POLITICO why he got involved with cannabis. The Ohio Republican raised eyebrows last year when he joined the board of cannabis company Acreage Holdings, despite being a staunch foe of legalization during his legislative career. Boehner said his views shifted after concluding that marijuana can have significant therapeutic benefits for patients.\n\nA message from the National Cannabis Roundtable: The National Cannabis Roundtable advances 21st century cannabis policy in the United States. We advocate for common sense federal regulation, tax equity, financial services reform, social justice and support changing federal law to acknowledge states\u2019 rights to regulate and manage their own cannabis policies.

Drop me a line with your tips and feedback: nfertig@politico.com or @natsfert. Share event listings: cannabiscalendar@politicopro.com. And follow us on Twitter: @POLITICOPro.\n\nOur Mission\n\nThis newsletter launches at a historic moment for marijuana and cannabis policy. Marijuana is legal on some level in 33 states but illegal at the federal level, creating a bewildering and complex web of legal, regulatory and business questions that even the most expert policy makers and lawyers struggle to answer.\n\nThis newsletter offers a sneak preview of what we will do for our Pro subscribers starting next month. Our mission for Pro readers is to cover these policy issues with passion and expertise, to deliver exclusive news and analysis, and to report on cannabis from a neutral, unbiased point of view. We come to this issue with no pre-cooked narrative about what should happen on cannabis policy. Our stories will focus on what POLITICO Pro does best: explaining policy issues and the politics behind them and delivering the news in an easy to digest format so that you can use our content to make business decisions.\n\nDriving the Day\n\nTHE CONVERSATION IN CONGRESS \u2014 A comprehensive legalization bill called the MORE Act was introduced right before the break by powerful Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). Before its introduction, though, another bill that would provide banking services to the cannabis industry in states with legal markets passed through committee and was due to have a vote on the House floor \u2013\u2013 but stalled because of its lack of criminal justice reform language.\n\nNow, with two marijuana bills queued up, lawmakers and advocates are hashing out timing. Some don\u2019t want to move the banking bill until a bill with criminal justice reform and social equity clears the House, while others think moving the bill with the best chance of passing in the Senate is a better use of time and resources.\n\n\u2014 MORE VS. SAFE: The MORE Act includes comprehensive social equity and criminal justice reform plans while the SAFE Banking Act does not. That is making all the difference right now. As we enter the fall term, the questions looming: Should the MORE Act be pushed through the House before the SAFE Banking Act, despite the latter\u2019s better chance of passing the Senate? Or is MORE\u2019s introduction enough to allow SAFE to finally move to the House floor?\n\n\u2014 Why do we care? Criminal justice reform is now a do-or-die element of cannabis legislation in the House. The fact that it is even slowing down the progress of a single-issue bill that deals with banking further enshrines the importance of social equity and criminal justice reform plans in any cannabis bill introduced from here on out.\n\nRead our full fall preview.\n\nLobby Watch\n\nNORML'S ANNUAL LOBBYING EVENT STARTS TODAY, bringing cannabis industry members and advocates from all over the country to Capitol Hill to meet with members of Congress. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden speaks this afternoon at the legalization advocacy group\u2019s annual conference. NORML isn\u2019t the only game in town:\n\nPOLITICO Pro DataPoint\n\nSubscribers of POLITICO Pro Cannabis will have access to exclusive cannabis policy explainer graphics. Check out a sample graphic: Federal cannabis lobbying continues to surge in 2019.\n\nMovers and Shakers\n\nEXCLUSIVE: FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER DISCUSSES EVOLUTION ON MARIJUANA \u2014 Former Speaker of the House John Boehner is an unlikely pot activist. During a more than three-decade career on Capitol Hill, including four turbulent years leading the House, the Ohio Republican was a staunch opponent of legalizing marijuana. But last year Boehner joined the board of Acreage Holdings, one of the country\u2019s largest cannabis companies. POLITICO Pro Cannabis recently spoke with Boehner about his new role as a marijuana advocate and the prospects for passing legislation on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhy get involved in the cannabis industry?\n\nBoehner: My whole part of this is on the medical side. You've got veterans that have all kinds of needs that aren't being met with what's out there. You've got people with anxiety issues or sleep issues. You\u2019ve got other people with chronic pain issues. I started doing all this research and I decided, I'm going to get involved in this. I knew when I came out, that was going to be a statement and make news, but I'm really glad I did it. It's been frankly an exciting last year and a half, to be involved in an industry that's emerging as the biggest new growth industry in America.\n\nYou were not a supporter of legalization during your tenure in the House. Some people would look at this and [say] that you're just looking to cash in. What's your response to that?\n\nBoehner: I know myself. My primary purpose for getting involved in this was to advance the cause of medical marijuana. Yes, I do get paid. I am on the board of Acreage Holdings. But I know what my motivations are, and I've tried to make that clear. I can understand why some people would look at it and say, \u201cOh, you're just cashing in.\u201d They\u2019re entitled to their opinion.\n\nHow do you view the landscape on Capitol Hill right now? What are the prospects in this current Congress for getting any kind of cannabis legislation passed?\n\nBoehner: When you look at how public opinion has changed dramatically on this issue over the years, more and more members are hearing from their constituents about the need to get the federal government out of the way. You have a lot of Democrats who were already there. But many Republicans are starting to come on board, as they see this dichotomy between what's going on in their own states and how the federal government continues to stand in the way.\n\nThe State of Marijuana\n\nD.C. ENACTS PATIENT PROTECTIONS \u2014 The D.C. Council enacted a temporary measure late last week banning the local government from firing individuals who are medical marijuana patients.\n\nWhy this is important: In 2015, Colorado medical marijuana patient Brandon Coats sued the Dish Network for wrongful termination after failing a random drug test. The case made it to the Colorado Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled against Coats because marijuana was still illegal at the federal level.\n\nSince then, state and even federal courts around the country increasingly have been ruling in favor of patients in employment cases. A county employee in Oregon who lost his job over medical marijuana use was reinstated and even got $22,000 in back pay in arbitration.\n\nMARIJUANA IN MISSISSIPPI \u2014 Advocates have collected more than 100,000 signatures to put medical marijuana legalization on the 2020 ballot. The campaign needs at least 86,185 signatures certified by the Secretary of State\u2019s office to put Initiative 65 to the voters.\n\nCalifornia was the first state to legalize medical marijuana at the ballot box in 1996. Now, the issue has become palatable even in socially conservative states. Arkansas and Louisiana both have medical marijuana programs, while Alabama has convened a panel to study legalization. In 2018, Oklahoma voters passed one of the least restrictive medical marijuana initiatives in the country.\n\nOFFICIALS EXPECT LEGAL WEED IN KENTUCKY \u2014 Democratic state Rep. Nima Kulkarni said most Kentuckians support marijuana legalization and expects the Bluegrass state to eventually legalize the substance. While the state is home to a flourishing hemp program, it has yet to change its marijuana laws. But medical marijuana legalization bill HB 136 racked up 52 co-sponsors in the last legislative session and advanced in committee \u2014 a first for any sort of medical marijuana legislation in the state.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n$600,000: That\u2019s the amount in bribes that Fall River, Mass. Mayor Jasiel Correia is accused of taking from pot companies. Correia was arrested and charged with bribery, extortion, wire fraud, and more on Friday. Three individuals with ties to Correia took plea deals.\n\n150: That\u2019s the number of students enrolled in the University of Maryland\u2019s first-of-its-kind marijuana master\u2019s program.\n\n89: That\u2019s the number of doctors in Florida who certified more than 168,000 medical marijuana patients.\n\nAround the World\n\nFIRST NATIONS HOLDS CANNABIS CONFERENCE \u2014 The Canadian Assembly of First Nations held its first cannabis conference last week to give voice to indigenous communities feeling left out of the legal industry. Native American tribes in the U.S. feel similarly frustrated by cannabis regulators.\n\nTHE CANNTRUST CONTROVERSY DEEPENS \u2014 Staffers at the Canadian cannabis producer bought marijuana seeds from the black market, and the resulting 1,000-plus cannabis plants were sold on the legal market, BNN Bloomberg reports. The company\u2019s former VP of cultivation Brady Green allegedly led the illicit initiative with a team known as \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d\n\nPot-Pourri\n\n\u2014 Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have developed a prototype marijuana breathalyzer, NPR reports. They say it\u2019s ready for mass production, but there\u2019s only one problem: We still don\u2019t know how much THC correlates with impairment.\n\n\u2014 Discussions about changing rules regarding cannabis in the NFL may be premature, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe have a lot more opinion than we do science on the use of marijuana for pain,\u201d said Allen Sills, the NFL\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\n\u2014 Colombia is now exporting medical marijuana to the U.K. and Canada, NPR reports. This adds another nation to the global marijuana trade \u2014 which so far has mostly remained medical, in order to be compliant with the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.\n\nA message from the National Cannabis Roundtable: The cannabis boom in America is real and growing. A diverse group of patients, veterans, bankers, law enforcement officers and many others supporting cannabis reform demonstrates a fundamental shift in our culture. 93 percent of Americans support cannabis marijuana reform and a strong majority support adult use. There are billions of dollars in new tax revenues on the line. There is the promise of almost a million jobs. New medical research gives hope to suffering patients. It\u2019s vital that politicians respond to the overwhelming public sentiment for cannabis reform. The National Cannabis Roundtable seeks to educate policymakers and advocate for legislative change at the federal level and unlock the potential of this dynamic new industry.
