He asked that his last name not be used to protect his identity.\n\nThe Reuters reporter did not mention the overwhelming evidence that the arrival of more foreign workers reduces the wages of Americans\u2019 blue-collar and white-collar workers. The process, which is described as the \u201cLaw of Supply and Demand\u201d to first-year economics students, reduces wages if employers can hire cheaper workers from poor countries.\n\nIn contrast, wages for Americans tend to rise when there is a \u201cTight Labor Market.\u201d In a tight labor market, employers must compete for American workers by offering higher wages, better working conditions, and benefits such as training and flexible hours.\n\nInvestor/lobbyists complain that Trump is reducing the no. of invited refugees from 30K in 2019 to 18K in 2020. These complaints are cheap & easy, but do show how biz fights to maximize $$$ by maximizing the delivery of cheap workers/ consumers/ renters. https://t.co/1OKBENwfUn \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 30, 2019\n\nIn recent years, Democrats, establishment Republicans, and many media outlets have preferred to urge more foreign workers \u2014 including H-2B and H-1B visa workers \u2014 than to urge wage raises for Americans.\n\nReuters admits that employers already hire illegal foreign workers and suggests that they minimize their legal risk by renting equipment to other companies, which may hire illegals:\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we don\u2019t ask,\u201d said Lorena, a Mexican immigrant whose family has built up a small oil field services business. She estimated that more than 90% of her employees were Mexican immigrants and that only 5% to 10% had genuine working papers. Her last name was not used to protect her identity. [Johnny] Vega\u2019s labor woes are pushing him to reorient his oil well service business toward hiring out his equipment.\n\nRead the Reuters article here.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.\n\nBut the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.\n\nThis policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThe federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy.\n\nThe Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.", "description": "Oil companies are raising more Americans' wages because President Donald Trump has tightened immigration enforcement, reports Reuters.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/oil-rig-workers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
