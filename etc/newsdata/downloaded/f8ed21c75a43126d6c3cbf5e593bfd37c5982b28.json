REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nThe increase in national sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1 is seen as crucial for fixing the industrial world\u2019s heaviest public debt at more than twice the size of Japan\u2019s economy.\n\nBut some analysts worry the twice-delayed tax hike could tip the world\u2019s third-largest economy into recession, underscoring the challenge for the central bank to sustain growth and accelerate inflation towards its 2% inflation target.\n\nWednesday\u2019s data is among key indicators to be scrutinised by the Bank of Japan, which holds its two-day policy review that ends on Thursday when it issues its quarterly projections of economy and prices.\n\nThe BOJ may hold off on loosening policy at its review as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save its limited ammunition.\n\nRetail sales in September jumped 9.1% from a year earlier, boosted by a 16.9% increase in car sales, and household durables such as refrigerators, computers and TV, and cosmetics, food and clothing, trade ministry data showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe surge in spending ahead of the sales tax hike bodes ill for fourth-quarter private consumption, some analysts say, although it may help push up economic growth in the last quarter.\n\n\u201cThe data released today suggests that private consumption may have risen by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter,\u201d Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, said.\n\n\u201cThe risks to our forecast of a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter drop in consumption in the fourth quarter are probably tilted to the downside.\u201d\n\nThe retail sales reading handily beat a 6.9% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll, posting the fastest annual growth since March 2014 when retail sales jumped 11% one month before the previous tax hike.\n\nSeasonally-adjusted retail sales grew 7.1% month-on-month in September, the data showed.\n\nThe trade ministry raised its assessment of retail sales to describe it as increasing.\n\nBut it added that it must stay vigilant to consumer sentiment after the tax hike and monitor any effects a recent slew of natural disasters may have on the economy.\n\nThe previous tax hike to 8% from 5% triggered a deep slump in private consumption and the broader economy as a big pull-back in demand followed the last-minute buying by consumers ahead of the hike.\n\nPolicymakers maintain that such a big swing in demand has not occurred this time round, given the smaller extent of the tax hike and various government measures to ease the burden of higher costs, such as shopping vouchers and other incentives.", "description": "Japanese retail sales grew at the strongest pace in 5-1/2 years in September as consumers rushed to buy big-ticket items to beat a rise in the country's sales tax, raising concerns spending could pull back sharply in the coming months.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446359641&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T028", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
