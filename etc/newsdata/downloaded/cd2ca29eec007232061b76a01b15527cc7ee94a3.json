The 27-year-old was challenging Red Stars defender Sarah Gorden from behind when she planted her right foot atop Gorden's cleat and rolled her ankle.\n\nCrystal Dunn arrived at postgame media availability in a boot. Erin Donnery\n\nDunn stayed on her feet and took a few steps before grabbing at her leg and lowering herself to the turf. After receiving a few minutes of medical attention on the field, she made her way over to the closest sideline and called it quits for the remainder of the contest.\n\nThe notoriously tough player has rarely taken time away from the pitch to nurse an injury over the course of her career. In fact, during this weekend's festivities leading up to the NWSL title game, Dunn said as much while describing her exhaustion from balancing national team and Courage responsibilities this year.\n\n\"It's a blessing to be healthy, but I will say I've been healthy going on four years,\" she said. \"And I have not had a rest in four years I feel like.\"\n\nAlthough the 2020 NWSL season doesn't kick off for many months, the USWNT is scheduled to take on rival Sweden \u2014 who knocked out the red, white, and blue in the 2016 Olympic semifinal \u2014 in Columbus, Ohio, November 7 before traveling to Jacksonville, Florida, to face Costa Rica three days later.\n\nGiven that Dunn arrived at Sunday's postgame media availability donning a boot on her right foot, it appears as though the USWNT may have to play its final friendlies of the year without its starting left-back. It'll be one of many challenges facing whoever US Soccer selects to replace Jill Ellis at the front of the bench heading into an Olympic year. The federation is set to announce its decision Monday, but reports from various outlets has indicated it will be NWSL coach of the year and Seattle Reign front man Vlatko Andonovski.", "description": "The North Carolina Courage striker later arrived at media availability donning a boot on her right foot.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db66cdcdee01905d9081993?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
