Subscribe now to see what\u2019s happening in right-wing media from the safety of your inbox.\n\nRight-wing personality Jacob Wohl appears to have faked death threats against himself and submitted them to police as evidence that he was facing \u201cterroristic threats,\u201d according to newly released documents.\n\nWohl and fellow provocateur Laura Loomer went to Minneapolis last month to \u201cinvestigate\u201d whether their quest to prove that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) married her own brother\u2014a charge based on flimsy blog comments that has been disproven.\n\nWohl\u2019s videos to his fans were premised on the idea that Minneapolis is an incredibly dangerous place, and often featured him wearing a bulletproof vest. At one point in a new video about their trip, Wohl goes to a Minneapolis police station to report death threats he says he and his team have received since being in the city.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Right Richter See what's happening with the extreme right wing from the safety of your inbox.

Now.\u201d\n\nBut @Drakehomes612 isn\u2019t a real account. As journalist Tony Webster first noticed, @Drakehomes612 is one of the fake accounts Wohl created in the run-up to his Twitter ban. A source familiar with Wohl\u2019s fake accounts confirmed to me that @Drakehomes612 was run by Wohl before being deleted by Twitter. That means Wohl was sending himself fake death threats, presumably in an attempt to up the drama during his Minneapolis videos.\n\nWohl submitted the faked messages to police as proof that he was facing \u201cterroristic threats\u201d via Twitter. The faked messages threatening to \u201cshit on your fucking bodies\u201d were included in a packet of police documents related to the case issued on Wednesday by the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Wohl\u2019s first brush with controversy. In 2017, he became the youngest person to receive a lifetime ban from futures trading. Last year, he was involved in a scheme to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller with sexual assaults allegations. Months later, the accuser Wohl had lined up told USA Today that Wohl had made all of the allegations up.\n\nLoomer, who didn\u2019t go to the police station, said she wasn\u2019t involved in the report. Wohl didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. But he\u2019s already lost one of his top allies on the right.\n\nActivist Ali Alexander, who organized Wohl\u2019s trip to Minneapolis and went with him to the police station, posted a video early Wednesday morning trying to distance himself from Wohl. Alexander claims that Wohl showed the faked direct messages to the police.\n\nIn the documentary, Alexander compares Wohl to both Batman and Iron Man. But now, he\u2019s backing away fast, saying Wohl may be a \u201cbad actor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but man, it doesn\u2019t involve me, and I\u2019m pretty excited about that,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nAlexander went on to suggest that his issue with Wohl isn\u2019t that he lied, but that he did it in a clumsy way.\n\n\u201cIt confirms that he\u2019s not operating at a level where there\u2019s useful misinformation, but kind of stupid, vanity-filled, ego-fueled disinformation,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAnd that won\u2019t look good for Jacob.\u201d\n\nAlexander distanced himself further from Wohl in an interview with The Daily Beast on Wednesday. Alexander, whose name is also on the police report, said he didn\u2019t know whether or not Wohl faked the messages. But he said he\u2019d be happy to work with police if they decide to investigate Wohl.\n\n\u201cIf they do, I can\u2019t wait to cooperate,\u201d Alexander said.", "description": "One came from a phony account the wingnut provocateur created and ran just before he was banned from Twitter.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1552491924/190313-Sommer-Jacob-Wohl-tease_zpag4w"}
