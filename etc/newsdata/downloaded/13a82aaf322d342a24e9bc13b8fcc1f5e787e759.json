And now, approaching the one-year anniversary of the ceremony, the couple is opening up about their fantasy-themed, costume-heavy, falconry-inclusive big day.\n\nSEE IT: ASOS MOCKED FOR INCLUDING 'SEE-THROUGH' JUMPSUIT IN BRIDAL SECTION\n\n\"It was the wedding of my dreams, and I'm so lucky to be surrounded by people who supported my vision and to have a husband who is just as passionate about fantasy as I am,\u201d said Etz, who works as an accounting clerk, to SWNS.\n\nEtz and Mansen, from Solna, Sweden, first met Oct. 2014 and bonded over a shared love of author J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s works. In fact, Etz was wearing a replica of \u201cThe One Ring\u201d on their first date, which Mansen, a fantasy author himself, noticed right away.\n\n\"Ferenc was obsessed with my very long hair, and from day one, he started calling me 'his own Elven Princess,\u2019\u201d she told SWNS.\n\nWATCH: COUPLE SURPRISES WEDDING GUESTS WITH SECRET FLASH MOB PERFORMANCE\n\nThe two were engaged in 2016. During their relationship, Mansen introduced Etz to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (she hadn\u2019t been watching) and the two adopted a cat they named \u201cKalisi,\u201d after a character on the show (an honorific title which, it should be noted, is actually spelled \u201cKhaleesi\u201d in the books).\n\nNaturally, it only made sense for the two to theme their wedding after their fantastical interests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nOn the big day, both Etz and Mansen wore clothes inspired by the elves from \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d and guests were allowed to dress as any character from their beloved fantasy franchises. Dishes at their reception were listed under a menu titled \u201cDinner Is Coming\u201d and given whimsical names, such as \u201cChildren of the Forest\u201d mushroom soup. And the entertainment included a live falconry show, also featuring owls and eagles, which was staged to the music from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise.\n\n\"As I had a very clear image in my head, we managed to pull it together quite quickly through endless phone calls, hours on Pinterest, online ordering and lots of gluing, stitching and wrapping,\u201d Etz said of the preparations.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nDespite all the prep work, however, Etz said she\u2019d gladly \u201cdo it all over again.\u201d\n\n\"I loved every second,\u201d she told SWNS in an interview ahead of their one-year anniversary. \u201cWe went to bed at 5:30 a.m. and there were still people dancing!\u201d", "description": "Two kindred spirits \u2014 as well two completely separate worlds of high fantasy \u2014 became one at a non-traditional wedding\u00a0ceremony in Germany.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/one-ring-to-rul-411766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
