Don't just write what you know | CBC Books", "language": "en", "text": "The 2020 CBC Short Story Prize is open for submissions! You can submit your original, unpublished writing up to 2,000 words for a chance to win $6,000 from the Canada Council for the Arts, a two-week writing residency at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and have your work published on CBC Books. The deadline to enter is Oct. 31, 2019.\n\nTo inspire and support you along the way, we are publishing a writing tip each week on CBC Books. You can also subscribe to our writing tips newsletter for even more tips.\n\nThis week's tip is from Will Richter.\n\n\"I used to follow what I now consider to be pretty bad advice, that being, 'Write what you know.' That might be fine for some people \u2014 people who had interesting childhoods, for example, or people like John le Carr\u00e9, who was a spy. But for me, write what you know often meant trying to squeeze my mundane experiences into things that were shaped like stories but actually weren't. So I let 'Write what you know' go and replaced it with 'Write what you like, so long as you can do so plausibly.'\n\n\"Since then I have had nothing but story ideas \u2014 not to mention a lot more fun. Now I doubt if that's good advice for everybody, but in my case, that freedom has been a real help and led directly to writing the story that was longlisted for the CBC Short Story Prize.\"\n\nWill Richter lives in Vancouver, where he works as a post-production script editor and freelance communications and magazine writer. He received his BA in English literature from Simon Fraser University, has published articles on everything from endangered rhinos to international quinoa scandals and now devotes his time to writing fiction. His short fiction has appeared in subTerrain magazine and was a runner-up in the Lush Triumphant Literary Awards competition. His story At a Distance made the 2019 CBC Short Story Prize longlist.", "description": "Vancouver-based writer Will Richter offers his best writing tip for those planning on entering the CBC Short Story Prize.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4814998.1536347351!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/woman-writin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
