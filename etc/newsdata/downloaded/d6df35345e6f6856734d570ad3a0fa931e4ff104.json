Frisk, 56, joined the company in July 2017 from his position as CEO of footwear and accessories company Aldo Group.\n\nFounder and long-time Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank will step down from the role next year. He is pictured on October 19\n\nSince joining Under Armour, Frisk has played a main role in the company's turnaround plan. He will join the board, while Plank transitions to executive chairman and brand chief.\n\n'Our multi-year, transition approach has ensured purposeful leadership continuity. Patrik is the right person to serve as Under Armour's next CEO,' said Plank.\n\nShares of the company were up 1% in premarket trading.\n\nIt follows a report in February that Under Armour employees were growing increasingly concerned about the relationship between married Plank and married MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal claimed that employees had long suspected the two were having an affair, and that a romantic relationship did reveal itself in emails that were then brought to the attention of the company's board last year.\n\nLaughing it up: Kevin Plank and Stephanie Ruhle are reportedly believed to be having an affair by employees at the sportswear company (pair above in 2013)\n\nPlank was reportedly asked if any company funds had been spent on the affair, with Ruhle, a frequent guest on his private jet, but he assured the members that any spend in his relationship with the television host had come out of his own pocket.\n\nEmployees did not know if that matter was ever investigated, and claimed that Ruhle has proven to have greater pull at the company than many employees and executives.\n\n'Mr. Plank and Ms. Ruhle are friends,' said Kelley McCormick, Under Armour\u2019s senior vice president of communications at the time.\n\nPlank, who is worth $1.8 billion, has been married since 2003 to Desiree Jacqueline Guerzon.\n\nRuhle is married to Andy Hubbard, who is a co-CEO at the hedge fund HausMart.\n\nCouples: Plank and his wife Desiree Jacqueline Guerzon (left) and Ruhle and her husband Andy Hubbard (right)\n\n'Ms. Ruhle has traveled with Mr. Plank and Under Armour staff on his private jet, they said, and given the CEO her input on a range of business matters,' reported The Journal.\n\n'Ms. Ruhle\u2019s involvement at the Baltimore company was unusual and problematic, these people said, and left employees unsure how to handle her feedback because many people believed she was romantically involved with Mr. Plank.'\n\nThis included Ruhle's emails being forwarded to people inside the company from Plank claims the report, and those ideas sometimes being implemented by the CEO.\n\nAmong the matters which Ruhle reportedly advised Plank on were the 2016 launch of the Chef Curry shoe and how he should interact with President Trump.\n\nThe latter led to much public backlash when Plank very publicly declared his support for the president, calling him an 'asset to the country.'\n\nIt was not just from the public either, with three of Under Armour's biggest spokespersons - Stephen Curry, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Misty Copeland - distancing themselves from Plank while criticizing the president.\n\nPlank would later write an open letter published as a full-page advertisement in The Baltimore Sun to say that his comments did not 'accurately reflect my intent'.\n\nHe listed the values he says the company holds dear which included 'jobs creation, entrepreneurship and opportunity', but said it did not align itself with President Trump's travel ban.\n\nHome sweet home: Plank and his wife live in this $4 million estate (above) just outside Maryland\n\nRun for it: Plank also owns Sagamore Farm in Glyndon, which has a giant race track (above)\n\nOn sale: Plank listed his eight-bedroom, 22,200-square-foot estate in Washington, D.C.'s tony Georgetown in February for $29.5 million (above)\n\n'We are always mindful of the responsibility that we have to those who choose our Brand, especially the young people who represent the bold and bright future of a diverse and inclusive America,' read the letter.\n\n'While we will continue to engage with government to protect our teammates, our company and our city, I can promise you that we will never compromise these values.'\n\nHe closed out the letter by stating: 'We will continue to stand for equality, diversity and opportunity for all. In a time of division, we aspire to be a force of unity, growth and optimism for our city and our country. I hope we will always make Baltimore proud.'\n\nSome are hitting out after this news broke, with William Cohan writing: 'I have known @sruhle for 10 years. This is a total hit job and completely unfair. She loves her family more than anything. Where is the editorial control on suggesting innuendo without any evidence?'\n\nThomas Farley also defended Ruhle, saying he too has taken advice from her, and given advice to Plank.\n\nPlank has a vast fortune and massive real estate portfolio that could be broken up should he and his wife split.\n\nHe is worth $1.8 billion and owns a hotel, tavern, racetrack and even a distillery in Maryland.\n\nPlank is also currently building a 4 million-square-foot headquarters for Under Armour in Baltimore as part of the redevelopment of the city's Port Covington neighborhood.\n\nHe had also been at work building a 35,000-square-foot estate for his family, but work suddenly stopped on the property last October.", "description": "Under Armour Inc said on Tuesday its founder and long-time CEO Kevin Plank will step down from the role next year and be succeeded by Chief Operating Officer Patrik Frisk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/13/20035500-0-image-a-26_1571749145034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
