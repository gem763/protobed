He also emphasized that data on consumption, while strong, was \"backwards looking\" and said that was why he has been \"emphasizing these downside risks and also emphasizing pre-emptive types of action to stay out of recession.\"\n\nBullard dissented last month (link) from the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter point, calling instead for half-point decrease.\n\nS&P 500 index company earnings are expected to fall 4.6% in the third quarter, according to Factset.
