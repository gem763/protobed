Almost every river and stream in the state flooded. When the water receded, four people were dead and numerous towns faced a massive cleanup, with nearly $700 million dollars worth of damage across the state.\n\nOne of the affected towns was my hometown, Moretown. Nestled on the edge of the Green Mountains, it\u2019s the classic definition of small town: no stoplight, a combined general store and gas station, a tiny library, and a single elementary school, all serving a population of just under 2,000. When Irene passed overhead, the floodwaters topped the banks of the Mad River, and flooded more than 60 private homes and public offices, including the post office, fire department, elementary school, and town offices. Moretown isn\u2019t a place with significant emergency-response resources, but the residents did have their neighbors \u2014 and a new online message board called Front Porch Forum.\n\nIn the aftermath of Irene, the residents of Moretown used this online community to coordinate meals for those left without a home, request assistance with the cleanup, or offer help with preserving family pictures. The town government had never set up an official online presence, so it began using the forum, too, posting official updates and keeping everyone apprised of developments in the cleanup.\n\nFront Porch Forum had come to Moretown just months before, but the site had spread throughout much of the state, town by town, since it was founded in 2000 in Burlington. The site looks like a relic from another era; its website is clean and minimal, without the pictures, reaction buttons or comment fields that most social platforms have implemented today. Users register using their real name and address, and gain access to the forum for their town or neighborhood. This network of 185 forums covers each town in Vermont, as well as a handful in neighboring New York and New Hampshire. While most towns possess their own forum, the more populated areas of the state, such as the cities of Burlington and Montpelier, are split up into more manageable districts. During normal times, people might use it to alert their neighbors about everything from runaway Roombas to notices about garage sales or public meetings. But in a pinch, it proved essential when it came to coordinating disaster relief.\n\nMeg Allison, the librarian for Moretown\u2019s elementary school, recalls how quickly the town mobilized in the aftermath of Irene. Over the course of the summer of 2011, people \u201cwere slowly gathering momentum and using [Front Porch Forum],\u201d she explained, and \u201csuddenly, it became the go-to place for sharing flood and FEMA information.\u201d The town board even began to print out the day\u2019s digest of postings, pinning them to the front door of the town hall. \u201cIt became the way the town communicated,\u201d Allison recalled. Town residents pitched in to help those who lost their homes: they cooked meals and offered help. Allison, whose own home was out of danger from the floodwaters, offered up her own expertise, helping her less fortunate neighbors preserve water-damaged family pictures.\n\nAllison says that her tiny town was prepared for the disaster in part because its residents had been using the forum for months, and in that time, it had helped to build and reinforce their relationships with their neighbors. As a result, when the storm hit, Moretown had a new tool at its disposal: those pre-existing relationships that had been strengthened by the multitude of tiny interactions facilitated through the forum. Towns that lacked the forum certainly had resources and their shares of neighborly connections that helped them, but the forum helped provide a durable piece of infrastructure to encourage these relationships in the preceding months.\n\nFront Porch Forum is similar to a Listserv: networks that were commonplace on the internet by 2000 but waned as modern social networks arose, their roles absorbed by sleeker, multibillion-dollar platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others. Yet despite the competition from those larger sites, Front Porch Forum has not only persisted, it\u2019s thrived in Vermont. Since its founding in 2000, it boasts nearly 160,000 members, or just under a quarter of the population of the state.\n\nBringing people together, and forming communities \u2014 this is, of course, the stuff of Facebook mission statements, and a mantra that\u2019s been so often repeated in a year of scandals and outcries over the prevalence of toxic behavior and the glacially slow pace when it comes to addressing it. The broad social media industry has been forced to contend with the desire to allow for a great latitude of freedom for its users and the inventiveness of bad actors that seek to manipulate social media for their own ends. While sites like Twitter and Facebook have found that they need to introduce new features, fact-checkers, and tighten up their rules around bad behavior, they have a long way to go to regain user trust. It\u2019s in this environment that Front Porch Forum has been operating, doing all of the things that its bigger rivals say that they want to do: bring people together and provide a safe environment online.\n\nMichael Wood-Lewis and his wife Valerie got the idea for Front Porch Forum in 2000, shortly after they moved to Burlington from Washington, DC in 1998. Michael had just left a job at a business-to-business startup and was looking for a new project.\n\nIt was a challenging time for the family. Their son, Benjamin, developed cerebral palsy shortly after he was adopted, and as newcomers to Burlington, they struggled to meet their neighbors. \u201cAlmost all families go through periods of great need,\u201d Michael told The Verge, \u201cand historically, neighbors were a key part of peoples\u2019 support networks. Valerie and I realized that Ben\u2019s severe cerebral palsy would require more than we could provide on our own.\u201d While their neighborhood was active and outgoing, the family had trouble breaking in. \u201cEnter Front Porch Forum,\u201d Michael says.\n\nMichael came up with the framework for a Listserv he called the Five Sisters Neighborhood Forum, and printed up a stack of fliers, which he distributed throughout his Burlington neighborhood, inviting his neighbors to join. Hosted through a third-party provider and armed with an Excel spreadsheet, he designed it as a space for neighbors to share information and updates about the area. Online communities were beginning to change, with Listservs and online forums giving way to the ancestors of today\u2019s social networks. Sites like Six Degrees, Classmates.com, or PlanetAll allowed users to create individual profiles and connect with other people they might know \u2014 or didn\u2019t know \u2014 online. While Wood-Lewis\u2019 Burlington forum didn\u2019t allow for individual profiles, it did tap into a similar desire: contact with one\u2019s community and neighbors.\n\nMichael explained that the Five Sisters neighborhood was home to \u201clots of community organizer types,\u201d and, as a result, his list was instantly popular, with hundreds of people signing up within a few months. It was a remarkable response, Michael says, because it came at a time \u201cwhen it wasn\u2019t even guaranteed that people even had internet in their homes.\u201d Over the next six years, he operated it on the side, and people used the list to do everything from solicit recommendations for local plumbers or carpenters, let their neighbors know about that wandering skunk, or opine on local issues.\n\nBy 2006, Wood-Lewis left his job as an executive director of an environmental nonprofit and began to think seriously about how to turn his side project into a viable business that he could scale beyond the Burlington area. He and his wife pulled some of their savings together to hire engineer Rob Maurizi to design and relaunch the site, turning an e-mail-based list into a platform of its own. This new online network now covered all of Burlington, Vermont\u2019s largest city. \u201cIf what\u2019s happening in the Five Sisters can happen in the rest of Burlington or Chittenden County,\u201d Wood-Lewis recalled, \u201cthere\u2019s got to be a business in there somewhere, and a social impact.\u201d\n\nFor years, Wood-Lewis manually compiled each day\u2019s submitted posts into a digest that he would then send out to the list each evening. When Maurizi left the state, Wood-Lewis had to scrape together money for an update every couple of months. \u201cWe really couldn\u2019t add features,\u201d he says. \u201cIt forced me to innovate along different lines, instead of developing new features or tweaking color schemes.\u201d To generate revenue, he began cold-calling local businesses to advertise on the site. That allowed him to hire a neighbor to help moderate the site and develop the procedures needed for handling the growing population.\n\nThe relaunched site maintains many of the same functions as the original Listserv. Users can now post messages directly to the site, which their neighbors can read by logging onto their forum or receiving the day\u2019s postings in their inbox in a daily email digest. Users have the option of replying directly to those messages, either by displaying their feedback in the next day\u2019s digest or contacting the poster directly via e-mail. They also have the option to make their listing viewable in neighboring towns \u2014 useful if you\u2019re casting a wide net for recommendations or if you have a missing pet.\n\nEach forum also displays a list of participating public officials \u2014 everyone from mayors to state representatives to librarians to justices of the peace \u2014 and users can navigate through the archive of postings or a community calendar. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, the forum doesn\u2019t provide members with individual profile pages or allow members to select who their friends are. Just as you can\u2019t choose which neighbors surround you, you\u2019re surrounded by your neighbors online.\n\nAn entire generation of social networks grew since the forum launched: MySpace, Friendster, Facebook, and Twitter. Built on the ashes of the first generation of social networks, these platforms offered people entirely new ways to communicate with one another. Despite those competing sites, Wood-Lewis\u2019 project was a hit locally. \u201cPeople were telling me stories daily about how impactful it was,\u201d Wood-Lewis recalled.\n\nFollowing the website launch in 2006, word of the network spread, and the Wood-Lewises put their own money down to once again expand the system to cover the entirety of Chittenden County. The demand for the site didn\u2019t stop there, but Wood-Lewis explains that their personal finances constrained the site\u2019s growth. Shortly after expanding to Chittenden County, the town of Starksboro (located to the south in Addison County) and Grand Isle County (containing the towns of Alburgh, Grand Isle, Isle La Motte, North Hero, and South Hero) approached the Wood-Lewises to join, and they came up with a workaround: the towns would pay to sign up. \u201cThen after that, communities just approached us.\u201d\n\nHe began to throw out a one-time fee as a startup cost for each town, based on the complexity of the desired forum and the state of their software. Residents raised the money themselves, went to businesses or their local chamber of commerce for funds, or applied for grants to pay the few thousand dollars that the company required.\n\nCritically, the site\u2019s growth was organic, growing as demand allowed. As the site began to expand across the state, it slowly grew its team of community moderators, who proactively skim over each post to make sure it adheres to the site\u2019s code of conduct. While major social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have teams who review reported posts, they do so in a reactive manner \u2014 users have to flag something that\u2019s out of character. While Front Porch Forum has developed tools to automate some of the review processes, it\u2019s kept its human moderators in the loop, working to make sure that what\u2019s being posted to the site isn\u2019t detrimental to the community.\n\nAlong the way, the company experienced two major boosts. The first came in 2011 with eVermont, an initiative from the Vermont Council on Rural Development, which had won a federal grant to expand internet access to rural parts of the state, and Front Porch Forum was part of the package offered to towns that applied.\n\nBut the biggest boost came in the aftermath of Irene (as well as another major flooding event earlier that summer around Lake Champlain), which spurred Front Porch Forum to go statewide. After the storms, the Vermont Council on Rural Development earned a second major federal grant to increase the resiliency of at-risk towns. Once again, Front Porch Forum was part of the package, allowing it to expand to the rest of the state. As of summer 2018, Wood-Lewis notes, 160,000 of Vermont\u2019s 260,000 households are part of the network, and of those households, 50 percent of users post to the forum, while 79 percent take \u201coffline actions\u201d due to their membership on their local forum.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make Vermont resilient in the face of other coming issues,\u201d Wood-Lewis says. Irene was a stark reminder that a changing climate will have an outsized impact on a tiny, less prosperous state. While resiliency took the form of better culverts and ditches to manage water from major storms, Front Porch Forum was pitched as a way to make those communities more resilient by shoring up the bonds between neighbors.\n\nInteractions on Front Porch Forum can range from serious, to utilitarian, to downright goofy. Earlier this year, I found a builder to construct a set of floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in my house through the site. One recent Burlington post asked for the whereabouts of a household Roomba, which had been tasked with cleaning a porch, only to escape down the street. (It was later recovered). In the lead-up to this year\u2019s midterm elections, my local forum lit up with neighbors discussing their local candidates, talking about everything from their stances on a proposed carbon tax to school spending.\n\nFront Porch Forum isn\u2019t designed as a virtual replacement for one\u2019s real-world neighborhood \u2014 it\u2019s meant to facilitate those everyday, in-person connections that form the basis of a community. Wood-Lewis says the site changes people\u2019s perceptions of where they live, because the connections it facilitates impart a sense that it\u2019s \u201ca real place of real people,\u201d and these interactions give its users a sense of ownership of their community.\n\nThat\u2019s played out in countless ways over the years. Westford resident Julia Andrews told The Verge about one notable interaction that she had on the forum shortly after it arrived in her town in 2006. Around Thanksgiving, she said that a fellow Westford resident posted about her experiences helping her impoverished brother track down a turkey for their family meal. \u201cInitially, she had a couple of responses,\u201d Julia said, noting that the original posting really upset her, and prompted her to reach out. \u201cWhat happened was that she and I met at a coffee shop.\u201d\n\nThe two had never met before, but after their meeting, they decided to set up a food bank. Six months of planning and work later, they opened up their food shelf in the United Church of Westford, a modest collection of shelves that still helps the community over a decade later. Andrews says that they use the forum to put out the call for donations and to advertise the food bank\u2019s hours and policies. The forum, Andrews says, is \u201cword of mouth on steroids,\u201d and said that \u201cpeople just come out of the woodwork\u201d to help stock the shelf.\n\nOthers have found the forum to be an ideal platform for contributing to the community in other ways. Since retiring as a teacher in Barre, Vermont in 1998, Nancy Wolfe explained that she saw a distinct lack of hometown pride in her central Vermont city, a blue-collar town that\u2019s earned a reputation for crime and drugs in recent years. Several years ago, she began a home-brewed research project into the city\u2019s storied history in an attempt to inject some civic pride into her neighbors. Attempts to hold a series of talks never yielded a good turnout, but she found that the city\u2019s forum provided an ideal venue for her efforts. She broke her work into small, manageable chunks, and began posting it \u2014 a paragraph at a time, a couple of times a week, sharing the town\u2019s history of granite mining and sculpting.\n\nPoliticians and city and town officials find the site useful as well. Front Porch Forum sells an access package to politicians, allowing them to observe the towns or counties that they represent. Burlington Ward 6 City Councilor Karen Paul uses the forum as a way to keep her constituents apprised of her work in city government. \u201cWhen I go door to door during campaign season, there\u2019s no question: a lot of people will say to me that they read my posts on Front Porch Forum,\u201d she told The Verge. That sentiment was echoed by Washington County State Senator Ann Cummings, who said that it was a good way to learn about issues that \u201cwere bubbling up in the community,\u201d and noted that it was another tool that she could use to stay engaged with her constituents.\n\nSince Front Porch Forum\u2019s founding, other sites have popped up to occupy a similar space in the industry, such as Nextdoor. Founded in 2011, Nextdoor allows individuals to map out a neighborhood and post recommendations, events, lost and found reports, and other items of interest. But the tenor is notably different. Loud, back-and-forth comment threads are frequently featured on platforms like Best of Nextdoor, but the interactions on Front Porch Forum are typically a bit more low-key. While you still get poorly worded responses or snarky back-and-forth discussions on the forum that would be worthy of Best of Nextdoor, the discussion feels less like gossip, and more service-y. This appears to be by design; where the major social media sites prize the number of interactions through features like post comments or reactions, discussions on the forum move at a slower pace.\n\nFront Porch Forum structures its conversations differently than the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and Nextdoor, slowing the pace down to prompt users to think a bit more about what they\u2019re saying before their community. There\u2019s no news feed with rapid-fire updates to check every couple of minutes. You can fire off an angry reply to a neighbor over something they wrote \u2014 but it will show up a day later on the site. Wood-Lewis said that they\u2019ve had more than one user write to the site directly, asking to retract a comment written in haste. It\u2019s harder to get in a flame war when each exchange takes 24 hours to respond to, at least on the platform itself.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Front Porch Forum is free from heated discussions. While it\u2019s easy to find bad Nextdoor posts, Front Porch Forum has its share of passive-aggressive and irritating users, arguing for days over issues relevant only to a small group of people. For example, the destruction of a home in Winooski earlier this year unleashed a flood of now-homeless rats into nearby properties. When someone asked about how to remove the rats, neighbors engaged in a fierce debate over the ethics of trapping and killing animals. In another recent posting, someone reported that their car was smeared with dog poop after complaining about unleashed dogs. And as this year\u2019s midterm elections approached, the site saw an influx of political advocacy. But on the whole, the platform\u2019s approach to discussions helps maintain a largely civil discourse.\n\nBut a bigger reason for the civil tone likely comes down to the fact that the users are all part of the same real-world community. And unlike Facebook or Twitter, where someone without a stake in a conversation or issue can drop in to interrupt and derail discussions, Front Porch Forum\u2019s requirement that someone list their address helps to protect against outsiders from sabotaging local conversations or spreading misinformation.\n\nFurthermore, that team of moderators helps ensure that the site\u2019s guidelines are being followed. The company employs six such community moderators across the state. Wood-Lewis explains these employees skim the postings (he says that they don\u2019t edit them) to make sure that they adhere to the site\u2019s Terms of Use, which prohibits racist or illegal conduct or personal attacks against one another. And while the site has the usual prohibitions against content that is unlawful, abusive, or pornographic, it also has some additional clauses: users can\u2019t use the forum \u201cin a way counter to its community-building mission.\u201d\n\n\u2018People tend to have thick skins around topics, but not around people\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople tend to have thick skins around topics,\u201d Wood-Lewis explained, \u201cbut not around people.\u201d It\u2019s okay to call out a bad idea, but it\u2019s not okay to call the person an idiot for doing so. Wood-Lewis says that the community manager team performs a vital role for the site, and that they go through a \u201cmonths-long in-house training that covers all aspects\u201d of the work that they perform, and that when a problematic post does come up, it\u2019ll be reviewed by multiple OCM members. When a post is flagged, it\u2019s reviewed, and the author is contacted. Most authors, Wood-Lewis says, aren\u2019t mad that their post was stopped: \u201cOften, we are greeted with expressions of relief,\u201d happy that a post written in the moment was pulled back before it caused problems. In most extreme examples, the moderators will just close an individual\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cWe generally have a subjective test \u2014 no personal attacks,\u201d says Wood-Lewis. \u201cCritiquing the decisions of a public official, we don\u2019t deem that a personal attack.\u201d He estimates that 99 percent of all of the site\u2019s posts make it past the moderators, and that \u201cthe vast majority of postings are not controversial in any way.\u201d\n\nSome users have complained about Front Porch Forum\u2019s approach to community moderation. In 2013, one user posted a comment about not wanting to use poison to deter wildlife in their yard, unless they\u2019re planning on killing \u201csome useless right-wing radio talk show host,\u201d which raised several complaints from users, and resulted in one of them being kicked off the site.\n\nBut in other places around the state, the community-oriented structure of the forum helps set the tone for its real-world counterpart. Monkton resident John Mejia recounted to The Verge an instance when they posted to their local forum following the theft of several Black Lives Matter signs from their front yard. They \u201cgot an overwhelming amount of support directly to me initially,\u201d Mejia says. \u201cI was a little disappointed that there wasn\u2019t more response to the forum in general.\u201d What did end up on the forum was \u201ca couple of posts that were just racist, I would say, in terms of bringing up all these well, lies, about the Black Lives Matter movement, but in general about race and racism in the US.\u201d\n\nMejia\u2019s response was to address those statements head-on, issuing corrections with facts, which earned another round of responses from neighbors who \u201cwere horrified at what the other person had written.\u201d Mejia urged them to take their horror public on the forum. \u201cAlthough I appreciated the personal support that I was getting, it was important for the community to see that those anti-black world views that were expressed are not common in our area.\u201d Mejia noted that moderators from Front Porch Forum contacted them as this played out, saying that they were monitoring the exchange, in case the discussion devolved.\n\nNow that the site covers all of Vermont, the company has begun to take tentative steps beyond the state\u2019s borders. The site included one tiny New Hampshire community as a result of a federal grant, and the company has recently expanded to a handful of towns in New York\u2019s Washington County \u2014 Argyle, Cambridge, White Creek, and Jackson \u2014 with the hope that they\u2019ll continue into others as time and word of mouth progresses. But Wood-Lewis says he doesn\u2019t want to take over the world: scaling up too quickly would mean outstripping their workforce. He explains that now that they\u2019ve gotten a handle on the site\u2019s growth, they\u2019re looking to begin tackling the long list of updates that they\u2019ve always wanted to hit, and they recently hired their first in-house software engineer to work on it. \u201cWe\u2019re settling up some deferred maintenance and software debt,\u201d he says.\n\nWood-Lewis described his company\u2019s revenue as having three components: ad sales to local businesses \u2014 the largest source of revenue for the site \u2014 which purchase unobtrusive blocks in the digests a few times a year; custom subscriptions for politicians or local governmental officials to access the forums of their constituents or jurisdictions, either to notify them of updates or to reach constituents in multi-town districts; and a yearly NPR-style pledge drive (that raised $150,000 this year), which is only a small percentage of their budget. \u201cAll three of those products, interestingly enough,\u201d he says \u201ccame about because people knocked on our doors.\u201d The site\u2019s users wanted to advertise, gain access to multiple forums, or simply give the site money because they found it to be really useful.\n\nWhile a social focus remains at the forefront of the company and its direction, it\u2019s still a for-profit enterprise. The company\u2019s slow growth came due to restraints from available resources and funding, but that conservative handling has prompted a far more thoughtful approach to how it serves its members. Where bigger sites have parceled out shares of the company to multiple individuals, Front Porch Forum remains solely in the hands of Wood-Lewis and his wife. That arrangement allows them to exert a level of control over the look, feel, and direction of the company and its social mission.\n\nFor now, Wood-Lewis is more interested in adding features (the company says that it is working on a mobile app) and focusing on local communities than in driving growth.\n\nAnd if a major company like Nextdoor or Facebook came to Vermont with an acquisition offer? \u201cI would listen,\u201d he says, \u201cand it would be an interesting conversation, but I don\u2019t think it would happen.\u201d", "description": "Vermont social network Front Porch Forum has become a useful online community for the entire state, helping users with everything from recommendations to disaster recovery.
