It was branded Arsenal players who were ready to die for the club. You could go after the game in the fight in the corridors you would know they would not leave you alone \u2013 this was the type of players I had at the start.\n\n\u2018They were ready to go to war with you, you could be in the trenches with them.\n\n\u2018Afterwards the second generation of players who had as well exceptional charisma. We speak a lot about the first generation but the other defence of Lauren, Campbell, Toure and Ashley Cole were exceptional with Lehmann in goal- they were characters.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day when you look back you feel when you get that right \u2013 the personalities \u2013 you are ready to go anywhere in the world. These teams had charisma.\u2019\n\nWenger has continually stressed his desire to continue his management career since leaving Arsenal but he\u2019s yet to accept an offer.\n\nThe 69-year-old has been linked with a role within FIFA and he confirmed last week that he was mulling over a job offer from the corporation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I just want to share what I\u2019ve learnt and give it back to the game in a different way, \u2018said Wenger.\n\n\u2018I am not sure if I would stop coaching as well because the devil is still in there. But I have to see, \u2018do I like it?\u2019 And can I be efficient?\u2019\n\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand sends message to Ed Woodward over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s Manchester United future", "description": "Arsene Wenger believes his title-winning 2003/2004 side was the greatest team he managed at Arsenal.
