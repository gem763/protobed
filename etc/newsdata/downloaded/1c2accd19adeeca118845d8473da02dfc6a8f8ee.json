But he\u2019s not talking about the ongoing Democratic clown car shows like the one last night. Hugh is looking to the future and the general election debates between President Trump and whoever the Democrats wind up selecting.\n\nHis suggestion is going to come off as a bit on the radical side. Rather than quibbling over the format or the location or who gets the first question, Hugh is suggesting that Trump simply announce that he won\u2019t be participating. Unless, that is, some major changes are made so the debates will be conducted in a fair fashion.\n\nLast week, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the schedule of 2020 presidential debates. President Trump should quickly dismiss that schedule as unacceptable and announce that if any debates will be held at all in 2020, it will be only after extensive, direct negotiations between him and the eventual nominee of the Democratic Party and their respective designated representatives. And those negotiations should begin from a premise that the Republicans will no longer play by the biased rules of a deeply unbalanced Manhattan-Beltway media elite. Explicitly articulating this declaration of intent now, along with the possibility that, as in 1968 and 1972, there won\u2019t be any debates, would do both the public and the elite media a great service. According to a recent Gallup survey, 13 percent of Americans \u201chave a great deal of trust\u201d in the mass media and 28 percent \u201ca fair amount,\u201d with \u201c69% of Democrats [saying] they have trust and confidence in it, while 15% of Republicans and 36% of independents agree.\u201d So more than half the country distrusts the media, and that suspicion is overwhelming among those on the center-right.\n\nHugh goes on from there at length, excoriating the \u201cManhattan-Beltway media elite\u201d with plenty of doses of largely deserved criticism. The amount of bias on display in the media has just become so ubiquitous that many of us don\u2019t even bother commenting on it anymore. Hewitt cites poll numbers showing the lack of faith most of the country has in the mainstream media these days and this is a problem that predates the Trump presidency by quite a bit.\n\nAs to the suggestion that Trump should stonewall the commission unless negotiations with the candidates become part of the formula is neither radical nor legally problematic. Keep in mind that the Commission on Presidential Debates is not a government entity. Its dictates are not the law of the land and it carries no legal authority. There is no law requiring candidates to show up for debates and the schedule issued by the commission is not in any way legally binding.\n\nWith all of that said, Trump would need to proceed carefully in my opinion. Calling for a negotiation with the Democratic candidate before any debates are agreed to is perfectly reasonable and the commission should go along with it. But flatly walking away from the debates carries its own risks. Some will doubtless see such a decision as a case of Trump being \u201ctoo afraid\u201d to face his opponent in a one-on-one verbal rumble. (That\u2019s actually a laughable idea when you consider how much he loves mixing it up, but people will still say it.)\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of who will moderate the debates, select the questions and set the tone. Certainly we don\u2019t want another 2012 Candy Crowley debacle, but somebody has to be found to do the job. And we can\u2019t just draw a random name out of the phone book. The goal is to make sure that it\u2019s an individual moderator that the public has a reasonable amount of trust in and the event doesn\u2019t just turn into a two-hour gotcha question ambush of the President by an obviously liberal moderator.\n\nCan such a person and format be found in the toxic political stew of the current era? I\u2019d like to think so. But if not, Hugh may be correct. Perhaps the President should just walk away rather than delivering himself to his enemies on a silver platter.", "description": "Cut and run?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/trump-nh.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
