Jay Inslee on Wednesday applauded the \u201carms race\u201d that he said has developed among the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders to lay out aggressive plans to tackle climate change, which had been the signature issue of his own since-ended bid for the White House.\n\nMr. Inslee gave shout-outs to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California and former Obama administration Juli\u00e1n Castro for the plans they\u2019ve released in recent days. The governor said he had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Ms. Warren a few days ago.\n\n\u201cSo we have seen, I think, an arms race now in a good way of candidates competing to have the most effective plans, and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nMr. Inslee, who dropped out of the presidential race last month, had introduced the most comprehensive set of proposals to tackle climate change among the 2020 field and said his ideas are available to the candidates as \u201copen source\u201d material.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the majority of the candidates who have shown an intense interest in this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re now in a place that is really healthy, where the Democratic Party is, I believe, going to produce a candidate to really make climate change a focus.\u201d\n\nHe said that a focus on climate change could be the key to defeating President Trump next year.\n\n\u201cThis is a way to defeat Donald Trump, because this is his very weakest [point],\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cAbout 70% of the people don\u2019t trust him at all on environmental issues, and so we need to attack his weakest point with our strongest candidate. And I feel that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nTen presidential contenders are set to take part in a \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall event hosted by CNN in New York on Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
