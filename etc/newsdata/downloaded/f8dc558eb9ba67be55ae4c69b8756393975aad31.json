It is very rare that economic migrants stay in Bulgaria.\n\nStatistics from the migration department of the Ministry of Interior show that the total number of detained illegal migrants has dropped by two per cent this year to a total of 1,880 detained individuals. Most of these individuals come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan.\n\nThe issue was thrust further into the international spotlight on Wednesday with the discovery of 39 dead bodies, now believed to be those of Chinese nationals, in a refrigerated lorry in Essex.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But there have been further complications with the registration system.\n\nIn 2018, Bulgarian media covered the problem of dozens of Bulgarians being held criminally responsible in Greece for trafficking illegal migrants.\n\nIt turned out that in most of the cases the Bulgarians had unknowingly sold vehicles such as trucks or minibuses to criminals purchasing them for human trafficking.\n\nThe new owners had deliberately not registered the vehicles under their name after the sale, in order to avoid being associated with the crime. Without further investigation, the Bulgarians were prosecuted by the Greek authorities, as the vehicles were still under their name.\n\nIn the latest incident 10 days ago, a van registered in Bulgaria was detained in Greece. The van did not stop when the local police attempted to pull it over for a check near the city of Kavala. Following a chase, the police managed to stop it. Twenty illegal migrants who came to Greece from Turkey were found inside.\n\nIn this case, the authorities did not indicate whether the driver was Bulgarian. However, some Bulgarian drivers have been sentenced to as much as 25 years.\n\nWhile Bulgarian drivers argue their lack of culpability despite their names being tied to vehicles used for pernicious ends, their prime minister is seeking to do the same on the international stage.\n\n\u201cTwo more trucks are registered here,\u201d Borisov told bTV, one of the country\u2019s leading broadcasters. \u201cThere is no way we can be connected except the truck sign. Nevertheless, we are working very well with the English services, so we will cooperate as much as possible.\u201d\n\nWhile the Bulgarian government is said to have been cooperating with international efforts to combat trafficking of late, the United States asserts this has not always been the case.\n\nThe US State Department\u2019s \u201cTrafficking in Persons\u201d report, published in June 2019 and based on CIA findings, said Sofia does not meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making significant efforts to do so.\n\nThe report described Bulgaria as \u201cone of the main sources of human trafficking in the EU\u201d, with men, women and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour, in countries as geographically diverse as Russia, Zambia, Israel and the US.\n\nAs areas of weakness, the report highlighted that there had been fewer investigations and prosecutions into trafficking, with courts mostly issuing suspended sentences. It also claimed \u201cofficials\u2019 lack of knowledge of trafficking indicators hindered effective victim identification, [while] corruption in law enforcement and the judiciary continued to hinder progress\u201d\n\nBut without urgent changes to migration policy, and increased cross-border efforts to tackle dangerous and exploitative people-smuggling \u2013 by Bulgaria, the UK, and the rest of Europe \u2013 the sense of devastation relating to the Essex discovery is in danger of becoming all too familiar.", "description": "During his last visit to the UK, Yavor Pantev found himself with some explaining to do.
