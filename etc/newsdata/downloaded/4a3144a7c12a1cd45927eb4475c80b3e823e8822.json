Mazie Hirono said she would stand with Joe Biden against attacks from President Donald Trump. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images congress 'I'll stand with Joe': Democrats rally around Biden after Trump attacks\n\nDemocrats are admonishing Republicans and President Donald Trump for attacking Joe Biden and his family amid the ongoing Ukraine scandal, calling their criticisms a distraction from Trump\u2019s current predicament.\n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators fought back against the president\u2019s insinuations that there was something suspicious about Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s connections to Ukraine, or that the former vice president and current 2020 hopeful pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son. Their defense highlights their allegiance to Biden as well as Democrats' strategy of keeping the attention focused on Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that the president is very afraid of Joe,\u201d said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \u201cAnd so he\u2019s going after Joe and his family for political purposes and I\u2019ll stand with Joe against any president who acts that way.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are not planning to let up on their attacks of the former vice president and his son, noting repeatedly this week that Hunter Biden reportedly made $50,000 a month for his work in Ukraine. And if Biden does become the nominee, his son\u2019s business dealings will further come into focus.\n\nBut Democrats say that Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine has already been litigated, and don\u2019t see a threat from the GOP.\n\n\u201cI think this is an issue that\u2019s been vetted for a while and enough to find out the truth,\u201d said Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who has endorsed Biden. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything that would be troubling or damaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vice president\u2019s engagement in the matter ... was well understood,\u201d added Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), referring to Biden's calls to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor over allegations of corruption. \u201dWe weighed in against the prosecutor, it\u2019s been looked at, it\u2019s strictly a distraction by the president and it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\n\nYet Biden faced some criticism from fellow Democrats, namely from 2020 rival Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who is trying to attract the same moderate voters as Biden. When asked about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, Bennet told POLITICO, \u201cit\u2019d be better not to have that kind of arrangement.\u201d\n\nBiden issued a statement this week saying that he would not focus his campaign on how Trump \"abused his power\" to come after his family but instead \"on how he has turned his back on America's families.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s attempt during a phone call to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate the Biden family reinvigorated House Democrats and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who endorsed an impeachment inquiry into Trump this week. On Thursday, Democrats further accused Trump of a cover-up after an unnamed whistleblower claimed that White House officials witnessed Trump abusing his office for personal gain over the call, and later tried to \u201clock down\u201d details of the conversation.\n\nMeanwhile, the majority of 2020 candidates have avoided going after the vice president\u2019s family. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (R-Texas) told reporters Thursday at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania that he did not think the latest Ukraine debacle made Biden more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI really thinks this country, as it should, is focusing on the conduct and the choices that President Trump has made,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a former 2020 presidential candidate, also said in an interview that she did not view Hunter Biden\u2019s work as a liability for Biden's campaign, adding that \u201cwhat\u2019s most alarming is how the president used his power and position as president of the United States to ask a foreign country to investigate a political adversary.\u201d\n\nSome Democratic senators acknowledged that Biden may have to do more explaining when it comes to his son\u2019s work abroad. But they also cautioned reporters from propagating Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories and emphasized the focus should remain on the whistleblower complaint against Trump.\n\n\u201cIf the media repeats and repeats and repeats allegations that have absolutely no foundation, you\u2019re falling into exactly the same trap that you did in 2016,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a close Biden ally.\n\nDemocrats also argue that Biden\u2019s family\u2019s business affairs pale in comparison to the Trump family. Democrats have scrutinized the Trump family for profiting off of his businesses during his presidency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that President Trump wants to get into a conversation about the business dealings of candidates\u2019 children,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \u201cIt\u2019s much weaker ground for Trump than it is for Biden.\u201d\n\nOther senators questioned how much interest the broader public had in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings and argued that the election would be fought over issues like health care and the economy, \"not distractions about what his son is doing,\" as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) put it. And as for Trump's claims that Biden sought to help his son's business, Democrats say it's only the latest outburst.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mixing up names, his mixing up the timing of events,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who ran for vice president in 2016. \u201dHe\u2019s still worried about the DNC. He\u2019s still trashing [former special prosecutor Robert] Mueller a year after that was done. So the Biden stuff looks like weird conspiracy stuff that Trump tends to read about in somebody else\u2019s tweets. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big issue.\u201d\n\n", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that President Trump wants to get into a conversation about the business dealings of candidates\u2019 children,\u201d said Sen.
