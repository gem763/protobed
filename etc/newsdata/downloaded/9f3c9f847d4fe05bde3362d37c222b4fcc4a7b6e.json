He dropped the money off at a venue the accused had allegedly chosen.\n\n\"Upon handing over the money to the accused, police authorities pounced on the three police officials and arrested them.\"\n\nViral WhatsApp messages\n\nIn addition, the accused are said to have been behind WhatsApp messages that went viral three months ago claiming that Masina's administration was engaged in corrupt activities. The messages were apparently an attempt to intimidate Masina and Mpya into paying the R5m.\n\nIn a statement, Masina said he felt vindicated by the arrests.\n\n\"We must commend the swift and effective response by both the SAPS and the EMPD in apprehending these three corrupt police officials in our City.\n\n\"I am glad that today, the truth is finally being unveiled [about] a malicious and incendiary plot to distract this administration from continuing to deliver quality services to our people. We are now fast closing in on City officials and other individuals involved in these unscrupulous acts of corruption and extortion.\n\n\"The City of Ekurhuleni remains steadfast in its zero-tolerance approach to corruption and we expect to make more arrests in the near future,\" Masina said.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Ekurhuleni police have arrested three SA Police Service members for allegedly trying to extort R5m from member of the mayoral committee in charge of human settlements, Lesiba Mpya.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7955/e3cbb32e71b1489c9eceeaa24916f71d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-14"}
