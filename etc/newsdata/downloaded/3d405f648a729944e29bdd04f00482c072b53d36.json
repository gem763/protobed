The front-month contract was at $66.28 per barrel, up $6.06, or 10.1%, from its previous close, by 0449 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed by as much as 15.5% to $63.34 a barrel, the biggest intra-day percentage gain since June 22, 1998. The front-month contract was at $59.77 a barrel, up $4.92, or 9%, at 0449 GMT.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter and the attack on state-owned producer Saudi Aramco\u2019s crude processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais has cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day. The company has not given a timeline for the resumption of full output.\n\nA source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe think the attacks would be a wake up call for investors, who have failed to price in risk within the price of crude. Although global supply will contract in the near term, the United States has the ability to supply this contraction,\u201d said Hue Frame, managing director at Frame Funds in Sydney.\n\n\u201cWith developments over the weekend, market participants will add additional factors when working out the fair value of crude on top of the usual supply and demand factors.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he approved the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) if needed in a quantity to be determined due to the attack.\n\nThe attack on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility at Abqaiq, came from the direction of Iran, and cruise missiles may have been used, according to a senior U.S. official. Initial reports indicated the attack came from Yemen.\n\nTrump also said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\n(Global oil prices spike over 10% after attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities: here)\n\n(Saudi Arabia crude exports to Asia vs rest of the world: here)\n\nRISK PREMIUM\n\n\u201cA geopolitical risk premium will return to the oil price,\u201d said Alan Gelder, vice president for refining, chemicals and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie.\n\n\u201cThis attack has material implications for the oil market, as a loss of 5 million barrels per day of supplies from Saudi Arabia cannot be met for long by existing inventories and the limited spare capacity of the other OPEC+ group members,\u201d he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined products after the attacks, consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note.\n\nSaudi Aramco will likely buy significant quantities of gasoline, diesel and possibly fuel oil while cutting liquefied petroleum gas exports.\n\nU.S. gasoline futures rose as much 12.9%, while U.S. heating oil futures rose by as much as 10.8%. China\u2019s Shanghai crude oil futures rose to its trading limit, gaining 8% at the open.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Aramco has told one Indian refinery there will be no immediate impact on oil supplies as it will deliver crude from other sources and has adequate inventory, a source with the refinery said.\n\nOther Asian buyers such as Thailand have also said the attack would have no immediate impact on oil imports.", "description": "Oil prices soared on Monday, with Brent crude posting its biggest intra-day percentage gain since the Gulf War in 1991, after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Saturday shut about 5% of global supply.", "authors": ["Koustav Samanta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430238786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0RW", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
