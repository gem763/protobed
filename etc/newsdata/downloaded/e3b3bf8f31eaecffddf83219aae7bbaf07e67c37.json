Many locals say the shutdown is in protest at the government action. Authorities blame militant threats.\n\nRangreth\u2019s warehouse-style halls, normally packed with young T-shirted programmers, are empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u00b4s a devastating blow to the software business in Kashmir. Internet is like oxygen to our business and it has been taken away,\u201d the owner of one company with clients all over the world told AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\nNo computers, no cars\n\nThe businessman said clients\u2019 patience was running out. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to lose them.\u201d\n\nJahangir Rasool, chief executive of internet provider STC, said he was detained by police for six days for keeping lines open for a few hours to help another company in his building that has clients in the United States.\n\nRasool said his firm and others have the firewalls and protocols to block social media or \u201cpolitical propaganda\u201d on the internet. But he said Indian authorities would not listen.\n\nRead More: US Senate body takes legislative action against India over Kashmir crisis\n\n\u201cThey sent police and intelligence agencies to inspect our systems. We told them that the IT sector will collapse (without the internet). They said: \u00b4Let it. We are not taking any risks\u00b4,\u201d declared the director of another company with clients in the Middle East.\n\nAuthorities have unblocked most landlines. But apart from 6,000 mobiles used by police and government officials, most of Kashmir\u00b4s 880,000 mobile connections and internet services remain suspended.\n\nState governor Satya Pal Malik in August said the lines were mainly useful as a \u201cweapon\u201d for \u201cterrorists and Pakistanis for mobilisation and indoctrination\u201d.\n\nRead More: Restrictions, communication blackout in Kashmir enters 62nd day\n\nSome IT companies have already laid off workers, many are preparing to move their business away from Kashmir.\n\nRasool at STC said his company had lost more than $2.8 million in business since August 5 and has laid off two thirds of its 370 employees.\n\n\u201cWe can\u00b4t function in a total blackout,\u201d said STC\u00b4s finance chief Abid Bhat who compared the shutdown to being \u201cblind\u201d.\n\nHigh-tech is not alone in its suffering.\n\nNot a single car or truck has been sold in two months by dealers across the Kashmir Valley, said Aawan Ahmad Narwaroo, head of one Srinagar car dealership.\n\nHe reckoned about 5,000 vehicles and motorbikes were sold in the same two months last year.\n\nRead More: UN chief reiterates concern over Kashmir situation\n\nOfficial records show no new vehicles have been registered with the authorities since August 5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collapse of Kashmir\u2019s economy. It\u00b4s not possible to calculate the snowballing losses,\u201d Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry vice president Nasir Hamid Khan told AFP.\n\n\u201cAbout 1,200 trucks carrying Kashmiri produce used to ply daily on the main highway out. Today we hear not even 100 do,\u201d Khan said.\n\nAt least three top business leaders were among thousands arrested after the August 5 clampdown. The executives are still in detention.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a top police officer told AFP the decision to reopen mobile and internet services would be taken by India\u2019s powerful Home Minister Amit Shah.\n\n\u201cHe (Shah) is asking for guarantees that no large scale protests will happen if the services are resumed. And there is no official here today confident enough to put his neck on the block,\u201d the police official said.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The coffee machines have been cold, computer screens blank and work stations empty for two months in Indian-occupied Kashmir's Silicon Valley.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kashmir-2-750x369-2-750x369-3-750x369-1-750x369-1-750x369-750x369-1-750x369-1-750x369-1-750x369-1-750x369-1-750x369.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
