And they knew when they found them that this was no ordinary find.\n\n\"They soon learned it was not simply treasure but a hoard of very valuable coins.\n\nSuch a quantity of coins of this kind would attract collectors from all over the world.\n\n\"They decided to treat the find as theirs and not to declare it to the landowner, the tenant farmer and the coroner. In short, they stole it.\n\n\"The hoard included a ring which has been looked at by a very eminent specialist from the British Museum who can tell us this is a ring from the ninth century. So a very ancient ring.\n\n\"There was also a crystal ball with some very fancy goldwork strips around it. It would have been worn as a pendant. This is from the fifth to sixth century.\n\n\"There was a large bracelet, the sort of thing that would have been worn on the upper arm.\n\n\"This is something which would have been made in the ninth century. There was a silver ingot, often used for melting down. It dates from the ninth century.", "description": "A group of metal detectorists stole Anglo Saxon coins worth \u00a33 million as well as \"invaluable\" ancient jewellery they found in a field before selling them on the black market, a court heard.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211956221-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhNkvlguSCLNAbLFJA3hmlxSyV74PnrmMVLeDsGCONQM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
