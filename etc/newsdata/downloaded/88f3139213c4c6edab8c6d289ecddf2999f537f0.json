And this isn\u2019t just your hippie aunt\u2019s stuff: High-tech fiddling with veggie-derived colors and fats means these products behave and taste a lot more like beef than the black-bean pucks of yore.\n\nOf course, the Impossible Burger is the Lizzo of the plant-based food market (i.e., so hot right now; also has juice), attracting such celebrity investors as Jay-Z and Serena Williams and earning the Harry Potter-meets-Twilight tagline \u201cthe one that bleeds.\u201d After being served up in some of the country\u2019s hottest restaurants (also in Burger King\u2019s Impossible Whopper), the company rolled out its packages in grocery stores late last month, meaning you can get in on the action from the comfort of your own kitchen.\n\n[This high-tech vegan ice cream may be good enough to fool even die-hard dairy lovers]\n\nImpossible is joining stock-market darling Beyond Meat in supermarkets \u2014 as well as some traditional meat-alternative brands that are getting more serious about their faux-beef game, too. While they might not all be as high-tech as Impossible, most similarly swap vegetable protein for cow and incorporate vegetable oils, juices and flavorings to more closely mimic red-meat properties.\n\nBut how close are they to the mark? We gathered some brave eaters for a burger tasting.\n\nOne good feature of these products is that you can shape them into patties yourself, whether you prefer steakhouse-like thick slabs or thin, smashable discs. (They also come in preformed patties, too, but I\u2019ve always found those to be disconcertingly factory perfect.) Of course, you can also use them for all the usual-suspect dishes, such as meatballs, sauces and tacos.\n\nBut to evaluate them, we kept things simple and stuck to the classic burger for our test, forming each into four-ounce patties with a uniform 3.5-inch diameter and cooking them according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.\n\nThe results were \u2014 well, mostly not great, with only one of the options turning out to be something we would feel really confident serving our friends. To be fair, they could be far better if they were gussied up with toppings and condiments (my kingdom for some aioli!), or even a liberal sprinkle of salt, all of which we eschewed to get to the essential burger-ness of each one. Here\u2019s what we found, starting with our least favorite and progressing to the winner.\n\n\n\nThe Lightlife burger.\n\n4. Lightlife Plant Based Ground\n\nLightlife is one of the OGs of plant-based protein. Founded in 1979 as Tempeh Works, the company has been making meat substitutes long before \u201cflexitarian\u201d was just a word to fling around in casual conversations. But Lightlife\u2019s ground product was our least favorite. Its pinky-orange hue was off-putting, bringing to mind a salmon patty for several samplers.\n\nThere was disagreement over the texture, with some praising (?) it as \u201cnot rubbery\u201d and others finding it disturbingly bouncy. \u201cLike the inside of a hot dog,\u201d said another, and not in a good way. Nobody liked the taste, though, which reduced us \u2014 professional wordsmiths! \u2014 to primary-school-speak. A sample? \u201cYuck.\u201d \u201cEw.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Sweet Earth burger.\n\n3. Sweet Earth Awesome Grounds\n\nThe flavor of Sweet Earth\u2019s new ground product was another \u201cnope\u201d for our testers.\n\nIts looks \u2014 another salmon-burger doppelganger \u2014 weren\u2019t making up for it, either. \u201cThis might be in the uncanny gap,\u201d one taster said, referring to the neurological phenomenon we experience when a robot looks alllmost human. Basically, we\u2019re creeped out.\n\nBut one comment suggested there was hope for this robo-burger: \u201ccould be okay with condiments.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Beyond burger.\n\n2. Beyond Beef\n\nSome of our tasters really dug the crust that the Beyond burger picked up in the pan. But others found the crunchy consistency of its interior \u2026 strange. The company reformulated its product last summer, adding bits of coconut oil and cocoa butter that emulate the white fat flecks that give ground beef flavor and juice. \u201cThe cross section looks like fossils trapped in rock,\u201d one eater observed, and another was turned off by the \u201cweird textured bits.\u201d\n\nAnd there was praise for its \u201cnice savory flavor\u201d that one categorized as \u201ca little beefy-tasting even.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Impossible Burger.\n\n1. Impossible Burger\n\nIt turns out, there\u2019s something to the hype: We all agreed that the Impossible Burger was the best of the bunch, and not just in a lesser-of-evils kind of way. \u201cI would serve this to veggie friends,\u201d declared one tester declared.\n\nOur culinary Sherlocks detected the product\u2019s much-lauded steaklike ooze. \u201cJuicy\u201d was the consensus about the patty, which struck a meatlike pose by having a convincingly slightly pink center and browned exterior.\n\nThe seasoning hit the right note, too. While others were bland, one taster enjoyed Impossible\u2019s \u201cdiscernible salt level.\u201d\n\nIn other words, finding a plant-based burger substitute is a task that\u2019s all but Impossible.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that the Impossible Burger\u2019s juice comes from beets. This version has been corrected.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s gets into the veggie burger game, testing a Beyond Meat patty in Canada\n\nThe key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world\n\nWe did it, America.
