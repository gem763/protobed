We\u2019re looking down. Everyone\u2019s nervous, everyone\u2019s excited,\u201d Jones told a news conference Friday. \u201cYou get down the first slope, you\u2019re not quite sure if you\u2019re going to throw up or hang on.\u201d\n\nJones\u2018 descriptive preview of England\u2019s opening game against Tonga on Sunday - and England\u2019s tournament at large - hinted at what\u2019s at stake for one of the Rugby World Cup\u2019s most experienced figures.\n\nJones has featured prominently in three previous World Cups; he took his native Australia to the final against England in 2003, and within a Jonny Wilkinson extra-time dropped goal of the title. He helped South Africa win as an assistant coach in 2007. He then caused the mightiest shock in tournament history when his Japan team beat the Springboks four years ago in England.\n\nIn 2019, he\u2019s a little uneasy, even if he\u2019s back in a country that\u2019s almost as familiar and dear to him as Oz.\n\nJones has nearly a decade of experience coaching in Japan, in club rugby as well as the national team. His mother is Japanese-American. His wife is Japanese. He\u2019s appearing on promotional videos for Japan\u2019s Rugby World Cup, the first in Asia. And local reporters here call him \u201cEddie-san.\u201d\n\nAll that\u2019s of little help now, he said. Probably because of the large lump of expectation he has on his shoulders this time after England made him reportedly the highest-paid coach in rugby in an attempt to win a first title since 2003 for the game\u2019s richest country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s an advantage,\u201d he said of his experience of Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how the team goes rather than how I feel.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s start to the World Cup is demanding: First, it\u2019s Tonga, a team bustling with big players, impressive physicality and desperate to restore some of its reputation after a 92-7 humbling at the hands of New Zealand in its last warmup this month. England plays the United States just four days later - a testing turnaround after the Tongan challenge - before finishing the group stage against two-time semifinalist Argentina and three-time finalist France. The group gives England no letup.\n\nSo, Jones\u2018 preparations and reputation will be tested in Japan after England recruited him in the wake of the country\u2019s home World Cup turning into a letdown and a group-stage exit in 2015.\n\n\u201cPhysically, I haven\u2019t seen the side any better,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s going to be some turns, there\u2019s going to be some accidents. There\u2019s going to be some fun. We want to enjoy all those things that come along and the team\u2019s equipped to handle it.\u201d\n\nEngland is almost full-strength and showing plenty of respect for Tonga at the Sapporo Dome, with Jones\u2018 team close to the lineup that beat Ireland 57-15 last month in a warmup game.\n\nCaptain Owen Farrell will start at 12, shifting infield to make space for George Ford at flyhalf. Scrumhalf Ben Youngs will play his 90th test. Jones also kept the loose-forward trio of Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Billy Vunipola together. Jones did bring combative lock Courtney Lawes into the second row alongside Maro Itoje.\n\nVunipola has strong Tongan roots - his parents are from the island and he still has family there - and it\u2019ll be the first time he plays against the team his father once captained.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be split loyalties with my family but in the country there definitely will be,\u201d he told the Rugby World Cup website \u201cand you cannot blame them because they want Tonga to win and I want England to win.\u201d\n\nTonga\u2019s inspiration for Sunday comes from two sources. Putting right that drubbing by the All Blacks may be the clearest. But there\u2019s another story for the Islanders. Loose forward Nasi Manu was named in the Tongan squad to face England and is in line for his first test since missing a year of rugby to undergo chemotherapy for testicular cancer.\n\n\u201cWe know that this is going to be a tough challenge,\u201d coach Toutai Kefu said, \u201cbut we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (captain), Jonny May, George Ford, Ben Youngs; Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Joe Marler.
