For 34 years the case has transfixed Britain as Bamber, now 58, continues to fight to clear his name .\n\nClutching his face, sporting newly dyed brown hair and howling, Freddie, who is the son of Day of the Jackal star Edward Fox - was the double of Bamber as he led the funeral procession with Mark Stanley who plays Colin Cafell, the father of the murdered children.\n\nFreddie is also seen in a tense courtroom scene as he watches evidence being given against him by brother in law Colin (Mark Stanley).\n\nCourtroom: Freddie is also seen in a tense courtroom scene as he watches evidence being given against him by brother in law Colin (Mark Stanley)\n\nTense: Mark is seen in character as Colin Caffell, the ex husband of Sheila Caffell and the father of murder victims Daniel and Nicholas, six\n\nUncanny: Mark bears a striking resemblance to Colin Caffell (R) the ex husband of murder victim Sheila Caffell\n\nBamber is one of the few prisoners in the UK who is serving a whole life prison term. He has always denied committing the crime,\n\nWhen he was convicted by majority verdict at Chelmsford Crown Court on October 28, 1986, he gave little reaction beyond slumping slightly in his seat.\n\nUnrecogisable: Sporting newly brunette hair, Freddie looked unrecognisable as he played the killer\n\nSentencing him to five life prison terms, judge Justice Drake said: 'I find it difficult to foresee whether it will ever be safe to release someone who can shoot two little boys as they lie asleep in their beds.'\n\nA country house which depicts the murder scene of White House Farm, near the village of Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, England, was also seen surrounded by police cars.\n\nThe six-part crime drama also stars Mark Addy as DS Stan Jones, Stephen Graham Gemma Whelan, Cressida Bonas (Doctor Thorne), Alfie Allen, Amanda Burton and Nicholas Farrell.\n\nSix part drama: A country house which depicts the murder scene of White House Farm, near the village of Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, England, was also seen surrounded by police cars\n\nVictims: Jeremy's adoptive sister Sheila Caffell, 28, was found shot dead with her six-year-old twins sons Daniel and Nicholas. This is believed to be their final photo together\n\nVictim: Essex Police initially believed that Sheila, who had mental health problems, had murdered her own family before turning the gun on herself but the prosecution disagreed\n\nTragedy: Jeremy's adoptive parents, Nevill and June Bamber,both aged 61 at the time of their deaths, were also killed in the massacre during the night of 6\u20137 August 1985\n\nBamber was accused of setting up Caffell and staging the killings so he could inherit a \u00a3436,000 family fortune.\n\nHis ex girlfriend Julie - who he split from one month after the murders - made statements saying Jeremy had told her he hired a hitman to kill his family before saying he had made clear his intentions to end the lives of his family to her on multiple occasions.\n\nA key piece of evidence in the trial was a silencer found in a gun cupboard in the downstairs of the house.\n\nPrison: Between 2002-2012 Bamber has launched several unsuccessful appeals to prove his innocence (pictured 2013)\n\nIt was argued that the extra length attached onto the rifle meant Caffell would not have been able to turn the gun on herself and then place it in the cupboard.\n\nThe jury was told there was blood on the silencer which came from Caffell and that there was red nail paint on a cupboard, indicating a struggle between herself and the attacker.\n\nBamber also claimed he had received a call from his father that night to say Sheila had 'gone berserk' with a gun.\n\nHe said that he alerted police and that Sheila fired a final shot while he spoke to officers outside the house.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Bamber's father had not made any call and that the only way Bamber would have known about the shootings was because he was the killer.\n\nBamber has claimed for many years that evidence was not disclosed to the defence by Essex police showing that two silencers had been examined by forensic scientists.\n\nIn September 2018 the CPS said: 'We have received correspondence relating to this case and requested additional material in order to respond to the points raised.'\n\n'Jeremy Bamber's conviction has been the subject of several appeals and reviews by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and there has never been anything to suggest that he was wrongly convicted.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Actor Freddie Fox looked unrecognisable as he transformed into family mass murderer Jeremy Bamber in first-look images from new drama White House Farm.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/10/19622624-0-image-a-39_1570872556685.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
