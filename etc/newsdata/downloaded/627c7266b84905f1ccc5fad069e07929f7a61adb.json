When Mr Jalbani protested, the doctor said the father was too poor to pay for a new needle.\n\nFour of Mr Jalbani\u2019s children have since tested positive for the virus and the two youngest have died.\n\nAnother parent whose three children contracted the disease after being treated by Dr Ganghro told Reuters the paediatrician \u201capplied the same drip on 50 children without changing the needle\u201d.\n\nDr Ganghro has not yet been convicted, and despite laws to deny bail to those accused of reusing syringes, is now working as a GP at a public hospital on the city\u2019s outskirts after renewing his medical certificate.\n\nHe has denied all accusations and insists he is innocent.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Some relatives also reportedly fear contracting the virus via physical contact with their children.\n\nA lack of literacy on the subject is not uncommon among poorer communities across much of Pakistan, where cases of HIV have nearly doubled since 2010 to 160,000, according to the United Nations\u2019 taskforce on HIV and Aids.\n\nAbout 600,000 unqualified doctors are thought to be unlawfully operating in the country, 270,000 of them in Sindh province where Ratodero is located, according to the United Nations joint programme on HIV and Aids\n\nThe Pakistani government responded to the crisis by shutting down clinics with unregistered doctors and illegal blood banks. It emerged many had been reusing syringes.\n\nBut as international and media attention waned, some clinics began to reopen.\n\nImran Akbar Arbani, the doctor who first identified the wave of sick children as an outbreak of HIV, told The New York Times: \u201cUnless these quack doctors, barbers and dentists are not checked, the number of incidents of HIV infection will continue going up.\u201d", "description": "Nearly 900 children in a Pakistani city have tested positive for HIV after a rogue paediatrician allegedly reused\u00a0infected syringes. About 200 adults have also\u00a0tested positive for the virus since the epidemic in Ratodero was confirmed in April. But health officials fear the true number affected\u00a0could be far higher, with less a quarter of city\u2019s 200,000 residents tested so far.", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/12/syringe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
