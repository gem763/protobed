He denounced Jacob Frey as a \u201cRadical Left\u201d lightweight and blasted the Democrat for a police policy banning officers from wearing their uniforms in support of political candidates. He sprinkled in a reference to his favorite foil \u2014 the city\u2019s Rep. Ilhan Omar \u2014 just for good measure.\n\n\u201cYawn,\u201d Frey tweeted back. \u201cWelcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors.\u201d\n\nIt was just a warmup to Trump\u2019s first campaign rally since being engulfed in the swirl of an impeachment investigation, an event expected to pack an extra punch. Heading to Omar\u2019s home turf, a liberal outpost in the Midwest, Trump quickly stirred up passions and partisanship as few politicians can.\n\nTrump will land in Minnesota as polls show Americans\u2019 support for impeachment and for removing him from office have ticked up in the weeks since House Democrats launched an impeachment investigation. While his GOP allies have launched a campaign to reverse the trend, Trump\u2019s self-defense may be the best preview of how he intends to fight back in the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cHe needs to be able to show right now, given all of this impeachment stuff, that America is rallying to his defense. And I don\u2019t think that that is going to be the optic that\u2019s created,\u201d said Ken Martin, the state Democratic chairman.\n\nBoth sides are tuned in to the symbolism of the moment. The rally at Target Center\u2014 the city\u2019s basketball arena\u2014 is expected to draw thousands of supporters as well as protesters outside. Trump will be joined by Vice President Mike Pence, who had a separate schedule of appearances in the state Trump is trying to tip his way next year.\n\nAt a White House event Wednesday, Trump made it clear he was looking forward to the rally.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great state, and we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun tomorrow night,\u201d he said.\n\nMinneapolis is a difficult place for the president to try to bask in the glow of support. Trump won just 18% of the vote in the dense, relatively diverse and liberal congressional district where he\u2019s staging his rally.\n\nBut the venue serves another purpose: The district is now held by Omar, the Somali-American lawmaker whom Trump often holds up as a symbol of the liberal shift in the Democratic Party. It\u2019s a message viewed as racist by some. He has tweeted that Omar should \u201cgo back\u201d to her home country if she wants to criticize the U.S. Trump supporters broke into chants of \u201cSend her back!\u201d at a rally this summer in North Carolina.\n\nThe episode is weighing heavily on Trump\u2019s Thursday rally. It drew criticism from fellow Republicans uncomfortable with the prospect of putting race at the center of the campaign.\n\nSome lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and some of the president\u2019s closest outside advisers privately warned Trump about the damage those chants could inflict on the GOP, according to four Republicans close to the White House who were not authorized to discuss private conversations. They believed the sight of thousands of mostly white attendees chanting \u201cSend her back!\u201d would dominate news coverage and turn off moderate voters, particularly women and suburbanites.\n\nTrump has held four rallies since. The chant has not erupted since.\n\nStill, the attacks on the \u201csocialist\u201d wing of the Democratic Party are the heart of Trump\u2019s plan to hold onto the Rust Belt and become the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972. Trump fell about 45,000 votes short of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton statewide in 2016. He\u2019s had staff in the state since June, and they have been busy building a network to turn out supporters next November.\n\nThe campaign needs to pump up Trump\u2019s support in the rural and suburban areas he carried in 2016 to overcome Democratic strength in Minneapolis, St. Paul and some other cities, plus suburbs that swung Democratic in 2018. The Minneapolis rally will also win media coverage well into western Wisconsin, widely seen as a critical battleground in 2020.\n\nGOP Rep. Tom Emmer, who leads the House Republican campaign arm and will attend the rally, said the opposition to Trump\u2019s visit could backfire on Democrats. Emmer was among Republicans accusing Frey of trying to block Trump\u2019s rally.\n\nFederal campaign law does not require presidential campaign committees to pay for expenses incurred by state and local governments in connection with a campaign event.\n\n\u201cI think this visceral hatred, the blatant attempt to shut down some people\u2019s point of view and deny thousands of Minnesotans their voice \u2026 I think Democrats are going to pay for it at the ballot box next November,\u201d Emmer said.\n\nIndeed, the rally plans provoked strong passions.\n\nOmar, whose family fled Somalia when she was a child and who became an American in 2000, tweeted shortly after the trip was announced: \u201cOur beautiful state welcomes everyone with open arms. But to be clear: we will continue to reject you and your campaign of lies and bigotry.\u201d\n\nSophia Jungers, 21, of Minneapolis, was planning to protest Thursday, just as she did when Trump rallied in the southern Minnesota city of Rochester last October.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re falling apart as a democracy, and we\u2019re not taking advantage of all the voices that need to be heard,\u201d said Jungers, a University of Minnesota student.\n\nMichelle Urevig-Grilz, 49, a teacher from suburban Ramsey who identified herself as a longtime Republican voter but a Trump opponent, said she was considering joining the protests.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a misogynist pig. He always has been. \u2026 And it is surprising to me how many women voters did vote for Trump. That\u2019s absolutely scary,\u201d she said.\n\nBut few of Trump\u2019s Minnesota supporters could be more excited than Mike Lindell, known to TV viewers nationwide as the \u201cMyPillow guy\u201d after the pillow company he founded.\n\nLindell, a significant donor who has appeared at previous Trump rallies, credits the president with creating a booming economy and giving entrepreneurs like him the confidence to take chances. He said he\u2019s scheduled to speak Thursday.\n\n\u201cEverybody voted for him on faith that there would be something good, finally, and boy has he provided it,\u201d Lindell said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The conflict and Twitter battles arrived in Minnesota well ahead of President Donald Trump's touchdown in the state.
