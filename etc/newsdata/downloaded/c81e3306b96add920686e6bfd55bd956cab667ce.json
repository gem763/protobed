But if they can't lead by example I think it's hard then to tell the private sector to do that.\"\n\nShe added the \"really cutting edge\" corporate firms will make changes to harness the talent of ex-prisoners, and smaller firms will be more agile, but will also have to weigh up the risks.", "description": "Hundreds of call centre workers are prisoners - as part of a programme to help offenders find work.", "authors": ["Jenny Rees", "Bbc Wales Home Affairs Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r2zxh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
