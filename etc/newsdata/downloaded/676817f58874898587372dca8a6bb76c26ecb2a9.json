People were spitting at him and stuff like that.\n\n\u2018I went to get the ball out of the goal after they scored the penalty and then a Yeovil player was telling their fans to calm down because the game might get called off, which obviously nobody wanted.\n\n\u2018I was with him, just telling them to calm down and that\u2019s when they started getting more aggressive and throwing stuff, swearing and all sorts and when I heard the racist comment, that\u2019s when I got upset and it all kicked off. The fan said \"black c\u201d word.\u2019\n\nHaringey goalkeeper Valery Pajetat points towards Yeovil supporters at Coles Park\n\nRowe, who was restrained from confronting the Yeovil supporters, added: \u2018I was in a bit of a trance. I was angry and upset, so wasn\u2019t really paying attention to what else was going on around me, then I felt someone pull me and it was my manager.\n\n\u2018He said, \u201cWe are all going off, we are not playing any more\u201d. Yeovil agreed and we left the pitch as one.\n\n\u2018We were in our separate changing rooms and there was a lot of back and forth between the FA, referees and what the options were. We said we didn\u2019t want to go back out because our safety couldn\u2019t be guaranteed, but not just that. It was just out of our own pride and respect. We are not going to go out and play in front of people like that.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not something new to me where I grew up and what\u2019s happened in my life. It hasn\u2019t shocked me. Obviously it is upsetting. The boys are taken aback because the whole situation exploded at once.\n\nHaringey players confront the travelling supporters during the FA Cup qualifying clash\n\n\u2018We just have to keep doing what we do and being who we are. We can\u2019t change for people who are uneducated and act like that.\u2019\n\nRowe disclosed that fear of punishment following the decision to walk off played no part in the Isthmian League Premier Division club\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t a worry at all,\u2019 he said. \u2018That was one of the first things that was said. We didn\u2019t care about the outcome, we just had to do what was right for the people who in the past or in the future may be too scared to do something like that. We just had to do what was right at that time. We\u2019ve been playing as a team and it\u2019s bigger than football, it\u2019s people\u2019s lives.\u2019\n\nThe Metropolitan Police are leading the investigation and are liaising with their counterparts at Avon and Somerset. The FA\u2019s on-field regulation team launched an investigation moments after the abandonment. The priority will be to establish the facts before any decision is made on the status of the match.\n\nThey have sought observations from the officials and both clubs and are in regular contact with the police.\n\nEngland's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria was halted twice due to racist abuse\n\nThere is an acceptance that this is a complex situation. At this stage, the prospect of either side being kicked out of the competition is unlikely. Although the FA are mindful of the seriousness of the allegations, a severe punishment against Yeovil could set a precedent that might leave matches open to opportunistic sabotage.\n\nThe National League side from Somerset said in a statement that they would co-operate \u2018with the authorities and our friends at Haringey Borough\u2019.\n\nThey added: \u2018We are aware there are allegations that racist comments were made in the crowd and this will be a key part of any investigation. Irrespective of the outcome of any investigations, we would like to make it clear that the club will not accept racism or discrimination in any form.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Bristol City are investigating claims that racist language was used in the away end during Saturday\u2019s Championship fixture at Luton Town. Luton are assisting the Robins with their enquiries. Both incidents come less than a week after a number of England players were racially abused during their 6-0 win in Bulgaria.", "description": "A Haringey defender says he was called a 'black c***' by a spectator during Saturday's abandoned FA Cup tie.
