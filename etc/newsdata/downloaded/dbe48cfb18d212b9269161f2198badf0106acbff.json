By agreeing to set up a meeting between Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and an Ukrainian presidential aide, he thought he could stop Trump cutting off ties with the new government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and keep US military aid flowing,\n\nTrump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nIt was a calculated gambit, but it did not come off. Volker is now fighting to defend his reputation against the impression \u2013 enthusiastically conveyed by Giuliani \u2013 that Volker was an integral part of Trump\u2019s parallel policy, which centered on digging for compromising material on former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cHe really tried to have his cake and eat it, thinking he could operate inside the administration with one foot outside, that would give him some flexibility. But those two things were incompatible,\u201d a former official said.\n\nA dapper, mild-mannered former ambassador to Nato, Volker\u2019s role as special envoy was unpaid and part time. He remained head of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University. The name alone would have normally been enough for Trump to veto his appointment. The institute is named after the late Arizona senator, John McCain, a traditional Republican foreign policy hawk who Trump despised, even after his death from cancer.\n\nHowever, Volker was hired by former secretary of state Rex Tillerson at a time when Tillerson still had some autonomy and the appointment appears to have gone below Trump\u2019s personal radar.\n\n\u201cVolker was honestly trying to see if he could help move things along in terms of peace negotiations to get the Russians to move on Ukraine,\u201d said Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, now at Georgetown University, who has known Volker for many years. \u201cHe never signed a never-Trump letter, because I think precisely he didn\u2019t want to be the position where if somebody needed his expertise, he couldn\u2019t give it.\n\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019m sure he would never have believed at the beginning that it would have involved brokering meetings for the president\u2019s personal lawyer with individuals in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSteven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine, said: \u201cGiuliani playing on the sidelines made the job much more difficult, with two policies, one in the US national interest, and the other aimed at promoting Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating the picture, Volker had remained a senior international adviser to a Washington lobbying group, BGR. BGR and the McCain Institute had financial ties to Raytheon Co, which makes the Javelin anti-tank missile that the US supplied to Ukraine. BGR has said he had recused himself from any issues related to the company\u2019s work on Ukraine.\n\nUltimately it was not conflict of interest questions that brought Volker down, but the incompatibility of seeking to pursue conventional Republican foreign policy in the midst of the chaos of the Trump administration, where at least two policies were being pursued on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYou had Kurt Volker going everywhere saying we have to be tough on Russia and help the Ukrainians, and the president saying we should have nothing to do with the Ukrainians [because] they are so corrupt,\u201d a European diplomat in Washington said. \u201cThis is a bigger issue. There are traditional diplomats who are considering the role of their country in a traditional way, and the higher levels of the administration that are not really engaged.", "description": "Before abruptly resigning Kurt Volker gambled that acting as a go-between for Rudy Giuliani could secure military aid for Kyiv", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af9628d4f7d7fa6bc26de1baaf182ea911b000f/0_33_2824_1695/master/2824.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7d273a8ba2d2cebbccf4d7030ac470ac"}
