Time\n\nBlue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York, has made its debut on the acclaimed Michelin Guide list for 2020, announced Monday.\n\nThe restaurant, which pioneered farm-to-table dining when it opened in 2004, received two stars.\n\n\"We are thrilled,\" said Irene Hamburger, vice president, Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns.\n\n\"Chef Dan Barber\u2019s onslaught of clever bites of mostly vegetables are plucked from the property\u2019s greenhouses and working farm. The kitchen serves excellent cuisine with a distinct personality in its stunning dining room that was formerly a dairy barn,\" noted the Michelin press release.\n\nIn addition to Blue Hill, the restaurant Atomix in Manhattan also earned a new two-star rating for its fresh take on Korean dining. The 2020 Michelin Guide New York City and Westchester County also names eight new one-star destinations: Benno, Crown Shy, Estela, The Four Horsemen, Le Jardinier, Odo, Oxalis and Ukiyo.\n\nThe New York guide is one of four editions; the others are Chicago; Washington, D.C.; and California.\n\nMore: These are the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurants in the world\n\nBlue Hill sits in a former dairy barn on 80 acres of land donated by the Rockefeller family. It works in tandem with a farm and education center, Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture, which is also on the property.\n\nBarber is known for consistently seeking out eco-friendly and low-waste practices to enhance his menus, and for working with seed breeders at the genetic level to develop more nutritious and delicious fruit and vegetables.\n\nEarlier this year, the restaurant was named among the World's Best 50 Restaurants for the fourth year in a row. It has hosted many celebrities, including Michelle Obama and Scarlett Johansson, who held her engagement party there.\n\nWhat to know before you go\n\nPlan ahead \u2014 as in, way ahead \u2014 if you want to dine there. Reservations are made starting at 9 a.m. two months prior to the calendar date for parties of up to eight through the website and can\u2019t be canceled (though they are transferable through the website).\n\nSimilarly, don't expect your standard menu. The experience, as it's referred to, is $278 per person exclusive of beverage and tax, and includes whatever is in season and available on the farm that day. Sample menus, are, however, on the website.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2019/10/22/blue-hill-gets-2-michelin-stars-know-before-you-go/2450159001/", "description": "Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County, New York, has earned two Michelin stars.
