Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?\u201d\n\nWarren emphatically thanked the singer for his glowing endorsement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful down to my toes for your support, @johnlegend! Looking forward to the day @chrissyteigen doesn\u2019t have to fight with the president of the United States on Twitter,\u201d she said.\n\nI'm grateful down to my toes for your support, @johnlegend! Looking forward to the day @chrissyteigen doesn't have to fight with the president of the United States on Twitter. https://t.co/bLdlaUcW4z \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 29, 2019\n\nThe presidential hopeful\u2019s remark harkens to the ongoing beef Teigen has carried out with the president on Twitter, openly expressing her disdain for the Trump in tweets to her 12 million Twitter followers.\n\nSparks flew in September after Trump tweeted about Legend\u2019s participation in a criminal justice reform town hall on NBC, blasting \u201cboring musician @johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife\u201d for essentially ignoring his role in getting it done.\n\n\u201cGuys like boring musician John Legend and his filthy-mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2014 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u2026.A man named @VanJones68, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n\u2026..the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it\u2026And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nTeigen responded by calling the president a \u201cpussy ass bitch\u201d for not tagging her in the tweet.\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch pic.twitter.com/9ZkV7bh4FA \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nTeigen, in the Vanity Fair interview, also called for jail time for the \u201cwhole\u201d Trump family.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he\u2019s impeached will be, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to be there anyway.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Sen.
