They could also be soldiers that died in battle. \u201cThe necropolis in which they were found could indeed be a war cemetery,\u201d said Luigi.\n\nThe Modena Civic Archaeological Museum also notes that the skeletons may be brothers in arms, as burials of two male warriors were sometimes buried together in the late ancient period.\n\nSTUNNING \u2018SENSUAL\u2019 QUEEN FRESCO DISCOVERED IN POMPEII\n\nGenetic research will be undertaken to find out whether the two men are related, the museum said.\n\nItaly continues to reveal new details of its rich ancient history.
