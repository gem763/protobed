Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on Thursday introduced a resolution backed by more than 40 GOP senators excoriating House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, accusing Democrats of violating due process for interviewing key witnesses behind closed doors. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced the five-page resolution that includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as a co-sponsor on Thursday afternoon.\n\nReflecting on Graham\u2019s antics, the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank asked, \u201cCould he be any more shameful?\u201d I\u2019m tempted to answer in the negative, but the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman keeps finding new ways to embarrass himself.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s tempting to write a point-by-point takedown of everything Graham said during his unfortunate press conference yesterday afternoon. I\u2019m inclined to write a long, tiresome piece explaining in excruciating detail that there\u2019s nothing scandalous about the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry; Graham is surely aware of that; he\u2019s contradicting his own stated principles; Graham\u2019s rhetoric about due process doesn\u2019t make any sense at all; and he appears unusually pitiful doing the bidding of a president who recently felt the need to remind Graham that he\u2019s his \u201cboss.\u201d\n\nBut for now, let\u2019s put those relevant considerations aside and consider a more practical detail: the number of co-sponsors on Graham\u2019s pointless resolution.\n\nAs of this morning, 44 Senate Republicans have signed on as original co-sponsors of Graham\u2019s non-binding resolution denouncing the House\u2019s impeachment process. There are currently 53 Senate Republicans in total, which means all but eight of the GOP members in the chamber have linked arms with Graham in support of this misguided measure.\n\n(The eight, in case you\u2019re curious, are Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Lamar Alexander, Johnny Isakson, Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski, and Mike Enzi.)\n\nGraham has said he actually has 46 co-sponsors lined up, though it\u2019s not yet clear who the other two supporters are.\n\nAnd why does this tally matter? For one thing, it tells us that Graham\u2019s resolution doesn\u2019t yet have the votes to pass, which isn\u2019t great news for the White House.\n\nOn the other hand, if the House impeaches Donald Trump in the near future \u2013 an outcome I consider a near certainty \u2013 the matter would go to the Senate for a trial. If every member of the Senate Democratic conference votes to remove the president from office \u2013 which is by no means a certainty \u2013 they would need to be joined by 20 of the Senate\u2019s 53 Republicans on at least one count.\n\nAs things stand, somewhere between six and eight GOP senators balked at Lindsey Graham\u2019s ridiculous resolution. With this in mind, the odds of 20 Senate Republicans agreeing to remove Trump from office are poor.\n\n* Update: I\u2019ve amended this post to note Graham\u2019s co-sponsor tally.", "description": "44 Senate Republicans signed on to Lindsey Graham's ridiculous resolution criticizing the House impeachment process.
