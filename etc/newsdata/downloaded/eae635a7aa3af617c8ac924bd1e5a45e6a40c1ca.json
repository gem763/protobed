The seven-time defending NL West champion Dodgers, who led the NL with 106 wins, remain without a World Series title since 1988.\n\nAdam Eaton walked against Kelly leading off the 10th, Rendon doubled on a drive that lodged in the left field wall and Soto was intentionally walked.\n\nKendrick fouled off a pitch, then hit a 97 mph fastball just over the wall in center for his second career slam. The other one was a game-ending, 11th-inning drive against San Francisco in August 2017.\n\nDaniel Hudson got the win, retiring Will Smith on a drive to the right field warning track with one on and one out in the ninth, then getting Chris Taylor on a liner to center.\n\nSean Doolittle pitched the 10th for the Nationals.\n\nThe Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise won a postseason series for only the second time, the first since the Expos beat Philadelphia in a 1981 Division Series caused by the midseason players' strike.\n\nCARDINALS 13, BRAVES 1\n\nIn Atlanta, the Cardinals turned the diamond into a giant pinball machine, dinging hits all over SunTrust Park. By the time the Atlanta Braves finally got the third out, it was the most productive first inning in postseason history.\n\nThe Cardinals scored 10 runs their first time up and dealt Atlanta another playoff heartbreak, routing the Braves 13-1 in decisive Game 5 of the NL Division Series on Wednesday.\n\n\"That was crazy,\" said Marcell Ozuna, one of five players who batted twice in the stunning outburst. \"We got a good opportunity \u2014 and we took it.\"\n\nAfter pitching seven scoreless innings in a Game 2 win, Mike Foltynewicz retired only one hitter before getting yanked. First baseman Freddie Freeman booted a potential double-play ball that might have limited the damage. The Cardinals scored their final run of the inning on a strikeout \u2014 a wild pitch in the dirt that skipped away from catcher Brian McCann.\n\n\"We just strung together a bunch of great at-bats,\" Wong said.\n\nIt was Atlanta's 10th straight postseason round loss since its last victory 18 long years ago, tying the ignominious mark set by the Chicago Cubs between 1908 and 2003.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
