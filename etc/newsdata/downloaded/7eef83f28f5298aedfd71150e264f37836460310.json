In their latest win, they proved they have the potential to be a threat with all four lines.\n\nMark Stone and William Carrier each had a goal and an assist and Marc-Andre Fleury made 33 saves to lead the Golden Knights past the Calgary Flames 6-2 Saturday night.\n\nTomas Nosek, Paul Stastny, Ryan Reaves and rookie Cody Glass also scored to help Vegas remain undefeated at home against the Flames. All three forwards on the fourth line scored and 12 players had at least one point.\n\n\u201cWhen you get your team going like we had tonight, all four lines contributed, that\u2019s a big part \u2026 you\u2019re excited when you see that,\u201d said Vegas coach Gerard Gallant, who is now one win shy of his 250th. \u201cNot too often our so-called fourth line are gonna get three goals in a game, but they went out there, they did their jobs, they kept the game simple, they worked really hard \u2026 they did their job and they got rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nSince the Golden Knights joined the NHL in 2017, Calgary is winless in five visits to T-Mobile Arena while being outscored 21-6.\n\nFleury, who went 2-0-0 with a 0.50 goals-against average and a .984 save percentage last season against the Flames, improved to 13-4-1 in his career against Calgary.\n\nWith regular backup Malcolm Subban nursing an undisclosed lower-body injury, Fleury figures to have a heavy workload ahead of him with Vegas playing six games over the next 10 days. Vegas recalled goaltender Oscar Dansk from Chicago of the AHL earlier Saturday.\n\nThe Golden Knights will endure their first back-to-back situation, as they travel to play in Los Angeles on Sunday, but Gallant said he would confer with goalie coach Dave Prior before deciding on his starting netminder against the Kings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to it, it\u2019s gonna be a tough game,\u201d Gallant said. \u201cL.A. had a real good game today \u2026 they\u2019ll be on a high tomorrow. We\u2019ll go in there tonight, no morning skate tomorrow and get ready for a game tomorrow night and it should be a real good hockey game. They\u2019re playing real well this year, doing a real good job.\u201d\n\nVegas found its offense at the right time, with back-to-back Pacific Division opponents on deck, after losing to Boston on Tuesday and at Arizona on Thursday.\n\n\u201cA little scrambly for us the last couple of games, so we had to just get back to playing simple hockey,\u201d Reaves said. \u201cBut being in position for each other and getting in on the puck and reloading and getting out of piles properly is something that we talked about and it definitely showed today.\u201d\n\nRasmus Andersson and Johnny Gaudreau scored for Calgary. David Rittich stopped 24 shots in his fifth straight start, and dropped to 2-4 with a 3.67 goals against average in six starts against Vegas.\n\nCalgary coach Bill Peters wasn\u2019t pleased with his team\u2019s effort, as it was thoroughly outplayed after Andersson and Gaudreau gave the Flames a 2-1 lead early in the second period.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play hard enough,\u201d Peters said. \u201cUntil we start to play hard, and play hard for 60 minutes, it\u2019s going to be up in the air all night long or you\u2019re going to get blown out. \u2026 We\u2019re disappointed the way we\u2019ve played.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Vegas has benefited from a well-balanced offense, including a fourth line that has eight points (six goals, two assists) in five games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be the best fourth line in the league,\u201d Carrier said. \u201cShift after shift, whatever the team needs - a big hit, tonight it was a goal, but it could be anything out there - we\u2019re just trying to be the best fourth line out there.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Calgary backup G Cam Talbot will make his Flames debut Sunday, when Calgary finishes up a three-game trip at San Jose. \u2026 Vegas D Brayden McNabb played in his 400th career game. \u2026 The game marked the first showdown between the Stone brothers, since Michael\u2019s younger sibling, Mark, was traded to Vegas from Ottawa last season. \u2026 Oakland Raiders rookie running back Josh Jacobs cranked the opening-game siren. \u2026 Mark Stone has a point in four of Vegas\u2019 first five games and is one assist shy of 200 in his career. \u2026 Gaudreau played in his 399th game and is expected to play in his 400th Sunday in San Jose. . Stastny\u2019s registered his 26th career goal and 63rd point against Calgary - both career highs against an opponent.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlames: At San Jose on Sunday.\n\nGolden Knights: At Los Angeles on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Vegas Golden Knights came into the season with one of the best top-six forward units in the NHL.
