Now, it may have to stand up to one of nature\u2019s most forceful visitors.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHurricane Dorian, excepted to slam the United States\u2019 southeast coast Monday, between Palm Beach and southern Georgia, could bring torrential rain and winds in excess of 150 mph.\n\nThe as-of-Friday Category 3 hurricane \u2014 which could be upgraded to Category 4 by landfall \u2014 is forecast to be so big that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties of the state.\n\nTrump approved that declaration Friday.\n\nWhile former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell tweeted (and then deleted and apologized) that she hoped Hurricane Dorian would make \u201ca direct hit on Mar a Lago!\u201d expert predictions on the possibility of Dorian crashing into the president\u2019s $160 million summer White House vary.\n\nDan Kottlowski, a senior meteorologist and lead hurricane forecaster at AccuWeather, said it\u2019s possible Dorian could hit the resort, but if it \u201creally slows down \u2026 it may start turning northward [and] if it fails to move to the coast by Tuesday,\u201d then it may \u201cnever make landfall even close to West Palm beach.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Kottlowski stressed Mar-a-Lago is \u201cnot out of the woods.\u201d And a direct hit would be costly.\n\nTrump bought the 62,500-square-foot mansion, decked out with 126 extravagant rooms, for about $10 million in 1985, per Forbes. The value has since increased 16-fold, beating out the S&P 500, which has returned just 12 times that amount in the same time frame.\n\nThe club\u2019s revenue reached an estimated $29 million in 2016, up a whopping 25% from the year prior. Estimates state it\u2019s worth $10 million more than when before Trump was elected.\n\nBut the president has faith in his investment: \u201cIt would look like Mar-a-Lago is dead-center,\u201d he told reporters before leaving for Camp David Friday night, \u201cbut Mar-a-Lago can handle itself. That\u2019s a very powerful place. The thing I\u2019m worried about is the state of Florida \u2026 this could be a record-setting hurricane.\u201d\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, the storm was centered about 625 miles east of West Palm Beach, heading northwest at 10 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMajor cruise lines Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian have started rerouting ships. Airlines are canceling flights and changing passengers\u2019 reservations. And the U.S. Navy ordered dozens of its warships and aircraft to evacuate two bases in northeast Florida.\n\nJeff Byard, a FEMA associate administrator, said Dorian could \u201ccreate a lot of havoc\u201d with infrastructure, power and roads. \u201cThis is going to be a big storm,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe're prepared for a big response.\u201d\n\nFloridians and all those in Dorian\u2019s projected path should be prepared.\n\n\u201cWhat we're telling people, anywhere from Miami to Cape Canaveral, even up to Jacksonville, is to evacuate,\u201d Kottlowski said. \u201cAnd everybody should have a hurricane plan. They should have provisions that will enable them to get through several days. People should not let their guard down.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "It's \u201cnot out of the woods,\" Dan Kottlowski, a senior meteorologist and lead hurricane forecaster at AccuWeather, told Fox Business.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
