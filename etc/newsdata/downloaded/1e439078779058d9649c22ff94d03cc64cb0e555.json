He has shown some good moments. We must give him a bit of time to adapt because of youth, change of league and living.\n\n\u201cThey are all different, have different pathways. We know he has played in the Champions League.\u201d\n\nOn a positive note for Chelsea, Pulisic is far from the only emerging talent that they have on their books at present.\n\nNorwich vs Chelsea, Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount\n\nA number of academy graduates, including a few teenage debutants , also figured against Grimsby.\n\nThe likes of Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount have been leading the way in 2019-20 , as they see regular game time in the Premier League, and Lampard is pleased with the progress being made by the Blues\u2019 stars of the present and future.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think the fact we are seeing a great number of them on the pitch speaks for itself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a group yes, there is a lot of work ahead of them. The step into the first team is the easier one, now it\u2019s about staying in it.\n\n\u201cThey all seemed very comfortable [against Grimsby]. It was a different game to a Premier League game, but they are confident lads. They have every grounding and base needed.\u201d\n\nNext up for Chelsea is a home date with Brighton on Saturday, with it likely that a number of youngsters will figure once again.\n\nReece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi made welcomes returns to action after injury against Grimsby, but Lampard does have a number of other players stuck on the treatment table.\n\nPressed for a fitness update, he said: \u201c[Antonio] Rudiger, out. Toni has got a recurring injury in the groin, he still has some pain.\n\n\u201cAndreas [Christensen], should be okay. A bit of pain but not a risk.\n\n\u201cOlivier [Giroud], yes he is over his illness. It left him pretty weak and he has got some strength.\n\n\u201cEmerson, other side of international break with hamstring.\n\n\u201cRuben [Loftus-Cheek], no date but he is jogging outside.\u201d", "description": "The Blues boss sees plenty of potential in the USA international but admits he is still finding his feet following a summer switch to Stamford Bridge", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FJjxKlxdf.EFYvqEvb046Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j1Rdap01WFNA5IEPaufN0g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/2de90e3d5cf3612c815110f3d83cef3c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
