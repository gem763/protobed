She was a huge influence in my career as a heptathlete, and just to be on teams with her at the Beijing World Championships, after she came back from having a child, that was absolutely amazing.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Her father Eldon was a national standard triple jumper, and he played the role of coach up until she left home for Loughborough University at 18. \u201cHe\u2019s still involved, still has a keen interest in how I\u2019m doing and how my training\u2019s going, so that helps. He\u2019s been a huge influence, he coached me from when I first started athletics when I was five up until the Rio Olympic Games, so that\u2019s a major part of career. He was a big role model.\u201d\n\nNow 22, she has quietly developed into one of Britain's outstanding talents in her own right. Two years after the London Games she won World Junior gold medals in both the heptathlon and high jump, outstripping even Ennis-Hill's feats at that age, before reaching the Olympic high jump final in Rio where she finished 10th, still a teenager. Last year she announced herself on the senior stage by winning silver medals at the Athletics World Cup in London and the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It's why Lake and her coach have plotted a route into athletics focusing on the high jump, by far her strongest suit, as she builds ultimately to the Olympics Games in Tokyo next summer. For now, the heptathlon can wait.\n\nBesides, there is little time for much else. Lake is studying for a psychology degree around her training, where a typical day is a little different to the average student: down at the track at 9am, a hard afternoon in the gym, then catching up on uni work before dinner. \"It\u2019s definitely a bit of a balancing act,\u201d she says. \u201cLuckily at Loughborough I get the opportunity to split my modules in half so I haven\u2019t got as much work load. And it\u2019s quite good to get my mind off training as well, not constantly thinking about it, so I\u2019ve got something else to focus on.\"\n\nWhile it takes up plenty of her time, Lake says her degree isn't entirely distinct from her career. \"Goal-setting, mindfulness, visualisation \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of small things which are transferable to sport. I definitely want to do something with psychology. I haven\u2019t completely decided what it would be, but it\u2019s definitely a future interest after athletics.\"\n\nHopefully life after athletics is a long way away yet, with a stellar career waiting in between. Making the transition from sensational junior, when records tumbled beneath her, to the senior stage has not always been easy. Injuries have severely hampered Lake\u2019s progress and she is having to learn quickly from the competitions she\u2019s fit to compete in, like the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow earlier this year.\n\n\u201cGlasgow\u2019s a weird one,\u201d she says. \u201cI came in quite good form, I got the British record earlier in the season. I\u2019ve been jumping quite regularly in the mid 1.90s, so I felt quite confident going into the competition. I had a bit of a rocky qualification to the final, and then when I got to the final I put too much pressure on myself and tensed up, and I wasn\u2019t jumping the way I have been all season.\n\n\u201cI was thinking too much about the end goal rather than the process, so I was just thinking about getting a medal. High jump is one of those competitions where you have to take it stage by stage, you have to focus on each height as it comes, you can\u2019t just think about the end result. I\u2019ve definitely learned from that, and I guess it\u2019s better to learn these things now, before the World Championships, so I\u2019m trying to take the positives out of it and learn from what went wrong.\u201d\n\nIt is a policy of self-reflection that has stood Lake in good stead so far in her career. Heptathlon remains the ultimate goal but for now the target is to push for a medal in a highly competitive high jump field. Emulating Ennis-Hill might be an unfair expectation on young shoulders, but if there is a London legacy it is surely that future British stars like Lake and her close friend Dina Asher-Smith are setting no limits on what they can achieve.\n\nTo find out more about Morgan Lake, go to her athlete profile on redbull.com", "description": "Morgan Lake remembers exactly where she was when Jessica Ennis-Hill clinched Olympic gold.
