By half-time, he had banged in his third.\n\nBilliat ended the opening half as a contest when he netted prior to the break.\n\nSundowns had their own attempts at goal, with their closest scoring effort coming off a well-taken free kick by Lyle Lakay, but were denied by Chiefs\u2019 goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi.\n\nMosimane reinforced the second half with Meza up front, Sirino and Hlompho Kekana in midfield, and Tebogo Langerman and Anele Ngcongca in defence.\n\nThe move injected renewed energy into Sundowns\u2019 attacks, but wiping off the deficit proved to be a near-impossible task, further compounded by a series of missed opportunities.\n\nIn the end, Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp handed his counterpart Mosimane a hammering which has certainly spiced up the teams\u2019 league clash in a fortnight.\n\nSundowns won the inaugural tournament last year 2-1.", "description": "Kaizer Chiefs (4) 4; Sundowns (0) 2", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae At Fnb Stadium"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9468/b1e61eb8e36e42db9bba93a7602dd2a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
