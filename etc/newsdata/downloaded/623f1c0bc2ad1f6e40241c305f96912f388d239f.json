WeWork's board \u2014 made up of a majority of independent directors \u2014 will choose Neumann's successor as CEO, instead of a succession committee as previously planned.\n\nThe filing also addresses concerns about Neumann's control of WeWork, recent stock sales, and his family's involvement in the company:\n\nNeumann controls the lion's share of WeWork voting rights, raised $700 million by selling and borrowing against his company's stock, and even charged the company nearly $6 million for the \"We\" trademark.\n\nHe partly or fully owns property companies that lease four properties to WeWork, raising a potential conflict of interest as he's both the landlord and the tenant. He makes millions through this arrangement, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWeWork paid one of Neumann's immediate family members to host eight company-related events last year, and it employs another as its head of wellness.\n\nHis cofounder and wife, Rebekah, serves as chief brand and impact officer, and she was previously a member of the succession committee.\n\nIn the amended filing, WeWork slashes the voting rights attached to Neumann's \"high-vote stock,\" making it worth 10 votes a share instead of 20 and falling to one vote a share if he becomes permanently incapacitated or dies.\n\nNeumann has agreed to limit the amount of stock he can sell in the second and third year after the IPO to no more than 10% of his shareholdings. He will also pay back any profits he makes from his real-estate transactions with the company.\n\nWeWork has also pledged that none of Neumann's family members will sit on its board.", "description": "WeWork has announced it will list its shares on the Nasdaq index.
