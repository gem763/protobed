Long live the Queen of Corpulence!' Katmai National Park and Preserve said on its Facebook page, which featured photographs of salmon-fattened Katmai brown bears.\n\nBrown bears and Grizzly bears are technically the same species of bear, with the differentiation being that brown bears tend to be more coastal.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Fat Bear Week Alaska announced on Tuesday that grizzly Holly is the latest winner of the viral internet competition\n\nKatmai, in southwestern Alaska, is known for its brown bears, which grow to massive sizes by gorging on salmon. Holly, who did not have cubs this year to distract her, had an especially big finish to the season.\n\n'She\u00b4s just a great bear. When she doesn\u00b4t have cubs, she looks like the Michelin Man,' said Naomi Boak, a Katmai Conservancy media ranger who has been managing this year\u00b4s Fat Bear Week event.\n\nHolly, who won in a field of 12 contenders, has been single-minded this year in her pursuit of salmon at Brooks Falls, the park\u00b4s best-known bear-gathering spot.\n\n'She doesn\u00b4t stop fishing. It was really hard to get pictures of her because she just doesn\u00b4t get out of the water,' Boak said.\n\nHolly, who won in a field of 12 contenders, has been single-minded this year in her pursuit of salmon at Brooks Falls, the park\u00b4s best-known bear-gathering spot\n\n'She doesn\u00b4t stop fishing. It was really hard to get pictures of her because she just doesn\u00b4t get out of the water,' ' said Naomi Boak, a Katmai Conservancy media ranger\n\nFat Bear Week, an event that combines tongue-in-cheek competition with science education, highlights the Katmai bears\u00b4 preparation for winter hibernation.\n\nBears typically lose a third of their body weight during their winter sleep, so the body fat they accumulate in summer and fall is crucial to survival. Thanks to Katmai\u00b4s bounty of salmon, along with its abundant berries, the park\u00b4s male bears can eat their way to more than 1,000 pounds and females to about two-thirds that weight before they retreat to their hibernation dens in the mountains.\n\nEven before this year\u00b4s Fat Bear Week, Holly was well-known to fans of Alaska wildlife. She has been a regular to millions of viewers who watch footage from the livestream 'bear cam' at Brooks Falls that was set up and is operated by the site Explore.org.\n\nEven before this year\u00b4s Fat Bear Week, Holly was well-known to fans of Alaska wildlife\n\nHolly was already famous for adopting a yearling cub that had been abandoned by its mother. Adoption is 'very, very unusual' among brown bears, Boak said, prompting Holly's bear-cam followers to dub her 'Supermom.'\n\nAlthough she had no cubs this year, Holly has offspring, including another adult female with cubs of her own. The three generations spent much of the summer at Brooks Falls, Boak said.\n\nAs well as the bears\u00b4 bodies, Fat Bear Week\u00b4s following also swelled this year. There were about 187,500 online votes cast in the 2019 competition, more than three times as many votes tallied in last year\u00b4s Fat Bear Week. The event gained a following in schools across the United States, after teachers incorporated Katmai\u00b4s fat bears into lesson plans.", "description": "This year\u00b4s champion fat fan favorite is Holly, organizers of the event said late Tuesday, with the winner selected by popular vote based on photos displayed on Facebook.", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19501754-0-image-a-48_1570640416797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
