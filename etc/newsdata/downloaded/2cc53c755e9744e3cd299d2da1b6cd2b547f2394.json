The drop of 4.71% in the past 24 hours overtook that of 4.47% in the past week.\n\nHowever, the top 10 coins list in general doesn\u2019t look good today, while bitcoin dropped to almost USD 8,000. After the green we\u2019ve seen last week, the middle of this one is very much red. Only three coins have appreciated since last Wednesday, these being Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Bitcoin SV (BSV), though their percentages are quite low too.\n\nTo shortly recap the recent developments in the Ethereum world: the annual Devcon conference organized by the Ethereum Foundation was held last week, producing a number of discussions on the transition to Ethereum 2.0, as well as a mission for ETH developers, and the price climbed from USD 171 on October 6th to above the USD 190 a few days later, probably making a lot of people happy. The rise was likely also fuelled by the opinion of the new Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Heath Tarbert, that ETH is a commodity.\n\nThis growth can be seen on the 7-day chart, reaching its highest price for that period of time on October 11th with USD 195. This price was last seen on September 24 during the drop from the 30-day high of USD 222.98. An interesting development shown by charts is the gradual drop from USD 187 yesterday, followed by a sudden and steep drop in just the last few hours from USD 180 to its current level, though it\u2019s still unclear why.\n\nETH price chart:\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s Sentscore, a market sentiment measure, has gone up 11.4% in a week, and it was one of the coins with the highest overall scores. As a matter of fact, the score rose by another 0.8% since yesterday, going from 5/10 to 5.2.\n\nMeanwhile, with these latest developments, crypto trader and analyst Nick Cote tweeted how there are no signals for the bull market to be seen at the moment.", "description": "After failing to stay at USD 190 level last week, the price of ethereum (ETH) continued to drop and is now below USD 180.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/723318d3fa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
