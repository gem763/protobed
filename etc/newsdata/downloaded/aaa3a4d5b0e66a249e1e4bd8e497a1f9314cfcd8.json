Rental has to be the answer, as it allows you to really enjoy fashion without wearing it once and throwing it away. It hasn\u2019t broken through to the mainstream yet, but people are accepting it as something that\u2019s a possibility.\u2019\n\nWhen bought new, the items range in value from a couple of hundred pounds to thousands for designer dresses by high-end brands such as Victoria Beckham, but a week\u2019s rental is typically a tenth of the price.\n\nWomen in their 50s and 60s looking for outfits to wear at weddings, parties and work are said to form a significant proportion of the market, while others just don\u2019t want to add to the piles of clothes cluttering up their wardrobe.\n\nMiss Shepherdson revealed she started renting clothes when she was invited to an event at Buckingham Palace. She said: \u2018I could either wear something I already had, spend \u00a31,000 on something new or I could rent. It was an obvious thing to do.\u2019\n\nThe rental firms claim their process is similar to buying and returning clothes when shopping online. Some also offer insurance for damage, such as drink stains.\n\nWomen in their 50s and 60s looking for outfits to wear at weddings, parties and work are said to form a significant proportion of the market (file image)\n\nMika Simmons, an actress who has appeared in a number of ITV and Channel 4 dramas, is a renting convert after trying the service for a red carpet event. \u2018I\u2019d rather rent than wear a dress that I\u2019m only going to wear once and which harms the environment,\u2019 said the 44-year-old, who hosts the Happy Vagina podcast about women\u2019s health.\n\nThe UK\u2019s fashion rental companies are hoping to mirror the success of US firm Rent The Runway, which has millions of users.\n\nAnna Bance, founder of one of the UK\u2019s biggest rental firms, Girl Meets Dress, said: \u2018When we launched in 2009 during the recession it was about saving money. Now a key reason our customers rent is sustainability.\u2019\n\nWhile it stocks many designers, it also features high street favourites such as Phase Eight. Items start at \u00a319 but stretch to \u00a3119 for a \u00a3995 Amanda Wakeley gown or \u00a3149 for a \u00a31,100 Stella McCartney dress.\n\nOther firms cater for women looking for a taste of red-carpet luxury. Newcomer My Wardrobe HQ offers a \u00a35,000 Alexander McQueen dress for \u00a3500 and a \u00a32,500 Tom Ford dress for \u00a3177. Founder Sacha Newell said: \u2018We offer statement pieces that women are unlikely to wear more than once.\u2019", "description": "Former Topshop and Whistles boss Jane Shepherdson started renting clothes when she was invited to an event at Buckingham Palace instead of spending on something new.", "authors": ["Tom Witherow Business Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/01/19971938-0-image-a-49_1571617861638.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
