I\u2019m like, WHAT?\u201d (Spelling errors in the original.) \u201cGranted, I suck at flying, but even this was egregious,\u201d Forkner added.\n\nThe exchange focuses on problems with the MCAS system, the same system that played a crucial role in the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, both of which crashed, killing everyone on board.\n\nIn another message, sent prior to that exchange, Forkner asked regulators to remove mentions of the MCAS system from pilot manuals. \u201cAre you OK with us removing all reference to MCAS from the FCOM (Flight Crew Operating Manual) and the training as we discussed, as it\u2019s completely transparent to the flight crew and only operates WAY outside of the normal operating envelope,\u201d Forkner wrote in March 2016.\n\nForkner left Boeing before the crashes and the subsequent grounding of the 737 Max fleet by nations around the world. Forkner is now a pilot with Southwest Airlines.\n\nBreitbart News reported this week that Boeing is eager to return the 737 Max fleet to the air. The aircraft manufacturer is currently fighting off lingering public concern that the fleet is not suitable for commercial travel.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "A series of internal Boeing messages between test pilots suggests that the aircraft manufacturer knew of issues facing the 737 Max fleet, later involved in two disastrous crashes, as early as 2016.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/wi/ap/16/d38b8e_boeing-plane-91333-in-may-2019-file-photo-boeing-737-max-jetliner-built-turkish-e1571692190330-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
