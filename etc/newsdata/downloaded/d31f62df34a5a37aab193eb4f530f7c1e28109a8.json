The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, convened in Beijing from Monday to Thursday, will show how China's ruling party is addressing the challenges the country faces in the new era.\n\nIn the meeting, the Political Bureau is expected to deliver a work report to the Central Committee and a document will be discussed on the Party's decisions on issues related to the consolidation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, the modernization of the State governance system and improving governing ability.\n\nGiven the complicated and fast-changing backdrop of the interwoven internal and external situations, against which China will forge ahead toward a key milestone in its development journey \u2014 that marking the realization of the Party's vow to build a moderately well-off society nationwide, which it has been striving over the past more than four decades to accomplish on time \u2014 the document will necessarily be a historic one, as it will serve as not only a summary of the Party's past experience, but also a guideline directing its future work.\n\nAccording to the Party's plan, it has pledged to make institutions of all aspects regarding the State governance system more settled and mature by 2021, the centenary anniversary of the founding of the Party, and they will be further developed by 2035, and modernized by 2049 at the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\nThe State institutional reform plan carried out last year cut eight ministerial departments and seven vice-ministerial departments under the State Council. It also reshuffled their affiliates in local governments, despite considerable resistance from the vested interests. Given the magnitude and efficiency of the reform, the document to be released by the meeting will surely carry forward that momentum to further advance the painful, yet long-awaited, institutional reforms on various levels to improve the performance and pertinence of the governance system.\n\nYet, no matter how extensive and deep the reforms will be, all the measures, along with the changes they are desired to bring about, must be in accordance with the latest requirements and conform to the direction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nIt is a path rooted in China's historical logic of modernization, as well as a path that has proved effective in seeing the nation through all kinds of tests. Therefore, we have enough reasons to anticipate the leadership of the Party will demonstrate more hard-won wisdom, and propose more new plans for the betterment of the State governing system so the country can overcome the present challenges.", "description": "It is a challenge faced by all countries: How to adapt their governance to changes, without going adrift.
