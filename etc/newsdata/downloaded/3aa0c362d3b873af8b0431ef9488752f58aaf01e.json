Luckily for him, Taronga has the perfect place for him to take a breather \u2013 the new sanctuary within the retreat. Watching Robbie as we\u2019re guided through the space, nestled within the confines of the 62-room luxury accommodation, is a study in mindfulness.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine you're not that far from the city's CBD. Rick Stevens\n\nRobbie walks slowly, eats slowly, he lives slowly. Nothing seems to bother him \u2013 even the small group of children clustered around him as he has his afternoon tea \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly the point. Rich in native flora like kangaroo paws and bottlebrush, this is a place to relax.\n\nLocated behind the zoo\u2019s long-established function centre, the Wildlife Retreat is a step up (and then some) from its Roar and Snore offering. From the moment you set foot in the beautifully appointed N\u2019gurra Lodge (where you\u2019re welcomed with a rosehip iced tea \u2013 or something stronger, should you wish) to the daybreak walk the following morning (with coffee served in eco-friendly cups) to see the elephants wake up and the zoo at its most tranquil, everything about the retreat is exactly as the name suggests: a true break from the outside world.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do something really tasteful,\u201d says Taronga CEO Cameron Kerr.\n\n\u201cThe catalyst for the Wildlife Retreat was the success of Roar and Snore and Zoofari at Western Plains,\u201d says Taronga chief executive Cameron Kerr. \u201cDemand simply outstripped supply.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he says, when guests stay overnight at the zoo, they form more meaningful connections with the wildlife, which translates into behavioural changes at home. \u201cWe know overnight stays are a really powerful tool for engaging with the community.\u201d\n\nCreature comforts are a big element of the experience. Rick Stevens\n\nTaking the retreat to the next level in terms of luxury was high on Kerr\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe wanted to do something really tasteful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of the things that other hotels have \u2013 a pool, for instance. But we put a lot of thought into making it beautiful.\u201d", "description": "Koalas, wallabies and echidnas are all part of the package at Sydney's newest luxury resort, Taronga\u2019s Wildlife Retreat, where your room comes with a zoo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2132%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a758c6193f7b00224d8c2b1fbbf1e1e60de6b7bf", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
