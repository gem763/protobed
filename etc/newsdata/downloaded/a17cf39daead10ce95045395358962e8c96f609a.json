On Saturday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV issued a warning to commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, in a commentary, CCTV said Silver could face \u201cretribution\u201d for defaming China and supporting Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager who tweeted support for the Hong Kong protests and set off an international controversy between the NBA and China.\n\nEarlier in the week, Silver had revealed at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York that China had asked the NBA to fire Morey over the tweet, which read \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d The commissioner said that there was \u201cno chance that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government, through a spokesperson, denied that it made the request.\n\nSilver is now clear on NBA\u2019s position\n\nSilver has clarified the NBA\u2019s position in recent public statements after his initial comments ignited criticism in the United States. The league\u2019s first statement called Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cinappropriate\u201d and said the NBA was \u201cextremely disappointed.\u201d\n\nDespite admitting that the financial losses as a result of Morey\u2019s comments have already been \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cmay continue to be fairly dramatic,\u201d Silver said that he is willing to deal with the consequences and protect Morey\u2019s freedom of expression.\n\nThis, no doubt, has infuriated China. In the editorial, CCTV claimed Silver \u201cfabricated lies out of nothing and has sought to paint China as unforgiving\u201d in order to \u201cplease some American politicians.\u201d After Silver\u2019s initial statement, politicians on both sides of the aisle criticized the league:\n\nStory continues\n\nBipartisan group of lawmakers to send letter to NBA commissioner on China, from Reps. Tom Malinowksi, Mike Gallagher, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jim Banks, and Sens. Ben Sasse, Ron Wyden, Tom Cotton, and Ted Cruz \u2014 Haley Byrd (@byrdinator) October 9, 2019\n\nThe CCTV editorial continued:\n\nSilver has spared no effort to portray himself as a fighter for free speech and used freedom of speech as an excuse to cover for Morey, who voiced his support for the violent actors in Hong Kong. This has crossed the bottom line of the Chinese people.\n\nTension is far from over\n\nWhile this appears like a bunch of hot air from the mouthpiece of the Chinese government, it is an indication that the two sides are far from reconciling. China stopped broadcasting preseason games and many sponsors have pulled out. Some games are back on the airwaves, but it might be awhile before the tension dies down.\n\nAt the Brooklyn Nets preseason game on Friday at the Barclays Center, hundreds of protestors filled the stands donning \u201cStand With Hong Kong\u201d shirts. NBA players, coaches and executives have strayed from stating their opinions on the issue as to not fan the flames, with LeBron James\u2019 panned remarks earlier in the week as an example.\n\nIronically, it was James\u2019 criticism of Morey that created an uproar in the United States and led to people in Hong Kong burning his jersey.\n\nGranted, issues surrounding a sports league that is worth billions of dollars with or without business in China seems paltry compared to what the Hong Kong protestors are fighting for. But as long as China keeps pushing back on the NBA over this issue, Adam Silver has a rocky road ahead.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Silver revealed earlier in the week that China had asked the NBA to fire Daryl Morey.", "authors": ["Eric He"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LSn.TnACDJtCmLvf9DPFlA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTMuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dOzwjlQx0zWnqfEUBnF2uQ--~B/aD0xNDE4O3c9MjU0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a4ab3000-eaea-11e9-97fb-3dab529115fe", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
