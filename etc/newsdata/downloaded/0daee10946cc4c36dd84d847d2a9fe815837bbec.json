Apple is already behind Samsung on smartphone sales, and it doesn't have anything to do with tariffs.\n\nAn increase in iPhone prices might mean existing iPhone customers are even slower to upgrade than usual, but that has nothing to do with Samsung.\n\nPresident Donald Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday over dinner, and he subsequently told reporters that the pair discussed coming US tariffs on goods from China.\n\nTrump told reporters from Bloomberg and other outlets on Sunday that Cook had made a \"good case\" that tariffs would make it tougher for Apple to compete with Samsung, its key rival in smartphones.\n\n\"Tim was talking to me about tariffs and one of the things, he made a very good case, is that Samsung is their number one competitor and is not paying tariffs because they're based in South Korea and it's tough for Apple if they're competing with a very good company that's not,\" he said.\n\nTrump said Cook had described Samsung as a \"very good competitor.\"\n\nHe added: \"I thought he made a very compelling argument, and I'm thinking about it.\"\n\nApple is due to be slammed by the new tariffs in the next few months, as it makes most of its devices in China, from which they're exported to the US and elsewhere.\n\nThe new 10% tariffs the US plans to apply on some Chinese goods would affect the iPhone, the iPad, and laptops starting December 15, while levies on the Apple Watch and AirPods are due to take effect September 1. Apple could raise prices as a result, making its pricey devices even pricier.\n\nIt's true that a price hike would make Apple less competitive than its rivals. But Cook's purported argument that Apple will lose out to Samsung specifically because of the tariffs doesn't make a lot of sense \u2014 iPhone sales have already been declining for numerous reasons unrelated to tariffs.\n\nA caveat: This is Trump's version of Cook's remarks. We haven't heard directly from Cook or Apple.\n\nApple has chosen to remain a luxury brand, which is why it lags Samsung on market share\n\nThe iPhone X was one of the first $1,000 smartphones. Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images\n\nApple has been struggling to beat Samsung on market share for years, as it's never really offered an affordable iPhone.\n\nIts \"affordable\" iPhone 5C was widely considered to be the worst model the company had released, while the cheapest option among the latest generation of phones, the iPhone XR, was released with a still-lofty starting price of $749.\n\nSamsung and the Chinese smartphone maker Huawei have managed to increase their market share over the past few quarters, IDC data shows, while Apple has seen quarterly declines.\n\nSamsung and Huawei have captured more of the smartphone market in recent months. IDC\n\nThis is largely attributed to Apple's decision to remain a luxury brand, pricing the iPhone higher than competing devices.\n\nThis has been a good model while there was a loyal cabal of users willing to regularly fork out for expensive devices. Apple didn't need to worry too much about market-share dominance while it had the margins.\n\nBut the approach has meant it's missing out on the millions of consumers in emerging markets who are buying their first internet-connected device. These consumers, in places like India, China, and Latin America, are skipping buying PCs or laptops and turning to cheap entry-level Android devices as their first internet device.\n\nAnd unlike Apple, Samsung is eyeing the mass market. The firm said it saw \"weak sales\" of its flagship device and iPhone rival, the Galaxy S10, in the second quarter but said its solution would be to produce more of its budget A-series of phones.\n\nThis tells us that Samsung is, in fact, struggling in the one area where it really competes with Apple: high-end smartphones. It's having to turn to budget phones to get new consumers on board. Given this situation, it doesn't make much a lot of sense to link tariffs to competition with Samsung.\n\nOf course, what Apple is really worried about is declining margins. Should Apple have to pay tariffs, that will dent its hardware margins, and it isn't yet clear whether Apple will absorb the additional costs or pass them to consumers.\n\nThe real trouble is that pricier iPhones will mean a further slowdown in upgrades\n\nThe issue for Apple is, perhaps, that an iPhone made pricier by tariffs will accelerate an existing trend: Loyal Apple customers aren't upgrading their iPhones very frequently. It's largely why iPhone sales have been in decline for months.\n\nSurveys show not that iPhone users are switching to Samsung or other Android devices, at least not in bulk, but that they aren't upgrading to new iPhones. CEO Tim Cook said in January that people were taking longer to upgrade.\n\n\"We do design our products to last as long as possible,\" he told analysts during an earnings call. \"Some people hang on to those for the life of the product and some people trade them in and then that phone is redistributed to someone else. The upgrade cycle has extended, there's no doubt about that.\"\n\nSo anyone who bought a $1,000 iPhone X is unlikely to upgrade to a new-generation iPhone if their existing device is working fine \u2014 and if the next price increase is prohibitive.\n\nIn other words, tariffs might exacerbate Apple's competition with itself, which has nothing to do with Samsung.", "description": "Apple is already behind Samsung on smartphone sales, and it doesn't have anything to do with tariffs.", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d5a8e72cd97844e111c8d63?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
