REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nAcross American universities and on Wall Street, researchers are honing computer models designed to predict the winner in the November 2020 election in which the Republican Trump will face a Democratic candidate still to be determined.\n\nWhat makes Moody\u2019s Analytics stand out is its focus on local economic conditions, which have drawn attention this year as a U.S.-China trade war has hit America\u2019s industrial heartland even as the national economy has stayed more buoyant.\n\nThe outcome of U.S. presidential elections is based on electoral college votes determined through state-by-state voting results rather than the national popular vote.\n\nThe research firm, known for its expertise on economies at the national and local levels, said factors boosting household finances across much of the country could lead to Trump winning 332 votes in the electoral college to 206 votes for the Democratic candidate.\n\nBut this scenario, in which Trump would pick up New Hampshire, Virginia and Minnesota in addition to the states he won in 2016, assumed a historically average rate of voter turnout.\n\nMoody\u2019s said its prediction model was wrong in 2016 - when it forecast Trump would loose to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton - in part because it failed to take into account the high rate of turnout in America\u2019s industrial Midwest.\n\nTrump lost the national popular vote to Clinton but won in the electoral college 304 to 227.\n\nEconomists at the firm, which is owned by Moody\u2019s Corporation but operates independently from rating agency Moody\u2019s Investors Services, said they were not ready to forecast voter turnout for 2020. But there are signs it could be high. Notably, voter turnout was historically high in 2018 midterm elections when Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans.\n\nIf turnout next year were historically high, Moody\u2019s said, the Democratic candidate could win Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - states that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016 and which are currently experiencing a manufacturing slowdown. In that scenario, the Democratic candidate would win with 279 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 259, Moody\u2019s said.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. economy sticks to our script over the next year, record turnout is vital to a Democratic victory,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.\n\nMoody\u2019s did not take into account who will be the eventual Democratic nominee. Twelve top White House contenders will take part on Tuesday in the first Democratic debate since the launch of an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.", "description": "A strong U.S. economy could help President Donald Trump win re-election next year unless there is a surge in voter turnout, economic research firm Moody's Analytics said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jason Lange", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441224153&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1TV", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
