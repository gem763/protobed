Elliot Daly AGE: 26 CAPS: 35\n\nStarts 18th consecutive Test. His deft kicking game has been effective in transition play from defence to attack.\n\nWING: 14. Anthony Watson AGE: 25 CAPS: 38\n\nShown flashes of brilliance in attack as he searches for 2017 Lions form after long injury setback.\n\nCENTRE: 13. Manu Tuilagi AGE: 28 CAPS: 36\n\nDelivered one of the standout performances of the World Cup so far as a one-man wrecking ball against Tonga.\n\nManu Tuilagi will be looking to replicate his rampaging performance against Tonga for England\n\nCENTRE: 12. Owen Farrell (C) AGE: 28 CAPS: 75\n\nSecond kicking option could be key in attack as defences are rushing up to try to force drops in humid conditions.\n\nWING: 11. Jonny May AGE: 29 CAPS: 48\n\nSpeedy cover defence could be important against a side who love to attack from deep in broken play.\n\nFLY-HALF: 10. George Ford AGE: 26 CAPS: 61\n\nRediscovered his confidence in the No 10 shirt and can trouble the Pumas with clever passes at the gainline.\n\nSince regaining the No 10 jersey for England, George Ford has looked back to his best form\n\nSCRUM-HALF: 9. Ben Youngs AGE: 30 CAPS: 91\n\nOvertakes Jonny Wilkinson as England's most-capped back but must improve on tempo from previous start.\n\nNUMBER EIGHT: 8. Billy Vunipola AGE: 26 CAPS: 47\n\nHis Tongan countrymen broke through Argentina's 10-12 channel seven times last week so the giant No 8 will look to follow suit.\n\nOPENSIDE FLANKER: 7. Sam Underhill AGE: 23 CAPS: 11\n\nAlmost two stone lighter than his opposite man but could run Pumas off their feet at the breakdown.\n\nBLINDSIDE FLANKER 6.

George Kruis AGE: 29 CAPS: 37\n\nNeeds to combat Pumas' line-out which provided platform for three tries against Tonga last week.\n\nSECOND ROW: 4. Maro Itoje AGE: 24 CAPS: 30\n\nReunited with Saracens partner George Kruis for the first time in Japan. Superior dynamism and athletic ability could be key.\n\nPROP: 3. Kyle Sinckler AGE: 26 CAPS: 27\n\nWarned the Pumas that England want to bring out their scrum and maul 'tank' in the opening 30 minutes of the contest.\n\nHOOKER: 2. Jamie George AGE: 28 CAPS: 41\n\nUsing 'cricket' trigger-words to perfect lineout throwing \u2014 holding his position after releasing the ball, like a cover drive.\n\nPROP: 1. Joe Marler AGE: 29 CAPS: 64\n\nShowed his softer side in an 'owl cafe' this week but has re-established himself as a fierce international scrummager.\n\nAfter reversing his international retirement, Joe Marler has established himself in the front row\n\nSUBSTITUTES: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Lewis Ludlam, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jack Nowell.\n\nARGENTINA\n\nBoffelli; Moroni, Orlando, De La Fuente, Carreras; Urdapilleta, Cubelli; Chaparro, Montoya, Figallo; Pagadizabal, Lavanini; Matera, Kremer, Desio.\n\nSUBSTITUTES: Creevy, Vivas, Medrano, Alemanno, Lezana, Ezcurra, Mensa, Delguy.", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: A victory against Argentina in Tokyo will take England a long way towards winning Pool C and reaching the World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19315304-0-image-a-93_1570222973819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
