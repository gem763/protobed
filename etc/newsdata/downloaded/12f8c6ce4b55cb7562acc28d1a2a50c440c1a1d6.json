Kavanaugh was reportedly a freshman at the time of the incident.\n\nStier declined to discuss the allegation with The Times, but the reporters said they corroborated details of the story with two officials who spoke about the matter with Stier.\n\nIt's unclear from The Times' report if Stier knew who the female student was, and if she has verified that the incident occurred as Stier described it.\n\nStier's account bears similarities to an allegation made by Deborah Ramirez, another Yale classmate who accused Kavanaugh of pulling his pants down and thrusting his penis in her face at a different dorm party.\n\nThe FBI did not investigate Stier's claims, The Times reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, before a ceremonial swearing-in in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, Oct. 8, 2018. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThough the FBI did interview Ramirez in September 2018, it did not interview some 25 individuals named by Ramirez as potentially having corroborating evidence of her allegations, according to The Times.\n\nThe newspaper added that many of the potential witnesses on Ramirez's list tried, but failed, to reach out to the FBI.\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court last October after a rancorous battle over the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct he faced.\n\nRead more: Anita Hill calls the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings 'a disservice to the American public' and 'a tragedy'\n\nOnly one of Kavanaugh's accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, was permitted to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Democrats railed bitterly against Senate Republicans, who limited the scope of the FBI's investigation into the allegations.\n\nKavanaugh adamantly denied Ford's and Ramirez's allegations. He declined to answer The Times reporters' questions about Stier's story.", "description": "One of Kavanaugh's former classmates, Max Stier, said he saw Kavanaugh at a party where his friends pushed his penis into a female student's hands.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ba018ca2154a37f5f8b5b61-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
