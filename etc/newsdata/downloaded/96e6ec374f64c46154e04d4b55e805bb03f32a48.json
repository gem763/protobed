We\u2019re tired of them screwing around with us. Politicians only do what they want to do, and turn their backs on all reality,\u201d said Javiera Alarcon, a 29-year-old sociologist protesting in front of the presidential palace, which was surrounded by police and military vehicles.\n\n\u2013 #ChileDesperto \u2013\n\nThe spasm of unrest was triggered by a hike in metro fares, which increased from 800 to 830 peso ($1.13 to $1.17) for peak-hour travel, after a 20-peso hike in January.\n\nPresident Sebastian Pinera announced Saturday he was suspending the fare hike, after the entire metro system was shut down the day prior with protesters burning and vandalizing dozens of stations, leaving some completely charred.\n\nThe Santiago Metro, at 140 kilometers (90 miles), is the largest and most modern in South America and a source of great pride for Chileans.\n\nPeople awoke Saturday to a ravaged city as burned-out buses, bikes and garbage littered streets patrolled by soldiers \u2014 the first such deployment since Chile returned to democracy in 1990 after the rightwing Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.\n\nDemonstrators shouted \u201cenough with abuse,\u201d while the hashtag #ChileDesperto \u2014 Chile woke up \u2014 made the rounds on social media.\n\nPinera\u2019s conservative government has been caught flat-footed by the worst social upheaval in decades.\n\nIt declared the state of emergency late Friday and ordered hundreds of troops into the streets.\n\nPeople were infuriated by a photo of Pinera eating pizza in a restaurant with his family while the city burned.\n\nThroughout Friday, rampaging protesters clashed with riot police in several parts of the capital while the headquarters of the ENEL Chile power company and a Banco Chile branch \u2014 both in the city center \u2014 were set on fire and heavily damaged.\n\nThe state of emergency is initially set for 15 days and restricts freedom of movement and assembly.\n\n\u2013 Government \u2018perplexed and dazed\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe unrest started as a fare-dodging protest mainly by students against the hike in metro ticket prices, blamed on rising oil prices and a weaker peso.\n\nThere had been several fare-dodging actions in recent days, organized on social media, but the protests escalated Friday, tapping into general discontent among many Chileans.\n\nChile has the highest per capita income of Latin America at $20,000, with expected economic growth this year of 2.5 percent and just two percent inflation.\n\nBut there is an undercurrent of frustration with rising health care and utility costs, low pensions and social inequality.\n\nThe metro fare hike served to wake up a society that was averse to violence after the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship from 1973-1990, which left more than 3,200 people dead or missing, sociologists say.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Chileans angry over social and economic issues clashed with security forces for a second day Saturday despite a state of emergency", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/5de328_protesters-argue-chilean-soldiers-clashes-in-santiago-on-19-2019-curfew-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
