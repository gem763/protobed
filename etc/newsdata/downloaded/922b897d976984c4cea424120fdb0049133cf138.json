The fast-moving case comes amid an impeachment inquiry over allegations of abuse of power by the president and could reach the Supreme Court this term. Trump is fighting similar attempts by congressional Democrats to obtain his tax records.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVance\u2019s role as the elected district attorney in Trump\u2019s hometown puts him in a unique position. His office enforces state laws and is not bound by Justice Department guidelines that prevent federal prosecutors from charging a sitting president with a crime.\n\n\u201cJust because the feds have made the decision not to pursue a case against the president, that doesn\u2019t in any way change the fact that the state has a valid interest in enforcing its laws \u2014 and a right here to do so,\u201d said Anne Milgram, a former federal prosecutor who also served as New Jersey\u2019s attorney general.\n\nVance, a reserved lawyer from a prominent Democratic family, was elected to his post in 2009. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but he previously said he views the office as a sometimes partner \u2014 or backstop \u2014 to federal law enforcement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have to be able to fill the gaps when the FBI can\u2019t or won\u2019t take these cases,\u201d including terrorism and terrorism finance cases, Vance said in an interview last spring.\n\nWeeks after federal prosecutors concluded their campaign finance investigation without filing additional charges, Vance\u2019s office began examining whether any Trump Organization officials had filed falsified business records, in violation of state law, regarding the 2016 payments to two women who said they had had affairs with Trump years earlier.\n\nTrump sued Vance in federal court to try to block the subpoena to his longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, claiming he cannot be investigated by any prosecutor, for any reason, as long as he is in the White House.\n\nAD\n\nTrump singled out Vance on Twitter this month after a federal judge in New York rejected the president\u2019s sweeping immunity claim as \u201crepugnant\u201d to the Constitution.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats \u201chave failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democratic prosecutors to go get President Trump,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cA thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d\n\nTrump has denied the affairs and any wrongdoing in connection with the hush-money payments arranged by Cohen.\n\nLawyer William S. Consovoy, who will argue the president\u2019s appeal Wednesday, declined to comment. In court filings, Trump\u2019s legal team says it is unprecedented for a local prosecutor to investigate the business of a sitting president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons why a local elected official would target the most prominent official from the other political party \u2014 to curry favor with constituents, to make a name for himself, to help his fellow partisans in Washington,\u201d the lawyers wrote in court filings last week.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven now, the District Attorney cannot refrain from taking political potshots at the President, or from framing his criminal investigation as part of a broader narrative about \u2018impeachment.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut former state and federal prosecutors say Vance is treading the path of his predecessor, the legendary district attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, who for decades used New York state laws to take on significant, high-profile investigations of corrupt politicians, corporate titans and banks from an office that has long played an outsize law enforcement role.\n\nAD\n\nVance \u201ctakes pains to be fair-minded,\u201d said lawyer Paul Shechtman, a former federal prosecutor who was counsel to Morgenthau. \u201cBut he\u2019s not afraid of going to battle.\u201d\n\nLast spring, after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted in federal court, he was indicted by Vance\u2019s office on state mortgage fraud charges. The step was widely viewed as something of an insurance policy in case the president pardons Manafort on the federal conviction. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the state charges.\n\nAD\n\nThe office\u2019s inquiry into the president\u2019s family business is a major test for Vance, who has faced criticism for his investigations of influential people, including Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and two of Trump\u2019s children.\n\nAD\n\nVance, 65, was exposed early to powerful players in Washington. His father, for whom Vance was named, served as secretary of state in the Carter administration and secretary of the Army in the Kennedy administration. As a child, the younger Vance spent the night at the White House, where President Lyndon B. Johnson gave him a pen knife.\n\nDuring his nine-year tenure as district attorney, his office has handled cases against nearly a dozen foreign banks that violated federal sanctions laws by falsifying business records. Those convictions, which came in parallel with federal convictions, resulted in about $3 billion in fines and forfeitures. Vance\u2019s office used some of the money for testing rape kits to reduce the backlog of investigations across the country.\n\nAD\n\nDespite his Democratic pedigree, Vance has received campaign contributions from major Republican donors and was endorsed by the conservative New York Post editorial board in 2009. He has frustrated privacy advocates on one of his signature issues, encryption, as he has highlighted the difficulties investigators face in gaining access to devices.\n\nAD\n\nOn that issue, \u201cCy Vance has been completely aligned with law-and-order Republicans who have wanted to see back doors built into encryption,\u201d said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nVance also was criticized for how he handled an investigation involving Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. After a two-year probe, Vance decided in 2012 not to prosecute the two for allegedly misleading potential buyers for the Trump SoHo condo and hotel development.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt we should keep digging and looking at it because there was enough there, but that was his call,\u201d said Adam S. Kaufmann, the office\u2019s former head of investigations, adding that he respected Vance\u2019s decision.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt the time, he felt if you were going to go after Trump, this larger-than-life New York figure, you\u2019re going to have to have the goods.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney, Marc Kasowitz, met personally with Vance before the decision was announced. Kasowitz had donated to Vance\u2019s reelection campaign, money that the prosecutor returned before the meeting, ProPublica and WNYC first reported.\n\nVance defended his decision, saying it was driven by diminished prospects for a conviction in part because the victims in the case were not cooperating.\n\n\u201cWe looked at it hard,\u201d Vance said last spring. \u201cThere was a lot of criticism, but I don\u2019t sell cases, and I\u2019m not going to take cases that I think are ones we can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe also drew flak for not charging Weinstein in 2015, when the movie producer was accused of groping model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. Subsequent revelations about Weinstein\u2019s long pattern of sexual assault and harassment helped spark the #MeToo movement.\n\nAgain, Vance said, the head of the office\u2019s sex crimes unit advised him that this was not a case they could win. Vance is currently prosecuting Weinstein on sexual assault charges based on allegations by women who came forward in late 2017 and early 2018.\n\nIn the hush-money investigation, Vance has said that, at this stage, Trump \u201chas not been identified as a defendant, nor is there an assumption he will be.\u201d\n\nIn his plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Cohen said he arranged the payment to Stormy Daniels \u2014 and another to Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 to keep their allegations of affairs with Trump from becoming public before the election.", "description": "As an elected N.Y. prosecutor, Cyrus Vance is not constrained by Justice Department policies for investigations and prosecutions.", "authors": ["Ann E.
