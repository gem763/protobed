New Zealand's benchmark index <.NZ50> was 0.1% higher. South Korea's Kospi <.KS11> was a touch weaker after disappointing trade data.\n\nThat left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> up 0.5% at 511.3 points. It is up 3.4% so far in September.\n\nThe E-mini futures for U.S. S&P 500 <ESc1> climbed 0.5% while Dow minis <1YMc1> were up 0.4%.\n\nThe gains come after the U.S. Trade Representative's office issued a brief statement characterizing the two days of talks with China as \"productive.\" It added that a principal-level trade meeting in Washington would take place in October, as previously planned.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as \"constructive\", and said they had also had a good discussion on \"detailed arrangements\" for the high-level talks in October.\n\nAdditionally, the United States removed tariffs from more than 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies.\n\n\"The two nations have continued to hold constructive talks. That's helped the sentiment but the markets still remain unconvinced,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\nInvestors were still a bit jittery as news broke on Friday that Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to U.S. farms next week following their two days of negotiations in Washington.\n\nThat led to losses in Wall Street on Friday with the Dow closing 0.6% lower, the S&P500 <.SPX> 0.5% down and Nasdaq <.IXIC> off 0.8%.\n\n\"Trade tensions are likely to wax and wane ahead of U.S.-China October negotiations,\" Citi analyst Cesar Rojas said in a note.\n\n\"Despite recent signs of a moderation in the pace of trade tensions escalation ahead of the October face-to-face negotiations, we continue expect U.S.-China trade tensions to continue.\"\n\nLater in the day, September manufacturing activity surveys are due from the United States and European Union which will be closely watched for any signs of a rebound.\n\nAction in currency markets was muted.\n\nThe dollar gained 0.1% against the safe haven Japanese yen to 107.69 <JPY=> after easing 0.5% last week. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar <AUD=D3> was up 0.1% at $0.6768.\n\nThe euro <EUR=D3> was mostly flat as was the British pound <GBP=>.
