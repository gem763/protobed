Rowling Donates $18.9 Million to MS Research\n\nThe London Borough of Croydon, where 7% of homes are empty, followed. As did Camden, Lewisham and Kensington & Chelsea, which each have 5% of their homes sitting vacant, the report said.\n\n\n\nOutside of London, Birmingham has the next highest number of vacant properties, though at 4,283, the figure is a distant second place.\n\n\n\n\u201cDue to the cost of properties in the main cities like London being so high over the last five years, landlords have been turning to cities like Birmingham and Liverpool,\u201d Ms. Evans said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as easy areas for letting in, however, so many of these properties are staying unoccupied for longer. These cities are also popular \u2018weekend break\u2019 locations, so the properties could be used as Airbnbs.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-106729?size=1.48664343786295&width=1280"}
