As the House impeachment inquiry moves forward, the candidates will have an increasingly difficult time forming and projecting a unified and compelling narrative around jobs, health care, and climate change. While impeachment will continue to dominate the news cycle and Washington for months to come, Democrats should remain focused on the issues and on legislative accomplishments, as those are what Americans will have in mind at the ballot box in 2020.\n\nFollowing the sudden surge of Senator Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Tlaib endorses Sanders at Detroit campaign rally MORE in the polls and the lackluster fundraising quarter of former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE, there is really no clear Democratic front runner and no clear Democratic narrative at the moment. Indeed, in the most recent national polls, Warren has proven herself to be a serious challenger to Biden, who at one point had a sweeping double digit lead over the crowded field of candidates.\n\nIn a Quinnipiac University poll this month, Warren beats Biden, receiving 28 percent of the vote, compared to Biden at 21 percent. However, in a CNN poll this month, Biden bests Warren, receiving 34 percent of the vote, compared to Warren at 19 percent. Senator Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race Democratic lawmakers, 2020 candidates pay tribute to Conyers 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE ranks in third place with 15 percent and 16 percent in both polls, respectively, marking a precipitous decline from his peak support earlier this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFurther, the latest Real Clear Politics national average measures Biden at 27 percent, Warren at 22 percent, Sanders at 17 percent, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 7 percent, and Senator Kamala Harris at 5 percent. In early voting states, polling numbers reveal even more ambiguity and indicate that the field will remain competitive throughout the Democratic primary.\n\nIn Iowa, Warren has a notable lead of 8 points, according to a poll by the Iowa State University, but her lead diminishes to 3 points in the Real Clear Politics average. Additionally, in New Hampshire, Warren has a narrow lead of 3 points, according to the Real Clear Politics average. However, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Biden has a lead of 4 points in Nevada along with a substantive lead of 20 points in South Carolina.\n\nMost Democratic candidates, including those polling in single digits, hold notable leads over President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE in general election matchups. Yet the instability within the Democratic primary and the vexing impeachment inquiry poses serious problems for all candidates moving forward. By putting impeachment at the center of the national conversation, House Democrats are turning attention to Trump and neglecting issues that voters are concerned with, such as immigration, health care, climate change, and creating an economy that can work for all Americans.\n\nMoreover, the public is still mixed on their support for this effort. A poll of swing states by the New York Times and Siena College found barely half of surveyed voters support the impeachment inquiry. Additionally, a strong 53 percent oppose removing Trump from office, while only 43 percent support removing him from office. To be clear, I believe the impeachment investigation is legitimate. The troubling evidence reveals that Trump used his office for his own personal political gain. This is a threat to our democracy, and should be investigated to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n\u201cWe are not jumping to any conclusions,\u201d said Representative Max Rose. \u201chis is an investigation. This is an inquiry and we are looking to rise above politics.\u201d While there is certainly truth to his statement, Democrats need to expand their focus to tackling and discussing issues that voters care about, especially with an election looming on the horizon next year.\n\nAs the impeachment process continues, Democrats must refrain from making the same mistake they made in 2016. The party should push a positive narrative that is centered on economic growth reforms and substantive legislative accomplishments, and is not merely a negative campaign against the president. Ultimately, if 2020 devolves into simply another election on the personality of Trump, then Democrats risk losing the White House and ensuring another four more years of him in office.\n\nDouglas E.
