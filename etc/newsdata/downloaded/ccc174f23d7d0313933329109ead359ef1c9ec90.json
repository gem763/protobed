It was a question of time before the goals came and at some point we cracked them.\u201d\n\nThe Germans stay second in the table but moved level on 15 points with Group C leaders the Netherlands, who beat Belarus 2-1 in Minsk earlier in the day.\n\nWins next month for Joachim Loew\u2019s side against Belarus in Moenchengladbach and Northern Ireland in Frankfurt will ensure Germany a place at Euro 2020.\n\nBoth Can and Gundogan, who both have Turkish roots, caused a stir before kick-off after they both deleted Instagram \u2018likes\u2019 of a photograph showing Turkey footballers performing a military salute, a gesture seen as supporting their country\u2019s military offensive in Syria.\n\nBoth UEFA and the German Football Association have said they will look into the incident.\n\nGermany were dealt a blow before kick-off when in-form winger Serge Gnabry, who scored in Wednesday\u2019s 2-2 friendly draw with Argentina in Dortmund, was pulled from the starting line-up with a leg injury.\n\nCan then quickly added to Loew\u2019s woes against the group\u2019s bottom side with the earliest red card ever shown to a Germany international.\n\nPlaying out of position at centre-back, the Juventus midfielder was sent off for lunging into a tackle, as the last man, on Estonia forward Frank Liivak.\n\nIt was the first straight red card of Can\u2019s career.\n\nNevertheless, Germany had the best first-half chance when Marco Reus curled his free-kick over the wall but against the woodwork.\n\nGundogan broke the deadlock early in the second half when his shot clipped Reus\u2019s boot and beat the Estonia goalkeeper from 20 metres out.\n\nSix minutes later, after an exchange of passes between Reus and winger Julian Brandt, Gundogan\u2019s shot on the edge of the area again took a deflection to make it 2-0.\n\nWerner, on for Freiburg striker Luca Waldschmidt, made it 3-0 on 71 minutes when a Gundogan pass picked out the RB Leipzig striker, who fired home across the goal.", "description": "Tallinn (AFP) \u2013 Ilkay Gundogan scored two second-half goals to help 10-man Germany claim a 3-0 win away to lowly Estonia in Sunday\u2019s Euro 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/e983ea_manchester-city-midfielder-ilkay-gundogan-celebrates-scoring-in-germany-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
