In recent months, the two entities, as well as a number of state attorneys general, have launched high-profile scrutiny of tech giants such as Alphabet Inc. GOOG -0.67% \u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. FB -0.52% that have come to dominate nearly every aspect of Americans\u2019 digital lives.\n\nNow, in the letter sent late last week to the Justice Department, the FTC complained about the department\u2019s behavior and raised concerns about recent interactions between the two agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How can the FTC and the Justice Department work together to address antitrust concerns with tech giants? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe previously undisclosed letter, signed by FTC Chairman Joe Simons, raises the prospect that a longstanding power-sharing agreement between the agencies is fraying. It is also raising broader concerns that the boiling tension could eventually derail the agencies\u2019 focus on so-called Big Tech\u2014among the biggest and most significant undertakings that either of them has conducted in years.\n\nAn FTC spokeswoman declined to comment. The Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelated Video The Justice Department is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust matters, Republican Mike Lee of Utah, said he plans to ask about the letter and the tensions it reflects at a hearing Tuesday. Both Mr. Simons and DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim are expected to testify.\n\n\u201cSen. Lee is aware of the letter and he intends to inquire at tomorrow\u2019s oversight hearing about whether the clearance process between the agencies is working and, if not, whether the FTC and DOJ are engaging in duplicative investigations,\u201d a Lee spokesman said on Monday. That clearance process, a longstanding arrangement between the two agencies, helps determine which of them investigates particular areas.\n\nMr. Lee has raised concerns about clashes between the agencies on several recent occasions\u2014for example, when the Justice Department took the unusual step of undercutting the FTC\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against chip maker Qualcomm Inc. this year. He has even suggested that having two federal enforcement agencies could be contributing to the problems.\n\n\u201cThis kind of dysfunction and confusion illustrates why having two agencies at loggerheads does not make for effective antitrust enforcement,\u201d Mr. Lee said in August.\n\nThe FTC and the Justice Department share antitrust-enforcement authority in the U.S. While they have at times been rivals and engaged in turf battles, employees in both agencies acknowledge that their interactions lately have become abnormally strained.\n\nTech issues are a major contributing factor. Both the FTC and DOJ are under considerable pressure to investigate\u2014and potentially challenge\u2014a range of actions by a handful of companies\u2014 Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are two others\u2014that dominate online search, retail and social media.\n\nOne point of contention is whether the Justice Department will open its own antitrust investigation of Facebook, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMessrs. Delrahim and Simons earlier this year negotiated arrangements that cleared the Justice Department to investigate Google for possible monopolistic tactics and also gave the department jurisdiction over Apple for similar issues. The FTC secured for itself the right to explore monopolization questions involving Facebook and Amazon.\n\nBut the Justice Department took things a step further in July, announcing a broad review of whether dominant online platforms in general are unlawfully stifling competition. That raised the rare possibility that both agencies might probe the same company, Facebook, at the same time.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s Facebook probe is investigating, among other things, whether the social-media giant pursued acquisitions designed to eliminate potential future competitors. The Justice Department, meanwhile, also has been fielding complaints about Facebook, including from people who advocate breaking up the company.\n\nFacebook didn\u2019t provide a comment in response. Over the summer, the company said the FTC was investigating \u201cin the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Amazon declined to comment. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStill another sore point going on for months is the Justice Department\u2019s decision this year to step into the FTC\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm. The commission won a favorable ruling from a California federal judge in May that forced major changes to Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, but an appeals court last month stayed the effect of that ruling for now.\n\nThe Justice Department is supporting Qualcomm, saying the trial judge\u2019s ruling was incorrect in several respects. It also argued in court papers that the ruling would diminish Qualcomm\u2019s competitiveness in 5G innovation and impact national security. The appeals court cited the Justice Department\u2019s position when it granted Qualcomm a stay last month.\n\nFTC officials believe the department fundamentally misunderstands their case and that the DOJ didn\u2019t properly consult them before intervening, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nQualcomm has said its business practices were justified and lawful.\n\nThe battles between the two agencies are \u201ca real drag on the effectiveness of the U.S. [antitrust] system,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former FTC commissioner who is now a George Washington University law professor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t destine the individual efforts to failure by any means, but it diminishes the prospects of success. It makes it harder to achieve a good result.\u201d\n\nWrite to John D.
