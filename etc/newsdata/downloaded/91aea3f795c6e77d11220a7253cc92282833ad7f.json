Adam Kinzinger (R-IL)\u2014have openly derided the move.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of Americans out there who had been surprised the Taliban had been invited to Camp David, especially the week of the 9/11 commemoration,\u201d the CNN host pointed out.\n\nAfter Pompeo waved off the criticisms while saying Trump was making \u201creal progress\u201d in achieving peace in Afghanistan, Tapper pressed him again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone begrudges the president or ambassador trying to bring an end to this war that\u2019s been going on so long with so many innocent people and so many service members killed, but I guess the question is why invite the Taliban to Camp David?\u201d Tapper wondered.\n\nNoting that the president\u2019s effort was to work with those who can eventually end the violence, the secretary of state added that Trump is not going to reduce the pressure on the Taliban if they don\u2019t deliver on their commitments, referencing the recent attack in Kabul that resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier.\n\nTapper, however, continued to challenge Pompeo on the notion of even bringing the Taliban to American soil to negotiate terms, highlighting that the organization recently reiterated its support for the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an organization that still supports 9/11\u2014still believes that the United States was to blame,\u201d the CNN anchor stated. \u201cWe brought that on ourselves. Why bring people like that to Camp David? I understand why you want to negotiate for peace but why bring people like that to Camp David?\u201d\n\nPompeo, again, punted on the specific question, saying that the administration has an \u201cobligation to do everything we can\u201d and that they \u201cunderstand who the Taliban are.\u201d\n\nThis prompted Tapper to then confront Pompeo on how he would view this if the shoe were on the other foot.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think that if a Democratic president had talked about having the Taliban come to Camp David to negotiate a peace process that was not already a done deal,\u201d Tapper noted. \u201cThat you as a congressman, as a soldier, as a veteran, as a West Point graduate, that you would be rather upset.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state insisted that the State of the Union host was \u201cjust wrong about that\u201d before taking a shot at Obama, claiming the former president was \u201cprepared to leave without ensuring to protect America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will never do that,\u201d Pompeo added.\n\nElsewhere on the other Sunday shows, the secretary of state was grilled on the scuttled peace talks, with much of the focus on the optics of inviting the Taliban to Camp David\u2014especially since the presidential retreat is where American leaders gathered following the 9/11 attacks to plan a response.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace aggressively pressed Pompeo on the bipartisan uproar over the canceled meeting, asking Pompeo point-blank: \u201cWho thought it was a good idea for the President of the United States to meet with Taliban leaders who have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands just three days before 9/11?\u201d\n\nDuring his appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, the secretary of state defended the Camp David setting, stating that he\u2019s aware of the history surrounding the location and \u201cPresident Trump reflected on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all considered as we were debating how to try and get to the right, ultimate outcome,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile there have often been discussions about war at Camp David, There have been discussions about peace there as well. There have been some pretty bad actors travel through that place. It\u2019s an important place.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think there are a lot of Americans out there who had been surprised the Taliban had been invited to Camp David, especially the week of the 9/11 commemoration,\u201d Tapper said.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567952098/state-union-jake-tapper_16_gxutal", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
