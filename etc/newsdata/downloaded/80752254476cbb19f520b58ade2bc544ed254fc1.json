Riding his father\u2019s coattails, and without any experience with either Ukraine or in the energy sector, Hunter secured a seat on the board of Burisma, where he was paid an incredible $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 to the eventual tune of, according to some reports, three million dollars.\n\nIn China, Hunter literally hitched a ride on Air Force Two with his dad to Beijing and secured a $1.5 billion \u2014 with a \u201cB\u201d \u2014 deal that could, according to FactCheck.org, eventually earn him tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd what has been the real-world result of what stinks like a couple of foreign bribes\u2026? Well, we have Joe Biden on video bragging about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, a prosecutor who, under penalty of perjury, says he was investigating Burisma. To get this prosecutor fired, Biden admits to muscling Ukraine\u2019s government into a quid pro quo: no U.S. aid unless you fire the guy.\n\nUkraine fired the guy.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s sucking up to the same Chinese government that \u2014 through the Bank of China \u2014 handed a company in which Hunter has a ten percent stake in a cool $1.5 billion.\n\nWhen confronted with these obvious and utterly shameless conflicts of interest, the media allow Biden to hide behind his outrage over his integrity being challenged coupled with his now-debunked lie about never having discussed these shady overseas business deals with Hunter.\n\nTo begin with, we already know Biden discussed these deals with this son because Hunter has admitted to discussing them with his dad.\n\nSecondly, though, is THE PHOTO, which clearly shows Joe and Hunter and Burisma\u2019s Devon Archer enjoying a round of golf while Joe was vice president in 2014.\n\nThe photo, first found by Tucker Carlson of Fox News, is a piece of utterly damning, photographic proof that Biden almost certainly discussed his son\u2019s business dealings. Good heavens, what better way to aid and abet his son\u2019s cash grab than with an afternoon of access, not only with America\u2019s vice president, but with the same Joe Biden the White House put in charge of dealing with Ukraine\u2019s corruption problems.\n\nNevertheless, during an extended interview with Hunter this week, not once did ABC News ask him about this photo, even after Hunter claimed he never discussed his business with his dad!\n\nNevertheless, during a three-hour debate Tuesday night, where Joe Biden once again only answered the Hunter questions with sanctimonious outrage over his integrity being questioned, not once did CNN or the New York Times ask him about this photo!\n\nThe corrupt media are TERRIFIED to ask about the photo because they 1) want to hide this smoking gun from voters, and 2) know Slow Joe does not have a good answer, and cannot square his claim of not having discussed his son\u2019s business dealings with this round of golf.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing Democrat primary voters need to keep in mind \u2026 Donald Trump is not John McCain or Mitt Romney. Donald Trump cannot be bullied by the crooked media into dropping an attack on an opponent, and Donald Trump will flog Slow Joe relentlessly with this smoking gun until the end of time.\n\nNo matter how hard the crooked media try, they cannot wish away photographic evidence of Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s dirty overseas dealing and all the lies they have told to try and cover it up.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
