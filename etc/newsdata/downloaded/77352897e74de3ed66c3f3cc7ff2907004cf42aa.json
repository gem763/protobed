Australia\u2019s future economic success will rely on educated workers able to access innovation and research to drive growth and opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe have put graduate employment outcomes at the centre of our performance-based funding model for universities. This means universities will be incentivised to continue to produce job-ready graduates.\u201d\n\nAndrew Norton, honorary fellow at Melbourne University's Centre for the Study of Higher Education, said universities might see the data as \"good defensive material\" but at best the results should be regarded as \"stable\".\n\nShort-term and long-term employment rates for graduates had not changed very much since 2007.\n\nIn 2007 slightly less than 84 per cent of people leaving university got a job in the first three months and by 2010, 93 per cent of the same group had a full-time job. Mr Norton said governments tended to focus on the short-term job rates of university graduates because that better fitted the political cycle, and these often looked a bit rocky.\n\n\"Even though we had terrible figures at four months out, after three years out nine out of 10 people had jobs. It's a rocky start but things end up well for graduates.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Tehan said employment in professional positions was very strong, with 99 per cent of dentistry graduates getting full-time jobs within three years, followed by medicine at 98 per cent and lawyers at 95 per cent.\n\nUniversity researchers argue the entry requirements for these degrees are very high and in some cases there are limited places for students, which combine to create a full-employment market for graduates.\n\nPossibly men are working longer hours, which would show up as more pay. Or men are more likely to ask for a pay rise. \u2014 Andrew Norton, Melbourne University\n\nGender pay disparity continues to plague university graduates. In 2016, a male graduate could expect to earn $60,000 in his first job but a woman would get only $57,500, a difference of more than 4 per cent.\n\nBy 2019 the same man would be earning $75,900 while his female counterpart earned $71,000, extending the pay disparity to 7 per cent.\n\nMr Norton said there were very few exceptions to the gender pay gap and it had persisted over a long period.\n\n\"Possibly men are working longer hours, which would show up as more pay. Or men are more likely to ask for a pay rise. Anecdotally that is considered a factor along the lines, 'If you don't ask you won't get'.\"\n\nSydney University has the highest graduate employment rate, with 93.2 per cent of students getting a full-time job within three years of obtaining their degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother high rating university is Wollongong, south of Sydney, with 92 per cent of graduates in jobs at the three-year mark.\n\nWollongong vice-chancellor Paul Wellings wrote the performance-targeting report for the government. He said employment levels would be one of four measures used to assess the success of spending, and the main objective of giving universities targets was \"more accountability for the spending of public money\".\n\nVictoria University was at the bottom of the list, but researchers said its dual role as a university and a vocational trainer made it difficult to rank it alongside pure research and teaching universities.\n\nAn area of concern for the government is the relatively large number of people who have jobs but are not using the skills in which they were trained.\n\nA little more than 22 per cent of people who left university in 2016 said after three years there were stuck in jobs where their university education was of limited use.\n\nThat was slightly fewer than the year before, but the figure has remained above 20 per cent for at least four years, and puts pressure on universities to meet the government's priority of producing \"job ready\" graduates.\n\nMr Tehan has put together a taskforce to investigate the mismatch between education and jobs, and said business might be able to compete with universities to educate people, citing the German conglomerate Siemens, which offers bachelor's and master's degrees in Europe.", "description": "Employment rates and salaries for degree-holders may be on the rise, but the sector remains under pressure to produce job-ready graduates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4795%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_132%2C$y_182/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c60d7a5b2a3e711e66d4b535306af3c9d45f491f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
