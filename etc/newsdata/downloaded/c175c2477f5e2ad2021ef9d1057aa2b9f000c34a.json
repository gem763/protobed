It is designed to remove friction from the user onboarding process, while still fighting online identity fraud and meeting AML and KYC compliance mandates.\n\nModern organizations need to implement the requisite safeguards to prevent bad actors from creating online accounts. Given the growth of deepfakes, bots and sophisticated spoofing attacks, Jumio has integrated certified liveness detection to detect when photos, videos or even realistic 3D masks are used instead of actual selfies to create online accounts. Jumio is the first automated identity verification solution to integrate NIST/iBeta-certified liveness detection via FaceTec ZoOm which serves as a powerful chilling effect on would-be cybercriminals hoping to impersonate legitimate users.\n\nPowered by AI, Jumio Go provides enterprises with a real-time, secure and reliable way to verify remote users, ensuring the person enrolling or logging in is who they claim to be online. Across a number of important use cases (e.g., renting e-scooters), verification speed is critical. One industry study showed that 40% of consumers abandon onboarding applications after initiating a process, citing the length of time taken as one of the primary reasons for not completing the application process.\n\n\u201cGiven Jumio\u2019s AI expertise, machine learning models and massive verification datasets, launching a fully automated solution was always a question of when, rather than if,\u201d said Robert Prigge, Jumio president. \u201cJumio Go leverages the power of big data and big AI to equip modern enterprises with instant online identity verification that delivers a simple and intuitive experience for good customers. Just as importantly, Jumio Go prevents bad actors and bots from creating fake accounts thanks to our embedded liveness detection, which is a powerful deterrent for fraudsters and cybercriminals.\u201d\n\nThe key benefits of Jumio Go include:\n\nUnrivaled Speed: Employs state-of-the-art AI, OCR and biometrics to deliver our fastest identity verification solution ever.\n\nEmploys state-of-the-art AI, OCR and biometrics to deliver our fastest identity verification solution ever.

Omnichannel Support: Supports a wide range of customer implementations, including mobile SDK (iOS & Android), mobile web, desktop and cloud API service options.\n\nJumio Go is being launched as a beta to give its customers an early look at the fully automated identity verification solution. The beta is available across a broad range of geographies and will expand to other geographies in the near future. Jumio will use the beta period to capture important feedback from customers and partners to better refine the experience and deliver the best fully automated identity verification solution on the market.\n\nJumio Go complements Jumio\u2019s other leading-edge identity verification solutions that empower organizations to increase conversions during the onboarding process, reduce online abandonment (often associated with time-consuming verification processes), and meet evolving KYC and AML regulatory mandates.\n\nJumio\u2019s full suite of identity verification solutions will benefit from and inherit the technology enhancements that have been integrated into Jumio Go. This provides another benefit to Jumio\u2019s business customers \u2014 they can now choose between a 100% automated solution or opt for Jumio Identity Verification, a hybrid solution that leverages a combination of AI, computer vision and human review to deliver the most accurate solution in the market.\n\nOver the past two years, Jumio has experienced dramatic sales growth which speaks to significant market opportunity and demand for biometric-based identity verification. Earlier this year, the company was named to Fast Company\u2019s prestigious annual list of the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies for 2019, ranking 29th globally and the second in the Security category.\n\nFor a sneak peek of Jumio Go, please visit Jumio at Money20/20 USA in Las Vegas, booth 2520.
