But Turkish officials leaked word that their leader had thrown the letter in the trash, and Erdogan then took Trump to task for his \u201clack of respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we so weak, and so inept diplomatically, that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, said in a speech Thursday denouncing Trump\u2019s Syria decision as \u201ca bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote an op-ed criticizing the pullout, a rare rebuke of Trump.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s wars will be \u2018endless\u2019 only if America refuses to win them,\u201d he wrote, referencing Trump\u2019s frequent argument that his critics want to keep U.S. troops abroad indefinitely.\n\nAD\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump \u201cshows strength at all the wrong times, and then when he needs to show strength, he shows abject weakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he got on the phone call with Erdogan, he was weak as could be,\u201d Schumer said Thursday on MSNBC. \u201cHe should have told Erdogan: \u2018You can\u2019t do this. America\u2019s not going to let you do this.\u2019 Instead, he green-lights Erdogan, and then a few hours later sends this ranting, rambling letter that shows ersatz toughness \u2014 and to show you the effect, Erdogan ignored the letter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s claim of brokering a major trade \u201cdeal\u201d with China after months of acrimonious negotiations has been undermined in Beijing, where Chinese officials for the past week have refused to confirm key elements of the supposed agreement \u2014 a clear sign of continuing disagreement between the two parties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deflating when the curtain is pulled back and the Wizard of Oz is a little guy,\u201d said David Axelrod, who served as senior adviser in the Obama White House. \u201cIf your whole predicate is strength and everywhere you turn there are signs of weakness, it is a danger.\u201d\n\nAxelrod added: \u201cHis psyche is invested in this facade of the strongman and yet he seems to be heeled by strongmen.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham rejected the notion that Trump\u2019s position has been weakened in recent weeks, writing in an email, \u201cThis Administration continues to deliver real results for this country.\u201d\n\nTrump has defended his Syria decision, arguing that it was wise for him to teach the Turks and Kurds a lesson in \u201ctough love.\u201d He has also accused House Democrats, as well as the media, of betraying the American people with an impeachment inquiry he argues was designed to overthrow the results of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe economy\u2019s booming, our people are prospering, our country\u2019s thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before,\u201d Trump told a roaring crowd of 20,000 at a campaign rally Thursday night in Dallas. \u201cBut the more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. Crazy. They\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s supremacy is being challenged inside his own realm. With his administration engulfed by crisis, Trump can no longer control the forces once solidly arrayed behind him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA variety of administration officials, including high-ranking political appointees, have trekked to Capitol Hill to offer damaging revelations during day-long depositions before impeachment investigators.\n\nBy testifying, these officials have decided to ignore the Trump White House\u2019s unequivocal refusal to participate in a \u201ctotally compromised kangaroo court,\u201d effectively ripping off the muzzles the president placed over their mouths.\n\nTrump is being humbled by the judiciary as well. A federal appeals court in Washington ruled against the president this month in an extended legal battle over access to his financial data, deciding that Congress could seek eight years of Trump\u2019s business records from his accounting firm.\n\nAD\n\nThe mounting crises for the administration \u2014 including self-dealing accusations over Trump\u2019s decision to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of world leaders at his own Florida resort \u2014 have weakened the president\u2019s hold on his party. During Trump\u2019s past controversies, most Republican lawmakers publicly defended the president even if they privately expressed frustration, but now some are speaking out in utter exasperation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not a good thing to have the appearance \u2014 you know, in the law, there\u2019s a canon that says, \u2018Avoid the appearance of impropriety,\u2019 \u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.). \u201cI think that would be better if he would not use his hotel for this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nThey are not alone. One of Trump\u2019s greatest political advantages has been the uniformly positive coverage he receives in conservative media, but the firewall of loyal defenders on which he has long relied is cracking.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has been angry with Fox News Channel because he deems the straight reporting, polling and some of the punditry it airs insufficiently adulatory.\n\nAfter a Fox poll this month found that a record 51 percent of Americans support his impeachment and removal from office, Trump erupted. He lamented on Twitter that Fox is \u201cmuch different than it used to be in the good old days\u201d and complained that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Drudge Report, arguably the most influential website in conservative media, in recent weeks has run a deluge of negative headlines about Trump in all caps or bright-red type.\n\nTrump is scrambling to keep his political coalition intact. He posted a video Friday on Twitter slamming Romney as a \u201cDemocrat secret asset\u201d who had merely been \u201cposing as a Republican\u201d \u2014 an ironic charge about Romney, a lifelong Republican, coming from Trump, a former Democrat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president\u2019s message, typed in all caps, conveyed his urgency: \u201cREPUBLICANS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND FIGHT!\u201d\n\nTrump has long striven to show strength and to declare himself a winner, even if doing so requires fabrications. In the 1990s, when his businesses failed and declared bankruptcy several times, Trump recast his role as that of a wily businessman outmaneuvering the bankers trying to take him down.\n\n\u201cAll of his books and anecdotes and television appearances are oriented toward a narrative about him being strong and winning,\u201d said Timothy O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer and executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion. \u201cHe absorbed this from his father at his father\u2019s knee. Fred had a very binary view of the world, that there were winners and losers and there wasn\u2019t any in-between.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has some ready assistants in perpetuating his narrative of winning. Just a few hours after acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo with Ukraine that brought fresh peril to the administration, which Mulvaney later recanted, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) took the stage at Trump\u2019s Dallas rally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSince you elected him, he has done nothing but win and win and win and win and win,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cName a topic! The economy. The stock market. The strongest military. Oil and gas industry. Moving our embassy to Jerusalem. Every issue. The Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a message that continues to resonate with the president\u2019s most ardent supporters, who remain a bulwark against his falling fortunes.\n\nWatching from the arena floor Thursday, Rod Taylor, a 54-year-old mechanic, was convinced.\n\nAsked whether the recent controversies weakened Trump, Taylor responded: \u201cHell no. He\u2019s the strongest president we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time somebody says he\u2019s weak, he turns it around,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nTrump\u2019s handling of this impeachment period contrasts with that of the last president to face impeachment, Bill Clinton, two decades ago. Clinton\u2019s strategy then was to show the American people that he was focused on doing his job as president and was not distracted by the proceedings on Capitol Hill, much as they gnawed at him.\n\nAD\n\nClinton paid particular attention to foreign affairs, striving to fortify alliances, whereas Trump strained alliances with his Syria decision and, in the estimation of critics, got played by Erdogan.\n\n\u201cThe world leaders rallied behind Bill Clinton,\u201d longtime Clinton friend Terry McAuliffe recalled. \u201cI remember talking to Clinton, one of the first calls he got was from [South African President] Nelson Mandela.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe, a former Virginia governor, added: \u201cWhat people loved about Clinton is they knew he was getting out of bed every single day to fight for them. . . . Here Trump gets out of bed every day and does angry tweets. It\u2019s totally different.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s former advisers are exhibiting less restraint than in earlier periods when it comes to speaking about the president.\n\nJohn Bolton, who departed as national security adviser last month, is writing a book about his time working for Trump and has retained the same agents who represented former FBI director James B. Comey for his tell-all, Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn. He also recently gave a speech criticizing the president\u2019s efforts to woo North Korea\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, and strike a nuclear deal with the rogue nation.\n\nFormer defense secretary Jim Mattis, who for months had steadfastly refused to criticize the sitting president, poked fun of Trump during a roast Thursday night at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. Mattis noted that Trump had called him \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d during a meeting with congressional leaders the day before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,\u201d Mattis said, invoking the three-time Academy Award winner. \u201cSo, I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\u201d\n\nMattis went on to mock the president\u2019s taste for fast food. \u201cI think the only person in the military that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t think is overrated is Colonel Sanders,\u201d Mattis said, referring to the Kentucky Fried Chicken founder whose likeness graces the chain\u2019s iconic chicken buckets.", "description": "The president\u2019s supremacy is being challenged inside his own realm.
