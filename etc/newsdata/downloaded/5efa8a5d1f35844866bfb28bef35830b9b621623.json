I don\u2019t think there is any other way to win here,\u201d Klopp said.\n\nChelsea made a spirited fightback in the second half, pulling a goal back with a superb effort from N\u2019Golo Kante, but they missed late chances to equalise and fell to a second defeat of the season that left them 10 points off the pace in 11th.\n\nFor Chelsea boss Frank Lampard, there were numerous positives to take from the game, even if his side are still without a home league win this season.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to accept congratulations after a loss, but the second-half display is close to where we want to be,\u201d he said.\n\nFRENETIC PACE\n\nLiverpool began the match at a frenetic pace as the intensity of their pressing game kept Chelsea pegged firmly against the ropes, struggling to hold onto possession or build any momentum, and it was not long until the pressure told.\n\nMohamed Salah backheeled a free kick to Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the box, who let fly with his right foot, drilling the ball past goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to give the visitors the lead after 14 minutes.\n\nDespite being second best for much of the first half, Chelsea still had their moments.\n\nThey were denied an equaliser by VAR after 26 minutes when Cesar Azpilicueta bundled the ball in only for replays to show that Mason Mount had strayed a fraction offside in the build-up, swiftly curtailing the home crowd\u2019s raucous celebrations.\n\nSalt was then rubbed into the wound when Liverpool doubled their lead four minutes later.\n\nAlexander-Arnold tapped a free kick on the left to Andy Robertson, whose cross was met by Firmino and he powered his header home from close range.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nLiverpool should have added to their advantage early in the second half when Firmino was left unmarked at the far post but he scuffed his volley and the Brazilian\u2019s effort was parried away by Arrizabalaga before Chelsea began to find their feet.\n\nKante pulled one back in spectacular fashion, turning midfielder Fabinho, before attacking the heart of the visitors\u2019 defence and curling the ball into the far corner, before further chances came and went.\n\nSubstitute Michy Batshuayi headed wide after 88 minutes and Mount scooped a Marcos Alonso cross over the bar at the death to leave the home side rueing their missed opportunities.", "description": "Leaders Liverpool maintained their perfect start to the Premier League season as they staved off a second-half fight back from Chelsea to secure a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge that left them five points clear at the summit.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432687142&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0P3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
