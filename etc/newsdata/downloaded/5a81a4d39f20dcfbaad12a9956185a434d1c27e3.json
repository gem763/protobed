Defaults remained below 2 per cent, in line with the full-year results reported in August.\n\nWhile Mirvac has \u2013 like the rest of the residential development industry \u2013 been hit by the credit-induced slowdown, the company's comments in its latest quarterly update show that it \u2013 like peers Lendlease and Stockland \u2013sees the worst behind it and expects the increased activity to translate into higher sales.\n\n\"As we foreshadowed at our FY19 results, we have passed the bottom of the residential cycle,\" chief executive Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz said.\n\n\"There are now clear signs of improvement in the Sydney and Melbourne\n\nestablished housing markets, with lifts in loan approvals consistent with the upturn in auction market activity, prices and turnover.\"\n\nMirvac made almost one-quarter of its profit last year from residential development. More than half of its business comes from office and industrial property development and ownership, and the company's reaffirmed picture was good news for investors, analysts said.\n\n\"We believe Mirvac's approximate 4 per cent dividend-per-share yield growing sustainably at 5 per cent will become increasingly attractive for income-focused investors,\" Macquarie Securities analyst Darren Leung said.\n\n\"An improving residential backdrop is also supportive.\"\n\nThe company increased the weighted average lease expiry of its office portfolio to 6.9 years in the quarter from 6.4 per cent at the end of June and its occupancy rate ticked up to 98.4 per cent from 98.2 per cent. The company's $3.1 billion active office development pipeline is 90 per cent pre-committed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the quarter, Mirvac topped out its Olderfleet redevelopment at 477 Collins Street in Melbourne and started construction of Suncorp\u2019s new headquarters at 80 Ann Street, Brisbane. The 60,000-square-metre office precinct is 74 per cent pre-committed and was on track for practical completion in 2022, the company said.\n\nFocus on Millennials\n\nOver the quarter, Mirvac kept sales growth constant in retail property, which accounts for about one-fifth of its profit. Moving annual turnover \u2013 the industry-standard measure of sales \u2013 rose 2.6 per cent in the quarter across its portfolio of retailers, down slightly from 2.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier. Specialty sales growth was constant at 2 per cent.\n\nMs Lloyd-Hurwitz said the company would keep reshaping its retail property portfolio to meet the changing taste for places that people would increasingly spend time in, rather than come to make purchases.\n\n\"In 2024, Millennials, Gen Ys and Zs will overtake Baby Boomers and Gen Xs in numbers to become the most dominant group in the country,\" she said.\n\n\"We\u2019re acutely aware of this fast-approaching tipping point and are focused on developing a deep understanding of this rapidly expanding cohort, their habits, purchasing decisions and preferences, to ensure we remain ahead of the curve when it comes to reimagining retail for the future.\u201d", "description": "The diversified developer says the latest quarter confirms its earlier comments that the worst of the housing market has passed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3174%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_57%2C$y_530/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9602c7edd60800ffc303ae5a0f2089ca232dac2b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
