By simply continuing to fund the department at current levels, lawmakers could skip the contentious process of negotiating new funding for the wall, one of President Trump\u2019s central legislative priorities.\n\nThe federal government is two weeks away from running out of money, and lawmakers are preparing to pass a short-term funding measure to buy more time to reach an agreement on the annual spending legislation. But in a sign of the difficulty ahead, money for the border wall has already dominated the early stages of talks in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe controversy seems to have grown and gotten deeper,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Failure to reach an agreement on border-wall funding led to a 35-day government shutdown, which ended in January as the longest in U.S. history.\n\nA worker walks beside a section of the Pentagon-funded border wall in Yuma, Ariz., Sept. 10.

After Congress didn\u2019t approve the level of funding he had sought, Mr. Trump in February declared a national emergency, allowing him to repurpose more than $6 billion to build the wall.\n\nThe president said the wall is necessary to reduce illegal immigration, a matter he said is critical to national security. Democrats have panned the wall as an ineffective and costly method of securing the border.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move to shift money from Defense Department and military construction projects\u2014including schools for the children of service members\u2014toward wall construction has rankled Democrats. They sought to add an amendment to the bill funding the Defense Department to limit the president\u2019s ability to redirect money.\n\n\u201cThe bill before us does nothing to rein in the ability of the president to continue to raid money from the Department of Defense to pay for his wall,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThat effort to amend the bill failed in committee, and Republicans advanced the military spending legislation along party lines. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said he would move forward with a procedural vote on the spending legislation this week, daring Democrats to oppose funding for the military on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cMy Democratic colleagues seem eager to bog down the funding process with all their outstanding disagreements with the president,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is averting a government shutdown a good reason to put off congressional debate over border-wall funding? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) lambasted the procedural maneuver, calling it a political stunt.\n\n\u201cFor him to say that Democrats are the ones threatening to block military funding when in fact we oppose a Republican bill that would shortchange the military is the height of double talk by the leader,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic efforts to curb the administration\u2019s ability to move money around for the wall have bled into other parts of the Senate appropriations process, including how to divvy up funding between various departments. A group of top Senate Democrats, including Messrs. Schumer and Leahy, sent a letter to Messrs. McConnell and Shelby on Tuesday asking that they drop funding for the wall from the chamber\u2019s spending legislation.\n\nMr. Schumer is also seeking to force a floor vote on terminating the national emergency at the border in a bid to end the president\u2019s authority to transfer the funds. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (R., Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), have joined the effort.\n\nBut even as the skirmishes over the president\u2019s ability to shift money continue, lawmakers in both parties and chambers are avoiding the main issue: deciding how much new money to give toward the wall.\n\nHouse Democrats, who have passed 10 of the 12 spending bills, don\u2019t plan to bring their own DHS spending bill to the floor this month. In a saga that opened a party rift, nearly 100 Democrats voted against a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for the southern border. They had raised concerns about how the funds\u2014which weren\u2019t designated for the wall\u2014would be used.\n\nDiscussions about passing a continuing resolution for DHS remain relatively preliminary, and a person familiar with White House thinking argued that it was too soon to \u201cdeclare defeat on DHS.\u201d Lawmakers are expected to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government open until Nov. 21, though legislation has been delayed by negotiations over aid to farmers affected by the trade war with China.\n\nRep. Chuck Fleischmann (R., Tenn.), the top Republican on the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DHS, said he hopes Congress doesn\u2019t have to resort to simply extending the department\u2019s current funding.\n\n\u201cI want to see a properly negotiated, properly funded DHS bill that addresses the nation\u2019s current needs,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been a fan of CRs\u2014except when we\u2019re facing a government shutdown.\u201d\n\n\u2014Catherine Lucey contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com", "description": "As disagreements about funding for a border wall again begin to consume spending talks in Congress, lawmakers are exploring an option to mitigate the controversy: putting it off until next year.", "authors": ["Andrew Duehren", "Andrew.Duehren Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108108/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
