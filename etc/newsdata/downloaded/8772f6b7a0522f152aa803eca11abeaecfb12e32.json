Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Thursday evening tweeted a message to President Trump, telling him that it will be a \u201creal pleasure\u201d defeating him in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real pleasure defeating you,\u201d Sanders wrote in response to a Trump tweet, describing far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as a \u201cwack job\u201d:\n\nIt's going to be a real pleasure defeating you. https://t.co/L8TGcUYy4G \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 4, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet came in reponse to a viral clip of a town hall attendee telling the socialist lawmaker that we must \u201ceat the babies\u201d to save the planet from climate change.

It means no person should have a billion dollars. The ascent of billionaires is a symptom & outcome of an immoral system that tells people affordable insulin is impossible but exploitation is fine. https://t.co/fjxKOGIdc2 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 2, 2019\n\nThe freshman lawmaker has yet to officially endorse a Democrat candidate, but she told CNN in May that the Democrat Party needed a candidate who has a \u201ccoherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,\u201d and cited both Sanders and Sen.
