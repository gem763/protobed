He played one Test the last time Australia successfully defended the urn on English soil and was the brains behind the team\u2019s resurgence in this series. Langer was charged with improving the culture of Australian cricket off the field and his attention to detail helped Australia to success on it.\n\nPat Cummins\n\nThe leading wicket-taker in the series shone throughout but his efforts in Australia\u2019s series-clinching match will long be remembered. He opened the innings by removing Rory Burns and Joe Root for ducks in the first over. He then got the first two wickets on the final day, including the key wicket of Headingley hero Ben Stokes for just one. His 24 wickets came at just 16.58.\n\nJosh Hazlewood\n\nHe was surprisingly left out of the first Test but after coming in at Lord\u2019s he soon proved a thorn in the side of England\u2019s batsmen, taking three wickets at the \u2018Home of Cricket\u2019 and nine at Headingley. And he stepped up when it mattered in the crucial Old Trafford Test.\n\nWith England looking well set on 166 for two, Hazlewood removed Burns (81) and Root (71) in successive overs. He soon bowled Jason Roy, too, and England were suddenly scrapping just to avoid the follow-on on 196 for five. Then in the second innings, his superb delivery bowled Jos Buttler and ended any realistic English hopes of saving the Test.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\n\nThe batsman started the summer batting for Glamorgan in Division Two of the County Championship and is on course to end it as Australia\u2019s second-highest run scorer in the Ashes. He was Test cricket\u2019s first concussion replacement for Smith at Lord\u2019s and his impressive 59 frustrated England\u2019s efforts of levelling the series.\n\nAt Headingley, with Smith sidelined, he was Australia\u2019s top scorer in both innings, with scores of 74 and 80. He then enjoyed a crucial century stand with Smith in the first innings at Old Trafford to move Australia into a strong position.\n\nPA", "description": "Steve Smith Where else to start?
