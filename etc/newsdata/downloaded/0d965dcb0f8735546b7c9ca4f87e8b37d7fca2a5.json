The fast and furious story of the infamous New Jersey water park is being turned into a documentary detailing both sunshine and litigation, appropriately called \u201cClass Action Park.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nA trailer for a documentary on Action Park was released on Thursday, promising insight into the sprawling entertainment complex in northwestern New Jersey that not only promised summer fun in the sun but also offered danger and countless liabilities. Opened in 1978, the water park boasted twisting rides, a go-kart track and countless other attractions geared for teenagers and pre-teens.\n\nBut the untold story, often whispered about and part of the allure of the location, centers on just how dangerous Action Park was and the gruesome injuries suffered. The park closed in 1996 but not without leaving a mark \u2013 often a permanent one requiring stitches \u2013 on the tens of thousands who visited it every year.\n\nThe Alpine Slide, known for its relaxing and leisurely pace, caused 14 fractures and 26 head injuries, according to one report, as well as \u201cAction Park\u2019s first death.\u201d\n\nThe documentary tells the story of the park and the love many still have for those hot, hazy summers spent in glorious freedom from responsibility. All done while simultaneously dodging death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFilmmakers Chris Charles Scott and Seth Porges detail this tug and pull for what was a rite of passage for many teenagers in the greater New York City region.\n\n\u201cEvery member of my family was injured in that park,\u201d comedian Jimmy Kimmel says in a bit during the trailer, then referring to the spot as \u201cTraction Park\u201d for all the serious injuries suffered.\n\nOthers took to social media to reminisce about the park.\n\nEntertainer Johnny Knoxville even produced a movie that was not-so-loosely based on the park, called \u201cAction Point.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube trailer succinctly summed up the magic and mayhem that was Action Park: \u201cIt was as a lawless land, ruled by drunk teenage employees and frequented by drunker teenage guests. The rides ignored basic notions of physics, common sense and safety. The end result lay somewhere between Lord of the Flies and a Saw movie.\u201d\n\nThere is no release date announced for the film.\n\nYears after closing, Action Park re-opened under new ownership as Mountain Creek. It features updated versions of the infamous Alpine Rush along with staples such as Colorado River and the wave pool.", "description": "Action Park was a popular summer hot spot in New Jersey for nearly two decades, closing in 1996.
