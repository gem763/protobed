It puts the death toll in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nDemocrat Ilhan Omar, who has previously said America was 'founded on genocide,' voted present on the measure which passed by 405 to 11. It comes amid furious calls from Washington for Ankara to end its incursion against the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\n'A country whose history is full of the stain of genocide and slavery neither has the right to say anything nor to lecture Turkey,' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the truth of the 'staggering crime' had been denied too often\n\nOmar said: 'Accountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as cudgel in a political fight.'\n\nErdogan's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu suggested Tuesday evening's resolution was 'revenge' for Erdogan's move against the Kurds - the fighters who were vital in the US ousting ISIS - deemed terrorists by Turkey.\n\nErdogan said in his televised address: 'In our faith, genocide is definitely banned ... We consider such an accusation to be the biggest insult to our people.'\n\nTuesday's vote was a first for the US Congress, where similar measures with such direct language have been introduced for decades but never passed.\n\nErdogan said the House vote was politically motivated, and hinted that the Turkish parliament would pass a counter resolution.\n\nHe did not specify what this would include but in previous speeches he has touched on the mistreatment of Native Americans and slaves.\n\nErdogan later told reporters he had not yet made up his mind about whether to go through with a visit to the United States which had been mooted for next month.\n\n'I haven't made my decision yet, there is a question mark,' he said.\n\nThe House also passed a measure on Tuesday imposing sanctions on senior Turkish officials involved in the Syria offensive.\n\nArmenians killed by Turks, during the Armenian Genocide in 1915\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) voted present on the resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide\n\nThe international recognition of the killings as genocide has long been the top priority of Armenia's foreign policy, supported by vigorous campaigning by Armenian diasporas around the world.\n\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan hailed the House move, tweeting that it was a 'bold step towards serving truth and historical #justice that also offers comfort to millions of descendants of the Armenian Genocide survivors.'\n\nThe Armenian foreign ministry said the resolution was of 'profound significance' and thanked US lawmakers for 'their overwhelming commitment to truth, justice, humanity and solidarity, and to universal values of human rights.'\n\nThe sentiment was shared by Armenians on the streets of the capital Yerevan.\n\n'I am so happy that the US has finally recognised the Armenian genocide,' said 69-year-old cobbler Koryun Hakobyan.\n\n'Other countries will now follow suit.'\n\nKim Kardashian, the US reality star who is a prominent member of the Armenian diaspora and visited Yerevan for the 2015 anniversary, hailed the Washington vote on social media.\n\n'WOW LOOK AT THESE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS!!! THE U.S. JUST RECOGNIZED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE!!!!' she wrote in a Tweet to her 62 million followers.\n\nKim Kardashian, the US reality star who is a prominent member of the Armenian diaspora and visited Yerevan for the 2015 anniversary, hailed the Washington vote on social media\n\nThis 1915 file photo, shows Armenian victims of the massacres in Turkey\n\nThis is the scene in Turkey in 1915 when Armenians were marched long distances and said to have been massacred\n\nTurkey's foreign ministry suggested the House measure was the result of domestic politics in the United States, where people of Armenian origin number between 500,000 and 1.5 million.\n\n'Its sole addressees are the Armenian lobby and anti-Turkey groups,' the ministry said.\n\nIn 2017, newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump criticized the killings as 'one of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century,' but in keeping with longstanding US practice he stopped short of using the word genocide.\n\nBefore being elected in 2008, Trump's predecessor Barack Obama had pledged to recognize the killings as genocide, but ultimately did not do so during his two terms in office.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the truth of the 'staggering crime' had been denied too often.\n\n'Today, let us clearly state the facts on the floor of this House to be etched forever into the Congressional Record: The barbarism committed against the Armenian people was a genocide.'", "description": "Turkey summoned the US ambassador to Ankara today after the House of Representatives voted to denounce 'the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923.'", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20380146-0-image-a-39_1572446711425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
