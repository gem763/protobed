He was the president\u2019s first secretary of state, serving from February 2017 until Trump fired him by tweet just over a year later.\n\nDemocrat New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office sued ExxonMobil Corp., alleging the oil giant committed fraud by deceiving investors about the future profitability of the business in the face of impending climate change regulation.\n\nThe case is the second time a climate case has gone to trial in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS\n\nExxon is accused of internally covering up costs it would incur from government rules designed to mitigate greenhouse gases. The lawsuit claims Exxon basically kept two sets of books -- using a public \u201cproxy cost\u201d of $80/ton of carbon emissions, a cost which would go toward the impending regulations, while internally telling investors regulations would only cost them around $40/ton of carbon emissions, allowing the company to become more brazen in its environmentally damaging investments, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe trial is seeking anywhere from $476 million to $1.6 billion in damages for shareholders. The case could also skew investor perception of oil and gas companies\u2019 prospects in light of evidence of climate change and new regulations it may spur.\n\nTillerson said that Irving, Texas-based Exxon knew climate change was a \u201creal issue\u201d and took it seriously. He said the company acted properly in what the suit described as keeping two sets of books. He said that one set of climate-risk calculations was for broad-level \u201cproxy costs,\u201d while the other was for \u201cgreenhouse gas costs\u201d to figure out how local fossil fuel regulations might affect specific projects, in order to get the \u201cbest assessment.\u201d\n\nHe said future policy impacts were difficult to take into account. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how else to model what future policy impacts might be. But whatever policies are, ultimately they come back to either your revenues or your costs.\u201d\n\nTRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUP'S ATTACK\n\nTillerson also said that he did not recall climate costs being a determining factor in any decisions he personally made during his tenure, which ended in 2016. However, James\u2019 office told the court last week that Tillerson was \u201cdeeply involved\u201d in determining the impact of climate science on Exxon\u2019s business prospects.\n\nTillerson said that he had opposed President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, and that during his tenure Exxon supported the concept of a carbon tax and in 2007 created a system to try to predict how regulations worldwide might reduce demand for oil and gas.\n\nTillerson added that the company would have no incentive to lowball the cost assumptions it used. \u201cWe would be misinforming ourselves.\u201d he said.\n\nExxon is a favorite target of environmentalists who allege that the company has known for decades that burning oil and gas would heat the planet. Massachusetts filed suit against the company last week. After a three-year investigation, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy filed suit alleging Exxon misled investors and deceived drivers and other consumers about the role of fossil fuels in climate change, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday that the company he formerly led as CEO, Exxon Mobil, did not attempt to downplay the effects of climate change regulation to investors.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/tillerson-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
