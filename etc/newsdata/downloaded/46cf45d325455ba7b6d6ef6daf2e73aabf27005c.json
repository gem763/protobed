The server then updates the map used by cars in real time with the data collected, and then sends that information to other cars for safety.\n\nTo test the speed and accuracy of the map updates, KT and Hyundai deployed three cars, dubbed M-Billy, for the trial.\n\nThe trial consisted of the three M-Billy cars being driven around the centre's track, with the front-most car being required to perform a sudden halt if a bicycle -- that was placed along the track -- blocked its passage. The second M-Billy car, which closely followed the first car, was required to read the information collected from the first car's sensors and also stop. The third M-Billy car, meanwhile, which would be further behind the other two cars, was tested to see if it could change lanes in accordance to the updated navigation data it received.\n\nDuring testing, the video of the first car coming to a sudden halt was also sent to passengers of the third car via 5G network. This was done through using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology that sends car data to handsets and adjacent sensors.\n\nKT and Hyundai said the technology would increase safety for autonomous cars and could also be used to detect jaywalkers.\n\nThe South Korean telco is a close partner in developing enterprise 5G applications with Hyundai Motor Group. The company is also currently working on a fleet management system for the latter's electric buses.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKT and Hyundai to collaborate in electric bus management\n\nThe South Korean telco will provide a fleet management system for Hyundai's electric buses.\n\nKT and Hyundai to deploy 5G networks into construction sites\n\nKT and Hyundai Engineering & Construction will collaborate to use 5G networks for automation in construction.\n\nHyundai and Kia invest $4.2m in new Korean cab-calling app\n\nThe app, Macaron Taxi, currently has a fleet of 200 cars with Hyundai and Kia expected to supply it with more vehicles.\n\nHyundai develops fingerprint tech to unlock and start cars\n\nHyundai Motor has developed a car system that will allow drivers to unlock and start their cars with fingerprints instead of keys, with plans to go live in China during the first quarter of 2019.", "description": "The real-time traffic navigation technology collects data from self-driving cars and transmits the data to those following in the rear for safety.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/22/7bc60537-1cd9-42dc-94a2-a08751ed6acc/thumbnail/770x578/fa77d00dad3f9b39e7169c2801780ec7/5-5g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
