According to a reconstructed transcript of the call released by the White House, which is not a verbatim account, he said:\n\n'I would like to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it.'\n\nTrump added that he'd like to have Attorney General William Barr call 'you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.'\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nCrowdStrike is a security firm that was hired by the DNC that detected, stopped and analyzed the hack five months before the 2016 election. The company determined in June 2016 that Russian agents had broken into the DNC's network and stolen emails published later by WikiLeaks\n\nCrowdStrike determined in June 2016 that Russian agents had broken into the committee's network and stolen emails that were subsequently published by WikiLeaks.\n\nIts findings were confirmed by FBI investigators, with whom it later shared the forensic evidence.\n\nBased on those findings, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 members of Russia's military intelligence agency and later concluded that their operation sought to favor Trump's candidacy.\n\nMueller testified before the U.S. Congress the day before Trump's phone call with Zelenskiy.\n\nIn the call, Trump mentioned Mueller's 'incompetent performance' and said 'they say it started with Ukraine.'\n\nTHE FICTIONS\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that he had 'absolutely' heard Trump mention 'the corruption that related to the DNC server'\n\nRepublican political operative Roger Stone has claimed that CrowdStrike is concealing evidence that could presumably clear Russia of culpability\n\nUkraine and Russia have been bitter foes since Russia's 2014 military intervention and annexation of Crimea. Unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about a purported Ukrainian link to the DNC hack began circulating almost immediately after it was discovered.\n\nSome propagated by Russian media and online included mention of a supposed 'hidden DNC server,' which acolytes of the Republican political operative Roger Stone picked up and circulated.\n\nStone is set to stand trial in November for allegedly lying to Congress, obstructing justice and witness tampering after getting swept up in the Mueller probe.\n\nHe has claimed that CrowdStrike is concealing evidence that could presumably clear Russia of culpability.\n\nA judge recently denied Stone's efforts to challenge the investigation into the hack. Stone sought to suppress search warrants that he alleged were based on faulty assumptions from CrowdStrike, but U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said there was no evidence anyone in the FBI had 'played fast and loose with the truth' in applying for the warrants.\n\nIn fact, CrowdStrike has also worked for the GOP. It helped the National Republican Congressional Committee investigate email thefts by unidentified hackers during the 2018 campaign, the company told the AP in December.\n\nTHE UKRAINIAN CONNECTION\n\nOne version of the conspiracy theory falsely contends CrowdStrike is owned by a wealthy Ukranian. In truth, CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russian-born U.S. citizen who immigrated as a child and graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nOne version of the conspiracy theory holds that CrowdStrike is owned by a wealthy Ukrainian. In fact, company co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russian-born U.S. citizen who immigrated as a child and graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nTrump himself has made this erroneous reference before.\n\nIn an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press, Trump said: 'Why wouldn't (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.'\n\n'CrowdStrike?' the interviewer asked.\n\n'That's what I heard,' Trump replied. 'I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It's incredible.'\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nThe reference raises questions about Trump's ability - or, perhaps, willingness- to sort between fact and fiction, analysts say.\n\n'If we take Trump's words at face value, then it appears that the president of the United States is intellectually unable to distinguish between utterly outlandish conspiracy theories and solid intelligence assessments based on facts,' said Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins security studies professor.\n\nJoan Donovan of Harvard University said conspiracy theories generally have two principal attributes: They simplify matters and lack attribution. And some political actors see a benefit to encouraging them.\n\n'Who can know the truth in these conditions? No one,' said Donovan, who directs the Kennedy School's technology and social change research project.\n\nCrowdStrike said in a statement that it 'provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI.' It added: 'We stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the U.S. Intelligence community.'\n\nMulvaney also acknowledged Thursday that the decision to hold up military aid to Ukraine was linked to his demand that Kyiv investigate the DNC and the 2016 campaign\n\nTHE LATEST RELEVANCE\n\nReferences to the server were included in the prepared remarks of U.S. envoy Gordon Sondland, who told Congress Thursday that he had heard the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, specifically say Trump wanted investigations into the 2016 election, including the server.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Mulvaney acknowledged that the decision to hold up military aid to Ukraine was linked to his demand that Kyiv investigate the DNC and the 2016 campaign.\n\n'The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,' Mulvaney said.\n\n'Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that,' he added. 'That's why we held up the money.'", "description": "In his iJuly phone call with Ukraine's president, President Trump referred briefly to a long-discredited conspiracy theory that tries to cast doubt on Russia's role in the 2016 hacking of the DNC.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/03/19867200-0-image-a-53_1571365786038.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
