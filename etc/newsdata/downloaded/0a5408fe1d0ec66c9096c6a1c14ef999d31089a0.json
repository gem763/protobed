They had a wide variety of themes - from paying homage to soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack, to a tribute to the Avengers: Endgame.\n\nReddit\n\nWhile one Ravana effigy was seen carrying Captain America's shield as he went up in flames, there was another one dressed as Thanos. Let's face it, it's possibly the best crossover ever!\n\nWhile the location of the Ravana carrying Captain America's shield is not clear, the one with Thanos was erected and burned down in Delhi's Karampura area.\n\nThe comments on Reddit couldn't stop comparing the effigy to the Endgame, one user wrote, 'Someone tell Thor not to aim for the head,' another wrote, 'It's legit interesting how Marvel grew out of movies in India instead of the comic books, like goddamn when Disney starts owning countries Marvel fans will just submit themselves'.\n\nDon't Miss 704 SHARES 41.9 K SHARES 13.4 K SHARES 8.4 K SHARES 6.5 K SHARES\n\nSomeone actually had a very interesting theory: 'A plot twist at MCU, RAAVAN is the brother of Thanos and he is going to take revenge for his brother's death in next MCU phase'.\n\nThe festival is marked as Dussehra in the north, Dasara in the south, Vijayadashami in east and north eastern states of India.\n\nReddit\n\nSince the festival marks the victory of good over evil, themes have ore often than not struck on social evils.
