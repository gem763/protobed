The deal between the two governments is the latest in a series of policies aimed at creating new layers of deterrents to the influx of migrants applying for protection on U.S. soil.\n\nKevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is scheduled to announce the deal Friday afternoon, according to administration officials with knowledge of the agreement. McAleenan traveled to El Salvador to hash out the accord last month with president Nayib Bukele.\n\nU.S. officials describe the deal as an \u201casylum cooperation agreement,\u201d insisting that such an accord does not amount to what is known as a \u201csafe third country\u201d deal. That term has been stigmatized in Central America, in large part because it would be difficult to consider the Northern Triangle region of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as a safe haven given that it has among the highest homicide rates in the world.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Immigration Trump-Administration-Reaches-Deal-To-Send-Asylum-Seekers-To-El-Salvador-In-An-Effort-To-Deter-Migrants-From-Entering-The-United-States"], "top_image": ""}
