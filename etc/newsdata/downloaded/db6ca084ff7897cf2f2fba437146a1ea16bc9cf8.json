Meanwhile, Morey has not addressed the controversy since several tweets attempting to clarify his position on the protests.\n\nSeveral of the league's biggest stars, including LeBron James and James Harden, attempted to soften the blow. James called Morey's comment \"misinformed,\" while Harden apologized for the tweet, saying, \"We apologize. We love China. We love playing there.\"\n\nThe NBA season kicks off Tuesday as the New Orleans Pelicans take on the reigning champion Toronto Raptors, and the Los Angeles Lakers face the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nRead more:", "description": "The Houston Rockets GM set off a firestorm between the NBA and China when he tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong", "authors": ["Justin Carissimo", "Justin Is A Breaking News Editor At Cbs News.
