The timeline for final approval was unclear Wednesday.\n\nThe EU is required under a pair of directives adopted by the bloc in recent years to identify countries that are susceptible to moving dirty money. But creating a blacklist has proven to be politically fraught.\n\nThe previous blacklist from the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, was rejected in March by member states, following pushback from Saudi Arabia, which was on the list, and the U.S., which had some of its territories listed.\n\nA big question facing the commission as it revamps its methodology is whether it can quell criticism that it wasn\u2019t clear about its reasons for including jurisdictions on its previous list.\n\n\u201cA lot of the controversy\u2014at least from our point of view on the list\u2014was who it didn\u2019t include,\u201d said David Schwartz, president and chief executive of the Florida International Bankers Association, whose members include banks with operations in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories that were on the list.\n\nThe EU\u2019s attempts to call out anti-money-laundering weaknesses abroad have been undercut, in part, by scandals on its own turf, including allegations that bank branches in Estonia have been used to move dirty money from Russia, compliance observers have said.\n\nThe commission is working to secure acceptance from policy makers in the European Parliament and European Council on a revamped methodology, according to Christian Wigand, a commission spokesman. It is also working with countries and jurisdictions that it deems as high-risk.\n\n\u201cThe commission remains fully committed to deliver a new list in line with our legal obligation to do so and in order to protect the EU financial system,\u201d Mr. Wigand said.\n\nBlacklists impose higher compliance costs and due-diligence requirements, as well as possible reputational risks, on banks that operate in designated countries. The EU blacklist, if approved, would apply to financial institutions based in the bloc\u2019s 28 countries.\n\nComplicating the EU\u2019s effort is the fact that the Financial Action Task Force, the anti-money-laundering standard-setter, has a longstanding blacklist of its own. The FATF, established by the Group of Seven leading nations 30 years ago, counts several European countries, as well as the European Commission, on its member roster.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Departmentraised the issue of overlapping lists in February when the EU designated Puerto Rico and other territories as high-risk. Unlike the FATF\u2019s process, which includes extensive reviews and consultations, the EU\u2019s process involved minimal communication with the countries affected, the Treasury said.\n\nThe Treasury \u201chas significant concerns about the substance of the list and the flawed process by which it was developed,\u201d it said at the time.\n\nUnder the newly proposed EU methodology, the European Commission would adopt the FATF\u2019s high-risk designations while adding other requirements to \u201ctop up\u201d the FATF\u2019s action plans as it deems necessary, according to the documents published ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\nAdditionally, it would establish country-specific benchmarks for evaluating jurisdictions, and countries would have 12 months to address the EU\u2019s concerns before appearing on a blacklist, the documents said.\n\nIt was unclear when the commission would publish a new version of its list.\n\nWhat sank the previous effort was a hasty rollout by EU leaders looking to appear tough on financial crime and who should have given blacklisted countries more time to respond, said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who focuses on European economic issues. \u201cIt was fundamentally political,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said.\n\nWrite to Kristin Broughton at kristin.broughton@wsj.com", "description": "The European Union is working on a new approach for flagging countries with weak anti-money-laundering laws after the bloc\u2019s previous attempt to create a blacklist failed earlier this year.", "authors": ["Kristin Broughton"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-115559/social", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
