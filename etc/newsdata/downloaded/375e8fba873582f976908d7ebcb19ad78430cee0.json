(AP) - A week after winning a close game on the road, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers found a way to lose one at home in excruciating fashion.\n\nThings don\u2019t figure to get much easier the next two months for a team that\u2019s still learning what it takes to be successful.\n\nRookie kicker Matt Gay remained a hot topic on Monday, as did coach Bruce Arians\u2018 unconventional decision to use a delay of game penalty to move the ball 5 yards farther back before the sixth-round draft pick narrowly missed a potential game-winning 34-yard field goal in a 32-31 loss to the New York Giants.\n\nGay also missed an extra point and had another blocked.\n\nArians, in his first season at the helm of the Bucs, laughed when asked if he believes in the notion that the kicking game, which has been problematic in recent years, is cursed.\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s just finding ways to win games,\u201d the 66-year-old coach said. \u201cWe found a way to win in Carolina, we didn\u2019t find a way against San Francisco (three weeks ago). New York, we found a way, (but) we just didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d\n\nAt 1-2, with both losses coming at home, the Bucs face an uphill battle to end the NFL\u2019s second-longest playoff drought. The team hasn\u2019t made the postseason since 2007 and is entering a daunting stretch in which they won\u2019t play at Raymond James Stadium again until Nov. 10.\n\nOn the front end of the six-week odyssey between true home games, Tampa Bay will travel to Los Angeles to face the defending NFC champion Rams, visit the New Orleans Saints and fly to England for a \u201chome\u201d date against the Panthers in London.\n\nA bye week, followed by trips to Tennessee and Seattle complete a string of games that could make or break the season.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves in this hole, now we have to play great football,\u201d quarterback Jameis Winston said after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Daniel Jones-led Giants, who rallied from an 18-point halftime deficit in the rookie quarterback\u2019s first pro start.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we can learn from,\u201d Winston added. \u201cWe have to finish the game.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nAn improved running game has eased some of the burden on Winston to carry the offense. The Bucs still haven\u2019t had an individual 100-yard rushing performance, however they did gain 144 yards on 32 attempts against New York. Ronald Jones led the way with 80 yards on 14 carries, and Peyton Barber finished with 48 yards on 13 attempts.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offense was just 4 of 14 on third downs against the Giants. Also, four trips inside the New York 10-yard line only produced one touchdown.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nWR Mike Evans, OLB Shaquil Barrett. Winston\u2019s favorite target had eight receptions for 190 yards and three TDs. Evans also had a 44-yard reception to get the Bucs into field-goal range at the end. Gay, who rebounded from failing to convert two extra points in the opening quarter to make field goals of 47, 27, 52 and 23 yards, missed the potential game-winner wide right. Barrett, meanwhile, had four sacks. That came on the heels of three vs. Carolina. He has eight in three games.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nGay\u2019s strong leg made him attractive to the Bucs, whose recent kicking woes extend back to a poor decision to draft Roberto Aguayo in the second round in 2016. The rookie has been solid on long field-goal attempts but struggled on shorter kicks. At least for now, Arians is not second-guessing the decision to draft him.\n\nINJURED\n\nRookie ILB Devin White sat out Sunday\u2019s loss with a knee injury suffered against Carolina. The Bucs didn\u2019t report any significant injuries coming out of the game.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nSeven. Calendar weeks that will have passed by the time the Bucs play their next true home game, Nov. 10 vs. Arizona.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nArians said moving forward, players need to correct mistakes that were costly against Giants and remember: \u201cYou learn a hell of a lot more by almost losing than you do by losing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A week after winning a close game on the road, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers found a way to lose one at home in excruciating fashion.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/giants_buccaneers_football_91943_c0-11-4454-2607_s1770x1032.jpg?15c90453d9a9e830618453b0b1ea52c7d3d078a4", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
