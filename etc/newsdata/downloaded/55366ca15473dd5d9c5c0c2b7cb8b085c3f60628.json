I haven\u2019t been able to do much since we broke up because the heartache is just too much.\n\nHow can I get over her and start moving on with my life?\n\nJade: Break-ups can be difficult. Especially when you\u2019re on the receiving end and are caught off guard by the news.\n\nBut they are inevitable for all of us at least once in a lifetime.\n\nAlthough it might not seem like it now, it\u2019s important to remind yourself that it\u2019s not the end of the world.\n\nInstead, I suggest that you look at this moment in your life as an opportunity to rediscover yourself and learn to enjoy your own company again. Approach it like a silver lining and re-establish your connections with family and friends that you might have neglected. Go out, discover new places and things to do and try to avoid the places you went to with your former lover.\n\nResist all urges to bombard your ex with unwanted calls and texts. You\u2019ll only regret it when you finally come to your senses \u2013 and you will.\n\nInstead of reaching out, get a diary to write down all the nasty things you wish you could say to her. This way you get to express yourself without repeated rejection.\n\nIt\u2019s not unheard of to beat yourself up and start asking questions, such as \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d and \u201cwas I not enough?\u201d. Just make room to allow yourself to go through the painful emotions of a break-up and to cry when you feel like it.\n\nDon\u2019t run away from the pain. And, while no one can prescribe how long you mourn your loss, remember that you are not defined by a break-up or a relationship.\n\nBe open to the idea that not everyone feels the need for closure and so you might not get that from your ex. Your questions might go unanswered.\n\nBreak-ups don\u2019t always go the way we think they should and people must deal with them in their own way.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nDo you have a question for Jade?
