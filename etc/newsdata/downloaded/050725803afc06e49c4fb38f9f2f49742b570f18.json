Mr. Barr's \"investigation\" has already jeopardized key international intelligence partnerships. He needs to come before Congress and explain himself. https://t.co/hl9qM86QrM \u2014 Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) October 25, 2019\n\nCould it be the good senator from Virginia is himself hiding something?\n\nHrm.\n\nSean Davis has a few ideas about why Warner reacted the way he did:\n\nNot surprising that Warner, who was secretly colluding with the bagman for Julian Assange, Christopher Steele, and the Russian foreign minister, doesn\u2019t want DOJ getting to the bottom of what his foreign agent associates were up to in 2016. https://t.co/UbqhU3HzMP \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 25, 2019\n\nOh, THAT\u2019S right.\n\nAnd wow, they are all so freakin\u2019 dirty.\n\nBarr is definitely over the target with this kind of nonsense being said. \u2014 singlemaltscotch (@singlemltscotch) October 25, 2019\n\nLet's hope his name shows up on an indictment. \u2014 The Vast Right Wing (@TheVastRightWin) October 25, 2019\n\nSubpoena?\n\nHe just doesnt want to be caught and jeopardize his cushy job \u2014 Joe Bradley (@jwbatx) October 25, 2019\n\nSomething like that.\n\nWho was that you were using to try to reach out to Deripaska?

Warner has refused to explain why he was coordinating with a Russian agent who was also repping Christopher Steele. https://t.co/E1LV76toU5 \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 25, 2019\n\nOops.\n\nFrom The Federalist:\n\nCongressional documents and recently leaked texts between Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and a registered foreign agent for a Russian aluminum oligarch indicate that Daniel J. Jones is intimately involved with ongoing efforts to retroactively validate a series of salacious and unverified memos produced by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, and Fusion GPS. The dossier, which declassified documents show was used as a basis for securing secret wiretaps on Trump campaign affiliates, was reportedly jointly funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nDouble oops even.\n\nNo wonder he\u2019s sweatin\u2019 it.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018Nadler is WRONG\u2019: Rep.
