But mine is different, I started this business to ignite change within my community,\u201d said Sophi.\n\n\n\nThe 29-year-old, who is studying towards a masters degree in project management at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, has turned his late younger brother\u2019s bedroom into a clothing store full of caps, jackets, shirts, shoes and crewnecks.\n\n\u201cSo, what we do is that we buy the fabric, but we get seamstresses and people with sewing skills here in Makhaza to assemble the garments and pay them for it. After that, the garments go to our studio in Claremont for printing and embroidery. I would say 80% is done by the community and 20% of the work is outsourced,\u201d said Sophi.\n\nAt the end of 2018, MK Originals recorded around R380,000 in revenue and made around R150,000 in gross profit.\n\n\u201cWe also receive orders from churches, schools and private companies who ask us to make T-shirts and other garments for them. This has been an important stream of income for us,\u201d Sophi said.\n\n\n\nSophi and other local entrepreneurs recently started an event called \u201cUdaba Pop-Up Experience\u201d which takes place on the first Sunday of each month.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe open the street and set-up various food, drink and clothing stalls. So people can shop and enjoy themselves on a Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that a portion of MK Originals's profits also go towards initiatives including workshops, skills-development training, and supporting the local football club.\n\n\u201cWe want to assist other young people who want to go into business. We want to have conversations about product development, market access and challenges in getting funding,\u201d said Sophi.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rate of unemployment seems to be getting worse each year. As young people we can\u2019t wait on government or the private sector to create jobs for us, we must start our own businesses. Sure, we\u2019re not all going to be entrepreneurs, but even if you find employment you must have a skill that you can fall back on in case things don\u2019t go as planned,\u201d he added.\n\nSophi currently employs seven people and his future plans include purchasing houses in the township, renovating them and turning them into stores, in a bid to normalise entrepreneurship in the township and to show off its creativity.\n\n\u201cI want to do this because you won\u2019t see us at the mall. I believe we will lose what we stand for in terms of culture. We want to show off the creative side of our community.\u201d says the entrepreneur.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "This is the heart of MK Originals, a clothing brand founded by Siyabulela Sophi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9400/3c0631b3aba94ed9a528c920d8e546a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
