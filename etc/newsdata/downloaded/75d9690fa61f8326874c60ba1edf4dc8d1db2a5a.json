Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is facing calls to resign Tuesday, a day after the New York Times reported on threats he made to government employees for not sufficiently backing President Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama.\n\nThe saga dates back to September 1, when Trump tweeted that Alabama, along with several other states, \u201cwill most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Dorian. Twenty minutes after Trump\u2019s tweet, the Birmingham office of the National Weather Service tweeted that \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\u201d\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nThe experts were right, but Trump dragged out the story last week, insisting that Alabama was at one point in Dorian\u2019s path. And on Friday morning, Ross attempted to help his boss out. According to the Times, Ross called Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, and insisted that he do something about the NWS\u2019s public contradiction of Trump. Jacobs balked at the demand, but when Ross reportedly threatened his job (an action that the Commerce Department denies), Jacobs conceded.\n\nFriday evening NOAA put out an unsigned statement saying that the tweet from NWS Birmingham, by this time a week old, was \u201cinconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately, the Commerce Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General launched an investigation, the Times reports:\n\nThe National Weather Service \u201cmust maintain standards of scientific integrity,\u201d the inspector general, Peggy E. Gustafson, wrote in a message to NOAA staff members in which she requested documents related to Friday\u2019s statement. The circumstances, she wrote, \u201ccall into question the NWS\u2019s processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency.\u201d\n\nAnd just as quickly, calls for Ross\u2019s resignation began. Democratic representatives Don Beyer and Paul Tonko were among the first to say Ross should step down. \u201cWilbur Ross does not deserve the trust of the American people or a place in the Cabinet and he should be dismissed immediately,\u201d Beyer wrote. Several other Democrats in the House have joined them.\n\nIn a tweet, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Ross\u2019s \u201cthuggish\u201d behavior and compared him to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. He stopped short of calling for his job, though.\n\nOutside the government, groups such as the Sierra Club called for Ross to go. \u201cHis actions, on behalf of Donald Trump, threatened to instill panic simply to give cover for Trump,\u201d Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said in a statement. \u201cObviously, this shameless abuse of power could have devastating results now and in the future, demonstrating that Ross is unfit to continue in the cabinet and that he does not care that he is supposed to represent the American public above Trump\u2019s fragile ego.\u201d", "description": "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened NOAA employees who didn\u2019t back Trump\u2019s claims that Alamaba was in Dorian\u2019s path.", "authors": ["Adam K.
