Almost a quarter of Year Six children are obese or severely obese\n\nOverall, more than a third of Year 6 pupils (34.3 per cent) are overweight or obese - an 8.5 per cent increase on the 31.6 per cent in 2006/7.\n\nIt means around 206,000 children are heavier than they should be for their age before they have left primary school.\n\nAnd the latest NHS data showed a staggering 24.6 per cent of Year 6 children are either obese or severely obese.\n\nHOW HAVE THE FIGURES CHANGED? Year Six children who are overweight or obese 2006/7: 31.6 per cent 2018/19: 34/3 per cent Year Six children who are obese: 2006/7: 17.5 per cent 2018/19: 20.2 per cent Year Six children who are severely obese: 2006/7: 3.2 per cent 2018/19: 4.4 per cent\n\nThe rate of children that are severely obese is the highest rate on record, and three times higher than 12 years ago.\n\nIt's increased to 4.4 per cent from 3.2 per cent in 2006/7 and 4.2 per cent in 2017/18.\n\nChildren aged four to five are also fatter than they were last year, the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) data showed.\n\nOverall, 22.6 per cent of children in Reception are overweight or obese - amounting to 135,020 infants, compared with 22.4 per cent last year.\n\nMore than one in ten children in Reception are either severely obese (2.4 per cent, the same as the previous year) or obese (9.7 per cent - up on the 9.5 per cent on the previous year). Little has changed since 2006/07.\n\nNHS chief executive Simon Stevens said: 'These figures show that, as a country, we are clearly not on track to meet the government's sensible goal of halving childhood obesity.\n\n'While the NHS will be there for patients, services and budgets will obviously be placed under more strain.\n\n'So we also need combined action from parents, businesses and government to safeguard our children from this preventable harm.'\n\nMore than one in ten children in Reception are either obese or severely obese, figures show\n\n'Obesity is a dangerous public health threat for our children, leading to a string of serious illnesses.'\n\nMr Stevens' comments echo those Dame Sally Davies, the outgoing chief medical officer, who said drastic measures were needed to combat childhood obesity.\n\nIn her final report published yesterday, Dame Sally called for a ban on eating public transport to prevent 'mindless snacking'.\n\nThe bold recommendations also include phasing out any advertising and sponsorship of unhealthy foods and drink at major public venues, and introducing plain 'cigarette-style' packaging.\n\nDame Sally warned that the country is 'nowhere near' meeting 2030 Government ambitions to slash childhood obesity rates by half.\n\nTam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, told MailOnline: 'The government is continually reminding us that it has a \"world-leading \" strategy to tackle obesity.\n\n'These statistics show that is just not true but if Downing Street promptly adopts the proposals outlined England's outgoing Chief Medical Officer, it may well have something to crow about in only a few years time.\n\n'Dame Sally has proposed that children's weight be assessed every time the child is seen by a doctor or health professional. Her successor should ensure that the measure is implemented.'\n\nWHERE ARE 10 AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE OF FAT CHILDREN IN YEAR SIX?

And nearly half of youngsters eat crisps before eating cabbage and other greens. The poll of 1,500 parents with children under the age of five found that seven out of 10 of the mothers and fathers quizzed said their child does not get enough greens in their diet. It found that 36 per cent of parents admitted their child tried a chip before a carrot, with 18 per cent tackling a hamburger before they tasted broccoli. A total of 47 per cent said their youngster had eaten crisps before trying greens like cabbage, and 16 per cent admitted their little one had feasted on pizza before ever tasting a pea. According to the poll, 80 per cent of parents found the weaning stage - when babies are introduced to solid foods - incredibly stressful in terms of making sure their child got the nutrients they needed. In a bid to get their children to eat vegetables, 38 per cent of parents admitted saying that eating carrots gave you \u2018superpowers\u2019 like seeing in the dark, with 28 per cent pretending that vegetables were actually treats. A total of 54 per cent of parents say they used the \u2018choo-choo\u2019 methods of feeding their kids, pretending the spoon is a train. And 58 per cent of mothers and fathers admitted they lied to friends about how many types of fruit and veg their children ate to make themselves seem better parents. Mark Cuddigan, the boss of Ella\u2019s Kitchen, which carried out the poll, said: 'We know that introducing a variety of vegetables early during weaning, helps little ones learn how to love new veggie tastes, but we also know it\u2019s not always an easy task. 'It can take up to eight tries for little ones\u2019 tiny taste buds to learn to accept the taste of all types of veg, so we encourage parents to keep trying. It\u2019s never too late to grow a little veg lover.'\n\nJo Churchill, Public Health Minister, said: 'These data highlight once again how important it is for us to tackle childhood obesity, which has a devastating impact on the health of our children.'\n\nIn both Reception and Year 6, boys are more likely to be severely obese than girls.\n\nThe difference is most stark in Year 6, where 5.2 per cent of boys are severely obese compared with 3.4 per cent of girls.\n\nCaroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said: 'Every child has the right to grow up healthy, but this data shows the stark reality is that children are being overwhelmed by a flood of unhealthy food in our environment.\n\n'The number of children with a weight classified as severely obese is at an all-time high and this will damage their health now and in the future.\n\n'It\u2019s time for the Government to bring in the measures that we know will stem the tide of unhealthy food marketing and promotions, starting with the long overdue 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV and online.'\n\nThe data also showed the widening gap between rates of childhood obesity in the most deprived areas compared with the least.\n\nAlmost half (44.9 per cent) of all year six children in Barking and Dagenham were considered to be overweight, obese or severely obese in 2018/19.\n\nFour other London boroughs ranked in the top 10: Enfield (42.3 per cent), Brent (41.5 per cent), Greenwich (41.5 per cent) and Tower Hamlets (41.4 per cent).\n\nIn contrast, the rate was just 23.4 per cent in Richmond upon Thames, which had the lowest prevalence of obesity among 10 and 11 year olds.\n\nAmong Reception-aged children, Kingston upon Hull had the highest prevalence of youngsters being overweight (29.4 per cent).\n\nIt was followed by Knowsley in Merseyside (29 per cent), Redcar and Cleveland (28.8 per cent) and Blackpool (28.7 per cent).\n\nAt the other end of the scale came Kingston upon Thames (15.3 per cent), Richmond upon Thames (16.5 per cent) and Windsor and Maidenhead (16.8 per cent).\n\nEustace De Sousa, national lead for children at Public Health England (PHE), which oversees the NCMP data collection, said: 'Our most deprived areas are often the worst affected by childhood obesity.\n\n'These widening health inequalities show why such urgent action is needed to improve our children\u2019s health. We are taking positive action, but change won\u2019t happen overnight.\n\n'A healthy weight in childhood can help lay the foundations for a healthy life in adulthood, but achieving this is far more difficult for some children than others.'\n\nLast month, a report from PHE said food firms are failing to cut sugar fast enough, with some puddings and sweets actually getting more sugary.\n\nAt present, food firms are in a voluntary agreement with the Government over cutting sugar and fat in foods.\n\nThe mandatory sugar tax was slapped on soft drinks in 2018 which has led to a 28.8 per cent reduction in sugar per 100ml of drink.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to see a review of so-called 'sin taxes' \u2013 including the sugar tax \u2013 to see how effective they are.\n\nA resounding call for more action against food and drink giants is being pushed by experts, including Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE.\n\nShe said: 'Too many children remain overweight or obese, and severe obesity in Year Six has reached a new high \u2013 putting children at risk of poor mental and physical health now and as they become adults.\n\n'That\u2019s why we are addressing the wider factors impacting our children\u2019s weight \u2013 from working with industry to improve the food they eat, to helping local councils create healthier environments to live in. However, we know more action is needed.'\n\nOverweight children are more likely to be overweight or obese as adults, increasing their risk of serious illnesses including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.\n\nDame Sally's report said thousands of children are already suffering type 2 diabetes, asthma and musculokskeletal pain as a result of their excess weight.\n\nAs many as 120,000 cases of asthma in children may be caused by overweight or obesity, while as many as 650,000 children are thought to have fatty liver disease.\n\nMental health is also at stake, with problems such as depression, poor self-esteem, and bullying posing a threat to England's youngsters.\n\nWHERE ARE CHILDREN IN YEAR SIX THE MOST OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE?
