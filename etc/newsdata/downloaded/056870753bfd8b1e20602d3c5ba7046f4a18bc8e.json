The mere fact that the Times published a story alleging Kavanaugh had drunkenly assaulted someone 30 years ago, without any substantive details beyond hearsay, was enough to prompt three prominent Democrats to demand that Kavanaugh be ousted from the high court. Three candidates, bear in mind, who among them appear to have the combined support of 30 percent of their party\u2019s base.\n\nThe story immediately collapsed; the Times acknowledged that the alleged victim didn\u2019t want the matter raised, and her friends reported that she did not recall any such incident. The editors of the Times took no precautions to assure that there actually was a real source for the story. Yet that was still enough to prompt Senator Warren, now charging toward the lead among Democratic presidential aspirants, and Senator Harris, the former attorney general of California, and O\u2019Rourke, who got 48.3 percent of the vote running against Ted Cruz for the U.S. Senate in Texas last year, to demand the removal in disgrace of a U.S. Supreme Court justice. It is inconceivable that any serious person could wish the presidency of the United States in the hands of such people.\n\nDissension Within the Ranks\n\nThe failure of the New York Times is so complete and so inexcusable\u2014no effort whatever to verify this grievous allegation and concealment of the doubtfulness of it\u2014that it has started to fray the Democratic media\u2019s solid wall.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman and foaming-at-the-mouth Trumpophobe, lambasted the Times. This was an unheard-of breaking of ranks, though presumably a tactical effort to amputate the gangrene of the Times\u2019 naked partisanship in order to try to salvage some credibility for the beleaguered anti-Trump media.\n\nScarborough\u2019s dash for the tall grass didn\u2019t start a rampage. Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, the former producer of the television series \u201cWest Wing,\u201d whose last foray for the anti-Trump cause was the ill-fated floater that the president had obtained loans from German banks on the guaranties of Russian oligarchs, facilitated the escape of the New York Times reporters. Under his questioning, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly laid the blame on their editors, who, unknown to them, eliminated the sentence noting the fact that Kavanaugh\u2019s alleged victim did not recall the incident alleged.\n\nThis is fairly implausible, as the woman\u2019s inability to recollect the incident makes a formidable prima facie case that there was no incident, which even at the Times might seriously dilute the newsworthiness of the story. This is from the same newspaper that told us the investigation of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia began with the sinister meeting of former Australian opposition leader and high commissioner in London, Alexander Downer, and low-level Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at London\u2019s Kensington Wine Bar over a couple of drinks.\n\nThe Times conceded after the 2016 presidential election that it had been partisan in its coverage, without suggesting that it intended to change its tune, and it has since declared its intention to present, in effect, rank propaganda as news. This may please most Times readers, but it is certain, ultimately, to erode the goodwill in the trademark and the credibility of the product. And the defection of Joe Scarborough is likely to be more than a straw in the wind.\n\nAn Orgy of Collective Impoverishment\n\nThe Democratic candidates are hopeless, except possibly for Amy Klobuchar (D.-Minn.), who seems to retain some solid Minnesota credentials as a sane liberal of the Hubert Humphrey-Walter Mondale school\u2014no world-beater but not someone to use to scare young children into eating their breakfast cereal either.\n\nJoe Biden is being carried all the way down the field toward the finish line; the country waits for and celebrates his verbal blunders in what has become a great national sport. Bernie Sanders is a cranky, acoustically annoying Marxist crackpot whose thinking hasn\u2019t even advanced to the Twentieth Communist Party Congress (1956).\n\nSenator Warren is the chief challenger: a tedious, belligerent socialist who calls herself a capitalist, and has a \u201cplan\u201d for everything. But she lied about her ancestry for economic benefit and her \u201cplans\u201d are an orgy of socialistic collective impoverishment.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just false stories in the New York Times that send Democratic legislators to the media barricades demanding impeachment. Jerry Nadler\u2019s dismal circus in the House Judiciary Committee racked up another fiasco on Tuesday with the appearance of former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The majority counsel, Barry Berke, sent the bored stay-at-homes of America back to their soap operas with his irritating badgering about whether Lewandowski had always told the whole truth to the press; concluded that he hadn\u2019t and that therefore he was ashamed of matters that had occurred at the Trump campaign and that therefore he was trying to cover up criminal behavior.\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), the first to drop out of the Democratic presidential race\u2014i.e., the person with the least support of all these dozens of deadbeats and socialist kooks\u2014claimed some triumph for himself in Lewandowski\u2019s refusal to read for the committee and television cameras an extract from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nTrump cooperated entirely with Mueller, while denouncing his inquiry, and stonewalling congressional attempts to pretend the Democrats have a right to a permanent investigation of this president. Someone who has cooperated completely with real (and rabidly hostile) investigators cannot be accused of obstructing justice by partisan Democratic mudslingers in Congress.\n\nAs had been widely foreseen, it has all become boring and ludicrous and is about to be overwhelmed by the indictments of the fabricators of the whole Trump impeachment fraud.\n\nThe Democratic legislative sickness isn\u2019t confined to ineffectual haymakers aimed at the administration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced a couple of weeks ago he would table legislation restricting the sale of body armor. In 60 years of closely following politics in Washington, that is possibly the stupidest idea for a bill I have seen.\n\nSchumer was motivated in his innovative theory by the notion that if the sales of bullet-resistant body armor were restricted, mass killers would not be able to obtain them and would be deterred from such evil acts. This notion is unutterably asinine, sank like a stone, and is only cited as evidence of the terrible deterioration of the bipartisan political apparatus that Trump set out to remove and replace in 2015.\n\nTrump\u2019s Astonishing Change\n\nFinally, the president\u2019s mood is more relaxed. When asked last week if there were any Democratic candidates he thought well of, he replied \u201cI respect them all . . . it\u2019s hard work campaigning for president and I respect them all.\u201d\n\nTrump referred to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as a strong and capable person. His timing is perfect; the Democrats thrash away like drowning spiders and he is, finally, above it all where presidents belong, and the polls are already inching up again, to and above 50 percent at last.\n\nLike a carefully rehearsed dance of the veils, Trump has attacked, surmounted the Russian collusion fraud, turned the tables, won the great slanging match, and is now rising above the fray to the relief of those who don\u2019t like such indignities. It is an astonishing change from the near-chaos of the administration\u2019s early days.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168735261-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
