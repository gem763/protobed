CNN is offering urgent live updates and an official \u201cimpeachment watch newsletter\u201d for those who need a program of events. The Washington Post, CBS and The New York Times are also among the many news organizations which feel called upon to offer live updates as well.\n\nNews coverage, meanwhile, is showcasing polls which suggest more voters favor impeaching President Trump \u2014 even if that sentiment is not held by the majority of respondents.\n\nAll this frenzy could be working, though. An Axios analysis reports that it only took a month for the formal \u201cinquiry\u201d against Mr. Trump to get rolling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how fast it has gotten off the ground. You can see how quickly the Ukraine phone call came out of nowhere to become the all-consuming impeachment topic \u2014 way faster than the impeachment inquiries into Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton,\u201d Axios said.\n\nAnd the numbers: It took over 18 months for the Nixon inquiry to be authorized following the Watergate break-in in 1972 \u2014 and nine months for Mr. Clinton\u2019s inquiry to get underway in 1998 following revelations about his dalliance with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nRepublicans push back. They wonder what Rep. Adam Schiff. the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is up to behind closed doors on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat is Adam Schiff trying to hide in that room that 75% of the voting members of Congress can\u2019t go in, can\u2019t have access to the documents, can\u2019t even read the transcripts,\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise told Fox News.\n\nHe figures that the 75% of lawmakers who are left out of the process represent 230 million people \u2014 who are also being denied representation.\n\n\u201cSunshine is the best disinfectant to what is rotten to the core,\u201d Mr. Scalise declared.\n\n\u201cWhy the secrecy, Rep. Schiff?\u201d asks the New York Post editorial board.\n\n\u201cIf the public can\u2019t see for itself that a given witness actually weakens the case for impeaching President Trump, then it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 Democrats can still march out and tell the press the testimony was damning. Republicans may say the reverse \u2014 but in a he-said/she-said, the media is guaranteed to maximize any hit against the president,\u201d the board continued.\n\n\u201cBut Democrats can\u2019t keep things secret forever. And then it\u2019s up to the American people to decide whether this amounts to a mountain \u2014 or a molehill,\u201d they concluded.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Membership Card.\u201d\n\nWell, yes. That\u2019s a new outreach to card-carrying supporters from the always clever Team Trump 2020, the creative team within President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Future availability? We\u2019ll let you know.\n\nSORRY NANCY\n\nOh dear. A White House website \u201cWe the People\u201d petition calling on Congress to \u201cIMPEACH Pelosi for treason!\u201d has garnered over a quarter-million signatures to date, reports sharp-eyed CNS.com analyst Craig Bannister. Indeed, some 262,000 signatures now back the idea, placing the petition in the top 10 most-visited political pleas at the official site.\n\n\u201cThe petition argues that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a traitor to the United States because she provides support to its \u2018enemies\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants \u2014 by opposing border wall funding and by supporting sanctuary cities and tax-funded benefits for illegal aliens,\u201d Mr. Bannister writes.\n\nThe Georgia woman who created the petition in January, Marjorie Taylor Greene, personally delivered a copy of the petition to the California Democrat\u2019s House office on Feb. 22, Mr. Bannister writes, noting that Mrs. Greene \u2014 a business owner, wife and mother \u2014 has launched a campaign to become the Republican House candidate for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, consulting with members of the House Freedom Caucus and its founder, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.\n\nHALLOWEEN IN WASHINGTON\n\nOh the horror. If you are curious how Halloween is celebrated in the nation\u2019s capital, a few examples of the holiday fare set to take place this weekend according to ThingstodoDC.com, a social networking provider.\n\nWell, there\u2019s always the American Werewolves in Paris Halloween Gala at the Embassy of France which includes ballroom dancing and live \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d performances. There\u2019s also a \u201cNightmare of the Nation\u201d scavenger hunt for 100 weird items hidden throughout the city plus the annual Trick of Treat Embassy Row Walking Tour which does include trick or treating at multiple embassies. This is technically considered trick-or-treating on \u201cforeign soil.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Embassy of Romania plans a \u201cTransylvania Evening\u201d that includes \u201cDracula himself\u201d while a Halloween Graveyard Jam at a midtown nightclub features fare suited for \u2018ghosts, goblins, wolfmen, witches, vampires, politicians, and other scary creatures.\u201d\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale; The Montier Homestead, classic Georgian Colonial built of stone and stucco in 1772 on one acre in Glenside, Pennsylvania.
