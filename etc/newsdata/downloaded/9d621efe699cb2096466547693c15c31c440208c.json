Jose Serrano Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Elections Democrats grapple for open congressional seat in the Bronx\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Ruben Diaz Sr.\u2019s enemies call him a homophobic egomaniac \u2014 more of a mini-Trump than a Democrat.\n\nBut they also insist the longtime New York legislator is the man to beat in the South Bronx as Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano prepares to retire next year after nearly three decades in office, leaving a wide-open race in one of the poorest, most Democratic districts in America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWelcome to one of the more unusual 2020 Democratic primaries, a brewing Bronx showdown where the staunchly conservative Pentecostal reverend with a history of controversial anti-gay comments is facing off against a host of progressive candidates \u2014 including Ritchie Torres, a 31-year-old gay Council member who enjoys a large financial advantage in the race, but maintains that he is the underdog.\n\n\u201cRuben Diaz Sr. is the frontrunner by default. If the race were held today, he would win on the sheer strength of name recognition,\u201d Torres said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that the most Democratic Congressional district in America could be represented by a de facto Trump Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cThe notion of Ruben Diaz Sr. succeeding a larger than life icon like Jose Serrano represents a nightmare for the Democratic party, for the progressive movement.\u201d\n\nThe race will be a test of whether the new progressive politics that have dominated New York politics of late translate to a community where longstanding ties to leaders like Diaz still hold significant sway over the electorate \u2014 especially in a population where religious and social issues still drive votes.\n\nDiaz, who opposes abortion rights and was the only Democrat to vote against gay marriage as a state senator, was stripped this year of his committee overseeing the taxi industry for saying the City Council was \u201ccontrolled by the homosexual community.\u201d\n\nNew York Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Ted Cruz during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThat history makes him a useful foil for his many rivals for the seat, but political observers say there\u2019s a real chance he could win.\n\nThe core voters in the district have traditionally been senior Latina women, said Eli Valentin, a political consultant and professor at Monroe College.\n\n\u201cThey tend to be socially conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cHis comments don\u2019t shock them too much.\u201d\n\nDiaz Sr. shares a name with his son, the popular Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., who has distanced himself from his father\u2019s political views but could still help him at the polls.\n\n\u201cThe Diaz name is golden. People are used to voting for a Diaz in the Bronx \u2014 that counts for something,\u201d Valentin said.\n\nDiaz said his opponents are unduly focused on attacking him.\n\n\u201cWe live in America. Everybody has the right to say and do everything they want. I respect people\u2019s right to speak \u2026 so I hope they also respect my right to free speech. This is America, praise the Lord,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the front runner. I am the victim here. Everybody\u2019s shooting at me. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nThe latest high-profile entrant into the race is Melissa Mark-Viverito, the former speaker of the City Council.\n\nMark-Viverito, who led pushes to close Rikers Island, decriminalize minor offenses, and restrict New York\u2019s cooperation with federal immigration authorities, says she was pushing boundaries as a progressive long before the current insurgent movement in the Democratic party became popular. She has pledged not to accept money from real estate or corporate PACs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen such a change,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came into politics \u2026 people were calling me the communist, and I was too far left, and too progressive.\u201d\n\nBut Mark-Viverito does not live in the Bronx, a potential liability in a district located entirely in the borough. A longtime resident of East Harlem, she declined to commit to moving to the district immediately if elected, but said she would do so at some point.\n\nMark-Viverito, whose Council district included part of the Bronx, said voters would not care about her residency. \u201cIt\u2019s about what kind of representative are you going to be, how available are you going to be to me, how are you going to change my life?\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Mark-Viverito and Assemblyman Michael Blake, another candidate for the seat, were runners up in the recent race for public advocate.\n\nBlake, who worked in the Obama administration on minority- and women-owned businesses, says that being the only candidate with federal experience makes him the best qualified for the job.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be understated, the significance of this race. You\u2019re talking about the most Democratic district in America, the poorest Congressional district in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will send a very clear message to the country and to the world of what direction are we going in in the south Bronx.\u201d\n\nWith so many candidates in the race - at least nine are running so far \u2014 there is some fear that progressives may split the vote, making a victory by Diaz more likely.\n\nState Sen. Gustavo Rivera, who considered running for the seat but ended up opting out, said he hoped the field would narrow and progressives could coalesce behind a candidate.\n\n\u201cHow can we all get together and get behind someone who is going to make us proud, and not someone who\u2019s going to embarrass us?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt would be obscene for this person to occupy this seat,\u201d he said of Diaz, predicting the Councilman known for his trademark cowboy hat would end up a maverick ally of President Trump. \u201cHe with his crazy freaking cowboy hat will show up to the White House with 20 cameras and will talk about this great leader we have. Because of the way his ego works, he will not be able to help himself.\u201d", "description": "Welcome to one of the more unusual 2020 Democratic primaries.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/41/16/97695a4d411aacfc2f50023e8067/19921-jose-serrano-ap-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
