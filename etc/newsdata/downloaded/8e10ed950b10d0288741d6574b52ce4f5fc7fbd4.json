More than two years later it resembles a kangaroo court, the inspector general found, running inferior investigations that VA attorneys cannot trust and \u201cfloundering\u201d in its duty to protect employees who report wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nJust one senior manager has been removed by an office created to discipline senior-level managers involved in misconduct, Inspector General Michael Missal found.\n\nAD\n\nThe office has shown \u201csignificant deficiencies,\u201d including poor leadership, skimpy training of investigators, a misunderstanding of its mission and a failure to discipline senior leaders, according to the 100-page report.\n\n\u201cNotably, in its first two years of operation, the [office] acted in ways that were inconsistent with its statutory authority while it simultaneously floundered in its mission to protect whistleblowers,\u201d the report says. VA \u201ccreated an office culture that was sometimes alienating to the very individuals it was meant to protect.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn response, VA spokeswoman Christina Mandreucci said in a statement that the report \u201clargely focuses on [the office\u2019s] operations under previous leaders who no longer work at VA.\u201d She said its new leadership has independently identified many of the issues the inspector general highlights and is moving to make changes, ensuring greater oversight over investigations and halting retaliation against whistleblowers.\n\nAD\n\nMandreucci also touted VA\u2019s overall success at firing problem employees, citing the law passed by Congress that established the accountability office and gave the agency new tools to improve performance.\n\n\u201cWhen problems arise, VA quickly tackles them head on,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn fact, since June 23, 2017, when the Act became law, VA has fired more than 8,630 people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe office, which Trump established in 2017 with an executive order, was designed to improve the agency\u2019s ability to hold employees accountable and enhance protections for whistleblowers who had long faced retaliation. Congress passed legislation two months later that made the office permanent.\n\n\u201cWe are sending a strong message: Those who fail our veterans will be held, for the first time, accountable,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe will make sure that they\u2019re protected,\u201d he said of employees who report wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nThe office\u2019s \u201cmission and authority were statutorily established to protect whistleblowers from retaliation and hold senior VA employees and supervisors accountable,\u201d Missal, the inspector general, said in a statement. \u201cThis report demonstrates that under prior executive directors it failed on both counts in important ways \u2014 leaving new leaders with significant challenges to overcome.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeter O\u2019Rourke, the office\u2019s first executive director, used his position to retaliate against whistleblowers and failed to provide adequate reports to Congress on the office\u2019s day-to-day operations, investigators found.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, forced out of VA last year after serving as acting secretary, is now executive director of the Florida Republican Party.\n\nHis successor, Kirk Nicholas, told investigators that some VA employees treat the whistleblower title as \u201ca position description for them. They\u2019ve joined Whistleblowers of America. They\u2019re in the papers. They can\u2019t seem to let go of it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe report describes \u201cmultiple instances\u201d in which the office\u2019s political appointees did not recuse themselves from investigations of other appointees, creating obvious conflicts of interest.\n\nAD\n\nIn one case, the office received complaints of a hostile work environment, discrimination, harassment and retaliation in the personnel office at the VA headquarters led by Peter Shelby.\n\nShelby was golf buddies with O\u2019Rourke and Nicholas, who, during the investigation, was asking for Shelby\u2019s help with an unrelated matter that would boost his retirement benefits, the report says.\n\nNicholas wrote to Shelby as the investigation was ongoing: \u201cHey Golf Pro, Any movement on my retirement waiver yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best folks are on it,\u201d Shelby replied. At the time, Nicholas was in line to succeed O\u2019Rourke as executive director of the whistleblower office and Shelby was still under investigation, the report says. Shelby was found to have committed no wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nO\u2019Rourke told investigators that \u201cwe firewall political employees away\u201d from investigations of fellow appointees, giving the cases to career employees. But the inspector found no such firewall and said O\u2019Rourke personally intervened to remove the career investigator assigned to the case to a direct subordinate.\n\n\u201cThe former leaders of [the office] engaged in misdeeds and missteps that appeared unsupportive of whistleblowers,\u201d wrote James Mitchell\u00b6, the watchdog office\u2019s head of special reviews.\n\nThe long-awaited report came as a relief to many whistleblowers, who said they had high hopes for the office when it was created.\n\n\u201cIt solidly confirms what VA whistleblowers have been reporting for the past two years: The [office] targeted and silenced whistleblowers to the detriment of Veterans, creating a culture of fear and substantial personal risk for anyone who dared to speak up against wrongdoing and corruption in the federal government,\u201d said Jay DeNofrio, a program analyst for VA tele-mental health program. He is suing the agency after learning that the office began to investigate him for reporting problems in veterans nursing homes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrandon Coleman, a former VA whistleblower who was recruited to serve as the office\u2019s first whistleblower program specialist and to develop mentoring, education and outreach programs, said in an email that \u201cunder current leadership all of that is gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a noted VA whistleblower who supports President Trump I will say it is a scary time to be a whistleblower within the federal government,\u201d Coleman said in a statement. The office \u201cwas how we were finally supposed to get it right for VA Whistleblowers and instead we are currently failing them.\u201d\n\nThe office has been under scrutiny by Congress for more than a year. The House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs has scheduled a hearing on its operations Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAs of May, VA had removed just one senior manager on its recommendation, the head of the troubled D.C. Medical Center, investigators found \u2014 while VA has fired thousands of low-level employees after Congress passed legislation to clear a faster path to dismissing poorly performing employees.\n\nAD\n\nThe slow action against such managers came partly because the accountability office gave the officials deciding on disciplinary action \u201cinsufficient direction.\u201d In some cases, lawyers from VA\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office intervened, saying evidence the office had gathered was not legally defensible.\n\nThe office has hired many employees with limited or no experience as investigators, the report found. They have tended to look only at evidence that was sufficient to substantiate an allegation rather than a more thorough investigation that the law allows. As a result, witnesses were not interviewed, leading to what appeared to be biased approaches, the report found.\n\nIn one case, an investigator closed a case after interviewing a limited number of witnesses because \u201ca determination was made to not waste more resources,\u201d the report found.\n\n\u201cBy politicizing and mismanaging whistleblower protection, they\u2019ve done a disservice to our nation\u2019s veterans and the dedicated VA employees who show up to serve them every day,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said in a statement.", "description": "VA \u201ccreated an office culture that was sometimes alienating to the very individuals it was meant to protect,\u201d says a report from VA Inspector General Michael Missal", "authors": ["Lisa Rein", "Reporter Covering Federal Agencies", "The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_JvyS0Z71KtwsqFeoOHO5BdI294=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDZFBAGDQMI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
