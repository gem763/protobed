That was the last great fun we all had, and it turned out to be a bust almost beyond measure. The days of goofiness were done, I felt. The news alerts were getting to be a lot. I had, as they say, feelings of powerlessness.\n\nAnd I had no idea, really, how to find a therapist. The last one I saw I had discovered by searching on Yelp: \u201cbest therapist + gay + five stars.\u201d So who am I to judge efforts at smarter matching than that?

He found he felt better when he stopped getting so much new information.\n\n\u201cSomething that helped me was I deleted all the news off my phone,\u201d Mr. Kan said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the stock market app or Twitter anymore. And that did improve my mood.\u201d\n\nThis being San Francisco, there is a longstanding local group for existentialism. The Existential-Humanistic Institute, founded in 1997, is a collective of therapists and philosophers who have been puttering along in mostly quiet private practice for years, working with clients who are struggling not only with relatively ordinary issues but with their very purpose on earth. Interest in their approach appeared to spike along with the rise of Donald J.
