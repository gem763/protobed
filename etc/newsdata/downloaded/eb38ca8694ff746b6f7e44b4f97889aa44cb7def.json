REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nThe Lennon Walls are large mosaics of Post-it notes calling for democracy and denouncing perceived Chinese meddling in the former British colony that have cropped up in underpasses, under footbridges, outside shopping centres and elsewhere.\n\nLegislator Junius Ho, who has taken a tough stand against the protests, has called for cleanups of 77 Lennon Walls from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, by 100 people at each site.\n\n\u201cWe will do this to celebrate the 70th anniversary of our motherland,\u201d he said on his Facebook page, referring to the founding of the Chinese People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1, 1949.\n\nProtesters have vowed not to avoid confrontation but to rebuild the walls afterwards.\n\nThe Lennon Walls are named after the original John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s that was covered with Beatles lyrics and messages of political grievance.\n\nLennon\u2019s 1980 \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d album includes a track called \u201cCleanup Time\u201d.\n\nThe walls have occasionally become flashpoints in recent weeks. Three people were wounded in a knife attack by an unidentified assailant near a Lennon Wall in the Tseung Kwan O district of the New Territories in August.\n\n\u201cWe hope citizens will understand areas around Lennon Wall are relatively high-risk,\u201d police official Fang Chi-kin told reporters. \u201cThere have been fights and scuffles between people from different backgrounds near these areas.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Jockey Club cancelled all races on Wednesday after protesters said they would target the Happy Valley racecourse where a horse part-owned by Ho was due to run.\n\nHo, who once described the protesters as \u201cblack-shirted thugs\u201d, on Thursday pulled the horse, \u201cHong Kong Bet\u201d, from all races until the protests are over. Ho said the horse should not be \u201cdeprived of its right to race\u201d.\n\nAnti-government protesters, many masked and wearing black, have caused havoc in recent weeks, throwing petrol bombs at police, storming the Legislative Council, trashing metro stations, blocking roads to the airport and lighting street fires.\n\nPolice have responded with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets. A total of 1,474 people have been arrested, aged between 12 and 84, police said on Friday. So far 207 have been charged, including 79 for rioting.\n\nOn Friday, rights group Amnesty International accused police of torture and other abuses in their handling of detained protesters. Police said they had respected the \u201cprivacy, dignity and rights\u201d of those in custody.\n\n\u201cIt was not a fair report,\u201d a senior police officer told reporters. \u201cAnyone could have come out with a report like that quoting anonymous sources... I could have written another 400 like that.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including right of assembly and an independent judiciary.\n\nDemonstrators are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing and the protests have broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nChina says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and denies interfering. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.", "description": "A pro-Beijing lawmaker has called for a Clean Hong Kong Day on Saturday, urging supporters to pull down \"Lennon Walls\" of anti-government graffiti across the Chinese-ruled city, a possible flashpoint in more than three months of unrest.", "authors": ["Twinnie Siu", "Felix Tam", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431912444&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0LB", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
