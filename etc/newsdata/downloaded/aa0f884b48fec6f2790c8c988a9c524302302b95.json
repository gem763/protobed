Parrish reportedly passed away Wednesday at his Springfield, Mo., home.\n\nOriginally a ninth-round pick in the 1958 NFL Draft out of Florida by the Cleveland Browns, Parrish developed into a solid starter in the team\u2019s secondary by his second season, when he notched five interceptions.\n\nIn 1960, Parrish earned the first of his two Pro Bowl selections when he picked off six passes for an NFL-high 238 interception return yards and a touchdown. He snagged a career-best seven interceptions the following season in 1961.\n\nParrish played eight seasons with the Browns (1959-1966), picking off 29 passes in Cleveland, which ranks seventh in franchise history. He was a starting defensive back on the Browns\u2019 1964 NFL championship squad that blanked the Baltimore Colts 27-0 in the title game.\n\nParrish fought for players\u2019 rights as a vice president with the NFL Players Association, and campaigned for the firing of then league commissioner Pete Rozelle \u2014 which at the time almost resulted in his being traded away by Browns owner Art Modell.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stick to my guns and fight for a new commissioner,\u201d Parrish said then. \u201cPaul Brown (his former Browns head coach) is the answer to our problem.\u201d\n\nThe Browns finally cut Parrish in 1966, and he later signed a contract with the AFL\u2019s Houston Oilers, where he finished his playing career.\n\nAfter retirement, Parrish tried to forge a partnership in a joint players union combining NFL and AFL players. He later penned a best-selling book \u201cThey Call It A Game,\u201d where he criticized the \u201ccon men who sell the National Football League like cosmetics\u201d for allegedly taking advantage of the league\u2019s players.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Bernie Parrish, a two-time Pro Bowl defensive back who championed players' rights in the 1960s in battling the NFL over fair treatment, has died at age 83.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
