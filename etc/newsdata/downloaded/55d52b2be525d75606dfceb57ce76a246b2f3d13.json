Yu Jing/CNS via REUTERS\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered on Friday evening, with crowds expected to swell into the night, as the Asian financial hub braces for weekend demonstrations aiming to disrupt transport links to the airport after Lam\u2019s withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill failed to appease some activists.\n\n\u201cThe four actions are aimed at putting one step forward in helping Hong Kong to get out of the dilemma,\u201d Lam told reporters during a trip to China\u2019s southern region of Guangxi. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop the violence immediately.\u201d\n\nLam on Wednesday withdrew a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by its ruling Communist Party and announced three other measures to help ease the crisis.\n\nThe Beijing-backed leader said she disagreed with the Fitch downgrade, adding that said some of the activists\u2019 demands, such as dropping charges against protesters who used violence, violated the law.\n\nDemonstrations have gripped Hong Kong for three months, at times paralyzing parts of the city amid running street battles between protesters and police whose violence has drawn international attention.\n\nGermany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the issue of Hong Kong with Chinese premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, saying a peaceful solution is needed.\n\n\u201cI stressed that the rights and freedoms for (Hong Kong) citizens have to be granted,\u201d Merkel said during a visit to China.\n\n\u201cIn the current situation violence must be prevented. Only dialogue helps. There are signs that Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive will invite such a dialogue. I hope that materializes and that demonstrators have the chance to participate within the frame of citizens\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nLi told a news conference with Merkel, \u201cThe Chinese government unswervingly safeguards \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and \u2018Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong people\u2019\u201d.\n\nBeijing supported the territory\u2019s government \u201cto end the violence and chaos in accordance with the law, to return to order, which is to safeguard Hong Kong\u2019s long-term prosperity and stability,\u201d he added.\n\nFRESH PROTESTS\n\nProtesters plan to block traffic to the city\u2019s international airport on Saturday, a week after thousands of demonstrators disrupted transport links, sparking some of the worst violence since the unrest escalated three months ago.\n\nMany protesters have pledged to fight on despite the withdrawal of the extradition bill, saying the concession is too little, too late.\n\nSeveral activist and pro-democracy groups say they will not give up on their other key demands, with rallies planned on Friday evening at sites across the city such as subway stations and near government headquarters.\n\nThe extradition bill triggered mass protests that have since widened into a backlash against the Hong Kong government and its political masters in Beijing.\n\nThe massive, and sometimes violent, protests present Chinese President Xi Jinping with his greatest popular challenge since he came to power in 2012.\n\nAuthorities also say the turmoil has weighed on the economy, which faces its first recession in a decade. There is evidence some funds are being moved to rival financial centers, such as Singapore.\n\nMany protesters in the densely populated city of 7.4 million remain angry over Lam\u2019s refusal to hold an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality against them.\n\nPolice have fired tear gas, rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and water cannons at protesters, who have retaliated with petrol bombs and bricks.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 three other demands are: retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe rallies, release of all demonstrators arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to vote for their own leaders.\n\nMany residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to Hong Kong when it was handed back to China in 1997.\n\nChina denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, warning of the damage to the economy and the possible use of force to quell the unrest.\n\nLegislation over China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by U.S. Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, their leader said on Thursday.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Friday said measures announced this week to help restore order in the Chinese-ruled city were a first step, and disagreed with a credit downgrade by rating agency Fitch after months of sometimes violent protests.", "authors": ["Noah Sin", "Donny Kwok", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426838822&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850PB-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
