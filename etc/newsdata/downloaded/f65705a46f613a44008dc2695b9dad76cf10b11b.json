As they\u2019ve plowed the ground, here is one from me with a decidedly different intent, i.e., to expose a politically-motivated former CIA officer and now a whistleblower with ties to Democrats.\n\nA source known to me at the State Department, who will remain anonymous, tells me that everyone is pointing to Edward \u201cNed\u201d Price as the whistleblower who came forward with the accusation that President Trump \u201cabused his office\u201d during a phone conversation with the Ukrainian president. Here is how the swamp rag Washington Post characterizes the whistleblower\u2019s complaint:\n\nThe whistleblower complaint at the heart of the burgeoning controversy over President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president claims not only that Trump misused his office for personal gain and endangered national security but that unidentified White House officials tried to hide that conduct.\n\nIn forceful language, the unidentified whistleblower alleged that the commander in chief pushed his foreign counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and that senior White House officials then tried to \u201clock down\u201d records related to the matter.\n\nThe pressure, the whistleblower alleged, came in a phone call July 25 between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, an exchange that turned so politically problematic that White House lawyers directed other officials to remove the electronic transcript of the conversation from the computer system where it was stored.\n\nRead the rest here.\n\nNote that the complaint specifically refers to the phone call, which transcript the White House released just yesterday. Any objective reading of that transcript makes it clear that there was no pressure to do ANYTHING exerted on the Ukrainian president by President Trump whatsoever. What President Trump actually did was to solicit Ukraine\u2019s help for an ongoing investigation \u2013 a completely lawful interchange! Read it for yourself here if you have only been following legacy media reports about that transcript.\n\nWho is Price? According to Wikipedia:\n\nEdward \u201cNed\u201d Price (born 1982) is a Fellow at the New America Foundation and a political analyst for NBC News. Price is also a former American intelligence officer who worked at the United States Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 until February 2017. On February 20, 2017, Price published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, outlining his decision to retire from the CIA rather than work in a Donald Trump administration.\n\nNote that New America Foundation is one of the two top organizations liberally funded by George Soros, the other being the better-known Open Society Foundation. NAF\u2019s chairman of the board of directors is Eric Schmidt who has long and deep-standing ties to Democrats \u2013 particular Obama and the Clintons.\n\nhttps://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individuals/george-soros/\n\nHe certainly fits the profile of what has been rumored about the whistleblower: former intelligence officer, supportive of a Trump political rival, etc. But that\u2019s not the half of it, though. Anonymous sources also report that Price was not only a CIA deep state agent but was also one of the spies that John Brennan used in the 2016 election to spy on the Trump campaign. This guy quit the CIA in an huff and is virulently anti-Trump, too. Gee, is it any surprise that this guy would magically come forward now with a complaint based on hearsay evidence?\n\nHere is an interesting tidbit from Price\u2019s twitter timeline.\n\nIn that WaPo article linked above, there is this fascinating paragraph that dovetails coincidentally with Price\u2019s tweet above:\n\nThe transcript, the whistleblower alleged, was then loaded onto a separate system meant for classified information. And according to White House officials who informed the whistleblower, that was \u201cnot the first time\u201d a transcript was put there due to concerns about politics rather than national security, the complaint alleged.\n\nRemember, there are NO coincidences in politics, particular concerning the Deep State cabal who have been after President Trumps scalp from the beginning! There\u2019s a high probability that the transcript was put on the classified system to preclude it being leaked, too!\n\nHere\u2019s my question for Price, disgraceful Democrats like Adam Schiff, and their allies in the legacy media: if the President\u2019s conduct was so egregious, then why on Earth didn\u2019t State Department officials who were privy to the conversation first-hand register a complaint? Price only learned about the incident second- or third-hand!\n\nI believe we\u2019re going to find out a lot more about the whistleblower, including his complaint and how it was compiled from multiple sources (reportedly including media reports!), his political motivations, his likely connections to Adam Schiff and other Democrats, and much more. Stay tuned!\n\nThe end (for now).", "description": "Is This Guy the Ukraine Phone Call Whistleblower?", "authors": ["Stu Cvrk", "Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Alex Parker", "Sarah Lee", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/it-e1567981760840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
