(AP) \u2014 Daniel Hemric gave his hopes of landing a Cup Series ride for next season some help by taking his No. 8 Chevrolet to the pole for Richard Childress Racing at Kansas Speedway on Sunday.\n\nHemric, who was told last month that Childress would not pick up his option for 2020, turned a lap of 178.047 mph to edge the retiring David Ragan during qualifying on Saturday.\n\nThey were joined in the top five by a trio of drivers in NASCAR's version of the playoffs.\n\nRyan Blaney was third after his rain-delayed win last weekend at Talladega. Brad Keselwoski will start alongside him after qualifying fourth and Kyle Larson will start fifth.\n\nLike Blaney, Larson has nothing to sweat before the playoff field is cut to eight on Sunday. He locked up his spot in the next round by winning at Dover.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
