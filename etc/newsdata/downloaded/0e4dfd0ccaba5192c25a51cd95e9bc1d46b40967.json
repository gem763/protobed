Joe Biden is vying for the Democratic nomination for president and is a political rival. Concerns about Mr. Trump's call with Zelensky and other interactions with Ukrainian officials were detailed in a whistleblower complaint released to the public this week.\n\nAmodei, Nevada's sole Republican in Congress, later clarified that he was not calling on Mr. Trump to be impeached, but was just supporting the inquiry.\n\n\"In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,\" Amodei said in a statement, adding that he did not know if Mr. Trump's conversation with Zelensky was a \"smoking gun.\"\n\nOver 90% of House Democrats now support an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. The 219 Democrats are also joined by independent Congressman Justin Amash.", "description": "GOP Congressman Mark Amodei said Friday that he supports an inquiry into President Trump's call to the Ukrainian president", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/28/74fa53f4-9fd4-424a-aea0-72f1782f7b59/thumbnail/1200x630g2/48207c3f6d617b904e774b48ce499ebd/gettyimages-969195934-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
