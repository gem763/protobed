Despite Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general already explicitly stating there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden\u2014and confirmation from numerous Western officials that there was unanimous demand for the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor in question\u2014Trump is said to have asked Zelenskyy at least eight times in one July phone call to investigate Biden. The apparent pressure campaign is also said to be at least part of the reason for a whistleblower complaint over Trump that has sparked a standoff between Congress and the U.S. intelligence community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Hunter did over there, but I don\u2019t think he did anything illegal,\u201d said Andrew Lietzow, a 67-year-old Des Moines resident who served as a precinct captain for former President Barack Obama. \u201cPeople who want Biden are at this point really committed.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Biden turned the tables on Trump\u2019s Ukraine conspiracy theories and accused him of engaging in \u201can overwhelming abuse of power.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest attack on his political rival started just before 17 presidential hopefuls and hundreds of supporters convened for the Polk County Steak Fry, one of the biggest cattle calls for Iowa Democrats of the year. Biden, who had a notable presence at the event, bought 1,800 tickets, the most out of any 2020 contender.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s something the president should have never done. Period. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to back it up. \u201d \u2014 Bill Alexander\n\nIn interviews with over a dozen Democrats at the event, including many who count Biden as their first choice, most agreed that they have become newly energized in their support after he endured another personal attack from the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Trump. What do you expect?,\u201d Jim Benzoni, a 64-year-old Biden supporter and frequent caucus-goer said when asked what to make of the president\u2019s allegations about Biden and his son. \u201cWhat else is new?\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters under an overcast sky, Biden continued to redirect the attention back to the current occupant of the White House.\n\n\u201cTrump deserves to be investigated,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe is violating every basic norm of a president. Trump\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nBiden has enjoyed frontrunner status for much of the early Democratic primary. But a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll released on Saturday night showed his support may be more malleable than previously indicated. In the survey, he slipped to second place following Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Warren, who started off an impassioned speech on Saturday by saying she\u2019s here \u201cto stand up for the Constitution\u201d and that \u201cCongress failed to act\u201d in impeaching Trump, earned 22 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers, while Biden earned 20 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third at 11 percent.\n\nStill, among Biden\u2019s most ardent supporters, many view Trump\u2019s attacks on his role in Ukraine as both illegitimate and politically advantageous for the former vice president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something the president should have never done. Period,\u201d Bill Alexander, a 73-year-old resident from Ottumwa, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to back it up.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Biden supporters who agree Trump crossed a line. Supporters of a variety of rival Democratic candidates, including Warren, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and others rushed to Biden\u2019s defense when asked about the president\u2019s latest attack.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s horrifying that he would bring in Biden\u2019s son to try and divert people\u2019s attention,\u201d said Rose Oster, a 71-year-old Des Moines resident who\u2019s leaning towards Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, but also likes Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).\n\nOther Democratic attendees sounded concerns more broadly about the need for Trump\u2019s impeachment, citing his latest moves as just the most recent example.\n\n\u201cNow that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone \u2018bust\u2019 on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of rhetoric that Carmen Winters, a 70-year-old Des Moines resident and longtime Biden supporter, says leads people to turn against Trump.\n\n\u201cWe know that he\u2019s made up his life on lies,\u201d Winters said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who makes the fake news. I don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think it\u2019s horrifying that he would bring in Biden\u2019s son to try and divert people\u2019s attention,\u201d one Des Moines resident says.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3240,w_5760,x_0,y_540/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569119410/GettyImages-1170064547_otnivp", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
