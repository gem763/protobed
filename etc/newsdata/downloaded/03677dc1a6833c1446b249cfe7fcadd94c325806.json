Still, I\u2019m not quite a \u201cscientist,\u201d per se. But when I saw this little study in the journal Circulation on how dogs help people live longer...I thought, yeah OK guy, I, a non-scientist, could\u2019ve told you that!!\n\nThink about how you feel when in proximity to a nice dog. You probably feel pretty good! Hard to pick just one reason why dogs bring so much joy: there\u2019s that tickly, cold feeling when they push their noses against you; the way they look at you like, hey, I love you; that fuzzy, soft spot between their eyes\u2026so much good within a dog. To me, it\u2019s easy to see how a dog might make you happier and want to be alive longer...just to spend more time with the dog.\n\nBut scientists can\u2019t help but do their thing, I suppose, and so they took a look at nearly 70 years of published research to see if there\u2019s a link between dog ownership and mortality. What they found is unsurprising: According to data from six studies published between 1950 and 2019, dog ownership was associated with a 24 percent risk reduction for death. That decreased mortality risk was even more pronounced among people with previous cardiovascular problems.\n\nAll of this is a fancy, science-way of saying that dogs appear to help people live longer, especially people with heart issues. A separate study, also published Tuesday in Circulation, builds upon this great news even more. Researchers found that people had better health outcomes after having a stroke or cardiovascular event if they had a dog.\n\nScientists will tell you that owning a dog is good because it encourages owners to take walks and play, and because companionship is generally good for you. I buy that. But also, if you put a really good dog in front of me, I\u2019d stick around as long as possible to keep playing with it. That may not be science, but it *is* common sense!\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Hannah Smothers on Twitter.", "description": "In six studies published between 1950 and 2019, dog ownership was associated with a 24 percent risk reduction for death.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9cb57e0c335200091dedd8/lede/1570551571234-GettyImages-989757650.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8442xh;0xw,0.1277xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
