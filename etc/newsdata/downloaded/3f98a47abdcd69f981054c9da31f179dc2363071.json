At one point, the door to the house flew open.\n\n\"Makai was asking, 'Is that a monster? Is that a monster?' because that's what he thought the storm was,\" Capron recalled. \"I just had to lie down and hold Makai in my arms.\"\n\nCapron's grandparent's house withstood the storm, but it was flooded and they lost nearly everything, including most of their clothes and Makai's toys.\n\n\"He handled it very bravely, thankfully,\" Capron added. \"He was like, 'It's OK, Mommy.'\"\n\nWhen Capron told Makai that some people, including children, were trapped after the hurricane, Makai put on a Spiderman costume that survived the storm and offered to help.\n\n\"He said, 'Mommy I have to go save the children,'\" recalled Capron, who also spoke with ABC station WPLG.\n\nCapron and Makai were able to board a cruise ship back to the U.S. on Friday evening, after waiting in line for 13 hours, she said.\n\nThey were greeted in Palm Beach by strangers with water and food and clothing and even Lyft drivers offering free rides.\n\n\"The love we got when we got back to the U.S. was unbelievable,\" Capron said. \"I just want people to know that the Bahamas is a nation with loving people and a rich culture. We will gladly accept any help that anybody can give, and are extremely grateful for everyone who has been so loving.\"\n\nCapron said the joyful welcome Makai got on his first day back at school Monday was \"something he needed, and I needed it too.\"\n\nShe shared the video on her Instagram account, where it already has more than 11,000 views. Capron said her grandmother, still in the Bahamas, called her crying after watching the video of her great-grandson.\n\n\"Right now, we're seeing so much trauma, so to see the love that kids are showing, I thought that was beautiful,\" she said. \"The rest of the world needed to see that too, especially the Bahamas.\"\n\nABC News' Fergal Gallagher contributed to this report.", "description": "Makai Simmons, 3, rode out Dorian in Freeport, Bahamas, with his mom and family.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/children-hug-ht-jc-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
