The death toll rose to 30.\n\nA few hundred people gathered at the partly flooded Leonard M. Thompson airport on Abaco island in hopes of getting a seat on one of the small planes picking up the most vulnerable survivors, including the sick and the elderly. However, the evacuation was slow and there was frustration for some who said they had nowhere to go after the Category 5 hurricane tore through the area, shattering whole neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThey told us that the babies, the pregnant people and the elderly people were supposed to be first preference,\u201d said Lukya Thompson, a 23-year-old bartender. But many were still waiting, she said.\n\nDespite hardship and uncertainty, those at the airport were mostly calm. The Bahamian health ministry said helicopters and boats were on the way to help people in affected areas, though warned of delays because of severe flooding and limited access.\n\nAt least 30 people died in the hurricane and the number could be \u201csignificantly higher,\u201d Bahamian health minister Duane Sands told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday night. The victims are from Abaco and Grand Bahama islands and include some who had been injured and flown to New Providence island, he said.\n\nThe hurricane hit Abaco on Sunday and then hovered over Grand Bahama for a day and a half.\n\nOn Thursday, emergency officials fanned out across stricken areas to track down people who were missing or in distress. Crews began clearing streets and setting up aid distribution centers.\n\nThe United Nations announced the purchase of eight tons of ready-to-eat meals and said it will provide satellite communications equipment and airlift storage units, generators and prefab offices to set up logistics hubs. U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said about 70,000 people \u201care in immediate need of life-saving assistance\u201d on Grand Bahama and Abaco.\n\nA British Royal Navy ship docked at Abaco and distributed supplies to hurricane survivors. On Grand Bahama, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship dropped off 10,000 meals, 10,000 bottles of water and more than 180 generators, as well as diapers and flashlights.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it flew a Boeing 737 from Miami to Nassau to drop off 14,000 pounds of relief supplies. The airline is also giving frequent-flyer points to customers who donate at least $25 to the Red Cross.\n\nTroops from the Rhode Island National Guard will be heading to the Bahamas to help. The Guard will mobilize three C-130J cargo aircraft that will depart from the Quonset Air National Guard Base on Friday, state officials said.\n\nSome dazed survivors of Hurricane Dorian made their way back to a shantytown where they used to live, hoping to gather up some of their soggy belongings.\n\nThe community was known as The Mudd \u2014 or \u201cDa Mudd,\u201d as it\u2019s often pronounced \u2014 and it was built by thousands of Haitian migrants over decades. It was razed in a matter of hours by Dorian, which reduced it to piles of splintered plywood and two-by-fours 4 and 5 feet deep, spread over an area equal to several football fields.\n\nA helicopter buzzed overhead as people picked through the debris, avoiding a body that lay tangled underneath a tree branch next to twisted sheets of corrugated metal, its hands stretched toward the sky. It was one of at least nine bodies that people said they had seen in the area.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t nobody come to get them,\u201d said Cardot Ked, a 43-year-old carpenter from Haiti who has lived 25 years in Abaco. \u201cIf we could get to the next island, that\u2019s the best thing we can do.\u201d\n\nKed was one of thousands of desperate people seeking help in Dorian\u2019s aftermath. With winds of 185 mph (295 kph), the hurricane obliterated houses on the Bahamas\u2019 Abaco and Grand Bahama islands.\n\nCrews in Grand Bahama worked to reopen the airport and used heavy equipment to pick up branches and palm fronds. Lines formed outside gas stations and grocery stores.\n\n\u201cPeople will be out of jobs for months,\u201d 67-year-old woodcarver Gordon Higgs lamented. \u201cThey\u2019ll be homeless, no food. Nothing.\u201d\n\nTotal property losses, not including infrastructure and autos, could reach $7 billion, the firm Karen Clark & Co. estimated.\n\nOn Thursday, medical officials moved hundreds of people left homeless by the storm out of the main hospital in Abaco to shelters in schools and other government buildings. Some were angry at being asked to leave, or at not being allowed to freely enter to visit hurt relatives, and a shouting match erupted at the main door between a small group of hurricane victims and Bahamas marines.\n\nAbaco and Grand Bahama islands are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts and are home to many fishermen, laborers and hotel workers.\n\nAt the Leonard M. Thompson airport, Rashad Reckley, a 30-year-old saxophonist, played the Bob Marley song \u201cThree Little Birds\u201d for people who had lost their homes.\n\n\u201cI want to lift up everybody\u2019s spirits after all the tragedy that happened,\u201d said Reckley, who said he had exhausted his repertoire after playing for hours.\n\n\u201cThey want me to play more,\u201d Reckley said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t think of songs to play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Marko Alvarez in Freeport, Bahamas; and Kelli Kennedy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more of AP\u2019s coverage of Hurricane Dorian, go to: https://apnews.com/Hurricanes", "description": "The hurricane hit Abaco on Sunday and then hovered over Grand Bahama for a day and a half.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d71d2273b0000e255d01098.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
