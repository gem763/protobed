Reports had moreover circulated in August pointing to the company\u2019s closure of a deal to increase its electricity supply by 357%.\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s report at the time indicated the firm may have already then been poised to become the world\u2019s largest publicly-listed miner.\n\nOver the past six months, the company\u2019s stock price increased by 137% from \u00a33.25 ($4.06) to \u00a37.70 ($11.85) per share, according to Google Finance.\n\nBitmain launched its upgraded Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) T17+ mining machines at the World Digital Mining Summit this October, promising increased power efficiency and hash rate.\n\nBitmain has itself meanwhile renewed its bid for a public listing, with fresh reports alleging it has recently filed for an Initial Public Offering with the United States Securities and Commission.", "description": "U.K.-based Bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain has doubled its order of new cryptocurrency miners as it eyes \u201csignificant expansion\u201d of its capacities", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9iNGE5NzI3NWJiZWU5MThjNjdmM2UyYTg4NzdkZWMyYi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
