They are also interested in keeping Republicans in office in the legislative branch. Reed's group invested $18 million in get-out-and-vote efforts during the 2018 midterm cycle.\n\nReed has already written seven books, including three political novels.", "description": "A prominent evangelical leader and Trump-ally is arguing that Christians have a 'moral obligation' to support the president in 2020.
