Jasmin Aileen Valero from California asked her partner, Joseph Luevanoz, to watch their infant daughter while she took a nap\n\nIn tears: But when she woke up, the man surprised her by shaving the baby's head. The video shows the baby, Jazlyn, all smiles while Jasmin cries over her hair\n\n'The one time I ask him to watch her so I can sleep in and...' Jasmin wrote when sharing the video on Twitter.\n\nBefore: Jasmin said she had no idea her partner was going to shave their daughter's head . Pictured is the baby before the haircut\n\nHer video, which was filmed by Jazlyn's father, Joshua Luevanoz, quickly went viral and garnered more than 3.9 million views because of Jasmin's stunned reaction to the shaved head.\n\nIn the video, Jasmin is seen bouncing Jazlyn on her lap while the baby's head is covered by a towel.\n\nThe mom appears to have no clue the baby's head is shaved until the father pulls the towel off her head to reveal the new haircut.\n\nJasmin's mouth instantly dropped open by the reveal, and she let out a scream in shock to signal to her partner she was unhappy by the surprise cut.\n\nIn the background, Joshua is heard laughing during the reveal.\n\n'That's not funny,' Jasmin said through tears. 'Why is she bald? Joshua, that's not funny.'\n\nDeciding the shave the youngster's head was not completely random, though, as it is custom in Mexican families to shave the head at a young age 'so their hair can grow thicker and nicer,' Jasmin told Storyful.\n\nThe couple had previously discussed doing it with their daughter but had not decided on a specific time.\n\nNot happy: Jasmin shared the video on Twitter, and not everyone was happy about the prank pulled by Joshua\n\nDon't fall for it: One woman said men sometimes do pranks like that so they never have to watch the child on their own\n\nHappy baby: But other commenters noted how happy the daughter looked in the video despite the newly shaved head\n\nGorgeous: Jasmin has since shared images of her daughter modeling the shaved head, showing she moved on from the prank\n\n'My daughter\u2019s father and I had agreed we were not going to do that until that day where I had asked him if he can watch her so I can sleep in a bit longer and he woke me up with that surprise,' she added.\n\n'I was heartbroken because my baby went from a full head of hair to none at all, but as you can see she was not bothered one bit. Always such a happy baby.'\n\nThe baby did appear to be all smiles even though her mom was crying over the shaved head.\n\nCommenters online had a lot of opinions about the surprise, with some unimpressed with the father's decision to pull the prank.\n\n'This wasn\u2019t funny, this is child abuse,' one commenter wrote.\n\n'This is the type of thing men do so they are never again given the responsibility of taking care of their own child. Don't fall for it,' another person commented.\n\nJasmin has since shared images of her daughter modeling the shaved head, showing she moved on from the prank.", "description": "Jasmin Aileen Valero from California asked her partner, Joseph\u00a0Luevanoz, to watch their daughter while she took a nap.
