(John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u2019S \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which triggered the automatic separation of thousands of toddlers, tweens and teenagers from their families last year, was an act of systematic child abuse orchestrated by a White House bent on prosecuting a war on undocumented migrants. The misery caused by that callous policy was glimpsed at the time \u2014 through photographs of sobbing children and accounts from devastated parents \u2014 by Americans whose revulsion prompted Mr. Trump to reverse course. Only now has the children\u2019s suffering been methodically documented by a government agency.\n\nA report on the emotional and psychological toll of those family separations, by the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services, makes for harrowing reading. It is a poignant reminder of the human damage intentionally caused by a callous government. Program directors and clinicians at 45 shelters overseen by the department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) were interviewed for the report, and their accounts pull no punches.\n\n\u201cEvery single separated kid has been terrified,\u201d said one official who dealt extensively with the children. Others described children who wept inconsolably, believing their parents had abandoned them. In one instance, a boy thought his father, detained at the border by the authorities, was dead. In other cases, kids were seized with psychosomatic effects of the trauma they had undergone: \u201cYou get a lot of \u2018my chest hurts\u2019 even though everything is fine [medically],\u201d said one official. \u201cChildren describe symptoms \u2014 \u2018every heartbeat hurts,\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t feel my heart\u2019 \u2014 of emotional pain.\u201d\n\nSuch was the collateral damage on the hearts of children inflicted by a heartless administration.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report details shortcomings on the part of the ORR shelters, which, scrambling to accommodate thousands of unaccompanied minors suddenly thrust upon them, hired staffers without first completing background checks and case managers ill-prepared to care for mental health. Clinicians assigned to counsel children were overwhelmed, facing caseloads double those set by agency rules. Low pay, demanding schedules and a scarcity of qualified candidates available to facilities \u2014 some in remote locations \u2014 impeded the shelters\u2019 capacity to handle what amounted to a humanitarian crisis.\n\nBut blaming the bureaucrats is senseless when the policy itself was at fault. It was then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions who announced \u201czero tolerance\u201d at the direction of the White House \u2014 a strategy of deliberate cruelty explicitly designed to deter Central American asylum seekers from crossing the border. Brutality was not an accidental feature of the administration\u2019s approach; it was the whole point.\n\nMedical groups have warned that children separated from their families are likely to suffer long-term, possibly lifelong, deleterious effects. Long after the Trump administration leaves office, its malice will linger in the lives of those it damaged.", "description": "The collateral damage suffered by these children was inflicted by thanks to a heartless administration.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/87Wcm7Tlz5cxY585s5ZM15MWbk0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5K6CXSWWOMI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
