That represents a net new job category, Chao noted.\n\nThe secretary also later emphasized that the DoT over which she presides and the current administration aim to be \u201ctech neutral, and not command and control\u201d and that the department is not \u201cin the business of picking winners and losers,\u201d something she said the assembled audience of mostly private-sector attendants would be \u201cso pleased to hear.\u201d\n\nUnder Chao, the DoT has introduced and continues to overhaul guidelines, rules and programs that favor and unblock industry and commercial access to autonomous driving, drone operation and spacecraft launch capabilities. Recently, Chao has come under fire for potential conflict of interest related to use of her position.", "description": "In a talk at the Uber Elevate Summit in Washington, D.C., today, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao shared a total overall figure for ongoing testing of autonomous vehicles on U.S roads: More than 1,400 self-driving cars, trucks and other vehicles are currently in testing by more than 80 companies across 36 U.S. states, [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ford-av.jpg?w=653", "published_at": "2019-06-11"}
