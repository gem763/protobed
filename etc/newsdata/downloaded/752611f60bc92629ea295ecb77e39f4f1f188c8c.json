Prices and the shorter 20-day and 50-day moving average lines have been hugging the price action in August.\n\nTrading volume has diminished and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been flat, signaling a balance between bulls and bears.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line in bearish territory but it has narrowed towards a possible cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this second daily chart of ZM, below, we used Japanese candlesticks to attempt to find more clues. The real body or the area between the open and the close is supposed to be the \"essence of the day\" but the shadows are also important and for ZM it shows more upper shadows in August than lower shadows.\n\nAn upper shadow tells you that traders rejected the highs of the day or that there was resistance on the advance. Water and prices tend to take the path of least resistance and for ZM that path could be lower.\n\nIn the bottom of the price chart is the 12-day price momentum study. Prices made nearly equal highs in June and late July but the momentum numbers were much weaker.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ZM, below, we can see a possible upside price target of $102-$103 but a trade at $88.19 would weaken the chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: We do not have a lot of price history to lean on but there are enough subtle clues to suggest only holding a token position in ZM ahead of earning's.", "description": "Let's check the charts and indicators ahead of ZM's Q2 earnings....ZM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Charts Of Zoom Video Are Looking Shaky Ahead Of Earnings", "Let'S Check The Charts", "Indicators Ahead Of Zm'S Earnings.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Kevin Curran", "Timothy Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/4d94ad8c-6217-11e9-a65a-1d88a2f59410.jpg"}
