Opponents fear he has found a loophole, though others think he is bluffing.\n\nWith politicians deadlocked, the issue of whether Britain delays Brexit could now be one for judges to decide.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BENN ACT\n\nOn Sept. 4, parliament voted through legislation to prevent Johnson taking Britain out of the EU without a deal. The law was backed by an alliance of rebels in Johnson's Conservative Party and opposition lawmakers.\n\nCalled the Benn Act after the lawmaker who proposed it, the law says Johnson must write to the EU to request a three-month Brexit extension until Jan. 31, 2020 if he has not managed to agree a divorce deal by Oct. 19 and parliament has not given its approval to leave without agreement.\n\nIf the EU offers a delay or a different length of extension, the law says he must accept. It even includes a text of the letter Johnson must send.\n\nDespite the legislation, which Johnson has dubbed \"the surrender act\", he has repeatedly said Britain would still leave the bloc on Oct. 31 as planned, and he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than ask for any delay. Such comments have provoked a number of pre-emptive court challenges from opponents who argue that Johnson must be prevented from breaking the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAN JOHNSON GET ROUND LAW?\n\nFormer attorney general Dominic Grieve, who has been kicked out of the Conservative Party over his backing for the Benn Act, says he is confident that the law is legally watertight and that Johnson cannot avoid asking for an extension.\n\nHowever, government ministers have said the law has a number of deficiencies and only imposes \"narrow duties\", suggesting Johnson could somehow get round it without having to break it. Such legal escape routes have not been spelled out.\n\nOne idea mooted has been that the government could declare a national emergency, allowing it to circumvent the law.\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Major also suggested that government ministers could use something called an \"order in council\" which would allow them to suspend the Benn Act using royal powers without requiring the assent of parliament or Queen Elizabeth. However, the government has said it does not recognise such a plan.\n\nOn Tuesday, an unidentified official in Johnson's office, which some lawmakers say could be his senior adviser Dominic Cummings, told the Spectator magazine that the government could \"do all sorts of things to scupper delay\".\n\nThe official said Britain would withhold cooperation with EU countries which supported a delay, including on security and defence issues, and that the government would make clear any extension would be pointless as it would refuse to engage in any further talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCOTTISH CASE\n\nIn order to ensure that Johnson does abide by the Benn Act, a legal challenge was launched in Scotland by anti-Brexit campaigners, fronted by tax lawyer Jo Maugham and Scottish National Party lawmaker Joanna Cherry who have led previous successful Brexit-related court cases.\n\nThey asked Edinburgh's Outer House of the Court of Session to issue an order compelling Johnson to comply with the law or risk penalties including a fine or imprisonment.\n\nDuring the hearings, Johnson's government promised to abide by the law. Judge Paul Cullen, known as Lord Pentland, ruled that these promises meant the court did not have to take action to compel Johnson to do so - at least not yet. But he also said it would be a serious matter if Johnson were to renege on those promises.\n\n\"I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,\" he said.", "description": "Scotland's highest court on Wednesday said it would wait before deciding whether to take action to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for a Brexit delay if he has failed to secure a divorce deal with the European Union by Oct. 19.
