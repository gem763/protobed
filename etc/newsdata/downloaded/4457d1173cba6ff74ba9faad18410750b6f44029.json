(Kabul, March 22, 2015) Paula Bronstein\n\nSecurity forces recorded 273 violent incidents, 91 of which were directed at voting centres. Government officials stated that 29 soldiers and police officers had died and 79 insurgents were killed.\n\nThe Taliban claimed to have carried out 530 attacks across the country, most of which, they said, were successful without providing further details.\n\nBut the \u201cspectacular\u201d operation that the Taliban were promising, with Kabul the prime target, did not happen. The capital has been repeatedly hit by suicide bombers in recent months but did not experience a major attack on the day.\n\nHamdullah Mohib, the national security adviser to the Afghan government, said: \u201cThey were certainly planning something very big. It would have been a huge propaganda victory for them with all the international interest in Afghanistan because of the election.\n\n\u201cBut with a combination of very good intelligence, hard work and a bit of luck we managed to stop it in time.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We believe the plan was to seize a government building, or perhaps somewhere where foreigners were located, and then carry out other attacks in the city. You can imagine what we would have been facing if that happened.\u201d\n\nMr Mohib continued: \u201cWe have been tracking them for a while and had to be patient. We didn\u2019t want to move in too soon and waited until they were in place, and then we carried out our move.\u201d\n\nAn official from a western country with troops deployed in Afghanistan said: \u201cWe thought it was a pretty impressive security operation on the days around the election, especially after a pretty bad suicide attack a week before.\n\n\u201cCoordinated multiple attacks with a possible siege-type situation, if that\u2019s what they were planning, are very tricky to deal with, as we have seen in Mumbai and Paris. There are allied forces on standby, but it must be stressed that the Afghans lead missions themselves.\u201d\n\nFear of violence, however, led to many people avoiding the polling stations and a low voter turnout. Initial estimates released by the Independent Election Commission showed that less than 25 per cent of the 9.6 million people who had registered to vote had actually done so.\n\nFinal figures confirming the estimate will mean the lowest turnout in Afghan elections since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. All three previous polls drew more voters, with around 60 per cent of the 12 million registered voters turning out at the last election in 2014.\n\nMore than a dozen candidates are taking part in the election, with the incumbent president, Ashraf Ghani, and his co-leader in the outgoing administration, Abdullah Abdullah, the main contenders.\n\nPreliminary results are due by 19 October and the final result by 7 November. A second round would be held between the top two candidates if there is no overall winner.\n\nPrevious Afghan elections since the fall of the Taliban have been mired in allegations of fraud, and there have been accusations that the result will be \u201cfixed\u201d this time as well.\n\nThe election commission claims that the use of biometric verification will prevent ballot-rigging. Every polling station has been supplied with equipment which will match fingerprint and photographs to identity cards.\n\nSome of the opposition candidates also maintain that a low turnout is a blow to the legitimacy of the election and will put into question the credibility of the winner.\n\nBut this view is not necessarily reflected among the public. Laibma Zahed, a teacher and an election supervisor at one of the polling stations, Zarghuna High School, wanted to point out: \u201cPeople are coming to vote despite all the threats, young and old, women and men, and their voices must be heard. It\u2019s up to everyone to decide for themselves if they vote or not.\u201d\n\nSyed Ibrahimi, a 48-year-old businessman, agreed: \u201cI didn\u2019t vote personally: maybe I should have done, but I didn\u2019t. I have a wife and four children and I could not take the risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that was my choice, others voted so I can\u2019t complain,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want trouble over the election results to add to all the other troubles we have, as long as the results are fairly honest.\u201d\n\nRead the first part of the Conflict Without End series here: Afghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption; the second part here: Afghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: \u2018My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up\u2019; the third part here: Raid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence\u200b; the fourth part here On the Afghan campaign trail in the shadow of the destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan, talk of Taliban return divides\u200b and the fifth part here: As Afghanistan heads to polls, Middle East rivalries threaten already fraught political scene\u200b", "description": "A plot by the Taliban to carry out a \u201cMumbai-style\u201d\u00a0attack, using teams of gunmen to hit multiple targets in Kabul, was thwarted just before Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election, according to senior government officials.
