But for him to say the thing that he said about Joe Biden was so far beyond the pale \u2026 That has nothing to do with impeachment. That is about elections.\u201d\n\nShe then (mis)quoted the popular TV show Dragnet, in which a strait-laced detective remorselessly tracked down malefactors and wrongdoers in 1950s Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts \u2013 \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 and the constitution. His policy, his personality, his potty-mouth, that\u2019s about the election and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the \u2026 inquiry is because he has not honoured his oath of office. We will honour ours.\u201d\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Trump, which is likely as Democrats control it, the president will be tried in the Senate. The Republicans hold that chamber, making conviction and removal from office unlikely.\n\nPelosi added: \u201cAnd, the Senate is saying, \u2018Now that you are doing that, we are not doing it.\u2019 You know, just because we have the courage to honour our oath of office doesn\u2019t mean we have to fold to the cowardice of the Senate that is not going to honour theirs \u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the county. But our constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it.\u201d", "description": "Speaker says \u2018Potus has become a potty-mouth and children are listening\u2019 after president made crude comment about Biden at rally", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95eb1e69495ec9ebf8b85525a66977ddacbdda5e/0_73_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da7e93a9f19d4088e56c81eba3ab5492", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
