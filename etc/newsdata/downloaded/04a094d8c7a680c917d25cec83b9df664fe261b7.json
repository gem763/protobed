It was pretty great.\u2019\n\nReunited, and it feels so good (Picture: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)\n\nPaul said that Cranston was flown in to set on a private jet \u2018so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the public at the airport\u2019, and the pair resisted the urge to go out in public together.\n\n\u2018But for me that was the easiest part to keep it a secret. I mean, I love throwing surprises. I love surprising my wife. I love lying to people in an innocent way. And this was just that on a big scale.\u2019\n\nThe actor also confirmed that most of the customers seen in the diner were either crew members or members of their families \u2013 \u2018people who we could trust to not leak this information\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We wanted to be surrounded by loved ones, to be a part of this really cool day. The day Bryan came on set with that bald cap and those loafers and that classic Mr. White outfit.\n\n\u2018I mean, the faces that showed up, the people who flew in just to see this moment, they thought, \u201cWell, look, if I\u2019m going to visit one time, it\u2019s gotta be during this time.\u201d\n\n\u2018It was pretty cool to be a part of that.\u2019\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is available on Netflix now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
