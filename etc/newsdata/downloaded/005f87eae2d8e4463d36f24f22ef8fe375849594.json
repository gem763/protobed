I will do so of course having taken advice in appropriate quarters,\"\n\n\"The government is not the arbiter of what is orderly.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMr Bercow invited Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg to come to the despatch box saying at the moment there \"is extreme ambiguity about intention\" adding that \"cannot be right\".\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said: \"I think you worry unduly, that there will be a full emergency business statement on Monday, which is part of what I was saying so that people will have a full appreciation of what business there will be.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Queen's Speech debate will continue but Monday will be as I set out on the point of order I raised a few moments ago.\"\n\nLabour's Hilary Benn (Leeds Central) asked if Mr Bercow would be willing to accept a manuscript amendment to any motion tabled by the Government \"once we know what your ruling is on Monday\".\n\nMr Bercow replied: \"I do not want the House to be disadvantaged.\"\n\nHe added: \"It must be right that there should be an opportunity for manuscript amendments to be tabled so that alternative propositions can be put before the House.\"\n\nIn the absence of being allowed to ask questions on the Government's plans, MPs raised a number of 'points of order' asking for an explanation.\n\nBut before they had completed their points of order, Mr Rees-Mogg stood up and walked out of the Chamber.\n\nThe SNP's Patrick Grady, who was asking a question of the chair at the time, sighed, gestured towards the departing Leader, and said: \"Mr Speaker, I'm not sure I have a point of order any more.\"", "description": "The leader of the house didn't bother waiting for points of order on the Government's rapidly unravelling plan to be asked", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
