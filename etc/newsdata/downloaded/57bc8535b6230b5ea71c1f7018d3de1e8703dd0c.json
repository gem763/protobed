Semi-finals day at a Masters 1000 event \u2013 and not a wrinkle in sight?\n\nIn Shanghai on Friday, the ages of the four participants added up to just 89 years. The statistic might not seem all that startling in most sports, where the saying goes that \u201ca good young \u2019un always beats a good old \u2019un\u201d.\n\nBut in tennis, where the Big Three have spent recent seasons crushing all challengers beneath their collective jackboot, it feels like a revolutionary moment. To find the last Masters semi-final line-up of comparable greenness, you have to go back 20 years to Hamburg in 1999. That quartet included a pair of world No 1s in Carlos Moya and Marcelo Rios, which should encourage this year\u2019s crop.\n\nSo what happened in Saturday's twin battles of the babes? The first match, which pitted 23-year-old Daniil Medvedev against 21-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas, produced quality ball-striking but disappointingly little drama, especially when you consider that these two have a frosty relationship off the court.\n\nHaving taken out reigning world No 1 Novak Djokovic in a fine three-setter on Friday \u2013 a result which ensures that Djokovic will give up that top spot to Rafael Nadal early next month \u2013 Tsitsipas looked a little flat yesterday as he succumbed to a 7-6, 7-5 defeat in 96 minutes.", "description": "This is men\u2019s tennis, but not as we know it.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212821096-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
