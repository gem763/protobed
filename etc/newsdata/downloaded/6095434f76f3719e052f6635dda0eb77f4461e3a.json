There\u2019s nothing uncooked about me. To write about me is nothing like it is to be with me. Never had a persona. Never needed one. Never will. \u2014 Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) September 5, 2019\n\nDel Rey went on to lambast Powers and tell her to not \u201ccall yourself a fan\u201d because her \u201cgift is the warmth I live my life with and the self reflection I share generously.\u201d\n\nSo don\u2019t call yourself a fan like you did in the article and don\u2019t count your editor one either \u2013 I may never never have made bold political or cultural statements before- because my gift is the warmth I live my life with and the self reflection I share generously. \u2014 Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) September 5, 2019\n\nWell, it seems Lana isn\u2019t pleased when she\u2019s not reviewed the way she wants. HuffPost has reached out to Powers for further comment.", "description": "The singer apparently wasn't pleased with an NPR review that called the music \"instantly compelling\" and also full of \"bad-girl flexes.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d714a55240000ee1775fe01.jpeg?cache=q7hd80nasy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
