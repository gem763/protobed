REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (UNITED STATES - Tags: PROFILE BUSINESS)\n\nThis week\u2019s impeachment inquiry against President Trump surrounding his late July phone call with the President of Ukraine isn\u2019t set to end the bull market in stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s the assessment from billionaire investor Ken Fisher, founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that\u2019s going on now that isn't in my opinion pre-priced and that would stop a bull market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stock market barely flinched when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced an impeachment inquiry earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of a circus,\u201d Fisher said, referring to the political battle that is heating up in relation to Trump\u2019s phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cAnd circuses in the longer term don\u2019t make or kill bull markets or bear markets. Will we have more circus? We\u2019re going to have circus all the way through the November 2020 elections. If you don\u2019t expect the elections to have drama, you\u2019re missing what elections are all about.\u201d\n\nPlus, even with the political uncertainty surrounding the impeachment inquiry, another political process is taking place: the narrowing of prospective 2020 presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cWith that comes falling uncertainty \u2014 as you move down to a two person competition,\u201d Fisher noted. \u201cThen we move to where one of those people will win. We always get a winner and the market pre-prices that.\u201d\n\nKen Fisher\u2019s market outlook\n\nFisher characterizes the current environment as an \u201cokay world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a great world, but it\u2019s an okay world and skepticism and negativity are very high,\u201d he said. \u201cNegativity and skepticism are priced into the market now.\u201d\n\nAs the market starts to realize that we\u2019re in an \u201cokay world,\u201d Fisher said it should be a fairly material positive surprise for markets, and the markets will pre-price that \u201cand move forward over the next year in the same form of begrudging, grinding, relatively joyless bull market that we\u2019ve had which is long, moves in spurts and then boringness.\u201d\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
