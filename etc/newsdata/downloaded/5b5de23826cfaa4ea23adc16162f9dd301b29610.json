It\u2019s Steve Cortes, a member of the Trump 2020 advisory board and a paid on-air contributor at CNN, a perennial media foe of the president\u2019s.\n\nLate last week, The Hollywood Reporter published a story on how Cortes had been \u201cbenched\u201d by network brass, and hadn\u2019t appeared on CNN in the U.S. in more than a month. \u201cThey just won't book him,\u201d a former CNN contributor told THR. \u201cThey\u2019ll just pay him. They won\u2019t fire him, because that\u2019s just blatant. But they won\u2019t book him, and they\u2019ll tell all the producers not to book him.\u201d\n\nWithin the past few weeks, the leader of the free world came to notice Cortes\u2019 absence from CNN, a network Trump has on-and-off insisted that he doesn\u2019t watch or pay attention to anymore.\n\nRecently, the president has dealt with news of a possible recession on the horizon, the aftermath of high-profile shootings and a racist, anti-immigrant mass murder, a debate over gun control laws, U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and the implosion of his pick for Director of National Intelligence. He has trashed the city of Baltimore, promoted a conspiracy theory that the Clintons killed pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and made fun of Chris Cuomo.\n\nAnd he has also found the time to get personally invested in the status of Steve Cortes\u2019 TV career.\n\nOn top of grousing to his aides, Trump got on the phone with Cortes in the past month to ask him what was going on, and to complain about CNN\u2019s \u201cbias\u201d and how unfairly the cable news network has treated its pro-Trump, conservative commentator, two sources familiar with the call tell The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough to have a stacked, four-versus-one panel,\u201d said former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), a current Trump surrogate and former CNN contributor. \u201cCNN has decided to eliminate as many Trump supporters as possible, including me, Jeff Lord, Jason Miller, Bryan Lanza, and Steve Moore. The Republicans who survive are the ones who take constant jabs at Trump. They\u2019re Never Trumpers or RINOs.\u201d\n\nKingston, who did not have his CNN contract renewed for this year, added that while he didn\u2019t receive a phone call from the president following the end of his paid contributorship, he used to get calls from Trump \u201cfrom time to time\u201d during his time at the network, when the president would praise Kingston\u2019s performances in specific CNN segments and discuss \u201cwhatever issues\u201d were on his mind. Trump would also ask about the other panelists he enjoyed watching\u2014and would be sure to point out the ones he \u201cdid not like,\u201d Kingston said.\n\nAs for Kingston\u2019s former colleague, the president has known and personally liked Cortes for years, and this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s taken an interest in the TV commentator\u2019s career path. In late 2017, Trump and Cortes had a conversation at the White House in which the president remarked on how much he appreciated all of Cortes\u2019 appearances on Fox News (the network on which Cortes was a regular at the time), a former White House official recalled.\n\nStill, the president had something else on his mind: he asked Cortes to go back to CNN, where the Trump surrogate was most needed to do battle with the network\u2019s armada of anti-Trump liberals and Never Trumpers, according to this ex-official. The president made it clear he wanted Cortes sticking it to the libs at CNN before and during his re-election campaign.\n\nCortes didn\u2019t disappoint. By late Jan. 2018, he tweeted: \u201cIt's official, I'm now a @CNN Political Commentator. Had a terrific run at @FoxNews, excited about the adventures ahead!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this latest adventure has effectively ended, or if he\u2019s just in the penalty box. CNN, Cortes, and the White House did not provide comment for this story.\n\nEarlier this year, Cortes was briefly considered, according to Politico, as a possible successor to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a job that ultimately went to Stephanie Grisham.\n\nCortes caused a minor internal stir at the network over his attempt to recast history in Trump\u2019s favor, admonishing the media and essentially absolving Trump of his comments following the murder of a protester by a neo-Nazi at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017. Earlier this month, Trump shared a video Cortes recorded for the conservative website PragerU in which the CNN pundit made a heavily revisionist argument\u2014one that has picked up steam in recent months and is nowadays regularly made by Trump campaign officials\u2014claiming that Trump had not referred to neo-Nazis or white supremacists in Charlottesville as \u201cvery fine people\u201d but was instead referring to a different group of protesters.\n\nCNN\u2019s media reporter Oliver Darcy criticized Cortes on Twitter, saying the commentator\u2019s comments were \u201ca weird thing for someone who is a paid CNN commentator to say, given the network's accurate reporting on the matter.\u201d Primetime anchor Anderson Cooper added that although he likes Cortes personally, his description of Trump\u2019s comments about Charlottesville were \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201cactually wrong.\u201d\n\nThe pundit\u2019s absence from CNN\u2019s air comes as pro-Trump pundits have become far scarcer on the cable news network. Earlier this year, the network decided not to renew the contracts of two of Trump\u2019s fiercest on-air defenders\u2014Kingston and former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer\u2014and as The Hollywood Reporter pointed out, another commentator sympathetic to Trump, Ben Ferguson, has not been on CNN since April.", "description": "Amid national uproar over mass shootings, possible economic gloom, and gun control, the president has found time to be distressed over a pro-Trump pundit\u2019s lack of CNN airtime.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Maxwell Tani", "White House Reporter", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1566348557/190821-swin-tani-steve-cortes-hero_glx0rq", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
