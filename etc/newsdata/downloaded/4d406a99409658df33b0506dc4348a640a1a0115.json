During her election campaign she posted picture after picture of him, saying how much she loved him.\n\nHill, 32, was the subject of a bombshell report on the right-wing site RedState on Friday alleging she was in a throuple with her husband and her 22-year-old female staffer.\n\nThe report linked to a picture of a completely naked Hill brushing the hair of the young woman.\n\nThe politician was also accused of having a separate affair with her male legislative affairs officer, Graham Kelly, 31.\n\nAccording to text messages, Hill's relationship with Kelly was the final straw for Heslep, saying he could accept his wife having a relationship with a woman, but not with another man.\n\nBisexual congresswoman Katie Hill lashed out at her husband Kenny Heslep on Tuesday after allegations she was in a throuple with him and her young female staffer\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Hill, 32, said: 'The fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to humiliate me. I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit a private matter for political gain,' she added, without saying who she considered were her opponents. Pictured: Hill with her staffers\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, Hill said, in part: 'Intimate photos of me and another individual were published by Republican operatives on the internet without my consent.\n\n'I have notified Capitol Hill police who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos, and therefore will have no further comment on the digital materials.\n\n'The fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me. I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain. This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed.\n\n'Allegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false. I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.'\n\nHill won a previously staunch Republican seat north and east of Los Angeles \u2014 that includes the Ronald Reagan library \u2014 in the blue wave that swept much of California.\n\nShe is vice chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, whose chairman Elijah Cummings died last week.\n\nRedState reported that both Hill and her husband Heslep were involved with the female campaign worker.\n\nIt said the three went on several vacations together, including a trip to Alaska where the naked picture of Hill was taken. The report also included pictures of Hill kissing the young woman.\n\nIn all the pictures, the woman's face was blurred out but from the report DailyMail.com has been able to ascertain the woman's identity.\n\nWhen approached at her home in California, the woman appeared agitated and declined to comment, saying: \u2018Please leave. Leave now.\n\nHill was also accused of having a separate affair with her male legislative affairs officer, Graham Kelly (pictured together)\n\nIn text messages sent in June, Heslep seems to admit to the staffer that the throuple's relationship dynamic was 'toxic'.\n\nHe wrote: 'I mean it, though, man. It has been weighing very, very heavily on me lately. Part of my mind keeps trying to justify it because of katies [sic] abuse.\n\n'That she created the ''s**t rolls downhill'' situation. But that is no excuse whatsoever for what I did. So again, I'm sorry.'\n\nThe staffer replies: 'It was a dark time and you treated me really poorly but I also stayed which I have to own.'\n\nBut she admits she was 'ready to put together' a future with both Hill and Heslep, telling him: 'Think of how toxic our relationship was? And I was still ready to put together something real. To build a future on that absolutely abysmal foundation.'\n\nIn another text exchange between the young female staffer and Heslep on June 12, she references what she feared that in addition to losing the relationship, she would risk loosing her future in politics and friends.\n\nShe wrote: 'Idk, I was getting ready and I was thinking about how much Katie liked to watch me [reference to a hobby]\u2026It's ok, she can't take [this] from me. She can ruin politics, take all my friends, and isolate me, but she can't have [this].'\n\nWhen the relationship between Hill and the female staffer broke down, the young woman tried to keep things professional, but Hill would allegedly cross the line, asking her to apply sunscreen for her, according to text messages.\n\nDailyMail.com's attempts to contact Heslep were unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to text messages seen by DailyMail.com, Hill's relationship with Kelly (pictured together) was the final straw for Heslep, as he said he could accept his wife having a relationship with a woman, but not with another man\n\nRedState said both the woman and Hill's husband noticed a change in Hill's demeanor after she took her seat in Congress in January.\n\nBy May, she broke off her relationships with both of them, saying she wanted to focus on her 'important' work in Washington.\n\nTexts provided to the site showed Hill telling the woman: 'I still care about you.'\n\nThe staffer replied: 'Well I still care about you, but I think I need a little more time to 'move on' before we can be friends.'\n\nShe added: 'It's not that I hate you, it's just that it hurts too much to think about you at this point in time.'\n\nHeslep filed for divorce on July 10 in Los Angeles, stating the couple, who have no children, had separated on July 5. He cited 'irreconcilable differences.'\n\nHill agreed the marriage had broken down, although she said they had split on June 7 \u2014 less than a week before they were due to celebrate their ninth anniversary.\n\nHeslep, who described himself as a house husband who hasn't had a paying job since 2014, asked for reasonable spousal support and $10,700 in attorney's fees. Hill said both should pay their own way.\n\nAccording to text messages, Heslep had been told that Hill was having an affair with Graham Kelly, her legislative director.\n\nHeslep told the person he was texting that he could accept her having a relationship with a woman, but not with another man.\n\nKelly has not responded to DailyMail.com's attempts to reach him.\n\nHill had used her love for Heslep to win her election, when she beat incumbent Republican Steve Knight by nine points. She gushed: 'Happy anniversary to the love of my life, my partner, and my best friend'\n\nHill had used her love for Heslep to win her election, when she beat incumbent Republican Steve Knight by nine points.\n\nHer campaign's Facebook page contained several pictures of him, but they have been pulled in recent days.\n\nOn June 12, 2017 \u2014 the couple's seventh wedding anniversary \u2014 she showcased a picture of her kissing him on the cheek, writing to her supporters: 'Today, I want to introduce you to the person who makes this campaign possible: my husband Kenny.\n\n'Running for office isn't easy, particularly when you're still working full time. Kenny has supported me every step of the way \u2014 from laundry and lunches to being my inspiration when things get hard. I could not do this without him.'\n\nThat September she called him 'wonderful and supportive' and thanked him for making fundraising calls for her.\n\nThe following June, she gushed: 'Happy anniversary to the love of my life, my partner, and my best friend.'\n\nShe added: 'It's crazy to believe we've been in each other's lives for fourteen years and married for eight. I don't think either of us could have ever guessed where we would be now, but I know I wouldn't be here without you.\n\n'Your love and support get me through the toughest challenges life throw at us.'\n\nHeslep filed for divorce on July 10 in Los Angeles, stating the couple, who have no children, had separated on July 5. He cited 'irreconcilable differences'\n\nTwo months before the election, she wrote: 'I am able to throw my all into this race because my husband, Kenny, is the toughest backbone anyone could ask for. He is at my side on my best days and on my worst, or or off the trail.\n\n'Kenny, you are my best friend and the love of my life,' she wrote about the man she now calls 'abusive,' before adding: 'I am so proud of the life we've built together and I can't wait to see what we do next.'\n\nHill has described herself as bisexual all her adult life. She told the LGBTQ magazine The Advocate: 'I've been out as bi since I was a teenager, right after high school,' saying it was part of being an 'honest, transparent politician.'\n\nBefore running for Congress she was executive director of a group called People Assisting the Homeless. Her husband's most recent job was regional manager for the same group.\n\nHill is the second freshman woman Democrat to have her husband file for divorce for allegedly having an affair with a staffer in the first 10 months of this Congress.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar's husband Ahmed Hirsi filed for divorce this summer after DailyMail.com exclusively reported that she was involved with her campaign aide Tim Mynett. Mynett's wife has also filed for divorce.", "description": "Bisexual California state congresswoman Katie Hill lashed out at her husband\u00a0Kenny Heslep on Tuesday after allegations she was in a throuple with\u00a0her young female staffer and him.", "authors": ["Martin Gould In Washington", "D.C.", "For Dailymail.Com And Josh Boswell In Santa Clarita", "California", "For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056368-0-image-a-147_1571779292277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
