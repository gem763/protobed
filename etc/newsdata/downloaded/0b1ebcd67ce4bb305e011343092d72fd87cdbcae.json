We look forward to winning at trial,\" Burlingame said.\n\nMichael McGovern, a lawyer for Chanu, said in an emailed statement, \"As Judge Tharp repeatedly noted in his decision, the Government has yet to prove that Cedric did anything wrong \u2014 and we look forward to trial, when it will become clear that he did not.\"\n\n\"We will continue to mount a forceful defense on his behalf,\" McGovern said.\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nLiew, who previously worked with Vorley and Chanu as a junior trader on the precious metals desk for Deutsche Bank, pleaded guilty in June 2017 to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and spoofing.\n\nLiew is a cooperating witness for prosecutors. He is awaiting sentencing.\n\nThe Justice Department has been aggressively cracking down on spoofing in the precious metals market. Federal prosecutors have lodged 13 spoofing cases against 19 defendants in the past five years.\n\nIn September, prosecutors indicted three J.P. Morgan precious metals traders \u2014 including the global head of base and precious metals trading \u2014 on charges that include racketeering conspiracy in connection with an alleged multiyear scheme to manipulate the precious metals futures markets.\n\nTrade groups, including the Futures Industry Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Bank Policy Institute and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association all filed briefs in January and February supporting Vorley and Chanu's argument to dismiss the charges.\n\nIn FIA's filing, the leading global trade organization says it \"objects to the government's attempt to expand the wire fraud statute in a new way that unnecessarily invites harm to legitimate trading and the vitality of the futures markets.\"\n\nIn addition, the FIA cautioned that \"if accepted, the government's theory of liability poses a serious risk of chilling legitimate, non-fraudulent trading by FIA's members and other market participants,\" the filing says.", "description": "The decision will allow a criminal case against two ex-Deutsche Bank traders, accused of manipulating precious metals futures markets from 2009 to 2011, to move forward.", "authors": ["Dawn Giel"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104545414-GettyImages-687260486-Deutsche-Bank.jpg?v=1571767396", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
