She is not wearing the black gloves required under IS, and she has nose and eyebrow piercings.\n\nIt's a brave move. A number of people have been murdered recently by women in the camp still who remain affiliated with IS, for not adhering to their radical form of Islam.\n\nShe had to move to a section of the camp monitored by cameras after being threatened with having her tent burnt down.\n\n'I tried to escape ISIS for years and now I come here and I'm still not safe,' the woman said.\n\nThe former jihadi bride, believed to be Zehra Duman, now lives in the Al-Hawl camp, in northeastern Syria.\n\n'It's a little Islamic State, you're still between the same people, they're still trying to imply their laws in the camp.'\n\nMs Duman, from Melbourne, travelled to Syria in 2014.\n\nAround 72,000 people are now residing in Al-Hawl camp, according to the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.\n\nAmong them are are about sixty women and children from Australia, who arrived from the last IS stronghold in Baghouz six months ago.\n\nNow 24 years of age and the mother of two small children, the woman lit a cigarette - also forbidden under radical IS ideology - before saying that she wants her story to be told.\n\nShe spoke hurriedly, knowing there was limited time to talk.\n\n'Two weeks before I came here I was clubbing. I wasn't religious,' she said.\n\nThe catalyst for her travelling to Syria was an ex-boyfriend in Australia who threatened and stalked her. Another friend of hers, who had travelled to Syria from Melbourne, took advantage of that vulnerability.\n\nAround 72,000 people are now residing in Al-Hawl camp, according to the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria\n\n'This guy I used to like from high school, he was good looking and stuff, he said: 'Look, I'm in Syria and it's not what you think, come and get married to me and I can give you a nice life',' she said.\n\nShe understood at the time that IS was active in the region, but this man - previously reported to be Mahmoud Abdullatif - told her not to believe the news in Australia.\n\nShe arrived in Syria, and the pair married in November 2014 in the north of the war-torn country. A month-and-a-half later, her husband was killed in Syrian government air strikes.\n\nThe woman claims she's wanted to leave Syria ever since his death.\n\n'The first time I had balls to leave was after I gave birth to my son,' she said.\n\nShe made contact with smugglers to try to leave of IS-held territory, but the group found the messages and placed her in home detention.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton's office did not respond to request for comment (pictured, jihadi brides hold up weapons in front of a car)\n\n'Basically you come here willingly but if you want to leave, if you want to go back to your old life ... they ripped up your passport.'\n\nIn order to get out of detention, she needed to remarry.\n\n'My last husband had good intentions. He felt sorry for me, he knew I wanted to leave and they're oppressing me. So he married me,' she said.\n\nHer second husband was killed in January this year, just before the final battle against IS by coalition forces in Baghouz.\n\n'I had a breakdown and a half, because I knew he was my only way out.'\n\nJust as a human corridor was opened up by the coalition and the Kurdish-majority Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Australian woman gave birth to a girl through a caesarean section.\n\n'I wanted to get out of there, there was really hard bombing ... not just then, always, but in the last days it was so intense.'\n\nShe and her two children were some of the first people to leave Baghouz, surrendering to the SDF.\n\nShe explained the trauma of being under bombardment for so many years is unmanageable for her and her children.\n\n'You know what happens when I hear a plane now, or even a garbage bin, automatically my body has diarrhoea,' she explained.\n\nHer son is not only traumatised from seeing so much death, but also evidently has staphylococcus, as seen from the boil-like clusters all over his legs.\n\nSDF Spokesperson Mustafa Bali said no foreign governments are cooperating on the issue of women and children in Al-Hawl (pictured, veiled women ride on a pickup truck in the camp)\n\n'You know what my son says when [my daughter] is sleeping, look Mummy [she's] dead. This is messed up, he's three years old, how can he know what death is?'\n\nShe hopes for her children's sake that Australia will take them back soon.\n\n'Forget me, I just want my kids to see my family, to see hospitals, medication, psychologists, have a normal childhood,' she said.\n\nSDF Spokesperson Mustafa Bali said no foreign governments are cooperating on the issue of women and children in Al-Hawl.\n\n'Especially the Australian Government they haven't done anything so far,' Bali said.\n\nHe pointed out that the SDF have limited resources to continue providing for families in the camps.\n\n'None of the governments are providing any money [for aid]. We are paying from the food of our kids actually.'\n\n'When we talk about the foreigners, the first thing that comes to our minds is their countries need to have responsibility towards them, it means they need to take them.'\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton's office did not respond to request for comment.\n\nThe woman understands there's no way out of the camp unless the government repatriates them.\n\nShe's aware she could face trial and prison, and says she would score a 'triple A+' in a de-radicalisation program.\n\nThe woman repeatedly called herself an idiot for travelling to Syria.\n\n'I want the Australians to know ... my intention right now is to show that we're not all the same. Some of us want help.'", "description": "The former jihadi bride, believed to be Zehra Duman, now lives in the Al-Hawl camp, in northeastern Syria.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/02/19321134-0-image-a-3_1570238430002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
