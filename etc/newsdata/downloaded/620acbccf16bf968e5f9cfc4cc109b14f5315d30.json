(Note: The chart above reflects data from 451 cities, since not all cities collect property, sales and income tax.)\n\nCities' revenue growth stalled in the 2018 fiscal year, but this year's continued drop indicates mounting pressures on city budgets.\n\nAt the same time, expenditures grew by 1.8% in 2018. City officials predict they'll grow again to 2.3% in 2019, thanks to climbing costs associated with infrastructure, public safety spending and pension costs.\n\nFinance officers from large cities and larger mid-sized cities are more likely than those from smaller mid-sized cities to expect a recession in the next two years. A few factors may be driving this, per Christiana McFarland, research director for the National League of Cities.\n\nBig cities are seeing a wider gap between revenue growth and spending growth than smaller cities.\n\nBusiness investment in 2019 is also declining, which tends to affect bigger cities first.\n\nAnd housing market growth is leveling off in most places \u2014 and even starting to slump in previously hot markets like San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nWhile larger cities may be nearing the end of this cycle of economic expansion, smaller cities may still have a bit more room to grow.\n\nThe Midwest is bearing the brunt of declining conditions, the report found. Overall general fund revenues in midwestern cities dipped by 4.4% in fiscal year 2018, mostly driven by steep revenue drops in the region's big cities. Chicago, for example, recorded an 11.7% revenue decline.\n\nFinance officers in midwestern cities are also most likely to say they are concerned that their budgets can't support the communities' needs over the past year.\n\nThe other side: Across the South, West and Northeast, municipalities of all sizes showed some growth in general fund revenues, albeit slower growth than previous years.\n\nThe bottom line: Peaks and valleys in property, sales and income tax collections tend to balance each other out over time. The fact that all three revenue sources are trending downward simultaneously \u2014 combined with the growing gap between city revenues and expenditures \u2014 suggests an economic downturn may be on the horizon.", "description": "The impact of changing economic conditions are felt by cities sooner than at the national level.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
