But, she adds, open workplaces and flat organizational charts don't equal an inclusive workplace \u2014 and might even create opportunities for unwanted contact.\n\nWhy it matters: There is a lot of talk in the industry about teaching girls to code and recruiting more women for tech jobs. But without addressing sexual harassment and other forms of bias, tech companies won't be able to attract a more diverse workforce and retain those entering the field.\n\nWhat's next: Alexander says tech companies need to examine themselves with a tougher eye on everything from office culture to sexual harassment training to how well represented women are in leadership.\n\n\"You need to treat sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct as workplace safety issues,\" she said.\n\nEven microaggressions and unconscious bias can lead to a culture where harassment is more likely to occur.\n\n\"Go beyond what's legally required,\" Alexander says.\n\nAmong her recommendations are sexual harassment trainings that are frequent, mandatory for all employees and interactive.\n\n\"You can't get away with a webinar once every 18 months.\"\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Alexander\n\nThe bottom line: The tech industry still has a lot of work to do to foster an inclusive workplace.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "A third of women in tech say they have received or witnessed unwanted physical contact in the last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/G87Vw89PMMInLbsohVzsL04CNlY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2018/11/21/1542816616732.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-21"}
