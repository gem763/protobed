She wrote about how Jack was teased by his peers when the two played with Polly Pockets: \"We ignored them and laughed and played and had so much fun they eventually asked to join.\"\n\n'He was who he was and he was proud of it'\n\nShe said Jack was \"quiet\" and she didn't want to push her role in his life.\n\n\"And, then he came out,\" she wrote. \"I was so proud of his confidence. He was who he was and he was proud of it. And, then we bonded again. We found each other on a new level with a whole new respect for each other.\"\n\nJack came out as gay when he was 17 years old, and his actor dad Dean McDermott recently opened up about his son in an episode of his \"Daddy Issues\" podcast.\n\nWhile he supports his son, he still voiced concern for him in a world that isn't always accepting.\n\n\"My son Jack is gay,\" McDermott told his guest Perez Hilton. \"I just think, you know, you want the best for your kid. And you don't want to wish a life of persecution and hard times and bigotry, right? I think there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nHe also praised his son's looks. \"He's this beautiful, 6-foot-4, beautiful Adonis,\" he said. \"He's just a gorgeous kid.\"\n\nSpelling ended her post with continued praise for her stepson.\n\n\"He is so smart, kind, funny, unique, sweet, confident, and driven. His scream, smile, and laugh are contagious and his style is fierce. He makes no apologies for who he is. And who he uniquely is ... Is Jack Montgomery McDermott.\"\n\nSpelling and McDermott share five children together \u2013 Liam, 12, Stella, 11, Hattie, 7, Finn, 7, and Beau, 2.\n\nREAD MORE", "description": "Tori Spelling got emotional on Instagram about her stepson Jack.
