I love meeting up with Wales. I haven\u2019t got anything to clear my mind about.\u201d\n\nWales manager Ryan Giggs suggested Bale\u2019s situation at the club had improved.\n\n\u201cIt would have unsettled him because it was apparently very close for him going,\u201d Giggs said.\n\n\u201cThings do change quickly in football and now he\u2019s playing, he\u2019s loved, he\u2019s happy, and I expect him to carry on doing what he\u2019s doing for Real.\u201d\n\nWales are fourth in Group E with six points, but have a game in hand over leaders Croatia (10 points), Slovakia and Hungary (nine points each).", "description": "Real Madrid's Gareth Bale said anger over his treatment and media speculation about his future at the Spanish club had not distracted him from giving his best on the pitch.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439130223&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990A3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
