Likewise, companies are shifting production and bringing more opportunities with them when they relocate.\n\nComparatively, job growth in San Francisco actually fell 0.1%, compared to the year-ago period, with 146,700 jobs.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a sign that companies are pulling back on hiring in the face of extreme cost of living,\u201d he said.\n\nConversely, San Francisco touted the fastest wage growth in September, up 3% year-over-year with a $73,861 median base pay. Atlanta followed, with wages up 3% at a median base pay of $56,0569. Wages in Los Angeles, meanwhile, were up 2.8%, with a median base pay of $63,526.\n\n\u201cDespite a rocky August with recession chatter near fever pitch, the labor market continues to sustain the economic expansion,\u201d the report said. \u201cCrucially, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in September to cut interest rates was in spite of, and not because of, the labor market. Additionally, while the trade war has negatively impacted sectors like manufacturing, consumer spending has been resilient.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Workers are flocking to these cities because of the lower cost-of-living, compared to cities like New York or San Francisco.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Boston.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
