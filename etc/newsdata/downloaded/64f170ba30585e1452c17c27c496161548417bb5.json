The report claims that a Michigan State groundskeeper removed two large pieces from the display after accusing the group of failing to obtain permission to promote their organization. After student leaders threatened to call the police, the groundskeeper decided not to remove the display.\n\nOver the course of the day, several students came by and removed flags. Students from Protect Life at MSU claim that students hurled obscenities at them as they passed by the flags.\n\n\u201cProtect Life Michigan serves nearly every university in the state and many host this display each year. We seek to have productive dialogue with students of all backgrounds, helping them understand the injustice of abortion,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cI am disappointed that the students we encountered today couldn\u2019t engage us in dialogue and instead resorted to violence and theft to make their beliefs known.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reported last week that the College Republicans office at the University of Wisconsin was defaced by a group of students. A female student was caught on camera covering the office\u2019s windows with labels that read \u201cracist,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d and \u201cbigot.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.", "description": "A small group of leftist student activists at Michigan State University was caught on camera this week stealing parts of a pro-life display that was set up on campus.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Michigan-State-U-pro-life-display-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
