Ron DeSantis' first brush with severe weather, a routine political hazard in the state, since becoming governor. | Getty Images DeSantis embraces role as spokesman-in-chief as Dorian churns\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Hurricane Dorian no longer seems to pose a major threat to Florida, but it is helping to make Gov. Ron DeSantis more of a household name.\n\nStaring down potentially destructive storms is one of the core job requirements for any new Florida governor, and DeSantis \u2014 in the post for just eight months \u2014 saw his name launch on the airwaves. Between last Thursday and Sunday, on average, DeSantis was mentioned on television more than 1,000 times, a huge spike for an official who is mentioned 50 to 100 per day under normal circumstances, according to TV Eyes, software that monitors television traffic.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDorian is DeSantis' first brush with severe weather, a routine political hazard in the state, since becoming governor and he's leveraged the storm as a real-life test drive of his new administration\u2019s emergency management apparatus. There is an army of staff and experts across the state who help hammer out everything from forecasting to relief logistics, so oftentimes the governor\u2019s most significant role is to be the face and voice of the collective response, an operation that is now wrapping up just because the state is no longer expected to get clobbered as badly as once feared.\n\nDeSantis, for instance, held a high-profile press conference at the Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee Tuesday with acting FEMA Director Pete Gaynor. At that much-covered event, like most of his others, DeSantis wore a dark blue windbreaker.\n\nDeSantis stressed that he'd talked to Florida\u2019s Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, and the biggest priority is securing federal cash to help cities along Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast that will still feel storm surges and wind impacts as the storm slowly works its way north roughly 100 miles off the Florida coast.\n\n\u201cNow that we have a more favorable track, I talked to Pete Gaynor about this [reimbursements] and the president and took proactive measures to make sure we can get reimbursements for counties,\u201d DeSantis said during the press conference with Gaynor.\n\nDeSantis is getting that \u2014 and other \u2014 storm-related messages out far and wide, with his numbers peaking late last week as the storm seemed to still pose a direct threat to Florida. Last Thursday, for example, DeSantis had more than 2,000 mentions, a number that was at 1,235 on Friday.\n\nBoth figures are considerably higher than the average mention total for DeSantis, and underscore the huge platform that a nationally-watched natural disaster can offer any Florida governor.\n\nThe only other Florida political leader that came close to DeSantis' mentions was Scott, himself a former two-term governor. Scott got attention for doing a series of media appearances about the storm, a role generally reserved for governors.\n\nHis mentions were much lower than DeSantis', but peaked Sunday when Scott did a round of national media interviews, including an appearance on Meet the Press. Because a federal official taking such a public role in messaging ahead of a storm is not the norm, Scott has faced some criticism \u2014 including from the Miami Herald's editorial board \u2014 that he is stepping on DeSantis\u2019 message.\n\nChris Hartline, a Scott spokesperson, disagrees.\n\n\u201cEvery elected official has a responsibility to use their platform to make sure all Florida families are aware of the threat from this storm,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cSenator Scott is doing what every other member of Congress has been asked to do by FEMA: letting constituents know to listen to local officials, heed evacuation warnings and be prepared.\u201d\n\nGary Fineout contributed to this report.", "description": "Between last Thursday and Sunday, on average, DeSantis was mentioned on television more than 1,000 times.", "authors": ["Matt Dixon"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/1c/b4baf7a242bbb731b6efaa1b25ea/desantishurricane.jpg"}
