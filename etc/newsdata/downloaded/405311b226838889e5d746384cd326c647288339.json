Twitter / Ena Matsuoka\n\nFans can sometimes seem dedicated \u2013 but one man in Japan has taken his obsession to a dangerous level.\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Police have arrested a man who allegedly tracked down and sexually assaulted an idol female singer by scrutinising reflections in her eyes from social media posts.\n\nThe term \u201cidol\u201d refers to pop entertainers in Japan who are marketed based on their attractiveness.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, 26-year-old Hibiki Sato, an unemployed man from Saitama, was arrested on charges of forcible indecency after allegedly attacking Ena Matsuoka, 21, a singer with pop group Tenshi Tsukinukeni Yomi.\n\nCiting Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, Telegraph reported that Sato was able to find out where Matsuoka lived by enlarging her social media photographs to reveal scenery and landmarks reflected in her eyes.\n\nSato then allegedly narrowed down the area using Google Street View, and identifying the station closest to her home, before stalking Matsuoka.\n\nThe singer had just finished a concert, and was entering her apartment building in Koto Ward just past 11pm on September 1 when she was attacked, Tokyo Reporter said.\n\nSato allegedly placed a towel over her head and proceeded to molest her, which resulted in injuries that took a week to heal.\n\nHe later admitted to the allegations, the English-language tabloid reported.\n\nThis is not the first time an incident involved obsessed fans of young female performers in Japan.\n\nThe Straits Times reported that in 2016, 20-year-old Mayu Tomita was stabbed 34 times in the chest, neck, back and arms by 27-year-old Tomohiro Iwazaki.\n\nPrior to the incident, Iwazaki had sent her nearly 400 increasingly angry tweets after Tomita refused gifts that he sent her, which included books and a watch.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - The man narrowed down the area using Google Street View after enlarging her social media photos to reveal scenery and landmarks..
