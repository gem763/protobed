It\u2019s going everywhere. So, you know, that\u2019s not happening. The pump is with me. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Naomi Campbell \u2018not ready to be a mother\u2019 at 49\n\nKeira Knightley and her husband James Righton are now parents to two daughters [Photo: Getty] More\n\nREAD MORE: Keira Knightley 'banned' her daughter from Disney princess films\n\nAs well as being bound by their new baby\u2019s feeding schedule, the actress also revealed that Delilah is having an impact on the couple\u2019s debate about potentially getting involved in the environmental movement, Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cWe keep having this discussion where we\u2019re saying to each other, \u2018Should we get arrested?\u2019\u201d the actress explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018We can\u2019t, we\u2019ve got a baby, she\u2019s permanently attached to my boob. So how\u2019s it going to work\u2019\n\n\u201cSo then he\u2019s going, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll go down and get arrested for both of us,\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s neither of us get arrested now. It\u2019s not the right time.\u2019 I think a lot of us just want to find a reason not to think about it...\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time the actress has opened up about her life since becoming a parent. In an interview with The Guardian last year she discussed the impact of motherhood on mental health.\n\n\u201cYour body just created life and now it\u2019s shifting in order to feed it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s monumental and we\u2019re all expected to go: \u2018Oh no, all good, I\u2019m groovy \u2013 I haven\u2019t slept, I\u2019m fine.'\u201d\n\nKeira, who suffered from a mental breakdown at the age of 22, adds her early therapy fuelled her to be able to cope with forgiving herself for making mistakes as a parent.\n\n\u201cThat I\u2019m able to forgive myself for not being brilliant [as a parent] every f***ing day is probably because of that breakdown.\u201d\n\nAnd earlier this year she spoke about being a working mum to Edie.\n\n\u201cThe the weird thing with acting is that sleep deprivation basically makes your emotions very close to the surface. It's much easier to cry,\u201d she told ET online. \u201cYou feel like crying all the time, so I can turn that on like that, so this is great. Thanks kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bags under my eyes are a little bit more, but apart from that, the crying is good!\u201d Knightley added.\n\nWatch the latest videos from Yahoo UK Lifestyle", "description": "\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it my boobs will explode.\"", "authors": ["Marie Claire Dorking"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o.c0cwXCmPcmAKyd.K.v1g--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8cbb9aa0-f573-11e9-acff-9cc9496c88ff", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
