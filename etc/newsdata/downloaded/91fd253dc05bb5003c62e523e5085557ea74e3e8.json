I became a shell of my former self.\u201d\n\nAfter allegedly complaining to top brass at the firm for months, Guerrero filed a report late Tuesday in San Jose, California, with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The report names DLA Piper, the $2.84-billion firm with lawyers in more than 40 countries that in 2010 famously represented Paul Ceglia\u2014the wood-pellet salesman who allegedly tried to defraud Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe complaint also names a senior partner at the firm\u2019s Silicon Valley office who, according to the complaint, recruited Guerrero. As part of his pitch, the partner allegedly told Guerrero that she was a \u201cstar\u201d and that he expected her to soon outpace him. He told her \u201cyou\u2019ll be my boss soon,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s EEOC filing alleges gender discrimination\u2014including quid pro quo and hostile-environment sexual harassment\u2014as well as retaliation.\n\n\u201cI went from working in Hong Kong as general counsel and the top female executive at a global tech company to being abused by [the partner],\u201d Guerrero wrote in her open letter issued Wednesday, in which she asked to be voluntarily released from mandatory arbitration. Her letter also claims that, outside of forced arbitration, she would be able to file civil claims against the partner for assault, battery, and sexual harassment.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s complaint alleges that the partner\u2019s behavior was \u201ccommon knowledge among employees, including other partners in the Palo Alto office\u201d who refused to remedy the situation. She names at least three other senior male partners who were aware of the allegations against the partner for months and \u201copted to marginalize what happened and horrifically\u2014did nothing.\u201d\n\nOne of those partners, the complaint states, \u201cbluntly told Ms. Guerrero that she was lying and that this was clearly a case of \u2018he said, she said\u2019\u201d and then \u201cfabricated a reason to remove Ms. Guerrero from a valued account just days after learning specific details about her claims regarding Mr. [the partner].\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast, the law firm said: \u201cWe are aware of these allegations by one of our partners and take them seriously. As soon as we were notified of the allegations, we took appropriate steps to investigate them. This process is ongoing and we continue to seek Ms. de Verneuil\u2019s cooperation in our investigation.\u201d\n\nShanghai, Brazil, Chicago, and Palo Alto\n\nThe partner \u201cregularly throws temper tantrums in and out of the office,\u201d involving yelling, cursing, and clenched fists, the complaint states.\n\nOnce on a trip to Shanghai, the partner asked Guerrero to come up to his hotel room to discuss business, drank several glasses of wine, and offered her a foot massage, the EEOC complaint alleges.\n\n\u201cBefore she knew what was happening, he had her lying down on the couch with his body next to her, physically hugging and groping her,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cUpset and in shock, Ms. Guerrero told him \u2018no\u2019 and ran out of the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn panic and disbelief about what he had done, Ms. Guerrero stayed silent because she naively thought that [the partner] would stop future advances,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nThe following week, on a flight to Brazil, the partner bumped himself and Guerrero up to business class and revealed his feelings for her, the report claims.\n\nBefore the plane landed, Guerrero said she was crying in the bathroom.\n\nThat night, according to Guerrero, the partner told her that he upgraded his room at the hotel so that the two could work there more comfortably and that two male associates on the trip would not be joining them for dinner. At a \u201cromantic restaurant,\u201d without the other two male associates present, the partner \u201cattempted to tell her things about his personal life\u201d while she claims she tried to steer the conversation toward work, the complaint alleges", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettyVanina Guerrero first immigrated to the U.S. from Colombia when she was 4 years old.\u00a0Decades later\u2014after cleaning offices, scrubbing toilets, attending college, graduating from law school, and mastering five languages\u2014she was hired at top-grossing law firm DLA", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CRdCcUWkgS.gtvAC2RhX_g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/8b5b2816ee75442e96785bb66310d70f", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
