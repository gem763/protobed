Encarnaci\u00f3n has missed 11 games since leaving the first game of a doubleheader at Detroit after hitting his 34th home run Sept. 12.\n\nEncarnaci\u00f3n is sitting after initial indications that he would play. Boone said \u201cmentally he\u2019s probably not quite over that hump where he needs to be.\u201d Boone said the concern is a tweak of the injury sidelining the 36-year-old designated hitter and first baseman in the playoffs for the AL East champions.\n\nGio Urshela was back in the lineup at third base after a day after missing a game in Tampa Bay. Urshela was hit by a pitch on his left hand on Wednesday. He said before the game there was \u201cno pain at all.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New York Yankees catcher Gary S\u00e1nchez was set to play at least part of the series opener in Texas after missing 10 games with left groin tightness, and the club has decided on a cautious approach with Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n's left oblique injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
