It was discovered as part of a document gathering process in response to a government investigation.\"The airline industry is on high alert after Boeing decided last month to also halt operations of another, older version of the 737, the Next Generation model, due to cracks in a critical part.As of last Thursday, the company had inspected more than 11-hundred of them after it was notified by operators worldwide, and found nearly 5 percent of them had faults.For the same reason, Korea immediately halted operations of nine of the 42 planes it had inspected.Following an emergency safety inspection meeting held Wednesday the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said it plans to conduct an inspection of the airplanes in question operating in Korea.The ministry said it plans to complete the inspection of 22 out of 108 Next Generation planes by next month instead of the initial five-month period.It plans to speed up inspections of the remaining ones as well.Kim Ji-yeon, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
