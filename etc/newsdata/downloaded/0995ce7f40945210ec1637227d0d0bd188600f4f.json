It\u2019s really nice. The grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center are remarkably well-maintained, the crowd is well-dressed, the food is a lot better than it should be, the drinks are sophisticated, and the souvenir T-shirts are made with the kind of soft, luxuriant cotton that make you feel like you\u2019re being caressed by a baby goat.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of handsome tennis tournament that should make America proud. But it\u2019s an expensive ticket, and it isn\u2019t very New York gritty. You can take the subway to get there, but the U.S. Open isn\u2019t the place to come if you want to see a scrappy city rat carrying a giant slice of pizza in its mouth. Or a 20-person brawl in the stands. Or a gargantuan pothole in the middle of the court, with a family of pizza rats inside, all of them wearing Ramones T-shirts.\n\nOnce in a while, though, the New York City escapes at the Open, maybe because everyone has had a little too much Grey Goose, and the crowd gets antagonistic, like it did Sunday night, when some clowns in Arthur Ashe Stadium booed No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic after Djokovic retired with an injury in the third set of his match with Stan Wawrinka.\n\nOof. That\u2019s not good. Djokovic deserves better.\n\nBut other times, that rowdy New York energy can be wildly entertaining, almost necessary, because a player craves it and summons it like a superpower. We\u2019ve seen it in the past with Jimmy Connors (\u201cThis is what they want!\u201d he bellowed amid an epic geezer run in 1991), some of Serena Williams\u2019s matches, and right now, we\u2019re getting it with the 23-year-old up-and-comer Daniil Medvedev, who may be from Russia, but seems to be falling in love with the passion of this still noisy, belligerent town.\n\nLate last week, in a third-round match, Medvedev began to unravel. He was struggling versus the veteran Feliciano Lopez, and he began to behave poorly (\u201cI was an idiot, to be honest,\u201d Medvedev admitted later.) He rudely ripped a towel away from a ball person, which infuriated the crowd. Then he flipped a middle finger in the air, which the nearby TV cameras caught.\n\nI will argue that a middle finger is basically a term of endearment in New York, deployed liberally over the course of a routine city day, but when the crowd saw that, it was really on. Medvedev was booed the rest of the night: loud, lusty, unafraid boos, the kind they unleash up in the Bronx for the yokels from Boston.\n\nMedvedev wound up winning the match, and then he made an unexpected move\u2014what is known in pro wrestling as a \u201cheel turn.\u201d In his on-court interview, instead of apologizing for his misbehavior, Medvedev went right back at the crowd and basked in all their animosity.\n\n\u201cThank you all, guys,\u201d he said, with a grin. \u201cYour energy tonight [gave] me the win. If you were not here, guys, I would probably have lost the match\u2026I want all of you to know, when you sleep tonight, I won because of you.\u201d\n\nThe on-court interviewer tried to get things back on a track, pointing out that Medvedev, the fifth seed here, is amid a breakout season, which included a recent tournament triumph in Cincinnati.\n\nDaniil Medvedev has made a \u2018heel turn\u2019 at this U.S. Open.

He kept trolling the boo-birds.\n\n\u201cThe energy you\u2019re giving me right now guys, I think it will be enough for my five next matches. The more you do this, the more I will win. For you guys. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAnd then he comically raised his arms in the air, as if to embrace all the hatred New York could unleash.\n\nIt was an amusing piece of showmanship. I should be clear that Medvedev is doing this with a bit of a wink\u2014he\u2019s one of the best young players on the planet; he doesn\u2019t need to be a villain to get attention. But this part is working for him here, so he\u2019s sticking to it. Medvedev reprised the heel routine Sunday night after his fourth-round victory over Dominik Koepfer.\n\n\u201cYou guys, being against me, you gave me so much energy to win. Thank you!\u201d Medvedev said, raising his arms once more.\n\nI\u2019m enjoying it\u2014and I think I\u2019m not alone. Tennis fans can see that Medvedev is in on the joke, that he understands the town and loves the New York City chaos. He was fined $9,000 for his Friday behavior and he\u2019s acknowledged that his on-court demeanor needs to improve\u2014\u201cI need to be a better person on the court\u201d\u2014but he is giving this tennis something it needs, which is some occasionally raffish attitude.\n\nI know, I know: We\u2019ve been down this road with numerous players, including Nick Kyrgios, sometimes regrettably. None of this is to defend tennis boorishness; or ignore the undeniable double standard when it comes to men and women\u2019s players; or deny the far greater value of civility and sportsmanship.\n\nNothing at this tournament has been better than the scene after the Naomi Osaka-Coco Gauff match, when the 21-year-old Osaka consoled Gauff, and shared the post-match spotlight with her vanquished 15-year-old opponent. It was the kind of moment that encapsulates what tennis can be, and demonstrated how singular both Osaka and Gauff are.\n\nGrace goes a long way in sports. But the U.S. Open is in New York City, and it can only be so genteel. Daniil Medvedev\u2014who will play Wawrinka in the quarters Tuesday\u2014is a delight, because he appreciates the madness, good and bad, that a loud town still offers. He\u2019s not a tennis villain. He gets it. As an old man once said, this is what we want.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is Daniil Medvedev giving tennis something it needs, which is some occasionally raffish attitude?
