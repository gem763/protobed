The results are both expected in regards to climate change and cannabis, but surprisingly traditional when it comes to careers and relationships.\n\nHighlights of the survey below, but as Business Insider notes, \u201cThe selection process for the bank\u2019s internship is considered to be among the most rigorous in the finance world \u2014 this particular crop of Gen Z-ers is thus likely to be more educated, performance-driven and competitive than the average in that generation.\u201d\n\n80 percent believe their personal data isn\u2019t secure, but half of them spend four or more hours on-screen per day\n\nThey\u2019ll buy into brands, but only 4 percent of respondents said their purchasing loyalty lies with influencers\n\n71 percent prefer print over digital when it comes to reading (most-read book: Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman)\n\nWhen traveling, they prefer hotels over Airbnb-like services by over a 2:1 ratio\n\nFor work, interns care far more about what they do day-to-day, who they work with and how to advance than working in a cool/fun place\n\n60 percent expect to start a business\n\nOver 90 percent expect to become homeowners, get married and raise children\n\n85 percent favor cannabis for medical use, and 59 percent of U.S. respondents favor legalization for recreational use\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about politics: They\u2019re pro carbon tax (83 percent), pro new referendum on Brexit (72 percent) and only 1 percent of respondents said they\u2019re most likely to trust politicians (the same amount as celebrities)\n\nWhile they\u2019re worried about climate change, the interns feel artificial intelligence will have the most profound impact on the planet in the next decade\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
