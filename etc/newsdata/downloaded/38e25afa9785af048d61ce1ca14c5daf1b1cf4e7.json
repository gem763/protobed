But Mike Wilson, the chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said the recent rally on trade hopes would end in disappointment.\n\nWilson argues he's seen this movie before and that it ends with a big market sell-off. That's what happened in December, when the two sides announced a trade truce that almost immediately unraveled, stalling a rally for stocks.\n\nSoon after, global stocks plunged as investors feared a recession was imminent. Wilson said a similar downturn is on the way, though he added that it wouldn't be quite as bad as December's sell-off because interest rates have decreased, helping to buoy the relative appeal of equities.\n\nWilson has been consistently bearish on stocks over the past few years and believes that a recession is on the way. He said a truce in the trade war didn't remove any obstacles to further economic growth.\n\n\"We fail to see any meaningful impact on the real economy in the near term,\" Wilson wrote in a recent client note. \"Without a significant rollback of existing tariffs, we don't see how a 'mini-deal' will change the currently negative trajectory of growth in both the economy and earnings.\"\n\nIt's not clear if last year's pattern is repeating itself, but just a few days after the \"phase-one\" deal was announced, it already looks like the partial agreement that was announced isn't really finished.\n\nWilson goes further, saying that if the recent rally is sustained, it might start a period of volatility and shifting market leadership that dims the outlook for the market.\n\nThe biggest winners on Friday, he said, were cyclical and short-term momentum stocks, which investors have been neglecting. Wilson said that hurt the relative performance of a lot of funds, and if they were forced to adjust to changes in market leadership, they would hesitate to buy.\n\n\"If such a pattern persists, it could be quite painful to many active and passive equity strategies, which ultimately will weigh on risk taking,\" he said.\n\nRead more: SOCGEN: A recession is coming soon, but these 3 trades can help investors dominate when it hits \u2014 and avoid the worst of the damage\n\nIt's not just the trade war\n\nWilson wrote that companies have been quick to blame the trade war for all of their shortcomings but that their shaky earnings and sales were often caused by a slowdown in the broader economy. If there's a lasting truce, the truth will come out, and that will affect stock prices.\n\nCapital spending by US companies is in a slump, he said, and after companies filled their inventories last year, he expected them to cut back on orders and potentially start canceling them. In another concerning development, Wilson said, peace in the trade war might push companies to start cutting jobs.\n\n\"If business does not pick up, there may be less apprehension to make the harder decision on head count,\" he said. \"Many of our industry analysts have been telling us they expect 'restructuring' announcements to become more prevalent during the fourth quarter as companies decide to flush this year's results in hopes of saving next year's.\"\n\nUltimately, Wilson said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act started an economic boom that has to end in a bust, as those tax cuts were enacted at a time when the economy was already gaining strength. He doesn't think anything can stop that cycle at this point.\n\n\"The tax cuts then created excesses that would ultimately need to be wrung out,\" he said.", "description": "Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist says the market is at risk for another 2018-style sell-off after it rallied on hopes of a trade truce.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ab4eb3098b3b52c008b45e6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
