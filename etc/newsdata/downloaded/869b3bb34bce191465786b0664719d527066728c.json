The claims are familiar. Corporations are not paying their fair share of the tax burden. They hide money in tax havens. Loopholes allow the biggest and most powerful to avoid paying income taxes at the full rate.\n\nThe FAANGs \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are digging their techy incisors into the economy and ripping out dinosaur profits without paying what they should be paying. Populist politicians in Canada, the United States, France and elsewhere see corporations as bloated, easy-to-tax targets.\n\nOver at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, bureaucrats from member countries \u2014 including Canada \u2014 are co-operating in the development of a new corporate tax system that would allow member governments to impose new taxes that would allegedly close down the loopholes and the corporate trickery that large corporations now deploy. In a new report this week, the OECD outlined how it might go about taxing the FAANGs, along with distributors of a range of internationally traded products \u2014 autos, maybe, or luxury watches and other baubles of the wealthy. The OECD plan, too weird and complicated to even begin to fully explain, proposes that profits and sales will be allocated internationally, and then taxed nationally at some agreed rate.\n\nThe plan fits in with the general idea that the level of corporate taxation is way too low. Corporate income tax rates have fallen from the 50 per cent range to the 30 per cent range in recent decades, a trend the OECD tax collectors see as a bad thing. Some business groups apparently support the OECD effort, mostly because a global tax system might at least simplify international corporate taxation and avoid global tax chaos.\n\nBut enough of that. Let\u2019s move on to the subject in the headline: End corporate taxes! Free the FAANGS! The idea is admittedly unrealistic in a political environment drenched with talk of inequality and greedy tech billionaires. But here\u2019s the kicker. Eliminating corporate income taxes would improve labour conditions, increase wages, stimulate growth and create jobs.\n\nCorporations do not pay taxes. Within a corporation, a tax is a cost of doing business. As with all costs, there is a constant effort to keep taxes as low as possible and use the money for investments in new projects, to improve quality and service, compete in the market, and maintain profits for shareholders. When the tax cost goes up, the corporate executives have only two options: pass on the cost to customers and workers, or cut back on investments.\n\nAcademic economic literature has highlighted the perversity of corporate income taxes for decades, including work by Nobel winners Milton Friedman and William Vickrey.\n\nVickrey, a 1996 Nobelist, saw the populist appeal of corporate exaction as a barrier to reform. The prospect of elimination \u201cseems dim,\u201d he wrote, especially given \u201cthe popularity of the corporate income tax as the tax nobody pays (and indeed it can be argued that the tax is not, in fact, paid by any of the current generation, but by future generations of wage earners whose productivity will be lowered by absence of the equipment with which to work that is not installed currently because of the tax).\u201d\n\nMore recently, economists associated with The School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary identified how corporate taxes cut into wages and employment. \u201cEvidence is mounting that corporate taxes are indeed borne to a significant extent by labour through lower wages,\u201d said one paper.\n\nA European tax consultant called the OECD tax-equalization exercise \u201ca political dead end\u201d and urged the EU to get rid of the corporate income tax. \u201cIf Europe would decide to abolish Corporate Income Tax this would lead to a true level playing field. There\u2019s no need for companies to implement complex tax structures. They can set up activities in countries purely on business reasons, not driven by tax. This will lead to more investments in Europe and therefore to more employment.\u201d Economist Laurence Kotlikoff in 2014 estimated that eliminating corporate income taxes in the U.S. would produce \u201crapid and dramatic increases in American investment, output and real wages, making the tax cut self-financing to a significant extent.\u201d\n\nMany columnists \u2014 esteemed and knowledgeable sources of information \u2014 have long advocated eliminating corporate income taxes. The Washington Post\u2019s Megan McArdle last year suggested that the best corporate tax rate is zero. A decade earlier, McArdle\u2019s column in The Atlantic outlined why corporate income taxes should be eliminated. One good point: \u201cWithout the corporate income tax, a lot of incentive for lobbying would go away.\u201d\n\nMy column today is not an attempt to make the full case for zero corporate income tax. It\u2019s a picket sign to draw attention to a better approach to corporate taxation: \u201cAbolish corporate income tax!\u201d\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Corporate income taxes are job killers; its costs are paid by workers and customers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/agettyimages-1161247075-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
