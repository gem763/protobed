This, she clarified, was her mother. Not whoever ESPN misidentified in the crowd during Game 4.\n\nTogether, they celebrated. Months earlier, Meesseman\u2019s mom, Sonja Tankrey, told her daughter that if the Washington Mystics were to make the WNBA Finals, she would be there. She delivered, making the trip from her native Belgium to be in attendance for the whole series.\n\nAnd on this night, when the Mystics won their first-ever championship in an 89-78 victory, when Meesseman sealed her Finals MVP with 22 points off the bench, the trek had all been worth it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad I was here,\u201d Tankrey said.\n\n\u201cI wish my whole family was here, but I\u2019m glad she was here so I could share it,\u201d Meesseman said, \u201cbecause basketball life is pretty lonely. The fact she was here, in one of the biggest moments of my life, the biggest achievements, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nAt 26 years old, Meesseman is used to playing basketball all over the world. She\u2019s played in professional leagues in Belgium, France, Russia and the States. It can be a taxing journey, and in 2018, Meesseman took an entire season off from the WNBA in order to rest, and to focus on training with her national team.\n\nMeesseman doesn\u2019t regret the decision. Even after Thursday\u2019s Game 5 win, she told reporters she needed the break. She got to stay home, never thinking \u201cwhat if?\u201d \u2014 even as Washington was swept last year in the finals against the Seattle Storm.\n\nThe Mystics, though, could have desperately used her, which is why her return this season has proved to be so vital. When she returned, coach Mike Thibault brought her off the bench as the Mystics were better suited with Elena Delle Donne in the starting lineup.\n\nBut Meesseman never blinked at the role, said friend and Belgium teammate Ann Wauters. Wauters, who flew from Belgium to watch the final two games of the series in person, said that\u2019s Meesseman\u2019s personality.\n\n\u201cShe does whatever the team needs her to do,\u201d Wauters said.\n\nIt was fitting Meesseman was the player who earned the series\u2019 MVP award. When Thibault was first hired to run the Mystics in 2013, one of his first draft choices happened to be a lanky 6-foot-4, 19-year-old from Belgium. Meesseman\u2019s growth correlated over with Washington\u2019s over the years, as it went from the league\u2019s worst to now champions.\n\nOn Thursday, the Mystics wouldn\u2019t have won without Meesseman. As they struggled over the first half with their shots barely falling, the Mystics got into a rhythm when Meesseman scored 11 of her 22 total points in the third.\n\nMeesseman, too, took over while star Elena Delle Donne was struggling. The 26-year-old repeatedly got the ball in the post and from there, she either took advantage of a mismatch or kicked the ball out to a teammate.\n\n\u201cThere were moments tonight that if it was a couple of years ago,\u201d guard Kristi Toliver said, \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t have wanted the ball in those moments. She wanted it.\u201d\n\nBy the fourth, Meesseman drew enough attention that gave Delle Donne room to work. The Mystics\u2019 regular-season MVP finished with 21 points on 8 of 16 shooting, and went 5 of 6 in the fourth. That, in part, was because of Meesseman making the right plays.\n\nAll year, Thibault dubbed her as the \u201cmissing piece,\u201d which he said was done with the intention of putting pressure on her. Asked about the motivational tactic, Thibault said Meesseman didn\u2019t appear to be as nervous heading into Game 5 than she was the previous outing. The tactic had worked, he thought.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case at all. Meesseman said she was nervous \u2014 \u201cso nervous\u201d \u2014 before Thursday\u2019s tip-off.\n\n\u201cHoly smokes,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cShe looked more calm today.\u201d\n\nBy nature, Meesseman is an introvert. Inside the Mystics\u2019 locker room, Meesseman keeps a photo of her and teammate LaToya Sanders that is taped over their lockers. The picture was hung for a few reasons, mostly as an inside joke to annoy the rest of the room.\n\nBut the two are also the introverts on the team, Meesseman said.\n\nSanders said she isn\u2019t surprised by Meesseman\u2019s success. This isn\u2019t the first title they\u2019ve won together, also winning the EuroLeague championship two years ago.\n\nFor that series, Meesseman was also named the Finals MVP. Sanders laughed, adding they needed to keep their streak going.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s grown and has become a phenomenal player and person,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cShe carried us in that fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
