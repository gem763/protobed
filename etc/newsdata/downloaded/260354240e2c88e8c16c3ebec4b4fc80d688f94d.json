He was met just before the line by Devin White, who delivered a monstrous hit that knocked the ball out.\n\nSafety Andrew Adams picked up the loose ball and began sprinting towards the end zone with no one between him and a go-ahead touchdown, but the officials whistled the play dead, claiming that Kern had been down before the fumble occurred.\n\nAs replays would show, it was the wrong call \u2014 the ball clearly came out before Kern was down or stopped short. Unfortunately, replay couldn't help the Buccaneers, as the play had already been called dead and therefore the ball could not be advanced.\n\nBuccaneers head coach Bruce Arians was in clear disbelief on the sidelines at the officials' decision.\n\nThe Buccaneers would still take over possession but failed to score a touchdown on their drive and ultimately lost the game 27-23.\n\nOn Twitter, fans were furious with the sequence and blamed the officials for the game's outcome.\n\nIt's not the first time this season a premature whistle cost a team a game-changing touchdown.\n\nIn a Week 2 matchup between the Saints and Rams, an early whistle from the referees on a similar fumble prevented the Saints from an 89-yard touchdown return that would have given New Orleans an early 10-3 lead and could have changed the course of the game.\n\nSince the premature whistle against the Saints in Week 2, officials had tended to let plays go on in similar spots, as referees can call a play back should replays reveal a player was down. But the crew working the Buccaneers game on Sunday apparently didn't get the memo, and it cost Tampa Bay a shot at the win.\n\nLos Angeles Rams completed a brilliant double-reverse flea-flicker that confounded the Bengals for a 65-yard touchdown\n\nBill Belichick would fly coach and put veteran players in first class, and one former Patriot said it was a huge factor in how players judge head coaches\n\nBill Belichick couldn't help but smile after using an ingenious loophole to burn the clock 'without really having to do anything'\n\nAaron Rodgers called for a little-known receiver to play against the Lions, and he wound up making the biggest play\n\nA high school football player made an incredible saving tackle on a teammate who was running the wrong way and about to score for the other team", "description": "The Buccaneers are the latest in a line of teams that have grievances with NFL officiating so far this season.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db60a2fdee01969c66f4e23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
