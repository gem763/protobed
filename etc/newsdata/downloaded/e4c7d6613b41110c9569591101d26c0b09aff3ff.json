Billionaires' Row, meanwhile, has seen some record-breaking sales by billionaires.\n\nAfter spending time in both parts of the city, it was clear that the two areas represent two different faces of wealth.\n\nOn Billionaires' Row, the ultra-wealthy buy penthouses they'll rarely set foot in \u2014 all for the prestige of Central Park views\n\nBillionaires' Row, a set of eight ultra-luxury skyscrapers along the southern end of Central Park in Manhattan, has seen some of New York City's biggest home sales ever.\n\nIt includes Central Park South, New York City's most expensive street in 2019, where the median sale price is currently $9.8 million.\n\nIn 2014, Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell paid about $100 million for a penthouse in the One57 tower, which was the most expensive home ever sold in New York City at the time. And in January 2019, hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin shattered that record by purchasing a $238 million penthouse in nearby 220 Central Park South.\n\nBillionaires' Row has seen some high-profile sales to billionaires who likely won't live there full time. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nYet these record-breaking sales hide the fact that many Billionaires' Rows condos are sitting empty.\n\nThe area's wealthy buyers may rarely even set foot in their pricey apartments there. Dell, for example, lives primarily in Austin, Texas. And Griffin is based in Chicago and has made extravagant real-estate purchases in London and Miami in addition to New York.\n\nThe Billionaires' Row towers also currently have a glut of high-end inventory, with more than 40% of condos unsold, Curbed New York recently reported.\n\nAnd then there's the neighborhood to consider. Billionaires' Row's Midtown Manhattan location is a bustling business, tourism, and retail district. And as two full-time real-estate investors recently told me, the \"traffic, noise, hassle, and retail\" don't make it an area where most New Yorkers want to live.\n\nI recently toured a $58.5 million condo on Billionaires' Row, and my impression was that those who'd pay that price for such a home are paying mostly for the views and the prestige of being able to say they own a home on New York City's Billionaires' Row \u2014 even if they barely actually live there.\n\nTribeca is a vibrant, walkable neighborhood that attracts young people with its trendy nightlife and luxury fitness studios\n\nIn the recent afternoon I spent in Tribeca, I found it to be a vibrant, trendy, and walkable neighborhood full of young people and families.\n\nThe residents are affluent, with an average income of $879,000, according to Bloomberg. And many of them are celebrities, drawn in by \"paparazzi-proof\" buildings on quiet, cobblestoned streets that are within walking distance of restaurants, bars, and luxury fitness studios like Equinox and SoulCycle.\n\nTribeca is full of leafy, cobblestoned streets and trendy bars and restaurants. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nMillennials, in particular, cite walkability as a key factor when deciding where to live, and the so-called \"wellness generation is happy to spend its money on pricey gym memberships, so it's no surprise that Tribeca is a relatively young neighborhood, with 45% of the population aged between 18 and 44.\n\nWhen it comes to real estate, Tribeca is known for its loft-style low-rises that couldn't be more different from a 1,000-foot-tall Billionaires' Row skyscraper.\n\nWhile Billionaires' Row seems to rely on the traditional prestige of Central Park views and the purchases of billionaires who may rarely even live there, Tribeca's liveliness and village charm embody the younger tastes of wealth in the city.", "description": "Billionaires' Row is full of super-tall skyscrapers with empty penthouses, while Tribeca's lofts are more integrated with the trendy neighborhood.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d02616c6fc92006d15cd822?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
