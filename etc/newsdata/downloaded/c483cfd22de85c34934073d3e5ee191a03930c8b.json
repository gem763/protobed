(Image: R.B. Silva, Adriano Di Benedetto, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nSo far, Jonathan Hickman\u2019s bold re-envisioning of the X-Men\u2019s place at Marvel Comics in House and Powers of X has been exactly that: bold. It has audaciously upturned everything we ever thought we knew about them, it has plunged headlong into esoteric ideas. Last week, it wanted to remind us it is still very, very much a series about fabulously silly people in Spandex.\n\nThat delectable paradox of it all is made more paradoxical by the fact that Powers of X #4 \u2014 by Hickman, R.B. Silva, Adriano Di Benedetto, Marte Gracia, Clayton Cowles, and Tom Muller \u2014 is both perhaps the most gleefully, earnestly silly issue of the House/Powers duology so far and yet also one of its most important.\n\nOnce again spread across myriad timelines \u2014 here specifically X\u2070, the past as Moira X reveals herself to a younger Charles Xavier; X\u00b9, the present Marvel timeline; and then X\u00b3, a far-flung future where bold plans are being made with the sinister Phalanx to ensure mutantkind\u2019s ascension to a new plane of existence \u2014 Powers of X #4 offers a quick catch up on some important context.\n\nCharles, really, man: this is a bad look in 2019. (Image: R.B. Silva, Adriano Di Benedetto, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nIn X\u00b9, we see the early days of Charles exploring Krakoa before it is made into mutantkind\u2019s sovereign nation, a scene that is both intriguing and made immediately sinister by Xavier\u2019s peculiar, colonialist attire that makes his simple exploration of the island feel suddenly more imperialist.\n\nMeanwhile in X\u00b3, we start to see the unfolding of the strange pact made between the Phalanx, Nimrod, and the Librarian\u2019s people \u2014 a merging of consciousnesses that could require the sacrifice of flesh and blood to complete, even if means letting the gathered mutant library of living memories ascend.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s mainly in the X\u2070 era that Powers of X #4 gleefully plays around with its mix of the grave and the goofy. Mainly, because after myriad teases, one of the most important antagonists of this whole endeavour has been revealed: Mister Sinister. And he\u2019s very, very fabulous.\n\nThere may be many Nathaniels Essex, but they are united by a love of the fabulous. (Image: R.B. Silva, Adriano Di Benedetto, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nX\u2070\u2019s storyline in this issue is concerned primarily with set up \u2014 Charles and Magneto, now having been burdened with the knowledge of Moira\u2019s many lives, come to Nathaniel Essex with a request to switch the focus of his cloning and genetics research from both himself and humankind to archiving the totality of the Mutant Gene.\n\nA notion Essex is at first flatly against... until one of his many, many clones at Bar Sinister gleefully offs him, reveals itself as a Sinister with a mutant gene of its own, and takes its place as the lead of Essex\u2019s vast army of selves.\n\nOh, and gets a cape, because apparently the mutant gene comes with a flair for the dramatic.\n\nSinister is replaced by, well, Sinister. (Image: R.B. Silva, Adriano Di Benedetto, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nWith the deal made and Sinister\u2019s memory erased of how it all came about thanks to Charles\u2019 powers \u2014 given the order to only remember why he\u2019s categorising the X-Gene when Xavier himself commands him to \u2014 the set up for what we already know is going to be a wild path for Mister Sinister is laid.\n\nThere\u2019s an air of tragedy to it all, and of menace; we know that Sinister is going to one day betray Mutantkind after decades of creating armies of chimeric mutants to fight their way with humanity, because we\u2019ve seen the future of Powers of X in the X\u00b2 timeline, a century (give or take a few decades) beyond these events.\n\nThe sharp mood swings from each Sinister clone, from childlike delight to immediate, murderous fury, are simultaneously unsettling and comical. It is, in many ways, a coalescence of many of the ideas we\u2019ve seen laid out in this duology: a chilling alien otherness to these peculiar, othered beings, an existential ponderance of what it means to live and die (especially when you have an army of your own clones).\n\nIt invites enigma, sows distrust. Because which of these myriad Mr. Sinisters can we really trust, when they\u2019re treated with such flippant disregard by, well, themselves?\n\nYou can feel the camp just oozing off of the page. (Image: R.B. Silva, Adriano Di Benedetto, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s also a deeply, deeply silly thing to watch unfold. It\u2019s hard not to laugh, and embrace the camp of it, as Hickman\u2019s dialogue for Sinister gets hammier than an all-you-can-eat pork buffet. After all, these are over-the-top egos clashing, running around in capes and silly uniforms, sagas of superheroes and supervillains.\n\nThere is an inherent absurdity to it all, even among the drama. That has always been the joy at the core of superhero comics, and even as this duology makes brave moves and lays out heady concepts, it\u2019s nice to have it lance a bit of its own pomp and circumstance and remind us of that. Even, as an added twist, doing so with the character that is ostensibly one of the biggest threats of this an entire saga.\n\nAt the heart of it all lies Powers of X\u2019s Mister Sinister \u2014 a charming, garrulous villain who could one day doom mutantkind to sheer devastation. But not after he\u2019s reminded us to trust no one, not even yourself.", "description": "So far, Jonathan Hickman\u2019s bold re-envisioning of the X-Men\u2019s place at Marvel Comics in House and Powers of X has been exactly that: bold.
