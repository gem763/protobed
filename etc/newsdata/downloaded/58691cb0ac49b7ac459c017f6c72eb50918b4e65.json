Fewer than one in 10 patients survive past five years.\n\nChest X-rays fail to detect lung cancer in nearly a quarter of patients, a review by the University of Leeds and University of Exeter has found (file)\n\nAnd, unlike many other cancers, survival rates have hardly changed in the last 40 years.\n\nResearchers from the University of Leeds and University of Exeter have called for X-rays, which cost \u00a325 a pop, to be scrapped as the first-line test for lung cancer.\n\nThey say they should be replaced by CT scans, which cost up to \u00a3500 per scan and are far more time-consuming.\n\nCT scans use a combination of X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.\n\nNHS watchdog NICE recommends doctors order an X-ray in the first instance if they suspect lung cancer from symptoms such as a persistent cough.\n\nThe scientists made the recommendation after analysing 21 previous studies which involved more than 1,000 patients.\n\nThey found that X-rays spotted the cancers between 77 and 80 per cent of the time.\n\nWriting in the British Journal of General Practice, the authors said: 'X-ray has been with us for a long time.\n\n'But surprisingly, there has been very little research into how accurate it is for diagnosing lung cancer.\n\n'If chest X-ray were a novel technology, it is debatable whether the available evidence would be deemed sufficient to support its implementation as a diagnostic test for lung cancer.'\n\nThey added: 'Our lung cancer outcomes still lag behind other high income countries, with less patients diagnosed at early stages of the illness.\n\n'There are likely to be many reasons for this, but this research suggests that one factor could be our reliance on chest X-ray, compared to other countries that make more use of tests like computed tomography scans.'\n\nDr Alison Cook, chair of The Taskforce for Lung Health at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Late and inaccurate diagnosis is a big problem for the treatment of lung cancer.\n\n'This study suggests reliance on chest X-rays may be part of the reason for the UK's poor lung cancer survival rates compared with similar European countries.\n\n'Recent research has also suggested we have far fewer CT scanners compared with the rest of Europe and far fewer radiologists to operate them.\n\n'That's why the Taskforce for Lung Health wants to see the right level of investment in diagnostic tools such as CT scanners \u2013 so we can at least match the levels seen in Europe.\n\n'We also need significant investment and planning to recruit, train and retain the radiologists who will operate them.'", "description": "Researchers from the University of Leeds and University of Exeter have called for X-rays, which cost \u00a325 a pop, to be scrapped as the first-line test for lung cancer (file)", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20026240-0-image-a-6_1571732749370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
