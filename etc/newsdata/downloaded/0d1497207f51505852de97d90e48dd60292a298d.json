It\u2019s such a beast that show. I\u2019ve worked on big shows like Big Brother and X Factor but the fans of Strictly are on it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a story this morning that said me and Zoe had a big bust up in rehearsals on Friday. A big old bust-up.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was late. I missed rehearsals. I was flying back from my big DJ gig. So its news to me.\"\n\nThe Sun on Sunday reported the feud broke out after Zoe jokingly told Rylan to \"shut up\" when he disrupted her during rehearsals on Friday.\n\nAn insider said: \"Rylan wasn't filming but he was 'performing' for the crew - telling jokes and laughing noisily. He was being very loud and Zoe snapped.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nIt was obvious Rylan took offence.\n\n\"You could cut the atmosphere with a knife...\"\n\nThey added: \"But they are both complete professionals on screen.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
