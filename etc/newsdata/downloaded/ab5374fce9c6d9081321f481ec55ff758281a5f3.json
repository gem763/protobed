They will return home to London that night.\n\nIn her speech earlier today, Meghan spoke eloquently about the importance of educating women.\n\n\"Education, I think higher education specifically is such a key element of growth, economic growth as well as personal growth and development,\" she said. \"Yesterday, I had a really interesting conversation with someone about the economy of well being and so I think so much of what we should be talking about and energies we focus on with ACU is supporting people: To know that if you don\u2019t have the support that is necessary [so] that you feel you can keep taking the next step then you\u2019re stunted in growth, right?\"\n\nMeghan announced three new gender grants for three of South Africa's universities, stressing her hope that they will empower more women to study. \"The goal here is to be able to have gender equality to be able to support women as they are working in research and higher education goals and also to be able to have workshops to convene things that are really helping people understand the importance of gender equality. True to what you said, when a woman is empowered, it changes absolutely everything in the community and starting an educational atmosphere is really a key point of that.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Duchess wore a trench dress earlier today.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h5QEhdz.x6eUoNhKWtHBKg--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xNTM3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/111d3072d31b09473599439e967bd860", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
