This is a real baby\u2019s first, though \u2014 baby\u2019s first pub!\n\nAccording to a new report from TMZ, a few Sundays ago, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle brought their then-4-month-old teeny peanut baby Archie (potentially named after a cat who got fat from eating too many grapes) to a pub called the Rose & Crown in Windsor, England, which is near their home at Frogmore Cottage. Archie is getting so big, as we know, and now he is getting so worldly, at the pub.\n\nAccording to TMZ, which has photos of the event if you\u2019d like to see, Archie kept quiet for the two hours the family (and their security detail) spent there:\n\nInstead of taking in a cricket or football (soccer) match on the telly \u2026 we\u2019re told Archie kept pretty damn quiet for the 2 hours the family was there. Not a single peep outta the little guy \u2014 even when Mom changed his nappy, (that\u2019s what they call diapers).\n\n(FYI \u2014 that\u2019s what they call diapers.) They were reportedly left mostly to themselves by the other patrons. That\u2019s nice. Did Prince Harry close any of his own car doors while he was at the pub, you must be wondering? TMZ does not specify, but if we know Prince Harry \u2014 and I think we do \u2014 the answer is likely an unfortunate yes.", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly took their baby \u2014 who did NOT drink \u2014 out for a pint and dinner near their home.", "authors": ["Kelly Conaboy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/18-meghan-markle-baby-archie-prince-harry.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
