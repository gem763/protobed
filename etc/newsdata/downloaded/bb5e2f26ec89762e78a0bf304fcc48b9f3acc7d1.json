Best comedy shows on Netflix 1/10 Elder Millenial, Iliza Shlesinger If you didn\u2019t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes. Standout line: \u201cThere\u2019s no secret [to meeting your future spouse], just so we\u2019re clear. Don\u2019t buy the books, don\u2019t buy the hype. There\u2019s no secret, OK? I\u2019m gonna be 35 when I get married. If there was a secret, I would have f****** used it. There\u2019s no secret. There\u2019s no special magic to it. I\u2019m never going to be like, \u2018GATHER ROUND, LADIES! Off the 405, lies a toad hole. You must go to it.\u2019\u201d Netflix 2/10 Nanette, Hannah Gadsby In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special \u2013 and indeed it\u2019s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she\u2019s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she\u2019s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania. Standout line: \u201cI have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it's humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.\u201d Netflix 3/10 Hard Knock Wife, Ali Wong If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you\u2019re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she\u2019s not sorry?) are gold. Standout line: \u201cNow, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he\u2019s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money\u2026 is the kind of man that doesn\u2019t like free money.\u201d Netflix 4/10 Relatable, Ellen DeGeneres After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage \u2013 and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she\u2019s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences \u2013 including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood \u2013 and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat. Standout line: [On losing her sitcom, then struggling to sell a talk-show to TV executives after coming out as a lesbian:] \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t want to buy it, because no one thought they\u2019d watch. There was this one station manager that said, and this is a quote: \u2018No one\u2019s going to watch it. No one\u2019s going to watch a lesbian during the day.\u2019 And I said \u2018Well, they weren\u2019t watching me at night. What time of day is good for a lesbian?\u2019\u201d Netflix 5/10 Son of Patricia, Trevor Noah Trevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it\u2019s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes. Standout Line: [Having established Americans\u2019 love for tacos]: \u201cWe\u2019re living through a time when we are all learning about the presidency at the same time as the president. That\u2019s never happened. How wild is that concept? You wake up every day reading the news, and you\u2019re like \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t know that.\u2019 And somewhere, at that exact same moment, he\u2019s reading the same news, going, \u2018Wow, me too.\u2019\" Netflix 6/10 Glitter Room, Katherine Ryan Katherine Ryan\u2019s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through. Standout line: [About a romantic partner:] \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, I need to be with someone who makes me a priority. And I suppose, because you have a child, I will never be your first priority. I shall always be second.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Hah! Second? Oh\u2026 no.\u2019\u201d Netflix 7/10 Weirdo, Donald Glover Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community \u2013 and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man. Standout line: \u201cI lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base \u2013 we\u2019ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.\u2019\u201d Comedy Central / Netflix 8/10 Not Normal, Wanda Sykes There\u2019s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny \u2013 and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd. Standout line: \u201cIn the Mueller investigation, how does [Trump] not know that he\u2019s Individual Number one? Come on. Everybody who\u2019s been indicted or going to jail\u2026 Papadopoulos, Gates, Flynn, Manafort\u2026 It all says in the Mueller report that they co-conspired with Individual Number One. Motherf*****, that\u2019s you! If everybody you come in direct contact with gets herpes, wouldn\u2019t you be like, [confused face] \u2018Am I giving everybody herpes?\u2019\u201d Netflix 9/10 Growing, Amy Schumer Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it\u2019s no surprise she discussed pregnancy \u2013 and the overall business of existing in a female body \u2013 with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. Standout line: \u201cIt\u2019s a new invention called THINX. They\u2019re just this underwear that you just bleed into [during your period]. Which I guess\u2026 makes me a f****** inventor. Who knew? Should I go on Shark Tank?\u201d Netflix 10/10 Live Shows, Daniel Sloss This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the \u201cfish out of water\u201d archetype by delivering his take on the US \u2013 and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and \u2013 yes \u2013 paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off. Standout line: \u201cAs a parent \u2013 no, I\u2019m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I\u2019m white, middle-class and male, and that\u2019s what my people do.\u201d Netflix 1/10 Elder Millenial, Iliza Shlesinger If you didn\u2019t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.
