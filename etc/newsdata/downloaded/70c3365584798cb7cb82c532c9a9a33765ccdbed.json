She is said to have lived in a house with her husband and three children which they had obtained after Islamic State fighters had killed its former occupants.\n\nThe young girl kept as a slave was a member of the Yazidi minority, who are often kept as sex slaves to be raped and tortured by Islamic State fighters.\n\nJihadist Notre Dame Terror Plotters Get up to 30 Years in Prison https://t.co/D76DOYAKNJ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 16, 2019\n\nWhile the trial was closed to the media due to the charges having occurred when Sarah O. was a minor, Gian Aldonani from the Central Council of the Yazidis was present in the chamber.\n\nSpeaking about the Yazidis, Aldonani said: \u201cThey have been tormented, tortured, humiliated, raped. ISIS women were often crueller than men. Jealousy plays a role here.\u201d\n\nAhmet S., 51, and 48-year-old Perihan S., the inlaws of Sarah O., have also been brought up on charges. A total of 33 witnesses have been called in the case which is expected to last until December.\n\nSarah O. is also said to have divorced her jihadist husband.\n\nReport: \u2018British\u2019 ISIS Bride Was Cruel Sharia Enforcer, Not \u2018Housewife\u2019 https://t.co/RYkZeLH8dI \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 14, 2019\n\nThe start of the trial comes just days after three female Islamic State sympathisers in France were convicted of plotting to blow up the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris in 2016. The two main suspects were sentenced to 25 and 30 years in prison.\n\nReturning female Islamic State members like Sarah O., have been a contentious subject in various European countries.\n\nSome, like Denmark, have stripped the citizenship of Islamic States fighters. Others, like Sweden, have refused to take such measures despite calls from experts not to allow jihadist women back into the country.\n\nISIS Bride Vows Son 'Will Grow Up to Be a Jihadist' as Crumbling Caliphate Evacuated https://t.co/eO75y6pRU9 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 23, 2019", "description": "A female Islamic State member on trial in Germany is accused of keeping two women and a young girl as slaves in Syria.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181381405-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
