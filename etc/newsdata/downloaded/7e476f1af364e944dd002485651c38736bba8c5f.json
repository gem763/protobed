Country risk, which soared to its highest level in more than a decade last month, also fell.\n\nTraders said the central bank intervened to support the peso in the afternoon by selling dollars from its reserves. The bank, which declined to comment, has intervened in the past, selling nearly a billion dollars in the second half of last week alone.\n\nThe currency rebound gives some relief to Macri, after a shock primary election battering last month sparked a sharp crash in the country\u2019s bonds, equities and the peso, which lost around 26% of its value against the greenback in August alone.\n\nArgentina's S&P Merval stock index .MERV, however, took a hit in afternoon trading, closing down 11.9% at a two-year low in a slide that local analysts attributed to global trade jitters.\n\n\u201cAll the markets are in the red and a weakened country like Argentina, with a complicated political situation, gets hits even more,\u201d said Hector Scasserra, director of local brokerage firm Arpenta Sociedad de Bolsa.\n\nIn Europe, the pounding of Argentina\u2019s bonds also eased after they had fallen to record lows on Monday, while there were tentative gains in some foreign-traded bank shares.\n\nRatings agency Fitch upgraded Argentina\u2019s long-term issuer debt rating to \u201cCC\u201d or just barely above default from \u201crestricted default\u201d saying the new rating reflects their view that \u201ca further default or debt restructuring of some kind is probable.\u201d\n\nFrankfurt-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Grupo Financiero Galicia (GGALyb.F) were up 0.6% after having tumbled 7.7.% on Monday while Banco Macro SA\u2019s (BMA.N) ADRs fell over 6% in New York, where markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.\n\nPeople are reflected in an electronic board that shows currency exchange, in Buenos Aires, Argentina September 3, 2019.

Following a fall on Monday, it has now diverged from the official rate by the largest margin since 2015, a sign of tension over pricing of the currency.\n\nSTILL AN EMERGING MARKET\n\nIndex provider MSCI said it was closely monitoring developments in Argentina but that the country\u2019s \u201cemerging market\u201d status for the purpose of MSCI indexes remained valid for now as MSCI Argentina only held foreign-listed shares.\n\nArgentina was included in the emerging markets index in May, potentially boosting inflows to the eight stocks that were added.\n\nAny reclassification of Argentina in the widely followed indexes would first require a public consultation from MSCI.\n\nOn Sunday, the government authorized the central bank to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso. The currency controls were a 180-degree turn for Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015.\n\nIt was the government\u2019s latest attempt to stabilise the peso, which has lost around 20% of its value since opposition presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez emerged as the clear front-runner in the Aug. 11 primary election.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government also said in a decree published in the country\u2019s official gazette that it would unilaterally hike the minimum wage by 35% over the next few months. Argentina\u2019s 12-month inflation is running at close to 55%.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nFernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, are considered a riskier prospect by investors, who fear Argentina could return to the interventionist policies of her former government.\n\nOn Monday, central bank president Guido Sandleris called Argentina\u2019s financial system \u201cstrong\u201d and said the bank would adhere to its strict monetary policy, despite the currency restrictions.\n\nSandleris, speaking at a news conference, said the bank was in talks with the International Monetary Fund to \u201credefine\u201d the monetary goals for September under its $57 billion financing agreement.", "description": "Argentina's peso surged on Tuesday, pumped up by Wall Street traders cheering President Mauricio Macri's capital controls that are aimed at protecting the beleaguered currency.", "authors": ["Cassandra Garrison", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425868350&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821U9"}
