Photo: Scott Angelheart/NBC\n\nIn April, it was announced that Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh would be joining the late-night NBC family, taking over Carson Daly\u2019s 1:35 a.m. time slot. Singh then went on her late-night big brothers\u2019 shows to pitch herself to the NBC viewing audience: She\u2019s going to be youthful, she\u2019s going to be a proud bisexual woman of color, and she\u2019s going to have very cute suits. And she kept all her campaign promises in her first episode last night. The show started with a rap about being a woman of color in late night \u2014 in which she bragged about being the only woman in late night with control of the thermostat, as well as boasting that she\u2019ll offer paid parental leave for staffers of any gender. But, you know, in a gangsta way.\n\nAlready, A Little Late With Lilly Singh is outperforming Last Call on YouTube, which makes sense since it\u2019s essentially Singh\u2019s home court. Following the premiere episode, Vulture spoke to A Little Late head writer and Late Late Show With James Corden alum Sean O\u2019Connor about Singh\u2019s endless energy, staying away from Trump, and deprogramming the part of himself that wants to roast the Kardashians.\n\nFrom the way the show is rolling out, it seems like it\u2019s almost as important that it work as stand-alone YouTube clips as it does as a show on NBC at 1:35 a.m. Does that change anything in the writers\u2019 room?\n\nNot really. In a way, it feels kind of similar to how it felt at Corden. We put an emphasis on the next day on YouTube, a little bit, in losing the topicality. When it comes to actual desk pieces or even monologues, it is a bit harder. We are essentially, as you\u2019ll come to see, writing five-to-seven-minute stand-up sets about one topic.\n\nThat\u2019s close to some of the videos Lilly would do on her channel, besides the raps and the vlogs.\n\nExactly. We had a pretty steadfast rule of \u201cno politics\u201d because of this block shooting schedule that we have. It felt important to me to take what she does on her channel and make that the first thing you see every night. So it\u2019s a perfect combination of all the things that got her here, in a way. It\u2019s vlog, sketch, interviews.\n\nWhat makes you excited about working with Lilly?\n\nHonestly, she\u2019s the most positive person I\u2019ve ever worked with, and I don\u2019t just mean from a talent standpoint. The level of positivity is something I\u2019ve never experienced in comedy. It\u2019s beyond bizarre. Normally, on every job I\u2019ve had, you go home and you feel kind of jaded about something in the day. And I have not felt that there, because of the positivity. It turns out, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a normal life until now.\n\nShe\u2019s also bringing in a unique tool set. How involved is the writing staff with stuff like the raps?\n\nOn the rap that was in the premiere, it was a combination of two people\u2019s pitches. But Lilly had her friend produce the track, and then she wrote all the lyrics. Coming from the YouTube world, she\u2019s used to doing everything herself. She is very involved in the writing process, which I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever truly experienced with talent. Like, she\u2019s actually typing. Which is unheard of.\n\nAs opposed to having the writer\u2019s assistant take dictation?\n\nYes. Most of the time, you pitch things and they give their tweaks out loud. But she\u2019s actually typing behind a computer, and that\u2019s interesting to see.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t shade against anyone you\u2019ve worked with before. It\u2019s just that hosting is an incredibly busy job.\n\nTruly. Especially at the launch of a show. It\u2019s crazy that the most important part of your job is to not be there, because you\u2019re promoting the show. We taped ten shows last week, and she also did 12 interviews around that schedule, while also doing her passes on monologues.\n\nAnd keeping up the vlog schedule.\n\nI think she has a different scale of time than the rest of us. She is the hardest worker I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve been staying up till 11 because of how many things we\u2019re shooting in advance, and she\u2019s there as late or later.\n\nI want to talk about Rainn Wilson\u2019s White Noise Machine. How did Rainn come into the guest sphere?\n\nFor the first show, we go out to a bunch of talent, and he was interested. You wind up pitching like ten things, and we narrow that down to three. And we let Rainn pick which he wants to do of that three.\n\nHow did the list of white noises come together?\n\nIt was fun. It was written by Jonathan Giles and Jen Burden. It was interesting because Jonathan is a person of color and Jen is a white woman. And it was fun to see what white people think their noises are and what Jonathan thought our noises were. I think that\u2019s where you got the harder jokes, like the police siren and the vacation braids. Although I think Lilly might have pitched the vacation braids.\n\nSo the noises that white people pitch for themselves are cuter?\n\nThat\u2019s where you might get the farm-to-table restaurant.\n\nYou said earlier that there\u2019s a \u201cno politics\u201d rule on the show, and Lilly rapped that there\u2019d be no Trump talk either. Is that just to keep the content evergreen, or are there other motivations?\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect storm of a few things. The timeliness, but also \u2014 being the last show that airs, every joke has been made, whether it\u2019s been on Twitter all day or on the 25 other late-night shows. And I feel like Lilly wants to talk about things that only she can talk about.\n\nIt would also be hard to stay the most positive person alive if you had to weigh in on the news today.\n\nAbsolutely. The thing that I\u2019ve liked about the monologues we\u2019ve taped already is that they\u2019ve had edgier topics, and she\u2019s putting all of that through her point of view, but she still remains positive. So maybe in the future we\u2019ll take politics to task \u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever do that, actually.\n\nWhat monologues have you been taping?\n\nTonight [Tuesday]\u2019s monologue is exciting. It talks about something that I don\u2019t think any late-night host has ever talked about: how Indian culture suppresses sex from their children. It\u2019s this great deep dive into all of the thoughts Lilly had about sex based on how much she didn\u2019t learn from her parents. It\u2019s a very interesting monologue, but it has pretty hard jokes in it.\n\nNot to overgeneralize, but I\u2019m guessing that wasn\u2019t a topic already near and dear to your heart.\n\nNo. It\u2019s wonderful Lilly does this. This is how in-the-shit she is. With something like that topic, she makes us a ten- to 12-minute voice memo at like one in the morning, to write based on her point of view. She lays out every thought she has on a topic, which is the most helpful. She\u2019s basically guiding us and giving us a road map before we even put pen to paper.\n\nThat way, when you\u2019re pitching jokes, it\u2019s not like playing Battleship.\n\nExactly. We\u2019re not just guessing where she\u2019s coming from on this.\n\nBut in a way, we shared some commonality. Being an Irish Catholic boy raised in New Jersey, my parents never had a sex talk with me. I could relate.\n\nGoing further on that, what has it been like heading a room that is majority women and majority people of color?\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s great! Everyone has this very distinct point of view, and I\u2019m learning a lot, which I like. The women writers were soaring immediately, but myself and our two male writers had a bit of a learning curve. We\u2019ve all gotten together because we\u2019ve had ten weeks now, but it\u2019s been this great process where there isn\u2019t a point of view left on the sidelines.\n\nHow would you describe that learning curve, personally?\n\nIt comes down to, like, little phrasings of what you talk about. We do a monologue about detox teas. My instinct is to skewer the people selling those teas on Instagram, but I feel like Lilly is all about girl love. So we\u2019re not into roasting the people who are selling it, we\u2019re taking down the corporation [making it]. When you\u2019re in a male-dominated world, you\u2019re like, \u201cLet\u2019s make Kardashian jokes!\u201d But this is not that show. And I like that.\n\nWhat can we expect from the show in the immediate future?\n\nWe have the prime-time special on Wednesday. Launching a show is the most adrenaline-pumping thing in the world, but when you add a prime-time special that\u2019s going to air that same week, it gives you double that. It\u2019s stressful, but it\u2019s also fun to arrange the best things twice. I think what I love is organization. I like putting together a show a lot.", "description": "An interview with Sean O\u2019Connor, the head writer for NBC\u2019s new late-night show \u2018A Little Late with Lilly Singh,\u2019 about the show and working with its YouTuber host.", "authors": ["Bethy Squires"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-lily-singh-late-night-premiere.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
