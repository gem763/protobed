He has retained high approval ratings for the past three years largely on fulfilling the promise of unleashing the police to kill suspects and ask questions later.\n\nThe policy has triggered condemnation from international human rights organizations and a petition against Duterte at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity.\n\nDuterte is currently in Russia on a diplomatic visit and discussed his frustration with the international community at the Valdai Forum in Sochi.\n\n\u201cSome of our partners have hurled unfair criticisms against my government about perceived excesses in our fight against drugs,\u201d Duterte told the forum, asking, \u201cIs this how friends treat each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey create rules and norms for almost everyone, and some refuse to be bound by the same. Think of the (United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea), the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and even the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weaponize human rights oblivious to its damaging consequences to the very people they seek to protect. Just look at the chaos and instability that ensued in Libya and Iraq following military interventions.\u201d\n\nDuterte appeared to be referencing America\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and China\u2019s constant, flagrant invasions of Philippine waters in contravention of the Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It is unclear which nation he was referring to when mentioning the Convention on the Rights of the Child, though climate alarmist Greta Thunberg recently used that law to sue five nations \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey \u2013 for not cutting back on pollutants enough to save humanity, according to her demand.\n\nHe noted that the Philippines has lost some contracts for defense equipment because of his use of these weapons against drug suspects without due process of law. Duterte defended his campaign against drug crime, stating, \u201cwe only seek to curb criminality that corrodes the very structure of government \u2026 Is this not something that all nations are entitled to? Is this not what democratically elected governments are mandated to do?\u201d\n\nCritics of the drug war chip away that Manila\u2019s sovereignty \u201cand \u201cthey clip our wings making it more difficult for us to effect meaningful change for our people,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of the misguided and self-serving crusades of the few. It is time that they are challenged,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe Philippine Inquirer noted Duterte went out of his way to identify America as not among the parties that he was complaining about.\n\n\u201cThe US is a close friend of the Philippines \u2013 in fact, our only treaty ally. We have deep ties with the American people, forged by shared history and nourished by common values. America certainly can offer so much more [to] the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also, the Philippine Star noted, insisted that any errors in the drug war that result in damage to national integrity are his responsibility.\n\n\u201cIf someday somebody has to be hanged, I will be happy. I will even put the noose on my neck and say \u2018go ahead\u2019 or if you want to shoot me in a firing squad, fine,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not aspire for honor. I do not aspire to be known. I\u2019m just a citizen, a worker of government and I will do what I have to do to protect the people especially the next generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a killer\u2026 I have yet to kill one human being. When I say \u2018I will kill you\u2019 that\u2019s a statement coming from the mouth,\u201d Duterte added, referring to the fact that he routinely uses the phrase \u201cI will kill you\u201d in his public remarks.\n\nDuterte has insulted foreign leaders and human rights activists on a regular basis for challenging his calls for police to eradicate drug crime by killing suspects. In 2017, following a meeting with leftist Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Duterte told reporters that he dismissed Trudeau\u2019s \u201cbullshit\u201d attempts to scold him for his drug policies.\n\n\u201c[I]t is a personal and official insult. That is why you hear me chewing down curses, epithets, nagmumura (cursing), bullshit and everything because it angers me when you are a foreigner you do not know what is happening in this country,\u201d Duterte said. \u201cI will not answer to any other bullshit, especially foreigners. Lay off.\u201d\n\nTrudeau is currently embroiled in scandal for being exposed as a blackface enthusiast, telling reporters he has worn the racist body paint so often that he did not remember every time he had done it.\n\nOn a separate occasion from his encounter with Trudeau, Duterte railed against the United Nations for questioning his human rights record.\n\n\u201cYou go and file a complaint in the United Nations. I will burn down the United Nations if you want. I will burn it down if I go to America,\u201d Duterte said in 2016.\n\nAt a separate speech, he complained that \u201cthese white people \u2026 these American blockheads \u2026 for every five Americans, three out of five are idiots, and only two are in their right minds.\u201d\n\nLast year, he referred to then-U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein as a \u201cson of a whore\u201d who had \u201ca big head, but it\u2019s empty \u2026 it cannot even sustain a nutrient for your hair to grow because his hair here is gone.\u201d Al Hussein is bald.\n\nDuterte arrived in Moscow this week for meetings with senior Russian leaders and appearances at various public events. He has referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past as his \u201cidol\u201d and \u201cfavorite leader.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte lambasted international aid groups and \"so-called friends\" who have criticized his anti-drug policies.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Rodrigo-Duterte-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
