Why not go all out to win it? You only get three opportunities (a season) if you\u2019re not in Europe.\n\n\u201cYou enter three competitions and the title probably slipped away from us on Saturday so we have the Carabao Cup and FA Cup to fight for.\n\nDean Smith wants Carabao Cup glory (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cWe want to finish as high as we can but this is a priority as well. We have a proud history in this cup, we\u2019ve won it five times, and want to continue to win it more and have days like we had in May at Wembley.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go but it was a deserved victory.\u201d\n\nEl Ghazi fired Villa ahead after 29 minutes when John Ruddy just failed to keep his low drive out.\n\nVilla dominated but were stunned when Cutrone turned in Taylor Perry\u2019s shot nine minutes after the break.\n\nIt was just the striker\u2019s second goal in 17 games since his summer arrival from AC Milan but it was cancelled out three minutes later with Elmohamady\u2019s winner.\n\nThe full-back got ahead of Bruno Jordao to stab in Henri Lansbury\u2019s near-post free-kick for his third Villa goal and first in over a year.\n\nWolves never looked like recovering but, despite defeat, boss Nuno Espirito Santo was satisfied with his young team.\n\nThe manager rested several established stars for Wolves\u2019 21st game of the season as they continue to compete in Europe and the Premier League.\n\nChem Campbell, 16, became the club\u2019s second youngest player while teenagers Dion Sanderson and Taylor Perry were given their full debuts.\n\nNuno said: \u201cIt was a tough game, Villa are a good team, we know Dean, he has good ideas and it was hard. We managed well, we stuck to our shape and we balanced ourselves. We had our moments.\n\n\u201cThe young players competed and gave everything, you have to give everything you\u2019ve got.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a building process. Since the beginning we\u2019ve tried to give competition to the young boys.\n\n\u201cWe tried to mix experience and talent. Their families should be proud, they are good lads.\u201d", "description": "Villa reached the Carabao Cup quarter-finals for the first time in seven years.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/wire-20400774-1572476062-228_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
