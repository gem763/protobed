So when her clients, a New York\u2013based couple, requested that she transform their Hamptons house into a year-round retreat, she knew exactly what direction to take. \u201cOne of them wanted a totally dark space, with inky colors and brass,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the other wasn\u2019t entirely convinced. To compromise, we used dark details \u2014 black side tables and black leather chairs, for instance \u2014 but kept the walls white.\u201d Brennen put a Jonathan Adler sofa and a Restoration Hardware coffee table in the living room, seen above, plus Clam floor lamps from MoMA, a glass Oda Pulpo floor light, and some vintage lounge chairs that overlook the pool. The art to the left of the glass door is by J\u00falio Leit\u00e3o, and the carpet is from ABC Carpet & Home.\n\nPhoto: Sean Litchfield \u201cWe used a beautiful smoked-oak cabinet front on the sink side of the kitchen and burnished brass handles on the side of the island,\u201d says Brennen. \u201cTo offset the dark cabinets \u2014 which will patina beautifully \u2014 we used a lilac marble countertop, which the client just fell in love with.\u201d The overhead pendant lights are from ABC Carpet & Home, and the oven is from AGA.\n\nPhoto: Sean Litchfield \u201cThe master bath is the opposite of the other parts of the home: We went dark on the walls and used neutral custom limestone on the floors.\u201d Restoration Hardware\u2019s bath cabinet and mirror emphasize the moody drama. The faucet fixtures are by Brizo\n\nPhoto: Sean Litchfield Though the beach is nearby, it\u2019s a luxury to have enough turf to install a pool for when the surf gets rough.
