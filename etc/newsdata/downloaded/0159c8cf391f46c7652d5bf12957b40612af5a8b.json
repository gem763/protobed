Goalie Laurent Brossoit made 29 saves.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, the Islanders took the lead on a power-play goal early in the second. Beauvillier sent a perfect pass into the crease to Bailey, who, in one motion, took the puck and flicked it past Brossoit at the 1:51 mark.\n\nNelson opened and closed the sequence that doubled the Islanders' lead fewer than three minutes later. After winning a faceoff with Blake Wheeler, Nelson controlled the puck and skated around the circle before passing to Adam Pelech. Nelson then skated across the ice and was in position to take a pass from Bailey and fire a shot past a sprawling Anthony Bitetto and into the upper corner of the net.\n\nThe Islanders went up 3-0 with 4:05 left in the period, when Scott Mayfield's slap shot from just in front of the NHL Face-Off logo ticked off the skate of Lee and fluttered past Brossoit.\n\nThe Jets got on the board with 2:54 left, when Bitetto pounced on a loose puck in the neutral zone and passed to Wheeler, who hit Laine in stride before Laine beat Greiss on the semi-breakaway.\n\nThe Islanders once again went ahead by three goals 1:25 into the third, when Beauvillier corralled his own rebound and tucked a shot past Brossoit.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Josh Bailey scored the first of the Islanders' three consecutive second-period  goals on Sunday night as host New York defeated the Winnipeg Jets 4-1 at ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
