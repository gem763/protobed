Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIn the first few days after House Democrats announced impeachment proceedings against President Trump, a series of anti-Trump conservatives published columns arguing that they were making a giant tactical error. Bret Stephens (\u201cPelosi\u2019s Bad Impeachment Call\u201d), David Brooks (\u201cYes, Trump Is Guilty, But Impeachment Is a Mistake\u201d), and George Will (\u201cThe best antidote for a bad election is a better election\u201d) all produced the same argument. Trump has done awful things, but impeachment will repel the public. Only an election can remove him.\n\nThe flaws in that argument have already become apparent. Impeachment is growing steadily more popular. A Washington Post poll finds a slim majority of Americans favor both Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office. A commanding majority, 58 versus 38 percent, support the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. The fear that Trump somehow desired impeachment has been belied by essentially all the White House reporting, which shows the president alternating between depression and raging and flailing for a strategy.\n\nThe fear that impeachment would backfire was not crazy, but almost every piece of evidence so far has vindicated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s strategy. There are several reasons why the politics of impeachment have turned in the Democrats\u2019 favor:\n\nThis isn\u2019t Russia. The anticlimactic denouement of the Russia investigation weighed heavily on the impeachment skeptics. But the political impact of the Russia probe was smothered both by its dependence on Robert Mueller, who was held back by an almost monk-like desire to escape politics by giving Trump every benefit of the doubt, and the sheer complexity of the affair. If the only important facts in the Russia story were Donald Trump negotiating for a several-hundred-million-dollar payoff from Vladimir Putin during the campaign and then lying about it, the outcry might have toppled him. But because that was just one of countless shady details, the incriminating facts were buried beneath one another.\n\nThe Ukraine scandal is much simpler. There is a lot of evidence of wrongdoing, but it all revolves around a single narrative of Trump pressuring a foreign country to investigate his domestic rivals. And the narrative is controlled by Congress, which is willing to charge the president with a high crime, not a reclusive prosecutor who has decided it is improper for him to make any such accusation.\n\nEven Republicans have trouble defending it. For all the public affirmations of support from Trump\u2019s fervent base in the party and party-controlled media, even his supporters are harboring some qualms.\n\nAnita Kumar has a revealing story quoting hard-core Trumpists \u2014 ones who stood behind him throughout the Russia scandal \u2014 expressing their belief that this time he went too far. \u201cRussia was never real,\u201d an outside Trump adviser says, \u201cUkraine is.\u201d \u201cRussia was a complete and utter fantasy. Ukraine isn\u2019t. His actions were unseemly \u2026 not a ghost like Russia,\u201d says another Republican. \u201cShould he have mentioned Biden? No. I wish he wouldn\u2019t have. \u2026 But I don\u2019t fault him as much as other people,\u201d says a third.\n\nThe story can get worse. One thing that ought to have been apparent at the outset of this scandal, but which many people missed, is that a lot of people were involved. Turning American foreign policy into an episode of The Sopranos isn\u2019t easy. You have a whole bureaucracy that\u2019s used to operating along established channels, and distorting its functions in such a gross fashion sends ripples throughout the system.\n\nThere are going to be more witnesses and more records of communication. Trump is going to keep lying and saying crazy things. It\u2019s not going to be easy to deprive the story of oxygen.\n\nThe politics can get worse, too. Republican support for Trump may be louder than the criticism. But the silence of many Republicans, not just the handful of quasi-independent voices, speaks volumes. Many Republicans are withholding judgment, perhaps criticizing impeachment as hasty, but not defending Trump\u2019s behavior or ruling out removal if more evidence emerges.\n\nGabe Sherman reports that Mitt Romney is planning to rally Republicans for impeachment in the Senate. Romney has a lot of respect in his caucus, and a lot of fame among the public. Can he get enough senators to remove Trump? Probably not. (Though \u201cprobably\u201d is a lot different than \u201cabsolutely.\u201d) But some measure of bipartisan support for impeachment is going to strengthen the message that Trump has done something seriously wrong. The lack of Democratic qualms about impeachment solidifies the message. When Democrats all say Trump has done something wrong, and Republicans are divided, people will get the message that he\u2019s probably in the wrong.\n\nThis will hurt Trump\u2019s reelection. The biggest mistake the impeachment skeptics made is their assumption that impeaching Trump are unrelated to, or at cross-purposes with, defeating him in 2020. \u201cAn election can save the country. An inside-the-Beltway political brawl will not,\u201d predicted Brooks.\n\nMost voters are locked in to one of the parties. The swing vote tends to be low-information voters with a hazy grasp of the issues. Impeachment is a signal to those voters that Trump has done something seriously wrong. It\u2019s not a magic trick that works against every president \u2014 there needs to be misconduct people can easily understand, and which the news media covers as a serious scandal. This easily qualifies.\n\nIf Trump has any political strengths, it is that he is a low-information voter himself, and grasps how the political narrative plays out in snippets of cable-news chyrons drifting across screens in bars and airports. Trump has confided to allies that impeachment \u201clooks bad on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d\n\nBecause his victory surprised so many people, Trump has a way of psyching out his opponents sometimes. There\u2019s no real political magic here. Having the news dominated by a scandal even many Republicans can\u2019t defend, with a constant drip of damning new details, is extremely unhelpful for the president.", "description": "A new poll finds 58% of Americans support the House opening an impeachment inquiry into the Ukraine scandal.
