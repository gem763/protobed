REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nThe practice \u201cis unconstitutional, and we are writing in the hope of dissuading you from engaging in it,\u201d the institute wrote to Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term congresswoman from New York who has gained a national spotlight for her championing of progressive views.\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded on Twitter that \u201cless than 20 accounts are blocked\u201d out of more than 5.2 million followers and \u201c0 are my constituents.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201charassment is not a viewpoint\u201d and said some accounts had \u201cposted fake nude photos of me & abused my comments. ... No one is entitled to abuse.\u201d\n\nShe was sued in July by former Democratic New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind for blocking him from her personal @AOC account.\n\nThe Knight Institute, which successfully sued President Donald Trump over his decision to block dozens of users on Twitter from his personal @realdonaldtrump account, argued that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s account \u201cis a \u2018public forum\u2019 within the meaning of the First Amendment\u201d guaranteeing free speech and noted that her tweets staking out political positions \u201chave made headline news.\u201d\n\nTwitter declined to comment.\n\nThe institute said Ocasio-Cortez was within her rights, however, to block Twitter users who had posted threatening speech.\n\nLawyers for Ocasio-Cortez said in an Aug. 14 letter that her Twitter account use was not equivalent to Trump\u2019s. They said she did not block Hikind because of his political views and denied she used her account to make formal announcements.\n\nOn Thursday, Hikind tweeted that he was \u201cwaiting for a single citation of an \u2018abusive\u2019 tweet of mine. Unless by abusive she means criticism that makes her feel stupid for her ignorant commentary and ideas!\u201d\n\nLast week, Trump challenged a federal appeals court decision in July that he violated the U.S. Constitution by blocking people whose views he disliked from his account.\n\nThe Republican president sought a rehearing by the full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, calling the 3-0 decision \u201cfundamentally misconceived.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department said in a court filing that if the appeals court ruling was upheld, \u201cpublic officials who address matters relating to their public office on personal accounts will run the risk that every action taken on that account will be state action subject to constitutional scrutiny.\u201d\n\nTrump has 63.7 million Twitter followers, and often uses his account to make significant announcements.\n\nThe appellate court found Trump\u2019s account bears \u201call the trappings of an official, state-run account\u201d and is \u201cone of the White House\u2019s main vehicles for conducting official business.\u201d", "description": "The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University said on Thursday it asked Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to unblock any Twitter users she has barred on the basis of their political views.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190829&t=2&i=1424097196&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7S1QJ"}
