Physical discs of your favorite shows won't become unavailable and they often come with added features like director commentary that aren't included elsewhere.\n\n\"When you have a hard copy it's a done deal,\" he said. \"You own it, and no one can take it away from you.\"\n\nREAD MORE: NBCU shared details about its upcoming Netflix competitor, Peacock, which will become the streaming home of 'The Office'\n\nKevin Murray, the social content manager at SecondSpin, a site that buys and sells pre-owned DVDs and Blu-rays, said TV shows from newer hits like \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Arrow\" to classics like \"Seinfeld\" and \"Friends\" bring in consistent business.\n\n\"TV shows are one of our top categories both in sales and in trade-ins,\" he said. \"People trade in older seasons, but they go right back out the door so quickly.\"\n\nIn addition to benefits like bonus features, Murray said DVD enthusiasts also value packaging because it puts a unique twist on their favorite content, like the \"Charmed\" box set he bought just because it was packaged as a replica of the \"Book of Shadows\" from the show.\n\nSome SecondSpin customers, who range from 30 to 50 years old on average, find DVDs easier to use than streaming services, Murray said. International customers in particular tend to favor SecondSpin over streaming, likely because not all US-based streaming services are available in other countries.\n\nMurray said streaming has not affected business at SecondSpin, but the company plans to capitalize on the reliability of discs as more streaming services launch and swap content.\n\n\"We're going to keep our eye on those TV shows to see what the interest level is and see if we can capture that over the next few months once these platforms start to launch,\" he said.", "description": "With the launch of every new streaming service, TV shows are coming and going from Netflix and others.
