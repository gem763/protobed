When Brown pulled up to Franco Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, the facility had already erected storm shutters on the windows.\n\nThen Brown looked around.\n\n\u201cThere are not too many trees here, but a lot of power lines, and he needs oxygen,\u201d Brown said, as forecasts for Hurricane Dorian\u2019s expected effects on South Florida kept changing. \u201cIf this storm is coming, I\u2019ll be back to take him to my house because I remember what happened last time, and I know my house is secure.\u201d\n\n[Capital Weather Gang: Historic Hurricane Dorian unleashing \u2018catastrophic\u2019 blow in northern Bahamas]\n\nAcross Florida, and in the days to come throughout the Southeast, relatives, state and federal officials, and nursing homes and rehabilitation centers are struggling to make decisions about when to move patients who might be vulnerable in cases of property damage or power loss. The apprehension follows a string of tragic incidents \u2014 dating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 \u2014 involving elderly or special-needs patients who were killed during hurricanes or the frantic days that can precede and follow a major storm.\n\nAfter 12 people staying at the Hollywood Hills nursing home died in 2017, Florida leaders created new regulations and storm emergency plans for assisted-living facilities, including mandating they have generators and adequate fuel to maintain a comfortable temperature for at least 96 hours after a power outage. Last week, four former staffers at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills were charged with manslaughter, accused of failing to move patients to safety quickly enough after the power went out.\n\n\n\nA woman is transported from the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills in September 2017 as patients are evacuated after a loss of air conditioning due to Hurricane Irma. (Amy Beth Bennett/AP)\n\nFlorida officials remain anxious about the safety of residents in the state\u2019s 683 nursing homes and 3,100 assisted-living centers.\n\nOn Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) noted that 120 nursing homes still had not submitted proof that they have generators, as is required by law. By Sunday afternoon, DeSantis said nursing home operators had worked throughout the weekend to make sure all nursing homes in eastern coastal communities have at least temporary generators or a plan to evacuate should they lose electricity.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be site checks, there are going to be phone calls to make sure that they have a plan to deal with folks that are in their care,\u201d said DeSantis, adding that the state will inspect nursing homes in hard-hit areas immediately after the storm to make sure they have power and adequate supplies.\n\nEfforts to prepare for Dorian, however, are complicated by continued uncertainty of its final path.\n\nThough the center of the storm is forecast to remain just off Florida\u2019s east coast, even a small shift in its track could bring high winds onshore across central and northern Florida, forecasters warn.\n\nOver the weekend in Miami, some assisted-living facilities were not taking any chances, even though it appeared the worst of the storm would track north and east of the city.\n\nAt the Sinai Plaza Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in North Miami, nurses and health-care aides spent Sunday afternoon loading patients with disabilities off a bus that was carrying evacuees from another facility closer to the ocean.\n\nFor relatives of elderly or infirm patients, preparing for a hurricane is an especially stressful time, experts said.\n\nKathryn Hyer, a professor and director of the Florida Policy Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida, said relatives and caregivers often struggle to decide whether it is better for someone to ride out the storm at home or evacuate to a location outside the storm\u2019s path.\n\nHyer has been studying the impact of hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike and Irma on vulnerable populations. She has found that, regardless of whether people evacuate or shelter in place, \u201cthe impact of a storm increases the likelihood of hospitalizations and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe death rates over 30 and 90 days increase when people are moved. With this population \u2014 some of whom are very sick \u2014 there are shocks to the system, and their fragility is taxed,\u201d Hyer noted.\n\nThe dangers facing patients come from health risks and the difficulties with moving people during urban evacuations. When Hurricane Rita threatened Houston in 2005, 24 residents of a nursing home were killed when their bus caught fire on a traffic-clogged highway.\n\n\u201cWe found you shelter in place until you can\u2019t \u2014 and that\u2019s what we tell people,\u201d Hyer said.\n\nIn Lake Worth, Fla., in Palm Beach County, where officials ordered a mandatory evacuation of low-lying coastal areas on Sunday, George Roth has spent the past few days scrambling to collect his shopping list to take care of his 95-year-old mother.\n\nJoan Roth had a stroke in July and is under 24-hour home care. George Roth, 71, is from New Jersey but decided to stay with his mother until the hurricane threat passes.\n\nRoth has collected canned food, batteries, \u201clots of water\u201d and extra gasoline.\n\n\u201cI have coolers, first aid paraphernalia, fans,\u201d he added.\n\nRoth also recently purchased an electric stair chair to get her down to ground level \u2014 there\u2019s no elevator that services her second-floor apartment.\n\n\u201cStill I worry, if we lose power, Mom will have to endure the heat and humidity,\u201d Roth said.\n\nSo, as the storm approaches, Roth is studying possible routes he could take to get to his cousins should he need to quickly relocate his mother to a safer location.\n\n\u201cWe are as ready as we can be,\u201d Roth said. \u201cEven with care helpers, it is mentally and fiscally demanding.\u201d\n\nSince Hurricane Irma, Florida has set up a robust tracking system called the Emergency Status System, which is working with state meteorologists, nursing homes and assisted-living centers to catalogue the number of beds, generators, dialysis machines and other medical equipment. They have also set up hotlines and Facebook groups for relatives who want to check in on the status of their elderly loved ones.\n\nBut the memories of Irma continue to resonate with many. Initially, that hurricane was supposed to strike the east coast of Florida, triggering widespread evacuations in south and central Florida. Irma instead skirted across the Florida Keys and struck the state\u2019s west coast, where some people from the east coast had sought refuge.\n\nMaia Magder, a 44-year-old speech pathologist from the District, recalls constantly worrying about her 73-year-old father and 77-year-old stepmother during Hurricane Irma. The couple live in a high-rise condominium building in Miami Shores, on Biscayne Bay.\n\nThey stubbornly refused to leave during Irma, until she repeatedly begged them. Now, they say won\u2019t leave for Dorian, even if the forecast storm track shifts.\n\n\u201cThey live on the top floor of a 20-story building, and every hurricane season, I worry,\u201d Magder said. \u201cI worry not so much about damage to the building \u2014 they have hurricane shutters and a generator \u2014 but because they\u2019d be stuck in a building with no AC and only stairs to get down.\u201d\n\nDespite such concerns, often from relatives scattered across the country, the operators of Florida assisted-living facilities say they are far better prepared for Dorian than they were for some past storms.\n\nKristen Knapp, a spokeswoman for the Florida Health Care Association, said facilities began preparing even before hurricane season started in June.\n\n\u201cWe have worked hard to be ready and know, for example, if a facility with 20 beds needs to move, there is another facility with 20 beds they can evacuate to and arrive to with good care,\u201d Knapp said. \u201cDuring Irma, we saw that people were moving multiple times, as the storm moved.\u201d\n\nIn Royal Palm Beach, a suburban town about 12 miles west of West Palm Beach, the manager of the Royal Palm Beach Health and Rehabilitation Center has been assuring relatives that patients are located in a \u201csafe building above flood level\u201d and with enough food and water to last a week, as well as a generator and extra medications.\n\n\u201cIt looks like they are ready,\u201d said Maria Lupe Alonzo, who was at the center on Sunday afternoon visiting her 92-year-old husband, who has Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cI feel it\u2019s a safe place.\u201d\n\nAt Franco Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Miami-Dade County, many visiting relatives also expressed confidence in facility managers, despite lingering concerns about what occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma two years ago.\n\n\u201cThey learned from that, I guarantee it,\u201d said Ella Brown, who was visiting her 94-year-old grandmother. \u201cDo you really think a nursing home is going to allow that to happen again? I don\u2019t think so, because that would be a real big mistake \u2014 their mistake.\u201d\n\nWax reported from Washington; Rozsa, a freelance journalist, reported from West Palm Beach.", "description": "After Hurricane Irma, the failure to evacuate or have backup power led to calamity at a Florida nursing home.", "authors": ["Tim Craig", "National Reporter", "Emily Wax-Thibodeaux", "National Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Social Movements.", "Lori Rozsa", "September At Pm", "Tim Craig Is A National Reporter On The America Desk.
