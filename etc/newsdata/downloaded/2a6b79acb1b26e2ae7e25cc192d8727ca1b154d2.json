He oversaw the law criminalising NGOs for helping refugees, Hungary\u2019s container camps for asylum seekers, and measures that led to the Central European University being forced to quit Budapest.\n\nHis nomination offers an early test for the incoming commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is to unveil her team on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dutch MEP Sophie in \u2019t Veld, who sits on the parliament\u2019s civil liberties and home affairs committee, told the Guardian the nomination was \u201cintended as a provocation\u201d.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, given the track record of this government and this minister, it seems purely hypothetical he will ever pass the basic test,\u201d she said referring to the EU\u2019s fundamental values on rule of law. \u201cHow can we put someone in charge who does not respect or recognise the treaties?\n\n\u201cIt is my expectation that he will get a very rough ride in parliament.\u201d\n\nEvery member state has nominated a commissioner, except the UK, which is due to leave the EU the day before the new commission takes office.\n\nEU commissioners are not meant to represent their governments, but often play an informal role, both as a back channel to the capital, and in promoting national approaches to economics and foreign policy in Brussels.\n\nTr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, who said he had had \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with Von der Leyen, was rumoured to be interested in taking charge of EU policy on enlargement or foreign policy towards neighbouring countries. But the latest speculation suggests he could be put in charge of the EU\u2019s aid budget.\n\n\u201cIf that is true, it would be a surprising, indeed highly alarming choice by Mrs von der Leyen,\u201d In \u2018t Veld said. \u201cThe portfolio of humanitarian aid includes issues like sexual and reproductive health, including abortion. An arch-conservative commissioner at the helm will have devastating consequences for the lives of countless women and girls.\u201d\n\nThe German Social Democrat Birgit Sippel said she was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the Hungarian\u2019s nomination, adding that a foreign policy portfolio would be a problem. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to give him a profile on migration, on home affairs, on justice, so that is something we have to focus on.\u201d\n\nThe parliament\u2019s political groups will start discussing the nominees this week, but have yet to reach collective views.\n\nThe Von der Leyen commission can only take office if all commissioners win MEPs\u2019 approval in a vote, following individual hearings. Usually one or two commissioners are rejected by the parliament, as MEPs seek to exert their power.\n\nThe confrontation between MEPs and Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi looks set to unfold as EU ministers open discussions later this month on whether Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government is in breach of the rule of law \u2013 following the unprecedented decision by the parliament to trigger the EU\u2019s most serious disciplinary procedure.\n\nThe rumbling discontent echoes a similar row over Orb\u00e1n\u2019s last European commissioner nominee, Tibor Navracsics, also a former Hungarian justice minister.\n\nProfile Viktor Orb\u00e1n Show Hide Born in 1963 in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in central Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been leader of the Fidesz national conservative party in two long stints since 1993. He has been Hungary\u2019s prime minister between 1998 and 2002, and again since 2010. After two years of military service he studied law in Budapest, and then political science at Pembroke College, Oxford.\n\nFor nationalists across Europe, Orb\u00e1n has become a hero, the embodiment of a nativist leader willing to eschew liberal political correctness and speak aggressively about the need to defend so-called Christian Europe. Steve Bannon has called him Trump before Trump, and Nigel Farage and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini are admirers.\n\nFor many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent. \u201cThe age of liberal democracy is at an end,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told the Hungarian parliament shortly after Fidesz won a third successive electoral victory in 2018. \u201cIt is no longer able to protect people\u2019s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture.\u201d His messaging, repeated in speeches and interviews ad nauseam, is that he is on a mission to protect Hungary and the rest of Europe from the evils of migration from the Middle East and Africa. He has frequently accused the Hungarian-born financier George Soros of a conspiracy to overrun Europe with Muslim migrants. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, which gives him leeway to make sweeping constitutional changes, and he has spoken of a plan to reshape the country over the next decade. He has installed loyalists in previously independent institutions, put a vast media network under the control of cronies and brushed off protests from the disgruntled urban elites. One thing Orb\u00e1n\u2019s admirers and detractors agree on is that he has become symbolic of something bigger than the fate of a smallish central European state with a population of fewer than 10 million. The man himself clearly relishes his increasingly large role in European political discourse. Frustrated with Brussels and other European critics, Orb\u00e1n has built alliances with neighbouring countries, notably throughout the V4, which comprises Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all of whose leaders have at times expressed varying degrees of unhappiness with the EU, and whose unity in messaging is growing. For Orb\u00e1n, the idea that he is up against an exhausted, decaying vision of Europe is one that he has returned to again and again in his speeches. In October 2018, he implicitly compared today\u2019s EU to the Nazis, Soviets and other imperial powers.

The former diplomat is not seen as a close ally of Orb\u00e1n: \u201cHe is an extremely talented expert, a professional executor and legal framer of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s will,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd I think that is how Orb\u00e1n looks at him, as a legal tool.\u201d\n\nTr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi said he was \u201cdelighted that president-elect Ursula von der Leyen considers me in her future team. It is a great honour.\u201d He declined to comment on the criticism from the MEPs, or his portfolio.", "description": "As justice minister, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi oversaw laws that put Hungary and EU in conflict", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496c41d2abf653b215dc779237fa9444a46a0255/1836_223_3627_2176/master/3627.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce5bf9f2ded3319d740a2ac5c1e80004", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
