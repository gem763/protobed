We're at the limit but managing it.\"\n\nHe said recruitment had fallen significantly in June and July as protests escalated and the authorities were criticised for what was seen as a heavy-handed response but that numbers had bounced back in August.\n\nHe said he had told front-line officers to maintain morale because only their agency was able to save this city from chaos and destruction.\n\n\"I try to convince officers that we are the only people who can protect Hong Kong at this juncture\".\n\nQuick guide to HK protests\n\nThe Hong Kong protesters are mostly young people worried about their future. Their demands have now expanded to include genuine universal suffrage and an inquiry into police behaviour\n\nThe protests started off peaceful but as the weeks have worn on the violence has escalated. The alleged involvement of gangs and undercover cops has led to fear, mistrust and suspicion\n\nHong Kong is part of China, but enjoys \"special freedoms\". Those are set to expire in 2047, and many in Hong Kong don't want to become \"another Chinese city\"\n\nAsked about an Amnesty International report accusing police of torture, arbitrary arrests and other abuses, the senior officer said the claims were totally unfounded, that the report was based on anonymous sources and Amnesty should have come to them with any complaints they had received,\n\nHowever during the discussion on Friday he did acknowledge that \"in any prolonged situation I'd be dishonest if I said that nobody has overstepped the line\".\n\nWhen it comes to allegations from the Chinese government that \"foreign forces\" were to blame for the ever more militant and destructive tactics being used by some demonstrators, he said local people were to blame but that a proposed bill in US Congress pegging trading status to Hong Kong's human rights performance would only encourage violence.\n\nHe blamed teachers for seeding the idea in students' minds that it was alright to break the law for a good cause.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 100 days of protests in Hong Kong in 100 seconds\n\nPolling in Hong Kong appears to show that the reputation of this once highly respected law enforcement institution has collapsed in recent months with regular scenes of police being surrounded by members of the public shouting abuse at them.\n\nThis officer said that most police were \"baffled by the degree of animosity\" against them and that \"...any spare capacity we do have we are already looking ahead to after this crisis and how we mend relations with the community. These things are already in the pipeline\u2026 Have confidence in us. We are a really good police force.\"\n\nHe said the force, one of Asia's oldest, has benefited from 175 years of learning, including from their mistakes.", "description": "A senior officer has admitted that Hong Kong police are struggling to deal with months of protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C02E/production/_108889194_mediaitem108889193.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
