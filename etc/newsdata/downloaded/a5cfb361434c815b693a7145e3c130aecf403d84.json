We are not bagging the industry. We want to disrupt in a positive manner,\u2019\u2019 Mr Rigby said.\n\nIt has also adopted a different approach to recruitment and remuneration \u2013 a major Achilles heel for Purplebricks, which battled a continual revolving door of disgruntled agents, many of whom struggled to earn a living from their meagre split of the fixed-fee.\n\nShaking up the industry\n\nUpside real estate agents are full-time employees of the company and are paid a monthly wage with the ability to earn bonuses based on sales success.\n\nThis strategy, assisted by an improving housing market, appears to be bearing fruit.\n\nUpside has sold 369 homes in the 12 months to the end of September \u2013 243 in the last six months \u2013 on a modest advertising budget.\n\nAt the height of its growth, Purplebricks was spending more than 80\u00a2 in advertising and marketing for every dollar in revenue it earned, including a national television and radio campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this media saturation delivered more than 6200 sales, it meant Purplebricks never came close to breaking even, a key reason why it quit Australia after less than three years.\n\n\"Too heavy a focus on TV advertising and not enough on good agents, relationship building and sales management was a key reason that Purplebricks failed,\" Mr Rigby said.\n\nAnother factor was the dip in the housing market, which meant homes took longer to sell, a key metric for a business model reliant on a high volume of sales.\n\nWhile Upside may benefit from the turnaround in the housing market, Mr Rigby said he believed the fixed-fee model was sustainable during downturns as well.\n\n\"We have no shopfronts. Those can cost $100,000 a month,\" he highlighted as one example of its advantages.\n\nHaving started in Melbourne, Geelong and the Mornington Peninsula, Upside recently commenced operations in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and the Gold Coast.\n\n\"We are shaking up the industry through a fair and transparent service,\" Mr Rigby said.", "description": "Upside Realty has recruited 43 agents and the real estate start-up expects to become profitable by October next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_528%2C$y_206/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8abf3cb45c8c4b5fc874d25c09a6efe2e6a9ae9d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
