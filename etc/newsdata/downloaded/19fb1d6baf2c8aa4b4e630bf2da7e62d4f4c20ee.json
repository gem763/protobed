No US troops were injured.\n\nAsked whether he thought Turkey, a NATO ally, would deliberately attack American troops in Syria, Mr Esper said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they would or wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA US military official told the Associated Press that the situation across northeastern Syria was \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d and that American troops had now become cut off from the Kurdish allies they had been fighting alongside.\n\nAmid reports of 130,000 civilians forced to flee their homes, dozens killed and nearly 800 detainees having escaped from a camp holding Isis relatives, Mr Trump attempted to defend his \"very smart\" move on Sunday.\n\n\"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight,\" he tweeted.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s time. It\u2019s time,\u201d Mr Trump said in a lengthy, wide-ranging address to conservative activists at the Values Voter Summit on Saturday.\n\nHe portrayed the Middle East as a hopeless cause, despite years of American military involvement and financial investment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less safe now. It\u2019s less secure, less stable and they fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they do. They fight.\u201d\n\nThe UN estimated on Sunday that at least 130,000 people had been displaced by the five-day-old Turkish invasion, with the official Kurdish death toll at 76.\n\nBoris Johnson has, in a phone call with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, urged Turkey to halt the offensive.\n\nAnd two of Turkey\u2019s NATO allies, Germany and France, have said they are halting weapons exports to Turkey, while the Arab League denounced the operation.\n\nMr Trump announced that he had directed $50m in emergency aid for Syria to support Christians and other religious minorities.\n\nTurkey regards the Kurds as terrorists, and Mr Trump suggested that he was aware of a likely invasion in the event of US withdrawal.\n\nHe defended his decision to reporters, saying Turkey had \u201cbeen wanting to do this for many years ... they\u2019ve been fighting each other for centuries\u201d.\n\nHis former defence secretary Jim Mattis has also issued a strong warning that Mr Trump's move could lead to the resurgence of Isis.\n\n\"We may want a war over, we may even declare it over,\" General Mattis said, in an interview with NBC, aired on Sunday.\n\n\"You can pull your troops out as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the 'enemy gets the vote', we say in the military.\n\n\"And in this case, if we don't keep the pressure on, then Isis will resurge. It's absolutely a given that they will come back.\"\n\nIsis declared on Saturday that it has already started regrouping and is planning a fresh campaign in Syria, claiming responsibility for two deadly car bombs on Friday.\n\nMr Trump has previously talked tough on Isis, using their existence to justify enacting a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nBut when asked about the prospect of escaped Isis prisoners shortly after his decision, Mr Trump played down the threat, telling reporters: \u201cWell they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go. They want to go back to their homes.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, an estimated 785 women and children affiliated with Isis escaped from a camp 50km north of Raqqa.\n\nKurdish authorities said \u201cmercenaries\u201d had attacked the Ain Issa camp where \u201cDaesh elements\u201d then attacked a severely diminished force of camp guards and opened the gates, amid Turkish shelling in the region.\n\nAs reports emerged of the escape, Turkish and Syrian rebel forces captured the neighbouring town of Suluk.\n\nMr Trump tweeted on Saturday night: \u201cThe same people that got us into the Middle East quicksand, $8tn and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side), are now fighting to keep us there.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to people that haven\u2019t got a clue. They have proven to be inept.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Donald Trump has described himself as \u201can island of one\u201d over his sudden decision to remove US forces from northeastern Syria, as his defence secretary said 1,000 troops would be evacuated to avoid getting caught up in the Turkish invasion.", "authors": ["Andy Gregory", "Phil Thomas"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/17/syria-smoke-from-turkey-turkish-artillery-bombardment-kurds.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
