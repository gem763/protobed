He can look over his shoulder and think \u2018down the road you\u2019ve got Jurgen Klopp, you\u2019ve got [Pep] Guardiola - these are managers that are actually improving their players, they\u2019re getting the best out of their squad\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at that [United] squad and, if anything, the players are getting worse.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re devaluing, as a squad they\u2019re getting worse.
