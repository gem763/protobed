The BPF is contesting only in 19 of 57 constituencies in Botswana.\n\nThe central region is a known stronghold of BDP and it is here where loyalty is going to be tested with BPF contesting in all 18 constituencies in the region.\n\nKhama is believed to be expecting his party to garner votes in this area out of loyalty to him and his brother, Tshekedi Khama, who recently left BDP and joined him at BPF.\n\nElection numbers\n\nBotswana has 57 directly contested parliamentary constituencies and for an outright win to become the majority party, parties must win at least 29 constituency seats.\n\nThe BPF, which is in coalition with the UDC, on its own is far from achieving 29 as it is contesting only 18 constituencies.\n\nBut it is encouraging its supporters to vote UDC in areas where it is not represented.\n\nThe two parties need each other\u2019s help.\n\nMedia reports from Botswana cited a recent survey, which predicted a landslide victory for BDP.\n\nBut others think the governing party seats will continue to drop in this election.\n\nThe BDP has gone from 45 seats in the 2009 general elections to 37 in 2014 when the then newcomer, UDC, took seven.\n\nPossibilities of a hung Parliament, a formal coalition between UDC and BPF, and the AP being the kingmaker have not been ruled out.\n\nThe prime candidates\n\nLast Wednesday evening was probably the day Botswana recorded the highest viewer rating and listenership as four presidential hopefuls locked horns in a debate where they unpacked their manifestos and got grilled.\n\nThe heated two-hour debate was streamed on Facebook. Masisi appeared composed while Boko was full of energy.\n\nThe articulate Gaolathe played away from finger-pointing as the presidential hopefuls deciphered their manifestos.\n\nThe soft-spoken Butale stood next to Masisi, who was dressed in the same red party blazer he used to wear when they sang from a different hymn book.\n\nOne of these men will soon be inaugurated as Botswana\u2019s president.", "description": "Fierce campaigning marred by dramatic political wrangling, finger-pointing and discrediting tactics in thelead-up to Botswana election.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/471ac4017e0e4eeab91012f8b7491dc9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
