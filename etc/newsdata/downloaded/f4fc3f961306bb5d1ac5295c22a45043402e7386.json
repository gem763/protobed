Few companies emerge from private equity deals without being laden with borrowing.\n\nInterestingly, Pizza Express uses exactly the same font and layout for its financial statements as it does for its menus. Unlike the menu, however, there are some quite unappetising items in its financials.\n\nMost off-putting of all, of course, is the enormous debt number. The interest on that \u00a31.1bn is costing the company \u00a393m a year, which wiped out all its operating profit last year - and then some.\n\nIn fact, the debt payments have pushed Pizza Express into the red for the last two years with a loss of \u00a355m last year alone.\n\n'No imminent danger'\n\nThe frustrating thing for the business is that it is making a reasonable amount of cash. It's for that reason, its auditors were happy to conclude the chain is a viable going concern when it signed off its accounts in April this year despite the company's debts being worth more than its assets.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTo be clear, Pizza Express is not in imminent danger of going bust. It has until 2021 before it needs to start paying back \u00a3600m to its outside creditors. (The other \u00a3500m is a loan from its Chinese owners).\n\nBut debt is a serial company killer - just ask Carillion or Thomas Cook. It can suffocate a company, so the earlier you try and address the issue the better.\n\nBonds in Pizza Express are selling for 84p for every \u00a31 worth of loan. That means that investors do not think those lenders will get all their money back.\n\nThe casual dining sector is littered with names which have been through some sort of insolvency process. Prezzo, Byron, Carluccio's needed to close stores and ask creditors to agree to rent reductions, while Jamie's Italian went bust.\n\nIf Pizza Express is going to last another 50 years some sort of debt restructuring looks inevitable. Getting it done in a brutal high street environment will not be straightforward.", "description": "The restaurant chain is not in imminent danger, but a debt restructuring looks inevitable.", "authors": ["Simon Jack", "Business Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/07C9/production/_109139910_pizzaexpress2_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
