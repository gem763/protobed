Everyone has to take responsibility for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d\n\nThe election comes amid high tensions in the region, with massive protests in neighboring Chile and Bolivia, as well as recent unrest over inequality in Ecuador.\n\nVoter Maria Marta Rosauer, 54, said she would give Macri \u201canother vote of confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI voted with the conviction and the certainty that he did things well and that he could have done better, but he needed time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNobody can put a country on its feet in four years, after how he found it. We opened our doors to the world after many years of being almost forgotten,\u201d she said, referring to the years when Argentina was a market pariah following a 2001 default.\n\nThere are \u201ctwo models of government at stake here. Alberto and Cristina represent greater equity,\u201d said another voter, Liliana, a 64-year-old architect in the capital. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see the end of a country that only benefits a small group.\u201d\n\nThe populist Kirchner, 66, who is facing trial in one of several graft cases stemming from her time in office, voted in the southern city of Rio Gallegos before flying to Buenos Aires to join celebrations.\n\nKirchner has long been a polarizing figure who succeeded her husband Nestor Kirchner as president in 2007 and remained in power until 2015.\n\n\u2013 Market fears \u2013\n\nThe return to power of protectionist Peronists comes amid a lengthy recession and a debt crunch, raising market fears of a possible default on a $57 billion IMF loan.\n\nThe peso fell 5.86 percent in the week before the elections, and the week ended with the dollar at 65 pesos.\n\n\u201cThe markets will be negative\u201d in their reaction to a Fernandez triumph on Monday, said Nicolas Saldias, a senior researcher at the Wilson Center.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be as brutal as in August (after the primary result), but people are taking their money out of the country, out of the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot depends on whether he shows his capacity to compromise.\n\n\u201cMacri is the president but Fernandez has the power. There has to be some signal that they are working together.\u201d\n\nFernandez has insisted his government would not default but rather seek to renegotiate the terms of the loan, and sought to reassure voters that their bank deposits would be safe under his administration.\n\nSince Fernandez\u2019s crushing victory in August primaries, which made him the favorite for the presidency, Argentine savers have withdrawn around $12 billion from their accounts.\n\nMacri blamed Argentina\u2019s economic problems on previous Peronist governments under Kirchner (2007-15) and her late husband Nestor Kirchner (2003-07).\n\nThe poverty rate has risen to more than 35 percent, inflation for the year to September was at almost 38 percent, while the peso has depreciated 70 percent since January 2018.\n\nVoters were also electing half of the Chamber of Deputies, a third of the Senate, the governor of Buenos Aires province and the capital\u2019s mayor.", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez won Argentina\u2019s presidential election in the first round on Sunday, official results", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/fc60be_supporters-argentina-presidential-election-winner-alberto-fernandez-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
