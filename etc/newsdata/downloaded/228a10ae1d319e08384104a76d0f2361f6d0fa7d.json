This seismic change led the Obama administration to initiate its so-called pivot to Asia. It led Donald Trump to make American competition with China one of his main campaign themes and later caused him to launch a trade war.\n\nAmerican primacists fear the rise of China, worrying that the U.S. will find it more difficult to impose its will (or at least attempt to) across the globe and to meddle and interfere with a myriad of issues that have no real bearing on America\u2019s national security. On the other side of the divide, there are non-interventionists who seem to believe that the only threat China poses to the U.S. is the possibility that Beijing\u2019s actions might trigger American warmongering.\n\nPrimacists certainly shouldn\u2019t fear a hard military threat from China. Thanks to our superior geostrategic positioning, the odds of Beijing ever projecting as much power as Washington is almost nil. At the same time, the non-interventionists are wrong to underestimate the threat that Chinese power poses to the American way of life. One needn\u2019t be a hawk or a card-carrying member of \u201cthe blob\u201d to see this threat.\n\nA rose-colored view of Chinese economic power is dismissive of what this power is actually capable of. John Tamny, director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, argues that the Chinese love America and that our economic relationship is beneficial to both parties. According to Tamny, any American fear of China is merely the result of demonization by politicians. Similarly, economist Barry Brownstein has argued at the Foundation for Economic Education, one of America\u2019s oldest classically liberal think tanks, that concerns about China can be overcome by both \u201clove\u201d and economic interdependence. To his credit, he acknowledges that economic interdependence failed to stop Imperial Germany and the UK from entering the First World War on opposite sides. But he brushes that aside by suggesting that we \u201cmake the economic interdependence between the U.S. and China so thick that war between the U.S. and China is no more imaginable than war between Ohio and Iowa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut contrary to Tamny\u2019s effusive praise for China and his claims that it\u2019s not a communist state, the regime in Beijing is still highly authoritarian and not in any way friendly to human freedom. The same government that ran thousands of protesters over with tanks, burned their corpses, then hosed them into the sewer system is now interning millions of Uighurs and creating a social credit system that would make Big Brother envious. No, it\u2019s not America\u2019s job to save the world, but as China\u2019s economic power increases, so too will its ability to influence affairs in the United States towards nefarious ends. And it\u2019s that very economic interdependence that non-interventionists such as Brownstein tout as the solution that will make this terrifying future possible.\n\nIt\u2019s already starting to happen. As the Chinese economy grows larger, American-based companies face pressure to alter their conduct here in the U.S. or risk losing access to the lucrative Chinese market. Hollywood has already kowtowed to Chinese censorship standards in the hopes of gaining access to hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. Nike recently canceled a shoe after its designer tweeted in support of the protesters in Hong Kong, which prompted outrage in China. And in 2018, a Marriott Hotels social media manager was fired after accidentally liking a tweet that thanked the hotel chain for listing Tibet as being separate from China. Marriott\u2019s leadership quickly assured the Chinese regime that they held the same view regarding Tibetan separatism.\n\nDomestically, fears of a cancel culture on college campuses and internet censorship driven by outrage mobs have become major issues, but the same fear can also be applied to China. American universities are starting to get hooked on funding from Beijing through government-sponsored Confucius Institutes and direct donations from prominent Chinese firms. And though last year Google announced it was canceling its censored search engine for the Chinese market called \u201cDragonfly,\u201d employees have revealed that work on the project has secretly continued.\n\nWill universities need to prevent critics of the communist regime from speaking on their campuses to protect valuable Chinese funding? What assurances do we have that Google won\u2019t censor its non-Chinese search engine or even turn over the data of regime critics in exchange for access to Chinese markets?\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t to tighten regulations on our commercial activity with China. China is an ancient civilization with a culturally rich history that has much to offer the U.S. To purposefully stifle the voluntary and beneficial cultural exchange that accompanies robust commerce would be detrimental to all of us.\n\nResponding with state-imposed economic measures to the extent that would be required to roll back malign Chinese influence over the U.S. economy also wouldn\u2019t be protecting America\u2019s way of life. Rather, it would emulate the authoritarian model of China\u2014Trump\u2019s Twitter ukases to American companies notwithstanding.\n\nA much better and sustainable method of preventing American companies from bowing to Chinese wishes is simply to exercise consumer sovereignty here at home. In the words of economist Ludwig von Mises, \u201cthe captain is the consumer.\u201d Merely by changing their consumption habits, consumers can ultimately decide not only where resources are allocated, but what companies will stay in business or fail. Changes in consumer behavior and the resulting market signals would make it clear to Nike, Marriott, and Google that giving in to Chinese pressure will be costly here at home. And recent fears over \u201cwoke capitalism\u201d have clearly demonstrated that corporations are eager to please their customers.\n\nAmerica still has the largest economy in the world, and its consumers still have immense power over even the biggest multinational corporations. Exercising that power, rather than using the state to dictate how companies act, will not only work to prevent undue Chinese influence; it will preserve America\u2019s tradition of freedom as well.\n\nZachary Yost is a Young Voices Foreign Policy Fellow and a Pittsburgh-based writer.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_407732266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
