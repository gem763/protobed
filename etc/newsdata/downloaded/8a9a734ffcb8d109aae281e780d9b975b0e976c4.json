The Pentagon first green-lighted the projects on Aug. 27, but that authorization was made under the presumption that costs would be far lower.\n\nThe Pentagon had redirected $2.5 billion from a counter-drug fund for the wall projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guessed at the time that the counter-drug funds would be enough based on \u201clower-than-expected contract costs,\u201d but the Army Corps said it would not be able to know the full price until later in the future, Politico reported.\n\nThe funds ultimately were not enough to cover construction costs, and the Army Corps withdrew on Sept. 13, according to the court filing.\n\nThe withdrawal marks the latest turn in the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to build as much wall along the southern border as feasibly possible, fulfilling a hallmark pledge President Donald Trump made on the 2016 campaign trail.\n\nActing Customs and Border Protection Director Mark Morgan said in a press conference earlier in September the White House wants to see 450-500 miles of \u201cnew border wall\u201d by the end of 2020. Morgan stipulated that there is a difference between what he framed as \u201cnew border wall\u201d and \u201cnew linear miles.\u201d New linear miles refers to the construction of border wall on ground where no wall or barrier previously existed.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Can the Pentagon get it done in time?", "authors": ["Jason Hopkins"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EZyi8OxdzBK19klf7m2aPw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/012b83b5b159a5724f8ddbfe493c659c", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
