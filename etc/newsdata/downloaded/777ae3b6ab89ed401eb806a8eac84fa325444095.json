If he is unable to bowl in the fifth Test at the Oval this week then one of Jason Roy, Jos Buttler or Jonny Bairstow will potentially miss out.\n\nThe destiny of the Ashes has been secured by Tim Paine\u2019s tourists going 2-1 up with one match to play, but Ed Smith\u2019s selection panel and the captain, Joe Root, have opted to defer any reboot of the Test team until they plan for the winter tours to New Zealand and South Africa. England have therefore named an unchanged 13-man squad for Thursday\u2019s Test, allowing batting hopefuls such as Ollie Pope, Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley to press their claims in the remaining county fixtures and avoid trying to start (or in the case of Pope, resume) Test careers against Australia\u2019s high-intensity pace attack.\n\nBut the injury that led to Stokes pulling out of his 11th over during Australia\u2019s first innings in Manchester, and then fail to bowl at all in the second, means the structure of the final XI is yet to be settled and the knock-on effect could prove significant in terms of career trajectories.\n\nShould England\u2019s vice-captain be forced to play as a specialist batsman, it would need an extra all-rounder to be drafted in. Sam Curran and Chris Woakes are the two options in the squad, although the latter will also challenge Craig Overton for the third seamer\u2019s role. The batsman who makes way in this scenario is similarly up for discussion.\n\nRoy would appear the obvious candidate. He was instrumental in England\u2019s World Cup triumph but has since struggled in Test cricket. The move from opener down to No 4 at Old Trafford produced scores of 22 and 31 but the fact that he was bowled twice exacerbated concerns about the suitability of his technique in the longest format.\n\nJoe Root says losing hurts but he wants to carry on as England captain Read more\n\nButtler\u2019s recall was last summer\u2019s success story in Test cricket but an average of 16.25 in this series is only marginally better than Roy\u2019s 13. The right-hander did enjoy his best outing in Manchester when making 41 and 34 \u2013 the latter innings lasting more than two and a half hours at the crease while he tried to save the Test on the final day \u2013 but he is still lacking a defined role.\n\nBairstow, as wicketkeeper, might appear the safest of the trio but England\u2019s patience is known to be wearing thin. His dismissal during the first innings \u2013 bowled while trying to drive an inswinger from Mitchell Starc \u2013 came when the second new ball needed seeing off and added to concerns that one-day cricket has affected his game against the red ball. Were England planning a switch of wicketkeeper this week, however, they would likely have left Bairstow out altogether rather than risk the inevitable fallout affecting the squad at training.\n\nWhen told a thumb injury would mean Buttler keeping wicket against India at the Ageas Bowl last year, the 29-year-old took the news poorly and a spell as a specialist top-order batsman during the winter \u2013 something Smith is known to still be keen on \u2013 was the source of further off-field angst.\n\nNevertheless, since Root took on the captaincy in early 2017 Bairstow has averaged 29 in Test cricket. With England keen to find a way of keeping Buttler\u2019s potentially game-changing batsmanship in the side, and Surrey\u2019s Ben Foakes so impressive as Bairstow\u2019s injury replacement against Sri Lanka, there is competition for the place he so cherishes.\n\nTrevor Bayliss, who oversees his final match as England head coach this week, is unlikely to miss the selection meetings that have meant such issues with the batting department have been endlessly debated and never truly solved.\n\nThe vacancy Bayliss leaves behind is set to be formally advertised after the fifth Test, with a caretaker head coach \u2013 likely the bowling coach, Chris Silverwood \u2013 due to be in place for the trip to New Zealand that begins in late October and features five Twenty20s and two Tests.\n\nAshley Giles, the director of England cricket, is also expected to take the head coach\u2019s place on the selection panel during this interim period rather than Silverwood, who will be among the candidates in the recruitment process.", "description": "Ben Stokes is to undergo a scan on a shoulder injury, with the potential that Jason Roy, Jos Buttler or Jonny Bairstow may miss out in the fifth Test if he is only able to bat", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceda741fa01e02e78a2f2b7299aca4451bbb15d7/24_220_3369_2022/master/3369.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1bb1d43e9adafbdde63f11d337478792", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
