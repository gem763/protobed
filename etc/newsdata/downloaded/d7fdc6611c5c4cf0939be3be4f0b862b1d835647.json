By nighttime, there were fires in one of the town's neighborhoods, apparently ignited by the shelling.\n\nTurkey's Defense Ministry said Turkish ground forces, joined by allied Syrian opposition forces, had moved across the border into Syria. Shortly after, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said its fighters had repelled the Turkish ground attack in Tal Abyad.\n\nA photograph released to Turkish media showed Erdogan at his desk, reportedly giving orders for the start of the operation. Turkish Presidency Press Service\n\nEarlier, a US defense official and a Kurdish official in Syria said the SDF has suspended operations against IS militants because of the Turkish operation. The officials who confirmed the suspension spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to provide details on the situation.\n\nTurkey's campaign - in which a NATO member is raining down bombs on an area where hundreds of US troops are stationed - drew immediate criticism and calls for restraint from Europe. In his statement, Trump emphasised that there are no American soldiers in the area under attack.\n\n\"Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\" Erdogan said in a tweet announcing what he called \"Operation Peace Spring.\"\n\nHe said that Turkish forces, with Ankara-backed Syrian fighters known as the Syrian National Army, had begun to eradicate what he called \"the threat of terror\" against Turkey.\n\nMinutes before Erdogan's announcement, Turkish jets began pounding suspected positions of Syrian Kurdish forces in the town of Ras al Ayn, according to Turkish media and Syrian activists. The sound of explosions could be heard in Turkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was difficult to know what was hit in the first hours of the operation.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said Turkish warplanes were targeting \"civilian areas\" in northern Syria, causing \"a huge panic\" in the region.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said those killed in the Turkish bombardments included two Christian Assyrians in Qamishli, a married couple and their child, a man in a village outside of the town of Tal Abyad, and a child in a village west of Qamishli.\n\nBefore Turkey's attack, Syrian Kurdish forces that are allied with the United States warned of a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nThe Turkish operation meant to create a \"safe zone\" carries potential gains and risk for Turkey by getting even more deeply involved in the Syria war. It also would ignite new fighting in Syria's 8-year-old war, potentially displacing hundreds of thousands.\n\nA resident of Tal Abyad said one of the bombs hit an SDF office, and he fled with his wife and mother by car to Raqqa, nearly 100 kilometers to the south, to flee the bombing. The resident, who gave his name as Maher, said the road to Raqqa was packed with vehicles and families, some fleeing on foot \"to get away from the bombing.\"\n\n\"People fled and left everything behind,\" he said in a text message after he reached safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey. Expectations of an invasion increased after Trump's announcement Sunday, although he also threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" Turkey's economy if the Turkish push went too far.\n\nUS Senator flags sanctions\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bipartisan measure Wednesday to sanction Turkey in response to President Donald Trump's decision to pull US troops from northern Syria, which left Kurdish fighters in Syria vulnerable to a Turkish invasion.\n\nGraham is partnering with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen on a bill that would trigger sanctions unless the Trump administration \"certifies to Congress -- every 90 days\" that Turkey is not operating in Syrian territory. Turkish ground forces invaded Syria Wednesday.\n\nThe sanctions would target Turkish leaders including the president, vice president and ministers of defense, finance, trade and energy, as well as against any foreign national who provides support to the Turkish military. The bill would also prohibit foreign entities from supporting Turkish energy production used by its armed forces and would require a report on President Erdogan's net worth.\n\nThe quick bipartisan deal reflects the broad outrage over Trump's reversal that abandoned the Kurdish allies that fought with US troops against the Islamic State. While Republicans have disagreed with Trump on other matters of foreign policy, never have they promised such swift action to contain the damage from a presidential action they have so publicly denounced.\n\nTrump received unusually sharp words from several Republicans, including those who rarely cross him, like Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn.\n\n\"I condemn in the strongest possible terms any US policy that will result in endangerment of the Kurds who have sacrificed so much blood and treasure alongside American forces,\" Blackburn said in a statement Wednesday. \"The US does not abandon or endanger partners who have made significant sacrifices and contributions to protect our national security interests.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump later said the US \"does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\"\n\nTrump said he made clear from the start of his political career that \"I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars - especially those that don't benefit the United States. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place - and we will hold them to this commitment.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, while noting that Turkey \"has legitimate security concerns\" after suffering \"horrendous terrorist attacks\" and hosting thousands of refugees, said the country should not \"further destabilise the region\" with its military action in Syria.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas condemned the offensive, saying it will \"further destabilise the region and strengthen IS.\" The operation also was criticized by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe EU is paying Turkey \u20ac6 billion ($9.79 billion) to help the country cope with almost four million Syrian refugees on its territory in exchange for stopping migrants leaving for Europe.\n\nFahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency's communications director, urged the international community to rally behind Ankara, which he said would take over the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey aimed to \"neutralise\" Syrian Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria and to \"liberate the local population from the yoke of the armed thugs,\" Altun wrote in a Washington Post column published Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErdogan discussed the incursion by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Erdogan's office said he told Putin the military action \"will contribute to the peace and stability\" and allow for a political process in Syria.\n\nIn its call for a general mobilization, the local civilian Kurdish authority known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria asked the global community to live up to its responsibilities as \"a humanitarian catastrophe might befall our people.\"\n\nThe Kurds also said they want the US-led coalition to set up a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria to protect the civilian population from Turkish airstrikes.\n\nThe US-backed Syrian Kurdish group urged Moscow to broker talks with the Syrian government in Damascus in light of the Turkish operation. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration said it is responding positively to calls from Moscow encouraging the Kurds and the Syrian government to settle their difference through talks.\n\nSyria's Foreign Ministry condemned Turkey's plans, calling it a \"blatant violation\" of international law and vowing to repel an incursion.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Washington of playing \"very dangerous games\" with the Syrian Kurds, saying the U.S. first propped up the Syrian Kurdish \"quasi state\" in Syria and now is withdrawing support.\n\n\"Such reckless attitude to this highly sensitive subject can set fire to the entire region, and we have to avoid it at any cost,\" he said in Kazakhstan.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, three IS militants targeted the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Raqqa, once the de facto IS capital at the height of the militants' power. An activist collective in Raqqa reported an exchange of fire and an explosion; the Observatory said two IS fighters engaged in a shootout before blowing themselves up.\n\nIS claimed responsibility, saying one of its members killed or wounded 13 SDF members.\n\nThe SDF, which holds thousands of IS fighters in detention facilities in northeastern Syria, has warned that a Turkish incursion might lead to the resurgence of the extremists. The US-allied Kurdish-led force captured the last IS area controlled by the militants in eastern Syria in March.\n\nBloomberg and AAP", "description": "Turkey launched airstrikes, fired artillery and began a ground offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday after US troops pulled back from the area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7025%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_311%2C$y_246/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/300ca24448af3efa181574aab5c99b3451d9c0de", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
