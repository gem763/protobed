On Saturday, The Bachelor's Abbie Chatfield (pictured) took to Instagram wearing NOTHING but a bunch of grapes and some foliage to prove a point\n\nDouble standards? On Thursday night's episode of The Bachelorette, Ciarran Stott was praised as 'confident' when he stripped off for a 'nude modelling' group date\n\nIn the snap, the reality TV runner-up is seen reclining on a black weathered couch naked, surrounded by cushions, in a Cleopatra-like pose.\n\nThe opinionated property analyst covered her nether regions with a couple of bunch of grapes and some foliage to make a point - and avoid getting the chills.\n\nThe Bachelor finalist accessorised her jaw-dropping statement with a platinum blonde shake 'n' go wig, fresh out of the bag.\n\nPaint me like one of your British boys! On The Bachelorette, Ciarran was quick to volunteer his services as a naked model before any of his fellow bachelors, saying: 'I'll have a crack!'\n\nAbbie captioned the provocative snap with a lengthy, self-described 'feminist rant'.\n\nIt begun: 'Last week on The Bachelorette, fan favourite Ciarran stripped down to nothing as part of a group date. In the same week, he admitted he used to dance in bars and has had a nose job,' wrote Abbie.\n\n'This caused Australia (including me) to fall even further in love with him, admiring his confidence, sense of humour and cheeky behaviour. The fact that he was so open about usually taboo topics was amazing.'\n\nIs Ciarran Australia's most confident man? On Thursday, The Bachelorette star also told Angie Kent he use to make a living dancing in gay nightclubs and he had a nose job\n\nAbbie continued: 'However, the comment section on every social media post of Ciarran's photo was full of (laughing/crying) and (fire) emojis...\n\n'While I love that the majority of the public got behind Ciarran, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if the gender roles had been reversed.\n\n'What if I had been on a group date, offered to strip down to nothing and posed nude on National TV? What if in the same week I had shared that I had plastic surgery and had danced in night clubs?' said Abbie.\n\nMy eyes are up here! Ever-confident Ciarran was naked when he was interviewed by Yvie Jones (right), with only a couple of bunches of grapes covering his modesty\n\nShocked: Angie's (left) best friend Yvie Jones (right) also appeared to be in awe as she drew the naked Englishman\n\n'I can only imagine the public outcry if I had done the same as Ciarran, and had uploaded a photo of me with nothing but grapes covering me. So let's not imagine.\n\n'Here's me doing a Ciarran. Let's see how this goes, hey?' she said, closing the post.\n\nIt's not the first time the fiery blonde has drawn attention to the double standards between men and women.\n\n'Can you imagine if I had done this?' Abbie (pictured) has claimed 'the nation would riot' if she stripped off on the Bachelorette\n\nLast month Abbie directed a post at her critics, both male and female, who had shamed her for expressing her sexuality on The Bachelor.\n\nShe wrote at the time: 'Things I got sl*t shamed for on The Bachelor: This bikini, my skirt at hometowns, multiple cocktail party gowns, kissing Matt 'without a date' and at a cocktail party (out of sight of anyone).'\n\nAbbie explained she 'did not expect to be sl*t shamed in 2019' and emphasised that 'sex is essential to a successful relationship'.", "description": "On Thursday night's episode of\u00a0The Bachelorette, Ciarran Stott was praised as 'confident' when he stripped off for a 'nude modelling' group date.", "authors": ["Shannon Shipley For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/09/19914280-0-image-a-5_1571472695777.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
