So boring\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "When Charlotte Gainsbourg was 16, she came home from school to find her mother distraught and the police waiting for her. They had just discovered that she was the target of a kidnapping plot. A gang of upper-class teenagers \u2013 journalists called them the blousons dor\u00e9s (golden jacket) gangsters \u2013 had planned to kill a police officer and steal his uniform. Then, using this disguise, they were going to abduct Gainsbourg and demand a 5m franc ransom from her famous parents, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The gang, who had already committed several armed robberies, had found a country house where they were going to hide Gainsbourg. They had even bought shovels with which to bury the police officer.\n\nGainsbourg laughs as she recounts the episode: \u201cI thought it was so cool.\u201d Her mother and father weren\u2019t quite so blase. \u201cI remember my parents being extremely scared and my father made me go to school with a bodyguard.\u201d She stares into her coffee, stirring in milk for longer than is necessary. \u201cI was so ashamed.\u201d\n\nGainsbourg and I are sitting in a chic but uncomfortable corner booth in a hotel cafe in Greenwich Village, New York. The singer, actor and style champion has just come back from Paris fashion week; French Vogue is full of pictures of her looking glam in a see-through shirt and tailored suit. She is dressed more simply today, wearing what she describes as her \u201cjean uniform\u201d: skinny jeans and a white T-shirt that, upon closer inspection, bears a Saint Laurent logo and probably costs a small fortune. She leads a jet-set life and works in the most extrovert of industries, but remains notoriously private and uncomfortable with attention. She fiddles anxiously with her necklace as we talk, avoiding too much eye contact. Having to be trailed by bodyguards as a teenager, having all eyes on her while her would-be kidnappers were arrested and, eventually, sentenced to several years in jail, must have been mortifying.\n\nBut Gainsbourg spent her childhood in the public eye, with a mother who epitomised 60s cool and a father whose provocative and often alcohol-soaked antics often made headlines. There was the time he appeared with Whitney Houston on primetime TV and announced that he wanted \u201cto fuck her\u201d, for example. On another live TV show, he burned a 500 franc note to protest against what he considered excessive taxation. Gainsbourg\u2019s classmates didn\u2019t respond very kindly to that stunt. \u201cAt school, the kids took my worksheet and they burned it,\u201d she says. She laughs quietly. \u201cSo I did get\u2026 I did get bullied.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With her father Serge, her mother Jane Birkin and half-sister Kate, 1978. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nHer father died of a heart attack in 1991, when Gainsbourg was just 19. She still seems to worship him and says she misses being \u201cable to ask him all the questions about music that I have today\u201d. She speaks fondly of the way he used to come up with melodies and test them on a little focus group consisting of her, her mother, and his artistic director. \u201cWe\u2019d make little asterixes next to the melodies we preferred,\u201d she remembers. \u201cEven though I was just a kid, he wanted my point of view.\u201d\n\nWhen she was 12, Gainsbourg made her musical debut alongside him on the song Lemon Incest \u2013 a play on un zeste de citron (a lemon zest). In the infamous video, Gainsbourg is sprawled on a bed while her topless dad caresses her and sings about the love they will never make together. The song, recorded in 1984, was accused of glamorising abuse and paedophilia, but despite the scandal \u2013 or perhaps because of it \u2013 Lemon Incest peaked at No 2 in the French charts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With her father Serge in the Lemon Incest video, 1985. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nGainsbourg has spent decades fielding questions about Lemon Incest and is less than thrilled when I ask her whether something similar could be released today, let alone spend 10 weeks in the Top 10, in the era of #MeToo. \u201cIt was already shocking at the time,\u201d she says with faint exasperation. \u201cI remember my father having to explain himself, and his lyrics, because he plays with the jeu de mots, how do you say that? When you play with the sounds of the words, like a double meaning?\u201d Gainsbourg is bilingual, but French is her first language; she pauses occasionally in our conversation to search around for le mot juste. We settle on \u201cpun\u201d and she continues. \u201cIncest is so shocking and so taboo. It\u2019s as if he was amusing himself with that. But when you listen to the lyrics, he\u2019s just talking about the infinite love of a father for his daughter and of a daughter for her father \u2013 and you can\u2019t condemn that. Because there\u2019s nothing physical. So, yes, he says incest, but that\u2019s it. I find it terrible that you can\u2019t talk about things that are\u2026\u201d she trails off, searching around for the right word. \u201cDifficult?\u201d I suggest. \u201cNuanced?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou hear the word \u2018incest\u2019 and conversation gets shut off,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no dialogue.\u201d\n\nSocial media has made it harder, I suggest: you can imagine the Twitter storms Lemon Incest would provoke today. \u201cYes, but I think my father would be condemned in every move he made,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything now is so politically correct. So boring. So expected. And everyone is so scared of what will happen if they go too far.\u201d Men, in particular, she says, have reason to be scared. \u201cA few tweets and it\u2019s done\u2026 their career is over.\u201d Her dad, she says, would have been miserable today, \u201cbecause it did matter to him what people felt, what people thought, when he got criticised\u201d. He is known as a provocateur, but he was sensitive, Gainsbourg says. \u201cHe got very wounded by a lot of stuff. There were a lot of antisemitic things going on during his life.\u201d And not just during the war, she adds, when, as a 10-year-old in Nazi-occupied France, he was forced to wear a yellow star to mark him as a Jew. \u201cEven afterwards, France was still very antisemitic.\u201d So much so that, when Gainsbourg released a reggae version of the Marseillaise (a characteristic provocation) in 1979, one newspaper critic accused him of bringing antisemitism upon himself, by \u201ctrying to make money with the national anthem\u201d.\n\nStill, Gainsbourg says brightly, she had a \u201ccompletely normal and very simple childhood\u201d. She was born in London, but grew up in Paris. Apart from regular ferry trips to England to see her maternal grandparents, the family travelled little; her father was scared of planes. Her parents split up when she nine, but Gainsbourg remained close to both, as well as her half-sister Kate Barry, the late fashion photographer (Birkin\u2019s first daughter, with the English composer John Barry). All in all, she says, life \u201cwas very square\u201d.\n\nVon Trier pushes you into really dark places. I want someone to push me where it\u2019s difficult, where I\u2019m uncomfortable\n\nThese days, Gainsbourg seems drawn to square pegs in round holes: men like her father who are both outsiders and insiders, who use outrage as a weapon against a society in which they have never felt welcome. Some might call them provocateurs, others perverts. One of her most notable collaborators is the Danish film director Lars von Trier, whose dark, psychological films Gainsbourg has appeared in \u2013 Nymphomaniac, Antichrist and Melancholia \u2013 reflect his battles with alcoholism, depression and various phobias. (Like Gainsbourg\u2019s father, Von Trier is terrified of flying.) In Von Trier\u2019s films, these battles are often acted out violently on Gainsbourg\u2019s body: in Antichrist, she plays a grieving mother who cuts off her clitoris with a pair of scissors; in Nymphomaniac, her character has graphic sex with strangers.\n\nGainsbourg has often been called Von Trier\u2019s \u201cmuse\u201d \u2013 but that is too passive a word to describe the actor. Part of her allure is that as a performer she is impossible to categorise neatly. She is not a stereotypical sex symbol or a damsel in distress, and she is not just an instrument for older men to act out their provocations; she uses them just as much as they use her. In all of her parts, you get the sense that she is the one in control.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Styling: Paul Sinclaire. Hair: Kevin Ryan at Art + Commerce. Makeup: Frank B at the Wall Group.

Photograph: Chris Colls/The Guardian\n\nVon Trier\u2019s films have frequently been described as misogynistic, but Gainsbourg rejects that idea, saying that she has done some of her best work with him. \u201cHe gives such wonderful parts to women,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can he be misogynistic if he\u2019s portraying women like that?\u201d What about Bj\u00f6rk, I ask, who starred in his film Dancer In The Dark? In 2017, as #MeToo started to become a mainstream movement, Bj\u00f6rk claimed that she had been sexually harassed by an unnamed film director many assumed to be Von Trier. He denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true Von Trier pushes you into really dark places,\u201d Gainsbourg says. \u201c[But] that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for in acting \u2013 I want someone to push me places where I haven\u2019t been, where it\u2019s difficult, where I\u2019m uncomfortable. That\u2019s all I want. For me, a lot of the work is letting go and trusting him all the way.\u201d While she won\u2019t speak for Bj\u00f6rk, she feels her own trust in Von Trier was never betrayed. In Antichrist and Nymphomaniac, for example, he walked through every frame with her to make sure she was comfortable. \u201cI said, the only thing I\u2019m really uncomfortable with are my boobs. So he said OK, and I\u2019m wearing a T-shirt the whole time [in the sex scenes]. I trusted him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In Lars von Trier\u2019s Antichrist, 2009. Photograph: Allstar\n\nGainsbourg released her first album, Charlotte For Ever, when she was 15, then took a long hiatus from music. She didn\u2019t release anything new until 5:55 in 2006, which sold well and had favourable reviews. She has kept going ever since, exploring a cinematic strain of disco pop, close in spirit to Goldfrapp. While working on her most recent album, 2017\u2019s Rest, she asked French novelist and provocateur, Michel Houellebecq, if he would write the lyrics. When I bring this up, she looks puzzled. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cHouellebecq,\u201d I repeat, in my best French accent. \u201cAh!\u201d she says, finally, \u201cHouellebecq! Yes, my producer [S\u00e9bastien Akchot\u00e9] and I had the same passion for his genius. My record company did ask him, but he wasn\u2019t very interested. Anyway, then I realised that I wanted to write the lyrics myself. I do love other people\u2019s writing. I feel very lucky to have worked with Jarvis Cocker and Beck. But it\u2019s so different to write your own lyrics. Touring and being on stage had a purpose. It changed everything.\u201d\n\nGainsbourg and Attal are not married. 'It was never a goal. My mother got married and it was not a success'\n\nRest is one of her rawest and most personal albums, and a lot of it stems from grief. In December 2013, her half-sister Kate died after falling from a fourth-floor window in Paris. Her death made living in Paris unbearable, Gainsbourg says. A few months after the tragedy, she decamped to New York with her partner and their three children. \u201cI was coming from a very dark place,\u201d she says. In the US, \u201cI was breathing again and seeing new sky. I thought: how come I haven\u2019t done this before? It\u2019s wonderful to just take a bag and go somewhere else.\u201d\n\nThe anonymity of New York wasn\u2019t just cathartic; it was creatively liberating. \u201cHere, I feel I\u2019m being myself with nobody noticing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not noticing. I feel very different, because I\u2019m not looking at myself all the time. I don\u2019t think in France I could have released my album and written the lyrics myself.\u201d The album, which blends French and English, reflects on everything from motherhood to the loss of her sister. On Kate, she sings: \u201cOn d\u2019vait vieillir ensemble [we were going to grow old together].\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Playing live in London, 2012. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIn France, Gainsbourg is recognised wherever she goes and is known, first and foremost, as the daughter of Birkin and Serge. In New York, she is finally starting to break free from that history. \u201cI feel ashamed saying this, but when people recognise me here it\u2019s about me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe films I\u2019ve done, a lot of Lars\u2019s films, and my music. I don\u2019t get recognised that often, but when it happens I\u2019m really proud.\u201d\n\nAt this point, a stocky man, dressed neatly in black, walks in and starts addressing her in French. I assume it is an adoring fan, but it is her partner, the French-Israeli actor and director Yvan Attal. After a second, he apologises to me for being rude and continues in English \u2013 he just wants a quick word about their lunch plans. The quick word is had and he disappears, presenting the perfect opportunity to start talking about him behind his back.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Now, to French people, I sound totally British \u2013 to British people, I don\u2019t.\u2019 Photograph: Chris Colls/The Guardian\n\nGainsbourg has been with Attal for 27 years \u2013 they met when she was 19 \u2013 but they are not married. \u201cIt was never a goal,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the contrary. My mother got married [to John Barry, before her relationship with Serge Gainsbourg] and it was not a success. So I felt that it wasn\u2019t part of my plans. And Yvan, he didn\u2019t care at all. Later on, we felt that for the children maybe it would be nice for them, for me to have the same name \u2013 but then I became so superstitious. I\u2019ve heard of a lot of couples who live a long life together, and they get married and split. I thought it was bad luck.\u201d\n\nHang on, I say: if she had chosen to get married, she would have changed her name? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she backtracks. \u201cI\u2019m very attached to my name, because of my father. But what\u2019s funny is that I was registered under Gainsbourg, which was not my father\u2019s real name. He was called Ginsberg and he changed it for work. On his passport, it was still Ginsberg. When I was 18, I asked to go back to my old name, just to have the same as him. It was such a big deal to go through all the paperwork, but we did it. I\u2019m very proud of it, because that\u2019s my story. I feel very close to that past.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With her partner of 27 years, actor and director Yvan Attal. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nHow does England fit into her story, I ask? She was born in London and her mother is English, but she lived only in France, before moving to New York. \u201cI feel I\u2019m pretending to be English,\u201d she says, quickly. \u201cFor a long time [growing up], I was very proud of being French. I had a very thick French accent and I wasn\u2019t making any effort [to be English]; I was the French cousin. But gradually I wanted to feel part of that world. Now, to French people, I sound totally British \u2013 to British people, I don\u2019t. I have this pride in being English, but at the same time there\u2019s nothing really there. Anytime I go to London, I feel like I don\u2019t belong.\u201d The English \u201cdon\u2019t let you in very easily\u201d, she explains.\n\nHas Brexit made her feel even less English? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very proud of my British passport. It is so stupid. It\u2019s a little booklet, but I cherish it. Maybe it\u2019s my mother, who transmitted something, some pride in that nationality.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Sean Penn in 21 Grams, 2003. Photograph: Allstar\n\nShe has lived in New York for five years, but says there is a cultural divide she hasn\u2019t been able to bridge. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get close to American friends. I feel I don\u2019t understand them completely. It\u2019s hard to \u2013 I feel stupid making generalities, but it\u2019s so money-oriented. In France, we\u2019re all about having lunch, dinner. It\u2019s a real art of life, art de vivre,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I love. I love time off.\u201d In the US, she says, everyone is working all the time. \u201cI feel they pretend that\u2019s what they want, but they\u2019re just forced to work all the time.\u201d\n\nFor all this, Gainsbourg admits that she is a workaholic herself. She has released five albums and been in more than 40 movies; her latest is a French comedy called My Dog Stupid, directed by Attal and featuring her son, 22-year-old Ben (her daughters, Alice, 16, and Joe, eight, live with her in New York). She also models, and is the face of Saint Laurent. But while she doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down, she has started to worry that the work will dry up as she gets older.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not at peace with [ageing] at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI think maybe when I\u2019m 60 I\u2019ll be at peace with it, because I\u2019ll be an old lady and it\u2019ll show.\u201d For the moment, she is \u201choping that I still look young\u201d, although occasionally she finds herself surprised when she looks in the mirror and sees that \u201cI do have wrinkles\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d she says of getting older in the entertainment industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a job where you\u2019re not supposed to age. The parts get thinner and thinner. The work will become less and less consistent. But, in a way, I\u2019ve already passed that. I had an agent who said: \u2018Past 40, you\u2019re going downhill,\u2019 which was so depressing.\u201d\n\nNow she is approaching 50 and still getting parts, still making music. After decades of grappling with the burden of her name, Gainsbourg is starting to consider herself a success in her own right; to feel that it is OK to be proud of herself. She may worry about wrinkles, but she is finally comfortable in her own skin.\n\n\u2022 Charlotte Gainsbourg wears Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello\n\nIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "The actor and singer grew up in her parents\u2019 shadow, and starred in Lars Von Trier\u2019s most extreme films.
