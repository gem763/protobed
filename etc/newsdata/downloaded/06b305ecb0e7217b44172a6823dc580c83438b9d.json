Hayes, the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide, saying that while same-sex couples can marry, \u201cthe court took care to \u2018emphasize that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.\u2019\u201d\n\nCathedral High School, a Roman Catholic school in Indianapolis, terminated Mr. Payne-Elliott\u2019s contract this year after receiving a decree from Archbishop Charles Thompson to disassociate with the diocese or fire the teacher.\n\nMr. Payne-Elliott\u2019s husband, Layton, also teaches for a Catholic high school, an Indianapolis Jesuit high school called Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory that refused to fire him. The archdiocese cut ties with Brebeuf, which appealed the decision to a Vatican court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
