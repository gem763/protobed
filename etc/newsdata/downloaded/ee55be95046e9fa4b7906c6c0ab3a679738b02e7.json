There have already been protests as a direct consequence of this. The community is being targeted at a time it needs electricity the most,\" Nxusani said.\n\nThe threat to cut electricity supplies is part of Eskom's strategy to recover debt from defaulting municipalities.", "description": "The Newcastle Municipality will not have its electricity supply cut off - for now - pending a decision by the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on the hotly debated issue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7632/406417c57df645369a09b1bdf2e2dccb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
