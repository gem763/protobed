I don\u2019t think anyone has called Boris a diplomat or statesman.\"\n\nJohnson this week withdrew the party whip from 21 Conservative rebels \u2014 including Soames, Rory Stewart and former chancellors Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke \u2014 after they voted against the government to push through legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn the Times interview, Soames called Johnson \"deeply unreliable,\" said he had \"signed up to the Trump playbook,\" and there was no \u201chelpful analogy\u201d between the current PM and Churchill.\n\n\u201cWinston Churchill was like Winston Churchill because of his experiences in life. Boris Johnson\u2019s experience in life is telling a lot of porkies about the European Union in Brussels and then becoming prime minister. He doesn\u2019t like the House of Commons. He is engaged on this great Brexit obsession: get us out, deal or no deal, do or die. That is not Winston Churchill.\n\n\"I think Churchill would have thought it extraordinary that we would have thought ourselves so successful, so powerful, so well thought of in the world that we could afford to give up this extraordinary relationship we have in this great European Union.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am worried about the Tory party because ... give or take the odd spasm we have always been seen as pragmatic, sensible, good at our job, sane, reasonable and having the interests of the whole country and now it is beginning to look like a Brexit sect.\u201d\n\nSoames also set his sights on Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons. He said the sight of Rees-Mogg lounging on the front bench of parliament was \u201crepulsive\u201d and added: \"He is an absolute fraud, he is a living example of what a moderately cut double-breasted suit and a decent tie can do with an ultra-posh voice and a bit of ginger stuck up his arse. You do not behave like that as leader of the House.\u201d", "description": "Churchill\u2019s grandson calls Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2018an absolute fraud.\u2019", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Emilio Casalicchio", "Alexander Clarkson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166233452-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
