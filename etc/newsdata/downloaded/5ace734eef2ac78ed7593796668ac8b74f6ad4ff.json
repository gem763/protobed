After Washington became the first team to fire its coach this season, the discussion turned to who Snyder might recruit to replace Jay Gruden, how the change will affect first-round rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins\u2019s development and what the Redskins must do to recapture the glory of their increasingly distant past.\n\nOn the same day that Redskins team president Bruce Allen declared that the culture of the organization was \u201cactually damn good,\u201d ESPN \u201cSportsCenter\u201d host Scott Van Pelt, who grew up in the D.C. area, offered a rebuttal. Perhaps no one articulated the state of a once-proud franchise and captured the frustrations of its fan base better.\n\n\u201cAs long as the song remains the same at the top, what\u2019s ever going to be different?\u201d Van Pelt asked during his \u201cOne Big Thing\u201d segment on Monday night. \u201cSo far under Dan Snyder, the team has been coached by the respected coordinator, Norv Turner, the respected NFL head coach, Marty Schottenheimer, who won his last five to get to .500, only to be fired after one year to be replaced by the college guy, Steve Spurrier, who called in his resignation from the golf course. He was replaced by Redskins royalty, Coach Joe [Gibbs], who was under .500 and replaced by Jim Zorn, best described as the guy who would take the job. He went 12-20, just like Steve Spurrier. He was replaced by the coach who won Super Bowls elsewhere. Mike Shanahan got twice as long \u2014 64 games, and he won twice as many games, 24. The symmetry\u2019s astounding. He was replaced by the up-and-coming coordinator who was fired after the 0-5 start.\u201d\n\nAs Van Pelt noted, that\u2019s a coaching search Bingo for Snyder. Where\u2019s Sherm Lewis when you need him?\n\n[Scott Van Pelt on the Redskins: Is anyone at Redskins Park listening?]\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s left to try?\u201d Van Pelt continued. \u201cThe only coach that didn\u2019t have a losing record was Marty, and he was given exactly one year. It\u2019s never the owner or the GM, it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault, and that is a two-decade summary of Dan Snyder\u2019s ownership. So is the fact that FedEx Field has been co-opted by rival fan bases like an 82,000 seat banquet hall available for weddings, birthdays, bas mitzvahes or NFL games. The last four home games have been completely overrun by fans of the Eagles, Cowboys, Bears and Patriots. If not for them, it would have been mostly empty. The Redskins lost all of those games by a total of 79 points. Rock bottom isn\u2019t a moment, it is a seemingly perpetual state, and I\u2019ve been trying to find the parallel for the systemic collapse that has happened here, and I just cannot.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, on \u201cThe Dan Patrick Show,\u201d Patrick called the Redskins\u2019 fan base \u201cone of the best in all of sports\u201d and recalled how beloved the team was when he covered players such as Joe Theismann and John Riggins. Van Pelt remembers those days fondly, too, and Redskins\u2019 ability to bring a city together.\n\n\u201cSnyder grew up there, the same time I did, when Washington was winning three Super Bowls in less than a decade,\u201d Van Pelt said. \u201cThey were a revered franchise that was so intricately woven into the culture of the region, they bridged the racial and socioeconomic differences, they brought together all of the DMV. Season tickets had a waiting list decades long; now you can\u2019t give \u2018em away. Those three hours on Sundays in the fall used to be off limits for anything other than Redskins games. Now they\u2019re endured, if they\u2019re acknowledged at all.\u201d\n\n[Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor is already destined to fail]\n\nVan Pelt bemoaned the fact that former Redskins assistant coaches Sean McVay, Kyle Shanahan and Matt LaFleur are enjoying success as head coaches elsewhere. He wondered who would want the Redskins\u2019 job given Snyder\u2019s reputation as a meddlesome owner, alluding to reports that it was the owner\u2019s decision to draft Haskins, despite the coaching staff\u2019s reservations. Finally, Van Pelt took aim at Allen, who is 42-75 as an executive in Washington, but would have everyone believe the culture in Ashburn is \u201cactually damn good.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine taking liberties with reality like that, selling that line and thinking anybody but you buys it,\u201d Van Pelt said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have seemed less self aware had he shown up to the press conference nude. Mostly, this is just an accounting, a repeating of the facts that will continue unabated as long as things remain status quo. Nothing changes, because nothing ever does. It\u2019s a treadmill to nowhere. That last part, that\u2019s my opinion, and I\u2019d love to be wrong. You want to bet against a couple decades?\u201d\n\nOne Big Thing\n\nThe Redskins pic.twitter.com/tFXt0Q1UYT \u2014 Stanford Steve (@StanfordSteve82) October 8, 2019\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nBruce Allen defends Redskins tenure, says \u2018the culture is actually damn good\u2019\n\nBill Callahan calls Redskins\u2019 interim job \u2018different territory\u2019; won\u2019t start Dwayne Haskins yet\n\nThe Redskins are starting over after firing Jay Gruden, but in what direction are they headed?\n\nPlayers react: \u2018Sorry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you\u2019\n\nHail or Fail: Jay Gruden\u2019s final game as Redskins coach was another dud\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field", "description": "The \"SportsCenter\" host doesn't expect anything to change in Washington as long as Daniel Snyder and Bruce Allen are in charge.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
