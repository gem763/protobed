Our alliance and friendship have never been stronger.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump embracing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Vice President Mike Pence looks on, in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington in March\n\nIn Trump's letter to Netanyahu, the US president wrote 'you are great!' in black Sharpie next to his signature\n\nTrump wrote in the note: 'There has never been a more productive time in the Israeli-American partnership, and I know there are many more victories to come.\n\n'Thank you for your strong leadership and loyal friendship. You are one my closest allies, and I look forward to the continued success we will have working together.'\n\nThe president then added along with a message written in black Sharpie, 'you are great!'\n\nTrump's letter of support came after Netanyahu announced he is unable to form a ruling coalition after the most recent elections.\n\nOn Monday evening Netanyahu said he could not form a new government following a deadlocked September poll.\n\nThis opened the door to his main rival, centrist Benny Gantz, to try and form a government.\n\nGantz has not revealed his strategy but is expected to invite Netanyahu to join him in a national unity coalition, as long as he vacates the office of prime minister.\n\nBut Netanyahu, who celebrated his 70th birthday on Monday, is not ready giving up the reigns of power.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (left) and President Reuven Rivlin at a funeral ceremony yesterday. He thanked Donald Trump on Twitter for his letter of support\n\nTrump also wrote an informal letter to Turkey's president Erdogan in which he tried to persuade him not to invade northern Syria, later adding, 'I will call you later'\n\nOn October 9 Trump tried to cajole his Turkish counterpart, into negotiating with Syrian Kurds instead of invading, a letter released by the White House reveals.\n\nThe president wrote: 'History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen.\n\n'Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!' he wrote, before adding, 'I will call you later.'\n\nTrump told reporters during a press conference at the time that he hadn't given Erdogan 'a green light' for Turkey to invade, and claimed releasing 'a very powerful letter' would dispel misconceptions about the impact of his troop withdrawal from Syria days before he wrote it.\n\nTrump's liberal use of a Sharpie, as seen in his latest correspondence with a world leader, has caused controversy in the past.\n\nIn the lead up to Hurricane Dorian last month, Trump demonstrated to reporters on a map the storm's path as heading towards northern Florida and parts of Georgia.\n\nThe president had earlier claimed parts of Alabama were in the hurricane's trajectory, but the original map issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), did not show Alabama being in its path.\n\nAt a press conference Trump appeared to have made his own alterations to the weather map, showing the storm passing over Alabama.\n\nReporters picked up on the difference between the two maps and dubbed the 'doctoring' of the map the saw the state now circles in black as 'Sharpiegate'.", "description": "President Trump wrote a birthday note to Israeli prime minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu telling him that 'there are many more victories to come'.
