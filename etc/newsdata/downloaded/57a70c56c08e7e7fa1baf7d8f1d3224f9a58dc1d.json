She believed - just as she had somehow continued to believe through the pain of her very public previous failures - but she refused to succumb to her emotions.\n\nThe memories were too raw; the labels still too close. Choker. Bottler. Destined for failure. She could not let it happen again. Not this time. Not with the world title in her grasp.\n\nStep by gentle step she progressed, extending her lead with magnificent run after magnificent jump after magnificent throw until her only real rival, one of the greatest heptathletes in history, tapped out. Nafi Thiam, the Olympic, world and European champion could take it no more.\n\nTroubled by an elbow problem and safe in the knowledge that Johnson-Thompson was untouchable regardless of anything she threw at her, the Belgian donned her tracksuit and walked off midway through the penultimate event. The game was up. With one event still remaining, Johnson-Thompson had all but secured the world title.\n\nStill she gave no hint of what she was feeling. A new target had appeared. Within months of appearing on the global stage as a wide-eyed teenager, Johnson-Thompson had been labelled \u201cthe next Jessica Ennis-Hill\u201d. Surely it was unfair to even ask her to compete with Britain\u2019s athletics queen.", "description": "Over the course of one of the finest performances in recent British athletics history, Katarina Johnson-Thompson remained expressionless.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/04/kjt-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
