We\u2019ll continue our work to prevent abuse of our systems,\u201d a YouTube spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nYouTube first sued Brady in August after learning that he targeted a couple of Minecraft and gaming creators \u2014 \u201cKenzo\u201d and \u201cObbyRaidz\u201d \u2014 by using false copyright claim takedowns. The company removed the videos, as the company is required to do when a claim is submitted.

It also includes statements from YouTube and Brady.", "description": "Alleged copyright troll Christopher Brady will no longer be able to issue false DMCA takedowns to other YouTubers, according to a lawsuit settlement filed.
