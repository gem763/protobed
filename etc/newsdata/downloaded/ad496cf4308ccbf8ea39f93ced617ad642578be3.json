That was an area of potential criminal law outlined by Mueller in his report. Mueller included 10 potentially obstructive acts, without reaching a decision on whether or not Trump should be prosecuted.\n\nA House Democratic impeachment effort could go beyond Ukraine, the top House lawyer said in court Tuesday\n\nThe judge asked Letter if the president could be impeached for lying to the American public. 'I believe so, yes,' he replied, CNN reported.\n\n'I can't emphasize enough, it's not just Ukraine,' he told Judge Howell, a Barack Obama nominee who oversaw the grand jury during the Mueller probe.\n\nIt is ultimately up to House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to decide on what grounds, if any, to vote articles of impeachment. The Constitutional provides few guardrails, stating that Congress may impeach a president for 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'\n\n'The House of Representatives ... shall have the sole Power of Impeachment,' the Constitution states in Article I, Section II.\n\nPelosi has cautioned lawmakers to keep impeachment narrowly focused on the Ukraine matter, where a whistle-blower alleges Trump abused power by asking the president of Ukraine to investigate political opponent Joe Biden and his son's company.\n\nDemocrats are seeking memos known as 302s summarizing interviews with officials as part of the Russia probe\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has urged keeping the impeachment effort narrowly tailored\n\nDemocrats want details on former White House Counsel Don McGahn's interviews, which featured in Mueller's obstruction section\n\nTop House lawyer Douglas Letter was a senior Justice Department official in 2018\n\nThe speaker was also late to jump aboard the impeachment train, having cautioned earlier the effort was likely to fail in the Senate.\n\nShe told ABC's George Stephanopoulos: 'Let's not take it too far afield. That's a matter of the committee to pursue. But for now, just stay focused on what the president did and how does that support our national security, honor his oath of office, and not undermine our electoral integrity.\u2019\n\nShe has not specifically ruled out going in other directions, however, and has not scheduled a formal House vote on an impeachment inquiry, which the White House is now demanding she do.\n\nDemocrats continue to seek FBI 302s, the agent notes on interviews conducted for Mueller's probe. The are particularly interested in interviews with former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who is quoted repeatedly in the Mueller report describing efforts by Trump to fire Mueller and get him to later claim there was no such effort to remove the special counsel.\n\nDemocrats have blasted the administration for stonewalling a range of their investigatory efforts. On Tuesday the Justice Department said it would provide 33 FBI memos, but only in redacted form.", "description": "House General Counsel Doug Letter told a federal judge Democratic impeachment efforts could be go beyond Ukraine, and that Trump could even be impeached for lying to the public.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19459446-0-image-a-8_1570565478032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
