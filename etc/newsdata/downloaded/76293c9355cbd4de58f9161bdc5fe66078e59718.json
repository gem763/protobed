That rival candidate\u2019s own husband, himself a former American president, has his own extensive \u201cties\u201d with Russian interests, including having very publicly meddled in a Russian presidential election with American tax dollars during his tenure in the White House \u2014 to say nothing of the millions of dollars donated to his private foundation by individuals and private entities who had business with his wife while she was serving as secretary of state.\n\nWe live in a globalized economy ruled by an internationalist class of gazillionaires who all have \u201cties\u201d with other internationalist gazillionaires who are always making deals and mucking around with NGOs and speaking at \u201cforums\u201d and lobbying each other\u2019s governments, usually quasi-officially. Under the definitions of \u201ccollusion\u201d and \u201cabuse of authority\u201d currently being bandied about, simply being a member of this class renders one unfit to hold public office.\n\nThere might be a real lesson here after all.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Walther", "Theweek.Com Articles Trumps-Ukraine-Scandal-Second-Coming-Russiagate"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
