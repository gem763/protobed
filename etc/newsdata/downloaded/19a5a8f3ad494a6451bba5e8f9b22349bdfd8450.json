They have a record of ousting presidents.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe have risen to say, in one united voice, \u2018Enough, Mr. President!\u2019\u201d said Oshcu, a small-scale farmer from the indigenous Kichwa community of Latacunga.\n\nLabor unions, women\u2019s rights groups and students all are protesting the austerity package introduced this month by President Len\u00edn Moreno. But Ecuador\u2019s majority indigenous population is now at the heart of the demonstrations that have paralyzed this South American country \u2014 a challenging development for Moreno, given the movement\u2019s success at ousting previous presidents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe country braced Thursday for an eighth day of protests in Quito and other cities, sparked last week when Moreno announced labor and tax changes and withdrew decades-old fuel subsidies \u2014 part of a belt-tightening program required under a $4.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nProtesters have blocked streets in the capital and highways in the countryside; occupied government buildings, oil fields, water-treatment facilities and a hydroelectric plant; and clashed with security forces. Moreno has called for dialogue but says he won\u2019t reverse the austerity measures, which he says are needed after years of overspending by his predecessor, Rafael Correa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary to correct grave economic errors,\u201d he said last week.\n\nAD\n\nMoreno declared a state of emergency and, as protesters descended on the capital this week, moved his administration 270 miles south to the port city of Guayaquil. Security forces have surrounded key facilities and fired tear gas and pepper spray. Five people have been killed, scores wounded and more than 680 arrested. Officials have put economic losses at more than $1 billion.\n\nAD\n\nEcuadorans have a history of ousting presidents, driven mainly by the indigenous movement. Most recently in 2005, Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s attempt to introduce austerity measures under an IMF agreement prompted tens of thousands to protest, and lawmakers voted to remove him.\n\nThis time, CONAIE, the national indigenous federation, is by far the largest organized group protesting. CONAIE President Jaime Vargas says that the community rejects the government\u2019s new reforms and subsidy cuts but that their complaint goes further.\n\n\u201cOur fight is in defense of our territories,\u201d he said. He said measures to appease the IMF have led to increased oil and mining in indigenous lands, actions that \u201cdon\u2019t respect the collective rights of the indigenous people.\u201d\n\nVargas says he won\u2019t speak with the government unless it agrees to reverse the austerity measures and stop selling concessions of their land to oil and mining companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany here have noted parallels between 2005 and 2019. But Vargas has stressed that the indigenous movement is not trying to destabilize Moreno\u2019s government.\n\nPolitical analyst Decio Machado says if the government falls, it won\u2019t be because of the indigenous movement but rather for mistakes he says it has been making since protests began: calling the state of emergency, cracking down on protests and refusing to negotiate over the austerity measures.\n\nOshcu, in Quito, says cutting the fuel subsidies affects indigenous farmers in the countryside directly because it raises the costs of transporting their goods to collection centers.\n\n\u201cWhen the price of gasoline rises, the income for the community decreases,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we came.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nViolent clashes have been reported in cities including Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca. Indigenous demonstrators are putting eucalyptus leaves in their noses to filter the tear gas and pepper spray.\n\n\u201cWe are here for our rights,\u201d Oshcu said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like that idea, then get out of the presidency.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Demonstrations against President Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s austerity measures have paralyzed the South American nation.", "authors": ["Kimberley Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6ucPPdwkCY2hkL75nI9Aiwph4lM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OVO5OHLNEI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
