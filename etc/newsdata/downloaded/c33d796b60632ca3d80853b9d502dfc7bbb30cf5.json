And 61% said that they would switch banks if their bank offered a poor mobile banking experience.\n\nFor channel strategists, the challenge in attracting mobile-minded customers is knowing when to bet budgets and political capital on developing emerging features. It's complicated by most flashy features \u2014 such as voice assistants, smartwatch banking, and bank-offered mobile wallets \u2014 being deemed a \"must\" by analysts, media, and rival banking executives.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThe Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Report uses data to inform channel investment decisions by highlighting which mobile banking features are most valuable to customers. Our study has data on consumer demand for 33 in-demand mobile capabilities across six key categories.\n\nUsing that consumer data, the study benchmarks the largest 20 banks and credit unions in the US by whether they offer the cutting-edge mobile features that customers say they care about most. What sets our benchmark apart is that it weights every feature according to customer demand data \u2014 not subjective analyst opinion.\n\nChannel strategists within financial institutions use our report to see which innovative features they should prioritize in development pipelines and to find out how they compare with rival banks and credit unions in offering those features.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence fielded the Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study to members of its proprietary panel in August 2018, reaching over 1,200 US consumers \u2014 primarily handpicked digital professionals and early-adopters, making our sample a sensitive indicator of emerging features.\n\nHere are a few key takeaways from the report:\n\nCiti snagged first overall . The bank led the account access section, tied for first in account management, and ranked highly in all the other categories of the study . Wells Fargo took second place, leading in security and control and transfers. USAA came in third, NFCU was fourth, and Bank of America rounded out the top five.\n\n. . Demand for security features is sizzling. Following a year of huge breaches being announced at companies like Facebook and Google, consumers' security concerns jumped to become the most important category. The category included the No. 1 feature overall: the ability to turn a payment card on or off.\n\nDigital money management features are also highly demanded. Chase and Wells Fargo may be onto something with their millennial-focused banking apps, Finn and Greenhouse, as the generation had sky-high demand for the six features in the category. The most popular feature in the category was the ability to separate recurring payments, such as Netflix and gym memberships.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nShows how 33 mobile features stack up according to how valuable customers say they are.\n\nRanks the top 20 US banks and credit unions on whether they offer each of those features.\n\nAnalyzes how demographics effect demand for different mobile features.\n\nProvides strategies for banks to best attract and retain customers with mobile features.\n\nContains 63 pages and 30 figures.\n\nThe full report is available to Business Insider Intelligence enterprise clients.
