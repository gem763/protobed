These rankings are not fantasy-driven in any way, though I will include nuggets of more abstract fantasy advice here and there inside the individual team write-ups. Who\u2019s hot, who\u2019s not -- that sort of thing. Send any and all complaints to me on Twitter: @drewsilv. Please believe me when I tell you that I do not hate your team.\n\n1. Houston Astros\n\nRecord: 90-49\n\nLast Week: 1\n\nJustin Verlander pitched the third no-hitter of his career on Sunday afternoon against the Blue Jays, striking out 14 batters along the way as part of a 2-0 victory. The following afternoon, in Houston's series-opening Labor Day matinee against the Brewers, Gerrit Cole racked up 14 strikeouts of his own in an eventual 3-2 extra-innings win. The Astros are the first team in the live-ball era to get 14-plus strikeouts from a pair of starting pitchers in consecutive games. Verlander and Cole have combined for a 2.68 ERA and 523 strikeouts in 369 1/3 total innings this season.\n\n2. New York Yankees\n\nRecord: 90-49\n\nLast Week: 2\n\nThe Yankees beat up on a couple of AL West teams last week, sweeping a three-game series at Seattle before winning two of three against the Athletics. They were then shut out by the Rangers on Monday -- the first shutout against the Yankees since June 30, 2018 -- but this team is currently tied for the best record in baseball and it sounds like Edwin Encarnacion is going to be activated off the IL ahead of Tuesday night's game versus Texas. Encarnacion, out since August 3 with a wrist fracture, has hit 30 home runs in 101 games this year between Seattle and New York.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nRecord: 90-50\n\nLast Week: 3\n\nTop-ranked infield prospect Gavin Lux made his MLB debut on Monday night in Los Angeles and starred with two hits and three runs scored as the Dodgers partied their way to a 16-9 holiday win over the Rockies. The 21-year-old got the call to the majors after batting .347/.421/.607 with 26 home runs, 76 RBI, 10 stolen bases, and 99 runs scored in 113 games this summer between Double-A Tulsa and Triple-A Oklahoma City. He is expected to play regularly against right-handed opponents, at least until Max Muncy returns from a small fracture in his right wrist. And perhaps beyond that.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

Atlanta Braves\n\nRecord: 85-54\n\nLast Week: 4\n\nThe Braves have won five straight games and 13 of their last 15 to keep the surging Nationals at bay in the NL East standings. Josh Donaldson and Dallas Keuchel are drawing most of the attention right now -- Donaldson slugged his 34th home run on Monday while upping his season OPS to .910 and Keuchel has posted a 1.08 ERA over his last four starts -- but the bullpen deserves some love too. Mark Melancon is up to eight saves with Atlanta after closing out Monday's 6-3 victory over the Blue Jays and Shane Greene has made 11 straight scoreless appearances.\n\n5. Minnesota Twins\n\nRecord: 85-52\n\nLast Week: 5\n\nThe Twins earned a 4-3 comeback victory over the Tigers on Labor Day and have now won eight of their last nine to move 5 1/2 games up on the Indians for first place in the AL Central. Minnesota set a new all-time record on Saturday for most home runs in a single season by any team, and that number will continue to climb with 25 games still to play. The combined team home run counter is at 269 after Ehire Adrianza went deep on Monday in Detroit. Max Kepler, who hit a go-ahead two-run single in the eighth inning Monday, is the clubhouse leader in homers with 36.\n\n6. Washington Nationals\n\nRecord: 77-59\n\nLast Week: 6\n\nThe Nationals got tamed by Noah Syndergaard and the Mets on Labor Day, falling 7-3, but they swept a three-game series from the Marlins over the weekend and have rattled off a 58-28 record since May 24. It was on May 23 that Washington fell to a season-worst 12 games under .500 at 19-31. This has been quite a turnaround, and the team currently has a 98 percent chance to advancing to the postseason according to FanGraphs' MLB Playoff Odds. Chasing down the Braves for the NL East title is a tall task, but the Nats are almost assured of claiming a Wild Card spot.\n\n7. St. Louis Cardinals\n\nRecord: 77-60\n\nLast Week: 8\n\nTasked with making up a rainout from back in early June, then getting hit with another rainout on Friday, and already facing a previously-scheduled afternoon tilt for Labor Day, the Cardinals played five games in about 52 hours between Saturday afternoon and early Monday evening. That's a tough ask of any team in any sport, but St. Louis has been on a roll since the All-Star break and kept that momentum going to earn four wins in three days. The Cards are 33-16 in the second half, after carrying a 44-44 record into the break. Look it up: Kolten Wong, right now, is this year's team MVP.\n\n8. Tampa Bay Rays\n\nRecord: 81-58\n\nLast Week: 10\n\nTommy Pham smacked a walk-off RBI single in the bottom of the 10th inning Monday as Tampa Bay beat the Orioles by a score of 5-4. It was the fifth win in a row for the Rays, who are currently a half-game up on the top AL Wild Card spot. Pham went 3-for-4 with a double, three RBI, and his 18th stolen base of the year in that Labor Day matinee versus Baltimore and is now just two steals away from his second career 20-20 season -- he slugged his 20th home run on Saturday. Since the Rays acquired Pham from the Cardinals last July 31, they are 99-64 in games he starts.\n\n9. Oakland Athletics\n\nRecord: 78-58\n\nLast Week: 7\n\nSean Manaea excelled Sunday in his first MLB start since undergoing major shoulder surgery last September, yielding just one hit -- and three walks -- over five scoreless innings against the Yankees. But the A's ultimately lost that one 5-4 due to poor bullpen work and they currently sit a game back of the second AL Wild Card spot. Maybe young left-hander Jesus Luzardo can help. He struck out 10 batters across six innings of one-run ball in his last outing for Triple-A Las Vegas and should join Oakland's active roster after making one start in the Pacific Coast League playoffs.\n\n10. Cleveland Indians\n\nRecord: 80-58\n\nLast Week: 9\n\nIf the Indians are going to stage one final push for the AL Central crown, that push must begin now. They have three more games this week against the White Sox, whom they bullied for an 11-3 victory on Monday, and then they will travel to Minnesota for a massive three-game weekend series versus the division-leading Twins. Those two teams meet again the following weekend for a three-game set in Cleveland. 5 1/2 games is the deficit that the Indians currently face. It's a steep mountain, but it is climbable, and they need to keep racking up wins anyway to keep their spot in the AL Wild Card mix.\n\n11. Chicago Cubs\n\nRecord: 74-63\n\nLast Week: 11\n\nThe Cubs scored zero runs in the final two games of their big three-game weekend series against the Brewers and were held scoreless through six innings of Monday's series opener against the Mariners. But they did eventually bust out versus Seattle, scoring five runs in the bottom of the seventh as part of an eventual 5-1 victory. Kyle Hendricks started that game and lowered his season ERA at home in Wrigley Field to 1.77. There is some concerning iffiness, however, on the status of Yu Darvish. He was scratched from last turn in the rotation due to forearm tightness.\n\n12. Boston Red Sox\n\nRecord: 74-63\n\nLast Week: 12\n\nThe Red Sox had a couple days off last week and were also off on Labor Day, but they've played well when the schedule has called for it, winning four of their last five to remain somewhat relevant in the AL Wild Card hunt. They're fourth in those standings, 5 1/2 games back of the second spot that would secure a postseason berth. Chris Sale (elbow) is likely done for the year, but Boston did get David Price back on Sunday after a three-week absence related to a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) cyst in his left wrist. He worked two scoreless innings in a 4-3 win over the Angels.\n\n13. New York Mets\n\nRecord: 70-67\n\nLast Week: 13\n\nNoah Syndergaard had the worst start of his career last Wednesday versus the Cubs, yielding 10 runs -- nine earned -- in just three innings of work. But he roared back with a brilliant outing Monday afternoon against the division-rival Nationals, striking out 10 batters over seven scoreless frames as the Mets went on to win 7-3. New York also took two of three games from the division-rival Phillies over the weekend, yet a four-game deficit in the NL Wild Card standings is the reality this team faces. Thor needs to keep being Thor, and Marcus Stroman needs to glitz up the Stro Show.\n\n14. Philadelphia Phillies\n\nRecord: 71-65\n\nLast Week: 14\n\nBryce Harper launched his 30th home run of the season and Rhys Hoskins slugged his 26th and 27th as the Phillies earned a 7-1 win over the Reds on Monday afternoon at Great American Ball Park. That came after they beat the Mets by a score of 5-2 on Sunday to avoid a weekend-series sweep. As it stands here on Tuesday afternoon, Philadelphia is 12 1/2 games back of first place in the National League East but only 2 1/2 games back of the second National League Wild Card spot. A lengthy winning streak would not only be nice but is also probably necessary.\n\n15. Milwaukee Brewers\n\nRecord: 70-67\n\nLast Week: 15\n\nThe Brewers managed to take two of three from the Cubs over the weekend, somehow spinning shutouts versus Chicago on both Saturday and Sunday. They carried that momentum into a daunting Labor Day matchup with the Astros and nearly pulled out another thrilling win courtesy of a Christian Yelich game-tying home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. But all that did was send the game into extra innings, and George Springer answered with a towering leadoff shot in the top of the 10th. This team is seven games back in the NL Central and four games back in the NL Wild Card race.\n\n16. Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nRecord: 71-67\n\nLast Week: 16\n\nThe D-backs have won seven of their last eight games, including a lopsided 14-7 victory on Monday against the Padres. Josh Rojas was among the leaders of that barrage of San Diego's pitching staff, providing four hits -- including a double and a homer -- in five at-bats. He finished with two RBI and three runs scored. Rojas doesn't have the prospect-rankings pedigree of baseball's bright young stars, but the former 26th-round pick slashed .332/.418/.606 with 23 home runs, 83 RBI, 33 stolen bases, and 89 runs scored in 105 games this year between Double-A and Triple-A.\n\n17. Texas Rangers\n\nRecord: 68-71\n\nLast Week: 18\n\nMike Minor sat through a three-hour rain delay on Monday in the Bronx before toweling off and delivering 7 1/3 scoreless innings against the dangerous Yankees lineup as Texas went on to win 7-0. It was the first time the Yankees had been shut out this year, and also the first time they had been shut out since June 30, 2018 -- a span of 220 consecutive games. A lot has gone wrong for the Rangers in the second half of this season, but they're poised to finish around .500 and both Minor and rotation mate Lance Lynn could pick up some down-ballot AL Cy Young Award votes.\n\n18. San Francisco Giants\n\nRecord: 66-71\n\nLast Week: 17\n\nThe Giants have lost three straight games, and six of their last seven, and 10 of their last 13. The dream of making the playoffs in Bruce Bochy's final year as manager is pretty much officially dead. A positive note: Mauricio Dubon, acquired from the Brewers at the July 31 trade deadline for pitchers Drew Pomeranz and Ray Black, slugged his first major league home run and his first major league double on Monday against the Cardinals. The 25-year-old looks poised to take over as the new second baseman in San Francisco after slashing .302/.345/.477 this season at Triple-A.\n\n19. Los Angeles Angels\n\nRecord: 65-73\n\nLast Week: 19\n\nIt's been a tough stretch matchups-wise for the Angels, who have played recent series against the Astros, Red Sox, and Rangers, and are lined up for three games against the Athletics this week in Oakland. They have lost eight of their last 10 and appear to be headed for a second straight fourth-place finish in the five-team American League West despite Mike Trout putting together the best year of his career at the plate. Trout has a personal-best 43 home runs in 129 games this season and he's on pace for 119 RBI, which would eclipse his previous high of 111.\n\n20. San Diego Padres\n\nRecord: 64-73\n\nLast Week: 20\n\nThe Padres took three of four from the Giants over the weekend before getting trounced 14-7 by the Diamondbacks on Monday. Cal Quantrill made that Labor Day start for San Diego and allowed eight earned runs over five innings as his season ERA jumped from 3.99 to 4.57. Fatigue is setting in for some of the Friars' younger arms, and there's talk of an early shutdown date for Chris Paddack. The 23-year-old was actually terrific in his last turn through the rotation, but he has already logged 34 1/3 more innings than he did between the minors and majors last year.\n\n21. Cincinnati Reds\n\nRecord: 64-74\n\nLast Week: 21\n\nThe Reds are mostly just playing out the string at this point, but don't tell Aristides Aquino. The 25-year-old Dominican slugger -- nicknamed \"The Punisher\" -- clubbed an upper-deck homer in the bottom of the second inning Monday versus the Phillies, giving the Reds their only run in the 7-1 defeat. It was the 15th home run for Aquino since he got called up from Triple-A Louisville on August 1. He is the fastest player in MLB history to reach 15 home runs, at just 122 plate appearances. Rhys Hoskins previously held that record with 15 home runs in his first 135 plate appearances.\n\n22. Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nRecord: 60-77\n\nLast Week: 25\n\nThe Pirates swept a four-game weekend series at Coors Field, totaling 37 runs across the four games. They've won eight of their last 10, after free-falling out of relevance between early July and the latter part of August. That tumble clouded what has been a career year for Starling Marte, who is batting .323 with a .950 OPS in 213 plate appearances since the All-Star break and has tallied 23 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 126 total games this season. The 30-year-old center fielder carries an $11.5 million club option for the 2020 season and a $12.5 million club option for 2021.\n\n23. Chicago White Sox\n\nRecord: 60-77\n\nLast Week: 22\n\nThe White Sox fell 11-3 to the Indians on Monday for their seventh consecutive loss. That matches the longest losing streak of the year for the Southsiders, and it could easily become eight consecutive losses with Dylan Cease scheduled to take on Mike Clevinger on Tuesday night at Cleveland's Progressive Field. Cease came into the 2019 season as a consensus top-40 prospect, but the 23-year-old right-hander posted a mostly underwhelming 4.48 ERA in 15 starts at Triple-A Charlotte and he owns a brutal 6.92 ERA through his first 10 starts as a major leaguer.\n\n24. Colorado Rockies\n\nRecord: 59-80\n\nLast Week: 23\n\nThe Rockies got embarrassed by the Pirates in a four-game weekend series at Coors Field, losing all four games, and then flew out to Los Angeles on Labor Day to get thrashed by the Dodgers in a messy 16-9 rout. Trevor Story and Nolan Arenado did both homer in that win in Chavez Ravine -- the 30th of the year for Story and the 36th for Arenado. Story now has back-to-back 30-plus home run seasons, and Arenado has a chance to set a new career high, which is currently 42. He has already reached the 100 RBI plateau here in 2019, for the fifth consecutive season.\n\n25. Seattle Mariners\n\nRecord: 58-81\n\nLast Week: 24\n\nThe Mariners rattled off a 7-3 stretch at one point toward the end of August, but the schedule got tougher in a hurry and they have lost six of their last eight entering the finale of a two-game set Tuesday night at Wrigley Field. Justus Sheffield started Monday's opener in Chicago and turned in the best outing of his young career, striking out seven batters over five scoreless innings before the Mariners' bullpen coughed up five earned runs in an eventual 5-1 defeat. Chalk it up as a step forward for Sheffield, at least. The 23-year-old has a 6.16 ERA through his first seven MLB appearances.\n\n26. Toronto Blue Jays\n\nRecord: 55-84\n\nLast Week: 26\n\nThe Blue Jays had the pleasure of handing Justin Verlander his third career no-hitter on Sunday afternoon and then ran into Mike Soroka and the Braves on Monday and fell 6-3. Despite impressive second-half contributions from Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. -- along with a couple of other young hitters -- the Jays are 3-11 over their last 14 games and have fallen to a season-high 29 games under the .500 mark. One cool highlight from Monday: Josh Donaldson returned to Toronto for the first time since getting traded last August and got a big ovation from the Rogers Centre crowd.\n\n27. Miami Marlins\n\nRecord: 48-88\n\nLast Week: 27\n\nThe Marlins got swept by the Nationals over the weekend and are 6-23 since August 3. They haven't won consecutive games since taking two straight from the Diamondbacks in late July. Miami didn't make any significant September callups on Sunday when MLB rosters expanded from 25 to 40, and we apparently aren't going to see pitching pitching prospects Sixto Sanchez and Jorge Guzman, who are up against workload thresholds. In other news, Marlins Park is about to log the lowest attendance total for any MLB stadium since the Expos' final year in Montreal (2004).\n\n28. Kansas City Royals **\n\nRecord: 49-89\n\nLast Week: 28\n\nAdalberto Mondesi returned to action for the Royals on Sunday after missing six weeks with a partially-dislocated shoulder and went 4-for-5 with three stolen bases and two runs scored in a 6-4 victory over the Orioles. It's been a disappointing year in some ways for Mondesi -- the lack of power and the injuries -- but he's second among all MLB players in stolen bases (35) despite appearing in only 83 games, with an outside shot of catching Mallex Smith (39) at the top of that leaderboard. Mondesi has 66 steals in 158 games since the beginning of the 2018 season.\n\n29. Baltimore Orioles\n\nRecord: 45-92\n\nLast Week: 29\n\nThe Orioles picked up some wins toward the end of August, but they lost 5-4 in extra innings versus the Rays on Monday and have now dropped three straight games. One highlight from Monday: Mark Trumbo, who had been out all season due to issues with his surgically-repaired right knee, was activated off the injured list and hit a two-run double in the Orioles' four-run sixth inning. Trumbo has talked about retiring this winter, but maybe he'll make it 10 major league seasons -- he's on his ninth -- if the hits keep coming down the stretch. He turns 34 years old in January.\n\n30. Detroit Tigers\n\nRecord: 40-95\n\nLast Week: 30\n\nThe Tigers couldn't turn a late lead into a victory on Monday afternoon against the Twins, falling 4-3 for their 95th loss of the season. They could reach 100 losses by the time next week's edition of the Rotoworld MLB Power rankings go live, though Detroit does get three against the Royals this week. Miguel Cabrera hit his 10th home run of the year -- in his 119th game of the year -- in Monday's loss to Minnesota. Still owed around $128 million, Cabrera is sporting the lowest slugging percentage (.398) of his celebrated 17-year major league career. His lifetime SLG is .543.", "description": "No change at the top of Drew Silva's weekly MLB Power Rankings, as Justin Verlander and Houston still lead the way. Get up to speed on all 30 teams.
