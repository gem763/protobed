The first jury was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nJames joined forces with the Kurdish People's Protection Units militia (YPG) after writing about shooting a 'Daesh rat' and describing the terrorists as the biggest threat since Hitler.\n\nMr Justice Edis (left) made it clear that the decision to prosecute had been taken by the Attorney General, who was then Jeremy Wright (right)\n\nThe judge said he was powerless to stop the prosecution for preparing acts of terrorism by fighting with the YPG in Syria because the decision to prosecute was a political one and the reason for the decision had not been revealed.\n\nHowever, he threw out the main charge halfway through the original case after ruling that prosecutors had failed to show that James had any ambitions other than fighting ISIS.\n\nJames was convicted of attending a terrorist training camp run by the banned PKK or Kurdish Workers' Party following a retrial\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had taken the decision to pursue James for training and fighting with a Kurdish group, arguing that they were terrorists who were fighting for an independent Kurdistan.\n\nIn a pre-trial judgment, the judge made clear that the decision had been taken by the Attorney General, a Cabinet-level politician, but said he had no clear explanation of why it was taken.\n\nMr Justice Edis, himself a former senior prosecutor, said there was a justification for prosecuting James, because he was likely to harm himself and others in a war zone, but the government had refused to deploy it.\n\nInstead, they made the 'surprising' decision to go into the case only prosecuting on the basis that James was supporting Kurdish nationalism and not fighting against ISIS.\n\nIn pre-trial hearings, Mr Justice Edis said: 'In the end, I am uneasy about the prosecution of a man who is able to say that at least some of the acts of terrorism for which he was preparing or trained were carried out with the support of the RAF.'\n\nJames told police he intended to travel to Turkey and on to Rojava, in the northern part of Syria\n\nBut he said he had 'eventually concluded' that that he was not allowed to 'stay' the prosecution 'despite my unease'.\n\nPolice negotiator was in regular email contact with Aidan James The court heard how a police negotiator was in regular email contact with Aidan James. In one message around Christmas, he wrote: 'I have not heard from you for some time so I wanted to check that you are okay. I imagine that at this time you may feel quite lonely in particular on Christmas Day. 'Being away from your mum and child cannot be easy, particularly when you are facing such conflict in Syria. 'As always I remain available to assist your return home to Liverpool and to support you through that process.' As he made moves to go home, James wrote in his diary of his 'amazing time'. He wrote: 'Lost good friends, met great ones, fought on front line numerous times, killed Daesh soldiers, been shot at many times by ISIS and our own guys. 'Drove humvys (sic), sat on roof as drove through desert, attacked by suicide vehicles many times, mortar fire, sniper RPG, drones, chilled with donkey.'\n\n'I cannot say that it is an affront to the system of justice. The political character of the decision to bring these proceedings is written into statute,' the judge said in his ruling, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\n\nHe made it clear that the decision to prosecute had been taken by the Attorney General, who was then Jeremy Wright.\n\n'That is because decisions about who in foreign conflicts should be prosecuted are often political decisions in that the UK may choose to prosecute those who are its opponents and not those who are its allies, even though their methods might be equally unlawful,' the judge explained.\n\n'These are not judgments that a court can make because the court is not equipped with the relevant advice of the security services and officials, and does not concern itself with UK foreign policy. Those are not matters on which the court is able to adjudicate.'\n\nThe group for which James fought was 'openly supported' by Britain and its military allies and the Foreign Office spoke of the groups having 'made an important contribution to counter-Daesh efforts' and confirmed Britain had provided support by way of airstrikes.\n\nInformal diplomatic relations continue between the YPG and the British Government over the fate of ISIS prisoners captured by the YPG and wanted for terrorism prosecutions in the UK, the court was told.\n\nThe prosecution said that the activities of the YPG amount to terrorism but added that if James's conduct was done 'solely and exclusively' with the intention of fighting against ISIS in Syria he should be acquitted.\n\nJames posted a photo to Facebook in August 2017 of him holding British Airways plane tickets\n\n'The justification of the self-denying ordinance has not been explained,' the judge said. 'Since it involves a decision not to prosecute a person for what are said to be serious criminal offences this is rather surprising.\n\n'I have not been informed of any basis for prosecuting this defendant and not others, or for prosecuting him on the limited basis I have just described. It follows, therefore, that I have not been told of any rational basis on which the Crown has proceeded as it has.'\n\nThe High Court judge also commented: 'The real question in this case is whether it is an affront to the system of criminal justice to prosecute this case, when many other apparently similar cases have not been prosecuted.'\n\nHe said that 'generally, the court would expect some principled explanation for different treatment of analogous cases. There has been no such explanation in this case.'\n\nIn James's case, police had warned the father-of-one that a Prevent case had been opened against him after he made Facebook posts declaring his intention of fighting against 'the sick regime and ideologies' of the caliphate.\n\nJames, who posted this image on Facebook in August 2017, had no previous military knowledge when he set out to join the war\n\nBut he ignored a warning from officers about the legal consequences of fighting in Syria or Iraq.\n\nJames was arrested days later after officers deemed the 'engagement was not considered to have been successful'.\n\nHe told police he intended to travel to Turkey and on to Rojava, in the northern part of Syria, and had been learning Kurdish, reading the Qu'ran and about 'all the conflict that's going on, political stuff'.\n\nJames had to scrap his original departure date at the beginning of May after his passport was seized but it was handed back at a later meeting on July 17, 2017.\n\nIn a journal entry dated that same day, he wrote he was 'still planning on going away to Syria/Iraq' to 'fight this most important of battles against the sick ideology of daesh'.\n\nJames is seen on CCTV going through security gates at Manchester Airport on August 26, 2017\n\nA case was brought against him because as part of his training he joined the PKK or Kurdish Workers' Party which is a banned group in the United Kingdom.\n\nJurors were told James fought alongside banned groups in the region and was no different to fundamentalists who plot to bring carnage to the UK.\n\nThe defendant said he was 'ripped' from 11 years of kickboxing training, but had been turned down by the Army, RAF, Navy and Territorial Army because of his mental health.\n\nAfter spending six months in the war zone he returned to London via Amsterdam and was immediately picked up by anti-terror police officers at Liverpool Airport in February 2018.\n\nHe had been living in supported accommodation before he flew out to Jordan, which he subsequently lost.\n\nJames fought alongside former British soldier James Matthews who served three tours with the YPG, specialising in clearing mines and booby-traps.\n\nA black Islamic State flag with a caption made by James, which reads 'This is the evil flag of the world's enemy ISIS, Daesh. IS flag (took) from a window in Deir Ezzor by me. F*** Daesh!'\n\nMatthews, 43, served with the British Army in Bosnia during the 90s and was featured in The Brits Battling Isis, a Channel 4 documentary about Britons fighting alongside Kurdish forces.\n\nBut he was cleared of attending a place used for terrorist training at the Old Bailey in July last year after the prosecution dropped charges against him.\n\nHis lawyer had slammed the 'extraordinary' decision to charge him in the first place.\n\nAn Old Bailey jury took seven hours and 46 minutes to clear James of attending terrorist training in Syria after a retrial - but they convicted him of attending terrorist training in Mahkmour, Iraq.\n\nJames bowed his head and wept as the verdicts were announced.\n\nMr Justice Edis described the case as 'highly unusual' today and said: 'It remains the case that his motivation in training was to pursue the course of conduct which he did pursue, and so his involvement in training was not to promote any acts of terrorism.\n\nJames posted this image on Facebook of himself and two others in Rojava, Syria, wishing his friends and family a merry Christmas, in this undated photo issued by prosecutors\n\n'His involvement in weapons training alongside the PKK was quite fleeting compared with his involvement in weapons training with the YPJ and I'm not going to say accidental because it isn't so, it was something that happened on his voyage but the ultimate destination was elsewhere.\n\n'During sentence I will bear in mind that this is a highly unusual terrorist case.'\n\nAccording to prosecutors he left the UK with the specific purpose of 'taking part in the violence'.\n\nJames was accused of joining a proscribed group called the PKK or the Kurdish Worker's Party, which was made illegal in 2001 and has a strong left-leaning stance.\n\nThe British Parliament has given the Home Secretary the power to outlaw or proscribe certain organisations linked to terror.\n\nProscription implies that the Secretary of State has concluded that the organisation commits, encourages or participates in acts of terrorism.\n\nAn airport security image of Aidan James taken at Manchester Airport on August 26, 2017\n\nMark Heywood, QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution case against this defendant is that, as a citizen and resident of this country, who did not know and had never been to Iraq or Syria before, and who had no prior military knowledge or experience whatever, and no official sanction at all, he went there for four months to fight.\n\n'He picked one particular cause in foreign conflict and he joined in.\n\n'He had picked his cause and it was the cause of just one of the many groups of people that inhabit that part of the world and would like it to be their own - the Kurdish people, or at least that part of them that is represented by the organised militia that he went to fight with.\n\n'The prosecution case against him is that he went as an individual to Syria to fight with guns and explosives. In doing so, he set out to advance a political and ideological cause.\n\n'In particular, as to the two charges he faces, his attendance at two places of training amounts, in each instance, to a criminal offence, because the law does not permit attendance at terrorist training places, anywhere in the world.'\n\nJames announces his intention to go to Syria to fight against Islamic State in a Facebook post on April 19, 2019\n\nJurors were told James travelled to a safe house in Makhmour, Iraq and lived there between the end of August and the start of October 2017.\n\nMr Heywood said while there he received training with weapons by the PPK, before moving on to Syria until November 4, 2017, where he was further trained by the YPG and went to fight in battles in Syria.\n\nPolice and Prevent officers became aware of Aidan's views following a series of Facebook posts, jurors heard.\n\nIn one on April 19, 2019 he wrote: 'The road to Rojava starts here, few weeks from now will be in Syria fighting side by side with brothers in arms against the sick regime and ideologies of the so called daesh and other Islamic extremist.\n\n'I don't care for people's opinions this is what I want to do and need to do'.\n\nThe officers warned him not to travel for his own safety and offered him help, but suspected their warnings had not worked.\n\nA image issued by prosecutors of a Google Maps search made by James from Turkey to Syria\n\nOn April 28 he was arrested and interviewed by the police while his mother's house was searched.\n\nA journal and his passport were found and retained for a while by investigators, but they announced he would be not investigated further.\n\nJames gave the impression he was intent on travelling, and on 17 July 2017 his passport along with his journal were returned, the court heard.\n\nThe following month he was in the Middle East.\n\nJames denied two counts of attending terrorist training camps. He was cleared of one charge and convicted of the other.\n\nHe was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on November 7.", "description": "Aidan James, 28, of Formby, Merseyside, joined forced with the Kurdish People's Protection Units militia (YPG) after writing about shooting a 'Daesh rat'.", "authors": ["Mark Duell", "Duncan Gardham For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20140994-0-image-a-164_1571932378355.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
