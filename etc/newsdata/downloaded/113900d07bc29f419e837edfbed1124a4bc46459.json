His excitement to get back in the game, on the other hand, is beyond the century-percentage mark and he's very much looking forward to Thursday's start in the Zozo Championship at Narashino Country Club, the first official PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\n\"I'm right on schedule,\" Woods said ahead of the skins game.\n\nTiger Woods gestures on the second hole during The Challenge: Japan Skins golf competition, Monday at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club.

He originally intended to have the surgery in December 2018, but his victory in the Tour Championship three months prior altered those plans.\n\nWoods didn't think he'd have enough time to rehab to get ready for the 2019 Farmers Insurance Open, so he delayed the surgery. And he was playing well.\n\n\"I figured I would keep rolling with it,\" Woods said.\n\nHe rolled all right, right down Magnolia Lane en route to winning the Masters for his 15th major triumph. But after winning his fifth green jacket, Woods' game took a precipitous drop as his knee gradually worsened, to the point he was in pain when kneeling to read putts. The injury also started to bother his back and affect his walking.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the Tour Championship, he had surgery Aug. 20. He started chipping and putting in mid-September. Two weeks later he was hitting full shots and has been playing rounds of golf the past two weeks.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I've been down this road before. I understand what it takes to get through it,\" Woods said. \"I've been kind of battling through this the entire year and trying to piece it together. It's nice to finally get over the hump and feeling good again and to go full speed. It's nice to be able to squat down and read putts.\n\n\"I'm excited for the year-end run. I feel much more fit.\"\n\nWoods, No. 10 in the world, is scheduled to play the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in December. The following week, he could be playing in the Presidents Cup in Australia. As captain, he'd have to pick himself as one of the four discretionary selections to play in the Cup.\n\nJAPAN SKINS: Tiger starts slow as Jason Day runs away with title, $210K\n\nJAPAN: Woods, McIlroy bring star power to inaugural PGA Tour stop in Japan\n\nOPINION: Koepka, Every do their part to change PGA Tour's narrative\n\nWoods last played in the BMW Championship, the second leg of the FedEx Cup playoffs.
