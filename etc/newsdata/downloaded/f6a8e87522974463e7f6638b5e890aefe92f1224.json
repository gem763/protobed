Found at Scarborough beach with blood coming out,' she posted on Facebook, according to Yahoo News.\n\nAfter a number of suggestions including 'alien poop' or ultra-valuable 'whale vomit', the slimy creature was eventually revealed as a toxic sea hare.\n\nSea hares are known to 'ink' when they feel threatened, releasing an ominous red-coloured toxic chemical into the water to cloud their predator's vision.\n\nTheir skin and digestive tract are also toxic to their predators.\n\nProfessor Culum Brown, from Macquarie University's Department of Biological Sciences told Australian Geographic sea hare were 'incredibly common' in Australia.\n\n'Because they graze on the algae, they take up the pigments and sometimes the toxins that's found in the algae, and so their colour is really variable,' he said.\n\n'That's obviously an awesome technique to blend into your surroundings.'\n\nHe compared them to the common snails without shells, and said their name came from their long tentacles which look like the ears of a hare.\n\nProfessor Brown said sea hares were particularly dangerous for inquisitive dogs.\n\nIn 2018, three dogs died in Western Australia after licking sea hares.\n\nA woman taking a walk on the beach stumbled across an alien like creature with 'blood' oozing out of its body (pictured) before taking to social media to find out what it was\n\nThe woman found the strange looking sea creature at Scarborough, north of Brisbane, (pictured) after it had washed up on the shore\n\nWHAT IS A SEA HARE? The Sea hare is a marine snail, found in shallow water and occasionally in rockpools on the low shore. They feed on seaweed and it is thought that this is what gives each Sea hare its colour, e.g. green Sea Hares are eating green seaweeds like sea lettuce whilst the reddish-maroon Sea hares are eating red seaweeds. Sea hares have an internal shell, which is around 4cm long and transparent. Like sea slugs, the Sea hare is a hermaphrodite and they sometimes mate in chains, with an individual acting as both male and female. They lay eggs in long pink threads, which are deposited on seaweed and look a bit like pink spaghetti.
