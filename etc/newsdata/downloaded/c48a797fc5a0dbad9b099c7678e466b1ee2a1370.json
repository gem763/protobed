Learn from it.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nWhen then-Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) made the agonizing decision nearly a year ago to vote against the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, she was well aware that she was probably sealing her doom in her uphill race for reelection.\n\n\u201cClearly, the vote hurt me,\u201d Heitkamp said Monday. \u201cIt energized the Republican base. It for them defined the Democratic Party as \u2014 what I heard over and over again \u2014 the word that basically was used to describe the Democrats was a \u2018mob.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is not the only one who believes the fight that ensued over allegations that Kavanaugh committed sexual misconduct decades ago hurt Democrats in their quest to make gains in red-leaning parts of the country. In focus groups with conservative and moderate white working-class women, the organization Galvanize USA \u2014 which is trying to bring those voters back into the Democratic fold \u2014 was hearing much the same thing.\n\nWhile many of the women said they welcomed the #MeToo movement, they worried about how their husbands and sons would fare in a climate in which \u201cpublic accusations without proof or fair trial are enough to bring down powerful and successful men,\u201d according to an analysis done by the Topos Partnership research organization.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe idea that a single transgression could permanently derail a man\u2019s life is a deeply troubling thought to these women, whose families include husbands, sons, fathers, and nephews who may or may not have behaved blamelessly themselves.\u201d\n\n[Sign up to receive Opinions pieces in your inbox six days a week ]\n\nHere\u2019s why this particular group of voters is important: As we head into the 2020 presidential campaign, white women without college degrees are the shakiest part of President Trump\u2019s base and a slice of the electorate that both parties see as a bellwether.\n\nIn 2016, exit polls and other post-election analyses indicated that Trump won this cohort by more than 20 percentage points, but its support for him has eroded dramatically since then. The latest Post-ABC News poll indicated the president was at best running even with his leading Democratic challengers among white women without college degrees. Only 42 percent said they approve of his handling of the presidency in the survey conducted during the first week of September, which marked a 12-point drop since July.\n\nSo no doubt another fight over now-Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh is one that Trump and the Republicans would love to have \u2014 and might get. According to a new book by two New York Times reporters, Max Stier, a Yale University classmate of Kavanaugh who now heads a well-respected, nonpartisan organization in Washington, claims to have seen Kavanaugh expose his penis to a woman at a drunken college party. That conforms with behavior in a separate incident described by another accuser, Deborah Ramirez. However, the woman Stier claims to remember as the victim in this incident has told friends she has no recollection of this happening.\n\nThere is plenty here that bears examination. Why did the FBI, when it was alerted to Stier\u2019s recollection last fall, neglect to even interview him? And why did it fail to contact people whom Ramirez said could corroborate her account? Was this slipshod investigatory work by the FBI, or was it the product of political pressure the FBI was getting from congressional Republicans and higher-ups in the Trump administration?\n\nWhat is not warranted at this point is the call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment by no fewer than four of the Democratic presidential contenders: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.).\n\nHeitkamp, for one, thinks Democrats should tread cautiously. \u201cThere\u2019s no do-overs\u201d on the Kavanaugh confirmation, she told me. \u201cYou can talk about impeachment. It\u2019s not going to happen. So the important thing is to figure out what in the process went wrong and how do you fix that process.\u201d\n\nThose who favor pushing for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment will argue that there is now more evidence that he committed perjury during his Senate testimony. But this would not come as a revelation to most Americans.\n\nPolling around the time of the Senate confirmation vote showed that only 1 in 4 believed that Kavanaugh was being entirely honest about his actions. \u201cThe problem that he had with his veracity was a pivotal point for me,\u201d said Heitkamp. \u201cI think he lied repeatedly about small stuff, and you know, when people lie about small stuff, they\u2019ll lie about big stuff. But I think for the democracy, it\u2019s more important that you get to what was happening internally at the FBI.\u201d\n\nThe Kavanaugh fight is over. But its unanswered questions need answers. We owe future justices \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 something better than a mystery.", "description": "Impeaching the Supreme Court justice won\u2019t help Democrats.", "authors": ["Karen Tumulty", "Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Karen Tumulty Is A Washington Post Columnist Covering National Politics.
