Thunberg responded in a Twitter thread on Wednesday.\n\n\"As you may have noticed, the haters are as active as ever \u2014 going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behavior and my differences,\" Thunberg said.\n\nShe continued: \"It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus, since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Being different is not an illness and the current, best available science is not opinions \u2014 it's facts.\"\n\nIn referring to being different, Thunberg was likely referencing her Asperger's syndrome, which she credits her fierce activist nature to and has called a \"superpower.\" (At the end of her thread, she used the hashtag \"#aspiepower.\")\n\nOn Monday, Fox News apologized after a right-wing commentator called Thunberg a \"mentally ill Swedish child.\"\n\n\"I honestly don't understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children for promoting science, when they could do something good instead. I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us,\" Thunberg said in her tweets.\n\nThunberg at the Climate Action Summit at United Nations headquarters on September 23.

Activists from the Amazon to Nigeria share their ideas for battling the climate crisis.\n\nThunberg, for her part, chose to troll one critic right back this week. After Trump said she seemed like a \"very happy girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\" the teenager temporarily changed her Twitter bio.\n\n\"A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\" the description read.\n\nThunberg ended her Twitter thread on Wednesday with an invitation to others to join her weekly School Strike for Climate on Friday. An estimated 4 million people around the world took to the streets to demand climate action with Thunberg on September 20, but she has made it clear that such demonstrations should not be seen as one-time events.\n\n\"See you in the streets this Friday!\" she said.", "description": "The 16-year-old climate activist responded to \"haters\" on Twitter, saying they are \"desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis.\"", "authors": ["Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8bc8e62e22af447246128b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
