Now they are linked in box office history, as Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s \u201cJoker\u201d will become the highest grossing R-Rated film ever, taking a record last held by \u201cDeadpool\u201d and its 2018 sequel. And Ryan Reynolds is happy for them\u2026sorta.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d is heading into its fourth weekend in theaters with $788 million grossed worldwide. It is expected by analysts to become the first R-Rated film to gross $800 million this weekend, and has already earned enough to pass the R-Rated record set by \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d last year with $785 million.\n\nAlso Read: 'Joker' Passes Global Box Office Run of 'Justice League' in Just 3 Weekends\n\nIn Hollywood, it\u2019s customary for the makers of a record-setting film to congratulate the movie that beats its record. We saw it earlier this year when James Cameron put out a poster congratulating Marvel Studios for beating \u201cAvatar\u201d for the all-time box office record with \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d The poster featured the dearly departed Iron Man surrounded by atokarina, the woodsprites from Cameron\u2019s alien world.\n\nRyan Reynolds, however, had a much more R-Rated way of congratulating the \u201cJoker\u201d team. His congratulations message featured the now-iconic image of Phoenix\u2019s Joker dancing atop the Bronx stairs, with each of the steps labeled with the protagonists of the R-Rated films \u201cJoker\u201d has passed. Along with Deadpool are Hugh Jackman, The Wolfpack, Pennywise, and Jesus.\n\nAnd above Joker\u2019s head is one simple declaration: \u201cYou motherf\u2014er.\n\n\n\n\n\nR-Rated box office congratulatory posts aren\u2019t like the ones you\u2019re used to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/OTy2BqIP4f\n\n\u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly when Reynolds will have another shot at taking back his \u201cUnder 17 Requires Accompanying Parent\u201d title, but we do know he will have it. Though 20th Century Fox is now owned by Disney, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn says that there are still plans to release a \u201cDeadpool 3\u201d in the future.\n\nRead original story Ryan Reynolds Congratulates \u2018Joker\u2019 for Breaking \u2018Deadpool\u2019 Box Office Record: \u2018You Motherf\u2014er\u2019 At TheWrap", "description": "Joker and Deadpool have a lot in common.
