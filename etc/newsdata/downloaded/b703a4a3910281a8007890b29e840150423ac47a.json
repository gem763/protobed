USA TODAY\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow has taken a comfortable lead in the USA TODAY Network weekly Heisman survey. Then again, his lead is only as comfortable as his next game.\n\nBurrow was named first on 14 ballots and second on six others in this week\u2019s survey of official Heisman electors who work for USA TODAY Network properties. His passing numbers in the Bayou Bengals\u2019 23-20 win against Auburn were impressive enough, 32-of-42 for 331 yards and his 30th touchdown of the season. But he also demonstrated his toughness in the hard-hitting affair, setting the tone with a third-down scramble in the first half that preserved a scoring drive. That might have helped cement his lead in the survey this week. Well, that and the fact that his nearest pursuer\u2019s team lost.\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow prepares to throw a pass during the first half against Mississippi State. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP)\n\nOklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts slid to a more distant second, though he did his best to rescue the Sooners from a 25-point deficit before coming up short 48-41 at Kansas State. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who didn\u2019t play this weekend while recovering from an ankle procedure, remains in third place. The Crimson Tide handled Arkansas without him, but he is expected to return \u2014 and will be needed \u2014 for Alabama\u2019s head-to-head showdown with Burrow and LSU on Nov. 9.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Oklahoma falls to No. 9 and the American Athletic shows strength\n\nTIGERS MOVE UP: LSU now No. 2 behind Alabama in Amway Coaches poll\n\nThree different Ohio State players occupy the fourth through sixth spots following the Buckeyes\u2019 dominant performance against Wisconsin. Defensive end Chase Young was listed most frequently on nine ballots. Running back J.K. Dobbins and QB Justin Fields also earned notice. All of those top six will be off this coming weekend.\n\nWake Forest wide receiver Sage Surratt was the only other player mentioned this week with a single point.", "description": "LSU quarterback Joe Burrow is the new front-runner for the Heisman Trophy ahead of Jalen Hurts, Tua Tagovailoa as college football enters November.", "authors": ["Eddie Timanus", "Published A.M.
