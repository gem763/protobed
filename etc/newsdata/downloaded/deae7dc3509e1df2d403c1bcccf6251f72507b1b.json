I don't mind having your bum as my view for the rest of the train ride. By all means, have a seat on the table.\"\n\nMore than 200 people commented on the post, sharing their shock at the other man's behaviour.\n\nOne person proclaimed: \"What a rude w*****!\"\n\nAnother said: \"This would annoy me so much. Such an invasion of personal space!\"", "description": "A man has shared his fury after a commuter on his train decided to sit on the table in front of him instead of on a seat", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20690082.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-KNM_RUDE_COMMUTER_SHAMED_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
