REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns and other records from the president\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA on Aug. 29 as part of a criminal investigation. The scope of that investigation is unclear.\n\nTrump sued Vance last month in Manhattan federal court, saying a sitting president is immune from criminal investigation. Vance has moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the dispute belongs in state court, where a grand jury issued the subpoena.\n\nIn a filing in Manhattan federal court, the Justice Department said the dispute should stay in federal court because Trump\u2019s claims \u201cimplicate the very relationship between the federal and state governments,\u201d while \u201cthe state\u2019s interest in litigating such an unusual dispute in a state forum is minimal.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government is not a party to the case, and the Justice Department did not take a position on whether Vance should get the tax returns.\n\nMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for Trump, and a spokesman for Vance\u2019s office both declined to comment on the filing.\n\nVance\u2019s office has agreed to not seek to enforce the subpoena until Oct. 7, or two business days after the judge rules on Trump\u2019s challenge, whichever comes first.\n\nMazars, also named as a defendant in Trump\u2019s lawsuit, said in a statement it would \u201crespect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d It said that as a matter of policy, it did not comment on its work for clients.\n\nWhile campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old convention of candidates releasing their tax returns publicly. His lawsuit against Vance is one of several efforts to shield his personal finances from investigation.\n\nTrump is separately trying to block Deutsche Bank AG from handing over financial records for him, several members of his family and his company to Congress. The bank has said the records include two individuals\u2019 tax returns.\n\nA federal appeals court in Manhattan heard arguments in that case on Aug. 23 and has yet to rule.", "description": "A dispute over whether New York state prosecutors can obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns raises \"significant constitutional issues\" and should be decided in federal court, not state court, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436469198&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911XM"}
