But now, on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, he has revealed his face for the very first time.\n\nBadiucao's name is a pseudonym adopted years ago, when he began posting caustic political cartoons lampooning the Chinese Communist Party online. He was quickly banned from Chinese social media and forced to operate outside the Great Firewall, China's vast online censorship apparatus.\n\nIn 2009, Badiucao moved to Australia, where he has since become a citizen, renouncing his Chinese passport. But even then, he did not reveal his identity. Like the UK-based graffiti artist Banksy, he operated in the shadows, carrying out most of his work online or on the streets, and only appearing at exhibitions in heavy disguise.\n\nDuring the filming of a documentary about his work -- which aired Tuesday night on Australian television -- Badiucao and director Danny Ben-Moshe initially went to extreme measures to maintain this secrecy. At home in Melbourne and during a year working with world famous Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in Berlin, Ben-Moshe filmed Badiucao from behind, or in disguise, taking care to avoid anything that could be used by the Chinese authorities to identify him.\n\n\"Most of the shots were of my back, avoiding showing the shape of my body,\" Badiucao told CNN in a phone interview. \"We were also aware of showing my fingerprints or the shape of my ear. AI technology has evolved so much that I was worried even a bit of my body could compromise my identity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 9 Credit: \"Two Chinas\": A December 2016 cartoon on US President Donald Trump's apparent questioning of the \"One China\" policy badiucao\n\nAs he reached the end of the process however, Badiucao realized that his hard fought anonymity no longer offered the protection it once did. In November last year, he was forced to pull out of a Hong Kong show at the last minute, amid concerns for his safety.\n\n\"My identity had been compromised,\" he said. \"The choice is clear: I either disappear or I step out and confront (the Chinese government) face-to-face.\"\n\nThe documentary shows Badiucao receiving news that members of his family in China had been contacted by the country's authorities. He wrestles with the decision to cancel his Hong Kong exhibition, with organizers, including Hong Kong Free Press and Reporters Without Borders, eventually taking the decision out of Badiucao's hands, fearing for the safety of his family and show attendees.\n\nIn one of the last shots of the film, the camera pans out to show Badiucao unmasked. His hair is cropped short, and he wears round glasses and a goatee.\n\nIn a shot from the film \"China's Artful Dissident,\" artist Badiucao shows his face for the first time in public.

I'm willing to be that dumb person.\"\n\nBadiucao takes part in a recreation of the iconic \"Tank Man\" photo from the Tiananmen Square protests of June 1989.

Badiucao's parents also live in Australia, and he is not in touch with other family members still in China.\n\nHe hopes that, by publicly revealing his identity, he can reduce pressure on people no longer in any position to influence him. A public profile may also help protect him against any future retaliation, he said.\n\n\"Because I will be monitored by media and human rights NGOs, in that way I will be safer,\" he said. \"In that case, I don't think being public is a bad thing.\"\n\nThe artist is, however, concerned that he may become a target for what he described as \"ultranationalists\" in China, who may seen his actions as a challenge to Beijing.\n\nBadiucao appears in the documentary \"China's Artful Dissident.\" For years he has hidden his identity for security fears.

Following the cancellation of his Hong Kong show, he went quiet for almost six months, worrying in private about what to do.\n\nRelated video: The unlikely evolution of artist Xu Zhen\n\n\"Showing my face (is) definitely a release for me,\" he said. \"I don't need to live a double identity life anymore, it also removes barriers (in) my social life, and makes it easier to develop my career as an artist.\"\n\nThis picture taken on May 28, 2019 shows Chinese cartoonist Badiucao standing behind his artwork titled 'Light' in his studio in Melbourne.

Badiucao -- or Badi for short -- has gotten so used to the moniker, once adopted as a deliberate nonsense term to hide his identity, that it feels more familiar than the one he was given by his parents.\n\n\"I have been Badiucao for at least six years,\" he said. \"I'm not used to being referred to by my real name.\"", "description": "On the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the Chinese dissident has revealed his identity in a TV documentary.", "authors": ["Hong Kong"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190605083600-badiucao-0528-01-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-04"}
