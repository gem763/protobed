Was smart money buying up Bitcoin from retail investors dumping their crypto at a loss? Or is the HODL effect spreading like wildfire, and more and more crypto investors are buying up as much of the limited Bitcoin supply ahead of the halving?\n\nNumber of Addresses HODLing More Than 1000 BTC Spikes Amidst Bear Market\n\nHolding through bear markets may be painful and even frightening for bullish investors who bought high, but don\u2019t want to sell low.

Just ahead of the April 2019 rally that sent the asset parabolic, yet another spike happened, taking the number from a bear market low around 1500 addresses with 1000 BTC or more, to 2000 \u2013 or a 25% total rise.\n\nBitcoin addresses holding more than 1000 BTC seems to rise just ahead of any major drops, and the metric did once again just ahead of the September 24 drop that sent Bitcoin below $10,000 to its current trading range.\n\nIt\u2019s now at a five-year high, according to a chart shared by Glassnode \u2013 a crypto market analysis and data intelligence firm.\n\nAre Whales and Smart Money Accumulating Bitcoin Ahead of the Halving?\n\nBut what exactly does this mean? For one, it could mean that smart money or whales had been accumulating Bitcoin at the lowest prices possible after the massive retail selloff following the 2017 bubble.\n\nAccording to Wyckoff\u2019s accumulation model, the best investors load up on an asset at its bottom and then drive up the prices in a markup phase. This appears to be exactly what happened, suggesting that Bitcoin was accumulated heavily, and this is just the start of the markup phase.\n\nRelated Reading | Experts Weigh In On The Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain\n\nAlternatively, the store of value narrative and digital scarcity of Bitcoin could have caused the HODL effect to spread, and crypto investors to try and buy up as much of Bitcoin\u2019s incredibly scarce supply ahead of an upcoming supply reduction in May 2020.\n\nThere are only 21 million BTC that will ever exist, and although 1000 BTC is only just 0.004% of the supply, the number is quite significant when considering the world\u2019s population and the cryptocurrencies use case of potentially replacing money as we know it.\n\nAnd while 0.004% of the BTC total supply may seem insignificant, this amounts to over $8 million USD at current prices.", "description": "A new data set has emerged that shows the growth in Bitcoin addresses holding more than 1000 BTC, and it is currently experiencing a new high following", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-whale-addresses-shutterstock_776180275-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
