He sang embellished first-person accounts of shootouts with police, immigration, murder and survival that became popular, especially in southeast Los Angeles, in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nBut while the trapcorrido musicians of today grew up hearing corridos, and could relate to some of the themes, their lived experiences were very different. They grew up in metropolitan California cities. They listened to hip-hop and rap music. They wear Air Jordans, Gucci and Balenciaga. Rap culture was a formative part of their upbringing.\n\nJose Leon, known as Mint, designs clothing for Arsenal Efectivo and other trapcorrido groups. He combines expensive fashion with urban street wear \u2014 embroidered jackets and expensive athletic shoes.\n\n\u201cThis movement is about something different,\u201d said Mr. Leon, 33, minutes before Arsenal Efectivo took the stage in Inglewood. He called it a trend born of the second-generation Mexican-American experience.\n\n\u201cAll of us grew up in places like South Central, and some of us grew up in the \u2019hood,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople used to wear hats and cowboy boots, but these boys don\u2019t want to wear that anymore. They want to wear what they wear in the streets. It\u2019s a whole new wave.\u201d\n\nJosh Kun, a professor and director of the University of Southern California Annenberg School of Communication, believes that corridos, as a form of music that exists along and on both sides of the United States-Mexico border, lend themselves naturally to collaboration with other genres.", "description": "\u2018Trapcorridos\u2019 \u2014 tales of love, bandits, heroes and gangsters \u2014 are a sensation in California and Mexico.", "authors": ["Walter Thompson-Hern\u00e1ndez"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/fashion/16trapcorridos1/16trapcorridos1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
