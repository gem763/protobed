Below, Ravetch remembers working with the actor, with whom he maintained a close relationship up until Forster\u2019s death.\n\nIf you look him up on IMDb, he has 187 acting credits.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nYou may know him as Max Cherry from Tarantino\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown.\u201d I first knew him as a child in the 1970s series, \u201cBanyon.\u201d\n\nBut his greatest role isn\u2019t listed on IMDb. He was first and foremost a remarkable father to his four children. Their profound love for him is impressive testimony to what kind of dad he was. He spent the last decade setting them up, not with trust funds, not with bank accounts, but with small apartment buildings so the building itself would provide them with an income (and, alas, headaches from renters), but they would be taken care of one day when he was no longer here.\n\nThat day came today.\n\nHe fought brain cancer with bravery and courage and determination until it became clear that it was a fight he could not win. He made the decision to enjoy his final moments with his family while he was still totally himself taking matters into his own hands at the time of his own choosing surrounded by the family he loved.\n\nLast night he wanted to talk about \u201cHamlet\u201d as he pondered the line, \u201cTo die, to sleep, to sleep, perchance to dream. Ay there\u2019s the rub\u2026\u201d\n\nHe repeated it over and over, \u201cAy, there is the rub!\u201d\n\nWhen he phoned this morning, I called him by his childhood nickname, \u201cFactory Bob\u2026\u201d and without missing a beat he said, \u201cFactory Bob\u2026who needs a job!\u201d We broke into laughter, genuine, sweet, unbridled laughter.\n\nTonight, his final movie debuts on Netflix: \u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Story.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t speak long this morning, \u201cI don\u2019t do long goodbyes, Josh\u201d and he ended the call with the phrase he always used, \u201cSee you on the next bounce\u2026\u201d\n\nBut this time he added another phrase, \u201c\u2026and I love you.\u201d\n\nI was blessed to have him participate in five of my plays. His presence made my plays far better than they possibly could have been without him.\n\nThere are people who profoundly influence your life\u2026\n\n\u2026for me, he was one of those people.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
