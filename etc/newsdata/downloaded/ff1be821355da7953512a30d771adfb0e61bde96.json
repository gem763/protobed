As at other recent political rallies, Trump responded by questioning his opponents' patriotism in front of adoring supporters in a Republican-friendly state.\n\nThe president peppered his speech with bracing claims that Democrats \u2013 \"leftists, socialists, and globalists\" \u2013 are trying to \"overthrow the results\" of the 2016 election. He called them \"crazy\" and \"sick\" and said he doesn't believe they love their country.\n\nDemocrats said Trump's recent harsh rhetoric reflects another emotion: Fear.\n\n\"The fact that he feels the need to do a rally in Texas suggests to me that he knows that he is going to be impeached in the House,\" said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. \"And so he has to throw all this red hot rhetoric to his base to help build up a firewall in the Senate.\"\n\nHe added: \"To me it\u2019s a sign of weakness.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at American Airlines Arena in Dallas, Texas, on Oct. 17, 2019. More\n\nSyria, Doral and impeachment\n\nThe pro sports arena in Dallas where Trump rallied was nearly full, but not totally. Trump delayed his speech by some 40 minutes as fans filled in what had been empty upper decks behind the stage. \"Will be out shortly as we wait for more of you to get in!\" he tweeted about 20 minutes after his remarks were supposed to have started.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Trump hosted fundraisers in Fort Worth and attended the ribbon-cutting of a new Louis Vuitton factory before arriving at the American Airlines Center in downtown Dallas.\n\nAs Trump traipsed through Texas, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney held a rare news briefing at the White House and said Trump held up financial aid to Ukraine \u2013 a central point in the impeachment investigation \u2013 because of concern about corruption in Kyiv. Mulvaney later rowed back on an assertion that Trump had wanted Ukraine officials to look into the 2016 election before freeing the money.\n\nMulvaney also announced that Trump would host next year's G-7 economic summit at his golf club in Miami. Critics called it another example of Trump using his position to enrich himself.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, was in Turkey negotiating a ceasefire in the Turkish invasion of Syria. Turkey agreed to halt its military assault in Syria for five days.\n\nAlso during the Texas trip, Trump announced that Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2013 who is involved in the Ukraine investigation \u2013 would be leaving the Cabinet by the end of the year.\n\nTrump praised Perry during the rally in Dallas, and touted the ceasefire as a way to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\n\"It was unconventional what I did,\" Trump said. \"Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while; then people find out how tough the fighting is ... It's like two kids ... you gotta let them fight and then you pull them apart.\"\n\n'Crazy' Democrats\n\nWhile attacking the impeachment inquiry, Trump defended his July phone call with the president of Ukraine by saying he only wanted to see an investigation of corruption. He accused Biden and his son Hunter Biden over the latter's business interests in Ukraine and China, though there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Texas fans were in as aggressive a mood as Trump, cheering as Trump assailed \"Crazy Nancy\" Pelosi, the House Speaker who authorized the impeachment inquiry; Hillary Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2016 election; the Bidens; the \"fake news\" media; and critics in general.", "description": "Donald Trump Trump told Texas supporters at a rally in Dallas that next year's election puts \"the survival of American democracy itself\" at stake.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Courtney Subramanian", "John Fritze", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b_.TQM8miZTqOKBWIeujMA--~B/aD0zMjczO3c9NDkwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/dd63ea2b1f55fb9fd6a53d82bdb236d2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
