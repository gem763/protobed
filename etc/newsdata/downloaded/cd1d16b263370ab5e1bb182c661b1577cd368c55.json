They\u2019re judges and when judges try to act like politicians, it normally ends badly.\u201d\n\nWhile denouncing the violence that has disfigured the traditionally peaceful independence movement, Mas said he took his hat off to \u201cthe massive mobilisation by people who realise they need to oppose this sentence and its consequences\u201d.\n\nOn Friday an estimated 525,000 people gathered in Barcelona to protest against the sentence and call for the release of jailed and exiled independence leaders. The city\u2019s Sagrada Familia church was closed after protesters blocked its entrance and later in the evening there were violent clashes as separatists hurled rocks and fireworks at police, who responded with teargas and rubber bullets.\n\nHowever, Mas, who governed Catalonia between 2010 and 2016 and set the region on its collision course with Madrid by staging a symbolic, non-binding independence referendum five years ago, acknowledged that mistakes had been made.\n\nThe current crisis began when Mas\u2019s successor, Carles Puigdemont, announced a unilateral independence referendum in June 2017.\n\nThe poll, staged in defiance of the Spanish government, courts and constitution, was held on 1 October that year and followed three weeks later by a unilateral declaration of independence in the regional parliament.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the independence movement has made three mistakes,\u201d said Mas. \u201cThe first is that it was in too much of a hurry and set out timeframes that were too short; it was making excessive demands of itself. The second mistake was the lack of internal unity \u2013 too often, there\u2019s been a lack of unity within the movement and that\u2019s still partly the case now.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artur Mas, who was banned from public office for two years, has not ruled out a return to Catalan politics.

We need to learn from those three mistakes.\u201d\n\nMas conceded that the independence movement needed to do more to win hearts and minds in Catalonia, where support for secession has never risen above 48.7%, and where pro-independence parties have never managed to take 50% of the vote in regional elections.\n\nThe snap Catalan regional election called by the Madrid government and held in December 2017 saw the three pro-independence parties retain their absolute majority in the Catalan parliament, winning 70 of its 135 seats. Between them, they took 47.7% of the vote. But the biggest single winner was the staunchly anti-independence Citizens party, which took 37 seats.\n\nAlthough Mas admitted that there is still not \u201ca decisive majority in favour of independence\u201d, he said another referendum needed to be held to settle the matter and heal the fractures within Catalan society.\n\nPolls suggest that the vast majority of Catalans are in favour an official referendum held with the Spanish government\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a solution that doesn\u2019t involve a referendum because people want to take the decision over the future of the country, whether they\u2019re in favour of independence or against it,\u201d said Mas.\n\n\u201cThe results may not be wholly positive but the current reality isn\u2019t exactly positive either.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that voters could be asked two questions in the referendum: whether they wanted to renegotiate their relationship with the central government with a new statute of regional autonomy, or whether they favoured independence.\n\n\u201cIn any case, I think there has to be a referendum and people have to be allowed to vote on independence.\u201d\n\nMas, who was barred from holding public office for two years after being convicted of disobeying the Spanish constitutional court by holding the symbolic independence referendum in 2014, said he is stunned by what has happened in the past two years.\n\nHe would never have imagined the nine politicians would end up in prison for sedition, nor that Puigdemont would end up in exile after fleeing to Belgium to avoid arrest and is now fighting to avoid extradition.\n\n\u201cI knew there could be legal consequences \u2013 I suffered them myself \u2013 but I thought they would be punished for disobedience with fines and not with charges of sedition,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not you\u2019re in favour of independence, the sentences trample all over basic rights.\u201d\n\nMas\u2019s ban on holding office has now ended. While he feels his political career is complete, he is not ruling out a return to office given the turbulent state of Catalonia. \u201cWe\u2019re living in such exceptional circumstances that I can\u2019t offer a decisive no,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to run. But the circumstances in the country are what they are and I\u2019m keeping an eye on what\u2019s happening \u2013 and what\u2019s happening within my own party \u2013 and I\u2019ll take a final decision when the time comes. But if I had to give an answer now, it would be no.\u201d", "description": "Artur Mas, who oversaw first referendum in 2014, explains why he thinks another is needed to calm the crisis", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a98c81dc75f6d8264bdb4134ef987302e454c70a/0_402_5128_3076/master/5128.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=317865635d6b3c871533cea35729de6d", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
