He is named together with his elder brother, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, in an indictment related to cocaine trafficking released by the US Department of Justice in February this year.\n\nChapo Guzm\u00e1n had two other wives and at least six more children.\n\nThe murder of 22-year-old Edgar Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez in a Culiacan parking lot May 2008 sparked a major turf war between Chapo and his former allies from the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva cartel that raged for years.\n\nThe Sinaloa public security secretary, Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda, told Milenio TV that as well as roving shootouts and barricades, the chaos included a mass jailbreak of between 20 and 30 inmates.\n\n\u201cWe are inviting people to get off the streets until we have re-established control of the city,\u201d he said.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n, whose cartel was once billed as the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the world, was sentenced to life in prison by a US federal court in January.\n\nOver the course of decades in the business, the 62-year-old had been arrested three times \u2013 twice in Mexico and once in Guatemala \u2013 and managed to make two spectacular escapes from high security Mexican jails.\n\nChapo\u2019s second arrest in 2014 took place in the port city of Mazatl\u00e1n without a shot being fired. He was in the company of his third wife and their two baby daughters at the time.\n\nTwo of the drug lord\u2019s eldest sons, Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, have appeared to lead the family\u2019s bid to retain control of the cartel after his final downfall began with his third arrest in January 2016.\n\nBoth sons were reportedly kidnapped in August of that year from a swanky restaurant in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta by the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s then up and coming rival the New Generation Jalisco Cartel. Officials only ever confirmed the abduction and release a week later of Jes\u00fas Alfredo.\n\nMexico after El Chapo: new generation fights for control of the cartel Read more\n\nHis last arrest, in 2016, and subsequent extradition to the US triggered a power struggle within the cartel, in which one of the factions was reportedly led by the highest-profile of his many children, Ivan Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar.\n\nThursday\u2019s shootouts initially prompted rumours that they were triggered by the arrest of Ivan Archivaldo.\n\nAs the shootouts spread terror around the city, there was no word from state or federal authorities other than advising people to stay at home. Locals fled the streets, with many taking refuge inside businesses and shops.\n\n\n\n", "description": "In Culiac\u00e1n, masked men exchange gunfire with security forces and erect burning barricades as armed trucks patrol", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8079827f3a283bde180cd9a014440070aca2fa86/0_19_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf7a85d565e9682e4791cd8ffbe5f611", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
