They should be household names already, and if they\u2019re not, they will be by the end of the postseason.\u201d\n\nThere are guys like that all around, even if players like the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Cody Bellinger and New York Yankees\u2019 Gleyber Torres have already had a taste of this time of year.\n\nSoto announced his presence as a teen in 2018, finishing second in NL Rookie of the Year voting after collecting 22 homers and 70 RBIs while learning how to play left field on the fly, but Washington didn\u2019t reach the playoffs. He followed that up with 34 homers and 110 RBIs this year while moving into the cleanup spot.\n\nHe\u2019s eager to get a chance to learn what October is about, saying, \u201cI want to see how the crowd is going to be. I want to see what my emotions are like.\u201d\n\nRobles, who got one at-bat in the 2017 NL Division Series, played his first full season in the majors this year, producing 17 homers, 65 RBIs and 28 steals, along with 12 outfield assists, the fourth-highest total in the sport.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody looser than Victor Robles in our dugout. I can tell you that right now. Don\u2019t be surprised if you see him dancing before the game,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThat\u2019s who he is, that\u2019s what he does.\u201d\n\nSoto will turn 21 on Oct. 25, and his first legal drink in the U.S. could come during a champagne celebration after the World Series. Robles said that when he and Soto embraced last week during the music-filled clinch party, \u201cWe were looking back at how we had discussed getting to this point. It\u2019s something we talked about together, the whole time we were coming up.\u201d\n\nAs for what they should expect now, Robles shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u201cBaseball is baseball. It\u2019s going to be the same baseball, even in the postseason,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cBut, yes, the adrenaline on our end is a little more heightened, and the adrenaline from the fans is a little more heightened, yes. Every game really matters, every play really matters.\u201d\n\nHere are other up-and-coming players whose October debuts could matter:\n\nKESTON HIURA, MILWAUKEE BREWERS\n\nPosition: Second base\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 Stats: .303, 19 HR, 49 RBIs, .570 slugging, .938 OPS\n\nWhy He\u2019s Important: Called up from the minors in May, his hitting has been so valuable, he even spent time in the cleanup spot.\n\nQuote: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any expectations on how I should play. The atmosphere\u2019s just going to feel a little differently.\u201d - Hiura.\n\nJACK FLAHERTY, ST. LOUIS CARDINALS\n\nPosition: Starting pitcher\n\nAge: 23; turns 24 on Oct. 15\n\n2019 Stats: 11-8, 2.75 ERA, 33 starts, 231 Ks, 196 1/3 innings, 0.968 WHIP\n\nWhy He\u2019s Important: The righty went to the mound on the last day of the regular season to seal the NL Central title, an indication of how much he means to his club.\n\nQuote: \u201cHe\u2019s got that ability to pitch. He\u2019s smart, works hard. I didn\u2019t have any doubt he was going to be a good pitcher in this league and right now he\u2019s proving that.\u201d - Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina.\n\nMIKE SOROKA, ATLANTA BRAVES\n\nPosition: Starting pitcher\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 Stats: 13-4, 2.68 ERA, 29 starts, 142 Ks, 174 2/3 innings\n\nWhy He\u2019s Important: After missing the 2018 playoffs because of an injury, his emergence adds key depth for Atlanta as it takes on St. Louis in an NL Division Series.\n\nQuote: \u201cHe carries himself like he\u2019s been around a long, long time. He knows exactly what he\u2019s trying to accomplish and that\u2019s very rare in somebody. He\u2019s got all the tools to be great.\u201d - Braves catcher Brian McCann.\n\nYORDAN \u00c1LVAREZ, HOUSTON ASTROS\n\nPosition: Designated hitter, outfielder\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 Stats: .313, 27 HRs, 78 RBIs, .655 slugging, 1.067 OPS\n\nWhy He\u2019s Important: Called up in June, he collected three consecutive AL Rookie of the Month awards and added pop to an already dangerous lineup.\n\nQuote: \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s hard to believe. He\u2019s probably one of the best young hitters in baseball right now. But what I like about him is how humble and how hard he works every day.\u201d - Astros second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve.\n\nLUIS ARRAEZ, MINNESOTA TWINS\n\nPosition: Infielder, outfielder\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 Stats: .334, 4 HR, 28 RBIs, .399 on-base percentage, 29 Ks\n\nWhy He\u2019s Important: Too few plate appearances to win the batting title, but otherwise would have finished second in the AL; versatility was a huge help with all of the injuries Minnesota had to outfielders. He sprained his ankle on the last day of the season, making his ALDS availability a question.\n\nQuote: \u201cHe has tremendous feel and he has tremendous awareness. We\u2019ve seen that from him over and over again. We\u2019ve seen it in the batter\u2019s box. He does things innately.\u201d - Twins manager Rocco Baldelli.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Dave Campbell, Fred Goodall, Beth Harris, Keith Jenkins, Janie McCauley and Kristie Rieken and AP freelancers Larry Fleisher and Brian Stull contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Juan Soto and Victor Robles took a moment to themselves off to the side of the clubhouse mayhem as the Washington Nationals celebrated clinching an NL wild card.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/phillies_nationals_baseball_00897_c0-106-2528-1579_s1770x1032.jpg?e5394d51d02a14aef8bde689394537542f8943bb", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
