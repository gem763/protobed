There will be 105 women running to represent the Conservative Party in the House of Commons \u2014 well above the party's past record of 68 women in 2011.\n\n\"This team of candidates is among the most professionally and personally diverse group we've ever put forward,\" Scheer said in a statement. \"This election will be about choosing a prime minister and a government that will help you get ahead, and all 338 of our candidates represent that choice well. Canadians are looking for a team with a plan that lives within our means and puts more money in your pocket.\"\n\nThe party says it has also attracted candidates from diverse backgrounds, including Indigenous Canadians, LGBTQ+ Canadians, Muslims, Sikhs, Jewish Canadians, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and new Canadians, including some who immigrated in the 2000s.\n\nThe Liberal Party has so far nominated 276 candidates, or 80 per cent of the slate.\n\nA spokesperson for the party said the remaining nomination meetings will be \"moving forward very soon.\" So far, 52 per cent of the party's new candidates are women.\n\n\"Team Trudeau 2019 candidates include veterans, teachers, Indigenous leaders, LGBTQ2 advocates, entrepreneurs, scientists, first responders, Olympians and Paralympians, experienced Parliamentarians and more \u2014 all working hard to build a better future for their communities,\" Braeden Caley said.\n\n\"Canadians will be making an important choice in this election. While Conservatives are focused on going backward with cuts to vital services that families rely on, Liberals are focused on moving forward with our positive plan to invest in the middle class,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the NDP said Tuesday it has so far nominated 180 candidates and is scheduling 122 nomination meetings over the next few weeks to nominate other candidates who have been vetted and approved by the party.\n\nThe candidate nomination deadline is Sept. 30. The election must be held on or before Oct. 21.", "description": "The Conservative Party became the first among the major parties Tuesday to nominate a full slate of 338 candidates ahead of the fall federal election.", "authors": ["Parliamentary Bureau", "John Paul", "J.P.", "Tasker Is A Reporter In The Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau In Ottawa.
