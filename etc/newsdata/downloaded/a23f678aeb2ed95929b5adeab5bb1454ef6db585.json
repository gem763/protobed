USA TODAY\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Twenty-eight players on Michigan State's football roster hail from Ohio, making Saturday's showdown at Ohio State a bit more meaningful than most.\n\nThose 28 players, which include 10 likely starters, will take on the No. 5 Buckeyes at Ohio Stadium, and only one of them, punter Jake Hartbarger, has played in a victory over the Buckeyes \u2014 Michigan State's 17-14 upset win in 2015 that propelled them to the College Football Playoff.\n\nSince then, there has been two close losses in East Lansing and a 48-3 Ohio State walloping in 2017 in Columbus.\n\nBut for the Ohioans on the team, many of whom were not recruited heavily by Ohio State, this chance Saturday night could erase the recent bad memories.\n\nMichigan State linebacker Joe Bachie (35) celebrates a tackle against Indiana during the second half at Spartan Stadium on Sept. 28, 2019. (Photo: Junfu Han, Detroit Free Press)\n\n\u201cBeing an Ohio guy, it means a little something extra to me,\u201d said senior safety David Dowell, a North Ridgeville native. \u201cI prepare the same regardless of the opponent\u2026 Sometimes in those big games you can get all hyped up and you forget about your assignment, so it\u2019s all about having that balance.\u201d\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: What unexpected result to watch for Saturday\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Our experts predict Auburn-Florida and the rest of Week 6\n\nBIG GAMES: Five Week 6 matchups with College Football Playoff impact\n\nFor Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio, who grew up in Zanesville and won a national championship in 2002 as Ohio State\u2019s defensive coordinator, he focused less on the personal nature of the game and more on the stakes of it.\n\n\u201cI really think that any time you're in a conference, you're trying to become the best in your conference, so you've got to measure up. Ohio State has been a dominant program in this conference,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've got to be able to measure up to win your share there or if you want to be Big Ten champion. The two times we've won and beat Ohio State, we've become the Big Ten champion.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, when the Big Ten added Nebraska and switched to a divisional format, Michigan State and Ohio State have combined for seven out of the 16 spots in the Big Ten championship game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a playoff game,\u201d senior linebacker Joe Bachie, from Brook Park, Ohio, said. \u201cYou want to be the best, you want to go to the Big Ten championship, this is the game you\u2019ve gotta win.\u201d\n\nBachie focused on the environment \u2014 the game is a \u201cBlackout\u201d with Ohio State wearing black alternate jerseys and the expected 104,944 fans clad in the same color.\n\nIt is not a hospitable environment for visitors, especially those hailing from the Mitten State. Buckeyes fans are known to sing a song about how they \u201cdon\u2019t give a damn for the whole state of Michigan\u201d when facing off against Michigan State or Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s special obviously to go back down there,\u201d Bachie said. \u201cI\u2019ll be grateful to play on a stage like this. To play on ABC, 7:30 at night, in Columbus, millions of people watching. Coming back home, this is the last chance to play them, the last chance I get to beat them, and really a lot of the guys from Ohio have the same mindset. This is going to be a special week for a bunch of us.\u201d\n\nThe road to the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis goes through Columbus, as Mark Dantonio said multiple times this week.\n\n\u201cThis means everything,\u201d senior defensive tackle Raequan Williams said.", "description": "Michigan State features 28 players from Ohio, which makes for a key story line when the Spartans visit Ohio State in 'playoff game' between the teams.", "authors": ["Chase Michaelson", "Special To The Detroit Free Press", "Published A.M.
