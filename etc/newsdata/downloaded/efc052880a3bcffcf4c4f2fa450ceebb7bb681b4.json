Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Oversight Committee, one of three panels leading the impeachment process. \u201cOne is that the president is a one-man crime wave who has generated virtually limitless impeachable offenses and misconduct. On the other hand, we need to develop a process that will close within a period of time that makes sense for the legislative calendar.\u201d\n\nBut Raskin said lawmakers are not yet discussing how to make that determination.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really are still in the throes of the fact investigation.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn\u2019t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles.\n\nAnd still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately \u2014 from Trump\u2019s own admission that he wants Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, to the summary of his phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president to the text messages of senior ambassadors worried that Trump was withholding military aid and a White House visit to bend Ukraine\u2019s leaders to his will.\n\n\u201cWhat I think you have in the public domain already is more than sufficient for an article of impeachment,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), an Oversight Committee member.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her top allies say they\u2019re still firmly in fact-finding mode and have promised a deliberate approach to the House\u2019s Ukraine investigation with no ironclad time limit. Senior Democrats say they\u2019re eyeing the end of the year as an unofficial outer limit for the House to craft and pass articles of impeachment, but the unpredictable investigation has produced so many leads it\u2019s hard to solidify a deadline.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republicans Wednesday that he expects Pelosi to approve impeachment articles by Thanksgiving, paving the way for the Senate to deal with a trial by Christmas.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s conscious of the calendar,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, which is expecting to handle the process of drafting articles of impeachment once the other panels conclude the Ukraine probe. \u201cOur expectation should be to have our work done by year\u2019s end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRep.
