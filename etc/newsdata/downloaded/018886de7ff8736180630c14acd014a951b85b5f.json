The days of vacations and weekend trips are over. School is back in session.\n\nSam Keen once wrote, \u201cDeep summer is when laziness finds respectability.\u201d Now laziness gives way again to work.\n\nBut before that happens we celebrate Labor Day. One last chance to relax and rest. A day set aside to honor the American worker. And an opportunity to reflect on the nature and value of work.\n\nSCOTT GUNN: ON LABOR DAY AND EVERY DAY, HONORING WORKERS HONORS GOD\n\nGod is the original worker. He wears many hats: real estate developer, zoologist, architect, civil engineer, strategic planner, artist and more. This means work must be good in and of itself since God can only do what is good.\n\nIt also means work reflects the activity of God. The work that God gives us has dignity in it. Just as God works, he has created us to work. We are co-workers with God, carrying out His purposes in this world.\n\nThe lawyer secures justice for clients. The grocer supplies food to customers. The doctor meets the health care needs of patients. The homemaker nurtures children. It takes all kinds of workers to do what God wants done in this world.\n\nGod expects us to work \u2013 at the office, factory, farm field, school or wherever we work. When we do it well it brings glory to God. This gives our work great meaning and significance. Work also helps to meet our necessary material needs.\n\nIs this enough for us to find fulfillment in our work? It certainly gives us a grander understanding. But whatever our particular job, there are ways to find fulfillment in what we do.\n\nHave Realistic Expectations\n\nThough it is meaningful to realize the inherent value of work, a realistic understanding is necessary. Work can provide a measure of significance and a sense of self-worth but it cannot fully deliver that for us. Work will not bring total self-fulfillment.\n\nWhen we expect our job to do this for us we end up despondent and disillusioned because of unrealistic expectations. Work is limited; it is not meant to fill the need for worship, family or recreation.\n\nIn fact, when work becomes everything to us we fall into workaholism. Now work crowds out other important parts of our lives. This way of seeking fulfillment is a never-ending cycle that hurts us and those we love.\n\nWork Well with Leadership\n\nToo many people begin to hate their job because they don\u2019t work well with leadership. Authority structures are necessary and needed in the workplace. An unhealthy relationship with your boss will never lead to job fulfillment.\n\nYour boss may not always be right but he or she deserves your loyalty. You would not be in your position if you and your boss didn\u2019t think you could work together. Help your boss anticipate problems, pitfalls and challenges. You would want that assistance if you were in his or her position.\n\nFeeling unappreciated or unjustly treated can cause you to be apathetic. This moves you away from fulfillment. Look for ways to make a positive contribution instead of complaining. Offer a helpful opinion and tell the truth when asked.\n\nEnhance Your Emotional Quotient\n\nYour relationships must be good for you to have fulfillment at work. Daniel Goleman coined the term \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d to describe our ability to manage ourselves and our relationships effectively. Many experts believe your emotional quotient is as important as your intelligence quotient in determining personal success.\n\nEmotional intelligence comprises four fundamental capabilities: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and social skill. Each capability contains a certain set of competencies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen you relate well with your co-workers, show you care about them and think of their contribution as valuable you experience fulfillment in your job. Being able to work on a team is crucial to your job. Communicating effectively includes both talking and listening. Expressing appreciation goes a long way toward building relationships and positively impacting people.\n\nDevelop Your Skills\n\nSince God has blessed us with talents to do our job we should work hard to develop them. When we improve our skills, it results in better work and more fulfillment. Demonstrating expertise at our job is a way of honoring God.\n\nYou may think your job doesn\u2019t require skill, or that some skills matter more than yours. You may think you\u2019re too old to develop your skills or you don\u2019t really have any skills. But you do have skills, they matter and you need to develop them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYou can develop your skills through self-study, school or training. It takes a commitment to continuous learning. Begin by selecting a skill to develop. And then target a specific skill-building strategy.\n\nYour work has value. The greatest amount of time in your life is spent working. Make sure and find fulfillment in what you do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY RICK MCDANIEL", "description": "God expects us to work \u2013 at the office, factory, farm field, school or wherever we work.
