September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nIt was hard for Benn, a merchant of violence across a high-stakes decade of professional fighting, to ever find peace. He says his career, which started in 1987 and appeared to end in 1996, was always under-pinned by drug abuse, adultery and deep depression.\n\n\u201cAll through my career I have been in a dark place,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom the age of eight I was smoking, spliffing and doing everything else until I was 41. Then Jesus came and my life changed, no spliffing, no sexing, no Es, no cigarettes, everything changed, but I just need that one more fight.\n\n\u201cNow I really have it all. Me and the wife work at the church in Australia. Just finishing building a lovely mansion, paid for. But I never really had closure. There is something sitting in me, bugging me that I have to get out. I don't want to be someone who asks 'what if?' No.\u201d\n\nThe British Boxing Board of Control have refused to sanction this bout meaning that Benn's comeback will be fought under the auspices of the British and Irish Boxing Authority, Biba. It will take place over 10, three-minute rounds at the light-heavyweight limit of 81kg. Benn and Bika will also wear 12oz gloves in what has been described as 'an extra safety precaution'.\n\nThe Board decided that, given his age and length of time since his last fight, it would not be appropriate to licence Benn under any circumstances. Bika, the 40-year-old Cameroonian, fought for a world title as recently as 2015 and represents an incredibly formidable opponent after such a long lay-off.\n\n\u201cThe Board knocked me back but there is more than one governing body,\u201d Benn adds. \u201cI get what they are saying, I'm not going to knock Robert Smith, I understand, but some of these guys that get in the ring for the British Boxing Board are overweight, big gut... really?\n\n\u201cThey are stringent, Biba. It wasn't easy. I had a brain scan, a neck scan, lungs everything. I am Nigel Benjamin Button Benn, it's not about age. I'm in training all the time, I have got that army discipline.\u201d\n\nBenn, however, is acutely aware of the perils of professional boxing having seen first hand the damage which can be inflicted inside the ring.\n\nIn what is considered his finest win, Benn stopped Gerald McLellan in the 10th round of a brutal, scintillating clash at the London Arena which left the American puncher with life-changing injuries. McLellan, now 51, is partially blind, deaf and unable to walk.\n\nWhen put to Benn that he might have thought about the fate which befell the Illinois man before deciding his own perilous return to the ring, he says: \u201cNo. A few people have had that kind of attitude but that's not me.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to ever go in the ring with that kind of attitude, I can't. I have sympathy for what happened but I don't go in the ring and think that could happen to me, no. If I do that I'm taking my focus away from what I can do. I can't go in there thinking 'this could happen to me'.\u201d\n\nOne member of the crowd at Thursday's press conference was his fighting son Conor Benn, himself a 15-0 professional, who has described his dad's decision to return to the ring as 'madness'.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see my dad fight, it is horrible,\u201d 22-year-old Conor said. \u201cHim getting in the ring? There is nothing nice about it.\n\n\u201cThere is real concern as his son because I know what it is like getting hit, it is horrible, there is nothing pleasant about it. No one wants to see their dad get punched in the face.\n\n\u201cBut I have said my piece, I have said \u2018Dad, I really don\u2019t want you to do this, because you are my dad\u2019 but he is going to do it so I have to support his decision.\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do, tell him I won\u2019t support him? I could never do that.\u201d\n\nInstead, father and son will live together in Conor's Essex flat and train alongside one and other under Tony Sims at his Ilford gym. Benn will now not return home to Australia until after the fight, which takes place at the same arena where he lost to Chris Eubank in 1993.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine what the house will be like when I am fighting on October 26,\u201d Conor says smiling. \u201cWe will be clashing heads.\n\n\u201cHe will be training and doing his early morning runs with me, he will be training with my strength and conditioning coach Dan Lawrence and he will do some work with my trainer Tony Sims.\n\n\u201cHe has always trained like a lunatic, weights, cycling or squash but six or seven years ago he got right back into his boxing.\n\n\u201cWhen he moved to Australia he started training at the PCYC gym, the Police Citizens Youth Club, to help the young kids in the area. Around that time, I turned amateur and he was always holding pads and training with me.\n\n\u201cIt was weird. I should have noticed it was coming then, I still can\u2019t believe that this is actually happened, it\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s madness.\u201d", "description": "Nigel Benn\u00a0leans back against the wall of the Thames-side nightclub from\u00a0which he has chosen to announce his curious comeback and tries his best\u00a0to stifle the tears in his eyes.
