REUTERS/Ross Setford/File Photo\n\nErasmus is keen for the Springboks to soak up the conditions ahead of the tournament, which included a 41-7 warm-up victory over Japan a week ago, and does not believe there will be a \u201ccabin fever\u201d element to contend with later in the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe have achieved a lot of the objectives we set in coming early to Japan,\u201d Erasmus told reporters at the team\u2019s base on Friday\n\n\u201cThe first was to get to know the country, the people, how things operate here, and to be comfortable in the country and we\u2019ve achieved that.\n\n\u201cThe second one was to get some match time against good opposition, which was Japan, and we achieved that. And then obviously the third one was to get the guys used to the climatic conditions, not just the heat, but the humidity, both in match and in training.\u201d\n\nCaptain Siya Kolisi agrees and says the preparation work they have put in now will help them finish strongly in matches.\n\n\u201cWe know how to handle the conditions now and the fact that our training has been very hard means it will stand us in good stead. The benefits will come through later in the games,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bok players will be given a few days off with their families after their final pool game against Canada in Kobe on Oct. 8, ahead of the start of the knockout stages.\n\nErasmus has also praised the welcome his side has been afforded, and the enthusiasm of Japanese people to embrace the tournament.\n\n\u201cSomething that has stood out for me \u2013 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen this anywhere else \u2013 is the people of the host nation wearing the jersey of the visiting team \u2013 the Springbok badge,\u201d the coach commented.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s been amazing to see the Japanese people wearing the Springbok jersey. I think that shows a lot of respect and I think we can learn a lot from that.\n\n\u201cIt makes us proud to see that and I think you can be proud of how you have supported the World Cup and adopting teams that are visiting here and making them feel at home.\u201d\n\nThe Boks open their campaign against New Zealand in Yokohama on Sept. 21 and will also play Italy, Namibia and Canada in their pool.", "description": "South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has feels vindicated in side\u2019s early arrival in Japan for the Rugby World Cup, even though it will mean their stay in the country will stretch to nine weeks if they make the Nov. 2 final.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429412261&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0XG-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
