Tossing it around can only create confusion, which may be useful to the president\u2019s allies, but not to those who would hold him to account.\n\nYes, the word is \u201cin the dictionary\u201d\u2014but then so is the word ruth, as in the mercy that one refrains from displaying when one is ruthless. Ruth as mercy was indeed once a living word, but certainly is not now (\u201cShow me ruth, oh please!\u201d\u2014 please). Its preservation with its definition in the dictionary qualifies as an archival matter. If emolument is used so rarely that when it comes up in the news, most of us need tutorials on what the word means, might we not decide that emolument qualifies, too, as an archival matter? That is, if we all must be told that emolument means compensation and special allowance, then why not just use those words instead and let emolument go the way of ruth? Compensation and allowance are hardly sandbox words, but we all know what they mean.\n\nIn any language, words can drift out of usage, often for chance reasons. English speakers centuries ago could refer to expeding as well as impeding, and to exulceration, still \u201cin the dictionary\u201d but today used only as a medical term rather than to refer to irritation or corruption more generally. Certainly some of us have a quirky fondness for words of this kind. One might wish to know the meaning of words like tergiversation and solecism just for the fun of it, to curate a collection of one\u2019s own special stuff, as something to pop out at parties. Books are published gathering words like those.\n\nJohn McWhorter: Trump\u2019s a liddle\u2019 scary\n\nBeyond this hobbyist\u2019s affection, however, we must understand that print, literacy, and dictionaries occasion something deeply odd in written languages: words that almost no speaker of that language knows the meaning of. This is a bit strange, because words are designed for communication.\n\nIn indigenous societies, ceremonial language can retain ancient words that have passed out of use and are no longer understood. My favorite example is among the Lokele in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who traditionally could \u201ctalk\u201d by playing drums with different pitches, because their language uses tones the way Chinese does. Many of the words used in ceremony were \u201cdrum words\u201d whose actual meanings were lost. But\u2014this was only in ceremonies, and is as harmless as, say, our joyously reciting the nursery rhyme \u201cHickory, Dickory, Dock\u201d with no idea that those are the numbers eight, nine, and 10 in the Celtic speech spoken by the indigenous people of Britain that the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes encountered. When matters of diplomacy are being discussed, \u201chickory, dickory, dock\u201d (and covfefe) won\u2019t do.", "description": "The word is outdated.
