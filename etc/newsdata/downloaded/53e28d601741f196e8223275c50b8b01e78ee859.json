But we also know that GPs spend a long time sitting down during the working day, which can contribute to poor health outcomes.\n\n\u201cEvidence suggests that doctors often neglect their own health. Therefore we need to find ways of getting GPs on their feet and moving more often.\n\n\u201cStanding consultations could help GPs to be more active, as well as highlighting to patients the importance of reducing and breaking up their sitting time.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe standing appointments will be for adults only and that patients will be able to sit if they wish.\n\nAnother possibility may be that standing could shorten the average consultation time.\n\nIn spring, a group of GPs in the Midlands will wear ActivPAL activity trackers on their thighs to provide objective data about their movements during and after the working day.\n\nThey will be given the desks to use in 30-40 half-day sessions over four to six weeks.\n\nGPs will be asked about their wellbeing, productivity at work and activity level before and after they have used the desks.\n\nPatients will also be quizzed when they leave their consultations.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe desks, which cost around \u00a32,000, can switch between standing and seated formats in seconds with the push of a button.\n\nGPs will be able to use their discretion as to whether they stay standing for the appointment.\n\nFor patients who are elderly, frail, pregnant, disabled or about to receive bad news, it may be more appropriate to be seated.\n\nProf Daley added: \u201cIf you come in for a repeat prescription there\u2019s no reason to sit, sitting just takes up more time, so it might be that for certain types of consultation it makes things quicker, and for others it\u2019s just not appropriate.\n\n\u201cFor example, if someone comes in for bad news or a cancer diagnosis, you might just want to sit.\u201d", "description": "Family doctors will trial standing appointments to boost their health by being less sedentary and set a good example for patients", "authors": ["Martin Bagot", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708814.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Woman-at-doctors-surgery.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
