The St. Louis clinic is the only health care provider in the state that currently performs abortions.\n\nThe document was reportedly created at Williams\u2019s request by a state health inspector who had access to medical records during the state\u2019s annual inspection of the clinic. The state says it ultimately found four patients who returned to Planned Parenthood more than once to have a surgical abortion, causing concerns about safety standards at the clinic, the Star reported.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But Planned Parenthood claimed state health officials \u201ccherry-picked\u201d those cases, the Star reported. Planned Parenthood\u2019s St. Louis clinic provided abortion care to 4,782 patients in 2016-17 and served more than 30,000 patients in total that year, according to its annual report.\n\nA DHHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment Wednesday.\n\nIn May, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a law banning abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest \u2014 one of several restrictive anti-abortion laws passed this year, with an eye toward overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that effectively legalized abortion across the country. A federal judge blocked the state from enforcing the state law in August, as litigation continues.\n\nMeanwhile, state officials have refused to renew the license for Missouri\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic. If it closed, Missouri would become the first state in decades to lack an abortion provider. Missouri is currently one of six states with only one abortion clinic, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that advocates for abortion rights.\n\nThroughout the licensing dispute, Planned Parenthood has defended its medical care as a safe and necessary resource for patients.\n\n\u201cMissouri politicians have gone too far. This is government overreach at its worst,\u201d Yamelsie Rodr\u00edguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, said in a statement about DHHS tracking menstrual cycles. \u201cThis is outrageous and disgusting. Planned Parenthood will always do what\u2019s best for patients and that will guide any decisions we make about how we continue fighting for abortion access.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Crystal Quade, the Democratic minority leader of the Missouri House, called the revelation \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and also called for an investigation.\n\n\u201cState law requires the health department director to be \u2018of recognized character and integrity.\u2019 This unsettling behavior calls into question whether Doctor Williams meets that high standard,\u201d Quade said in a statement on Tuesday, calling on Parson to \u201cimmediately investigate whether patient privacy was compromised or laws broken and determine if this is a person who Missourians can be comfortable having in a position of public trust.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "Missouri's top health official testified that he kept a spreadsheet tracking the menstrual periods of women who visited Planned Parenthood.", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/missouri-planned-parenthood-license.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
