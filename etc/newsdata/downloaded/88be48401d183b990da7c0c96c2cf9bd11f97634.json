Luckily, there are so many new streaming services popping up, with new free offers that I can claim and immediately cancel, that I never really have to.\n\nBecause if you decide to subscribe to all of these services on a long-term basis, well... as Kevin McAllister explains in The Wall Street Journal, that\u2019s going to cost you.\n\nIt can happen fast. Maybe you\u2019ll pay $12 for a Netflix account and $7 for an Amazon Prime Video subscription. Another $7 click here and a $15 one there and those prices you might not think twice about in the moment can end up leaving you with a $500-$800 tab on video alone by year\u2019s end.\n\nI\u2019ve spent $130 on a la carte streaming services this year, including the month of Foxtel I bought so I could rewatch the entirety of Game of Thrones before the final season (which turned out to be a huge waste of my time) and the occasional movie or television show I rent from Amazon.\n\nI also paid $59 for my annual Amazon Prime membership, which is the one subscription I refuse to cancel because it comes with free shipping. However, you can even pay for Prime on an as-needed basis if you really want to; there\u2019s no law that says you have to sign up for a full year of Prime just because you saw a Carnival Row advertisement in an airport.\n\nMcAllister suggests that more of us take advantage of what he calls \u201csubscription hopping,\u201d whether you pay for a month of a particular streaming service to watch a specific show or get even more strategic about it:\n\nA friend of mine, who is what I\u2019d consider a superuser, takes it a step further, waiting for a critical mass of content to hit any given streaming service before signing back up.\n\nAnd now that you know how much money you can save, you can become a subscription hopper too! Just... make sure not everyone does it, okay? Otherwise, all of those streaming media sites will change their pricing models and close this delightful little loophole.", "description": "I am not ashamed to admit that I watched the first season of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale on a free Foxtel trial....", "authors": ["Spandas Lui", "Tooran Alizadeh", "Edward Helderop", "Tony Grubesic"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zglui2a3dnx9r6l8ebcm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
