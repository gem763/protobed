Esper announced the planned withdrawal of virtually all U.S. forces from northern Syria in the face of a Turkish military offensive targeting Kurdish fighters in the region.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force veteran who was a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan, was among the most vocal members of the president\u2019s party to condemn the move.\n\nAD\n\nIn an appearance on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Kinzinger pushed back against the argument \u2014 made by Trump and some of his allies, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) \u2014 that the withdrawal is a step toward removing the United States from \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear the president and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time, and it\u2019s kitschy. But actually, we were preventing an endless war,\u201d Kinzinger said. He added that \u201cfor me \u2014 as a guy that served in the military and really got into politics because I believe in the role America plays \u2014 to see this yet again, you know, leaving an ally behind ... is disheartening, depressing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were preventing an endless war,\u201d @RepKinzinger tells @margbrennan of U.S. troop presence in Syria. Says Trump's retreat is \"weak.\" pic.twitter.com/ZpF3eFiXjl \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 13, 2019\n\nKinzinger said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d be allowed to come to the White House as planned next month. And he argued that Trump\u2019s decision puts U.S. national security at risk because \u201cnow we have another group that now believes they can\u2019t rely on the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Kurds found out on Twitter, for goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have left them to the wolves. And the message this is sending to our allies around the world, I think, is really going to be bad.\u201d\n\nBob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee until his retirement in January, also had sharp criticism for Trump\u2019s move \u2014 although he did not mention the president by name.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRecent decisions by the administration regarding Syria are a strategic error and further diminish the character of our great nation,\u201d Corker said in a tweet.\n\nOther Republicans took a more neutral tone.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who had previously called Trump\u2019s decision on Syria \u201cthe biggest blunder of his presidency,\u201d praised the president Sunday for offering his support for sanctions on Turkey.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGood decision by President @realDonaldTrump to work with Congress to impose crippling sanctions against Turkeys outrageous aggression/war crimes in Syria,\u201d Graham tweeted, adding that \u201cTurkey is NOT acting as a good NATO ally.\u201d\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump had tweeted that he was dealing with Graham \u201cand many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThere is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!\u201d\n\nDealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nFormer defense secretary Jim Mattis declined to directly criticize Trump during an appearance on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d saying that whether America is safer today because of the president\u2019s decision is \u201ca complex question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say, America\u2019s always safer when it builds the trust and a sense of reliability among our allies that we\u2019re reliable,\u201d said Mattis, who resigned last year after clashing with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nOnly two Republicans on the Sunday morning news shows \u2014 Paul and Sen. Kevin Cramer (N.D.) \u2014 defended Trump\u2019s move.\n\nAD\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Paul echoed Esper\u2019s argument, claiming that Turkey \u201cwas coming in one way or another.\u201d In a reference of Trump\u2019s initial troop decision, he added that the president \u201cwas right in moving 50 soldiers out of the way of an onslaught of tens of thousands of Turkish troops.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to send the sons and daughters of American mothers and fathers, am I going to send them there to die to try to figure out how the Kurd and the Turks can get along?\u201d Paul asked. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see that in our national interest. And we should vote on it. We should vote on it in Congress and declare war, if that\u2019s what people want.\u201d\n\nPaul did, however, criticize Trump\u2019s decision last week to send an additional 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn fact, I would withhold troops and arms from the Saudis until we see better behavior,\u201d Paul said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s inconsistent to say we\u2019re not going to be there for endless, senseless wars and then to have them in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nCramer said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that while he wishes the situation had been different, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the president had a lot of choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the logical question is, were we prepared to stay there and fight the Turks, given the fact that the Turks seem to be committed to coming across the border and establishing this militarized zone, with or without our staying there? ... Clearly, the Turks are not the type of ally that the Kurds are, but they are a NATO country, as you have pointed out, and it\u2019s never quite as simple as just a binary choice,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who left the Republican Party earlier this year and has mulled a presidential run, criticized Trump\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d defense, calling it \u201cjust cover for his having facilitated a disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump long ago could (and should) have withdrawn from Syria and worked to keep out Turkey,\u201d Amash tweeted Sunday afternoon. \u201cInstead, he pulled back a few troops (no withdrawal) and green lighted Turkey\u2019s attack.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference in New York City on Sunday afternoon, Schumer announced that lawmakers in both chambers will be putting forward a joint resolution that \u201curges the president to undo his decision to do everything he can to protect the Kurds, to do everything that we must do to prevent ISIS terrorists from escaping, and make sure that Turkey respects existing agreements related to Syria and with the United States.\u201d The Islamic State is also known as ISIS/\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchumer also invoked the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, noting that \u201cwe New Yorkers, we\u2019re the number one target for terrorists in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all learned from 9/11 that terrorism can begin in a tiny cell as far as 7,000 miles away and then metastasize into a domestic attack,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard and so long to prevent it from happening again. We have sacrificed blood and dollars to make it not happen. And in one fell swoop, the president undoes too much of what has been accomplished.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democrats also took to the morning news shows to denounce Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that lawmakers will consider two bills this week that would condemn Trump\u2019s policy toward the Kurds and sanction Turkey \u201cand all the people involved with what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can think of nothing more disgusting, in all the years I\u2019ve been in Congress, than what this president is allowing to happen with the Kurds,\u201d Engel said.\n\nAsked whether Turkey should be kicked out of NATO, Engel replied that \u201cit\u2019s something that needs to be considered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, how do you have a NATO ally who\u2019s in cahoots with the Russians, when the Russians are the adversaries of NATO? ... Erdogan\u2019s a bad guy. And I\u2019m disgusted that the American president would feel comfortable with someone like Erdogan,\u201d he said.\n\nOn \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) called Trump\u2019s decision \u201ca complete capitulation\u201d to Erdogan and \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d that will result in the resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nAnd on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) called the situation on the ground in northern Syria \u201cabsolutely sickening\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that Trump \u201callowed Turkey to begin killing the Syrian Kurds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you have this big, bipartisan uproar,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cYou have ISIS right now being the big winner, because the Syrian Kurds were our most effective partner in going after ISIS. Now, they\u2019re going to have a comeback.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen also accused the president of not moving more quickly to sanction Turkey.", "description": "The criticism came as Senate Minority Leader Charles E.
