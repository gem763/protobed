Proud we rose above it to take three points but this needs stamping out.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"Thankful to the brilliant England support. You got behind us in the most meaningful way possible tonight and we are all very grateful. Have a safe journey home and take care.\n\n\"Also been told what the Bulgaria captain did at half-time. To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nStaggeringly, Bulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov claims he didn't hear any abuse over the course of the game.\n\nIt comes after Balakov claimed before the match that England has a bigger racism problem in football than his home country.\n\n\"If this is proven to be true, we have to be ashamed and apologise for this,\" he said.\n\n\"It is probably because the fans were unhappy with the way the team was performing.\"\n\nRaheem Sterling and Ross Barkley each scored twice for England with Harry Kane completing the rout.", "description": "Bulgaria's skipper was seen remonstrating with a section of the home support during the half-time break", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Itv", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581783.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Popov.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
