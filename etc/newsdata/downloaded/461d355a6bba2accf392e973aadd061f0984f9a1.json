Ed Bott explains what makes this update different from the feature updates you\u2019ve come to dread.

Microsoft required the Snapdragon 850 for Windows on Arm PCs shipping with Windows 10 1809 and previously required it for version 1903. The Snapdragon 855's listing could be an error as Neowin notes, as that chipset is meant to be for smartphones.\n\nThere aren't many Windows on Arm PCs, but Samsung recently launched the Snapdragon 8cx-powered Windows 10 Galaxy Book S, which rivals Microsoft's brand-new Windows on Arm Surface Pro X tablet. Microsoft co-designed the Qualcomm SQ1 Arm chip on the Surface Pro X.\n\nMicrosoft demands that new PCs ship with AMD's 7th gen processors: \"Up through the following AMD 7th Generation Processors (A-Series Ax-9xxx & E-Series Ex-9xxx & FX-9xxx); AMD Athlon 2xx processors, AMD Ryzen 3/5/7 3xxx, AMD Opteron[2] and AMD EPYC 7xxx.\"\n\nOn the Intel-based PCs, Microsoft requires Intel's 10th generation 'Comet Lake' processors. \"Up through the following 10th Generation Intel Processors (Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9-10xxx), and Intel Xeon E-22xx[1], Intel Atom (J4xxx/J5xxx and N4xxx/N5xxx), Celeron and Pentium Processors.\"", "description": "The 1909, 1903 updates require Snapdragon 855, 8cx, and Intel Comet Lake CPUs as a minimum on new devices.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/dc3c6b47-0efc-45a7-b806-b27a6cc58d9c/thumbnail/770x578/835faebdff3d239b73c6b60e325ef8e4/comuterusersistock-876989820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
