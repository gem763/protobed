The statement also includes drawings made by Little, 79, of many of the women he strangled.\n\nLittle, who is serving life behind bars for his conviction on three murders committed in the 1980s, began confessing to additional killings some 18 months ago to a Texas Ranger who interviewed him in his cell at the state prison in Lancaster, California, according to the FBI.\n\nConvicted US murderer Samuel Little confesses to killing 90 women Read more\n\nLittle appears to have targeted mostly vulnerable young black women, many of them prostitutes or drug addicts, whose deaths were not well publicized at the time and in some cases not recorded as homicides.\n\nThe FBI videotapes show Little, sitting in front of a cinder block wall in blue jail scrubs and a gray knit cap, sometimes appearing bemused or smiling as he recalls the circumstances surrounding the murders.\n\nThe FBI has also released sketches made by Little of victims who remain unidentified in hopes that members of the public might recognize them. The agency cautioned that not all Little\u2019s descriptions may be accurate as his memory is faulty.\n\nA map posted on the FBI website shows that most of the still uncorroborated murders were committed across the US south, although one young woman was killed in northern Ohio and two others in southern California.\n\nOne unidentified victim was described by investigators as a black man aged 18 or 19 who presented himself to Little as a woman named Marianne or Mary Ann. He was slain in 1971 or 1972.\n\nAnother was a 25-year-old white woman with blonde hair, blue eyes and a \u201chippie appearance\u201d whom Little met in Ohio and strangled to death in northern Kentucky in approximately 1984.\n\nIt was not yet clear if Little, who is in failing health, would face additional prosecutions in the newly uncovered murders.", "description": "Investigators have confirmed 50 of the homicides to which Samuel Little has confessed", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6430578dd38a85c5fec32d45c5de64ace4d5359/0_69_3213_1928/master/3213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c7315fd5f778c4e2e868e6a17d22ba3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
