He was 70.\n\nA statement provided by his family reads: \u201cThe Money Family regrets to announce that Eddie passed away peacefully early this morning. It is with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to our loving husband and father. We cannot imagine our world without him. We are grateful that he will live on forever through his music.\u201d\n\nMore from Variety\n\nMoney recently revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer.\n\nA reality television series about Money and his family, \u201cReal Money,\u201d had aired on AXS TV starting in April 2018. It chronicled his life at home, on the road and with his family, as well as his health struggles.\n\nMoney made his home in the Bay Area in the 1970s where he performed at the city\u2019s clubs regularly. A star of MTV\u2019s formative years, he saw major chart success with such songs as \u201cBaby Hold On\u201d and \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise\u201d and, in 1986, \u201cTake Me Home Tonight,\u201d a duet with Ronnie Spector, his biggest radio hit. He was signed to Columbia Records and released 11 albums throughout his career, starting with his self-titled debut in 1977 which saw three songs chart, \u201cBaby Hold On,\u201d \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Really Got a Hold on Me.\u201d\n\nBorn Edward Joseph Mahoney in Brooklyn, New York, Money, who grew up on Long Island, originally started out in law enforcement, his father\u2019s profession, spending two years as a New York City police officer before deciding to try music. In Berkeley, Calif. following his move out west, he palled around with local musicians of the San Francisco club scene which led him to legendary promoter Bill Graham, whom Money met in 1976. Graham would become Money\u2019s manager helping him achieve multi-platinum album sales in the 1980s.\n\nMoney\u2019s arsenal of hits includes 1978\u2019s\u201dBaby Hold On\u201d (peak position on the U.S. chart: No. 11) and \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise\u201d (No. 22), followed by \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a Fool\u201d the following year (No. 22), \u201cThink I\u2019m in Love\u201d (No. 16) and \u201cShakin'\u201d (No. 63) in 1982, \u201cTake Me Home Tonight\u201d in 1986, which reached No. 4 (his highest charting song) and \u201cWalk on Water\u201d (No. 9) in 1988.\n\nDuring that decade-plus, Money also descended into drug and alcohol abuse, nearly dying of an overdose that left him unable to walk for a year.\n\nEventually working his way back to performing live, Money was featured on a 2016 episode of \u201cOprah: Where Are They Now?\u201d That led to the series \u201cReal Money,\u201d which debuted on AXS TV in 2018 and was on its second season.\n\nOccasionally, Money was also the subject of controversy. Most recently, and not of his doing, music industry pundit Bob Lefsetz took issue with a crack Money made during a talk at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, calling it anti-Semitic. As Money explained to Rolling Stone: \u201cI said, \u2018My wife always looks like a million bucks and she spends so much money on clothes and I hate it. It\u2019s the Jew in me.\u2019 And when I said that, because my mother is Jewish, Bob didn\u2019t realize that and mentioned it [in his popular newsletter]. He thought I was Irish Catholic, Polish or German or something and all of a sudden he said I was anti-Semitic. \u2026 It was a misunderstanding and I thought it was a funny joke because I got Jewish blood in me.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Money, the prolific singer and songwriter whose songs \"Baby Hold On,\" \"Two Tickets to Paradise,\" \"Shakin'\" and \"Take Me Home Tonight\" soundtracked popular music in the 1980s, died Friday (Sept. 13).
