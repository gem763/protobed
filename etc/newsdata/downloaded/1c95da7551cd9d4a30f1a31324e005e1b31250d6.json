If they\u2019re bad, you can\u2019t help thinking about them. There are so many ways socks can go wrong: when they don\u2019t hug your ankle tightly enough, or when the no-shows slip off in your shoes, or when you hate the pattern that\u2019s peeking out from under your pants. So to find the best socks for men, we talked to 14 guys \u2014 many of them men\u2019s-fashion insiders \u2014 to get the intel. They told us about their favorite no-shows, athletic socks, crew socks, dress socks, and more. We summed up all their top picks, from the simple and affordable Uniqlo crew socks that a bunch of stylish guys swear by, to novelty socks depicting Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream.\n\nBest no-show socks for men\n\nUniqlo Men's Low-Cut Socks, Black \u201cI live and die by Uniqlo\u2019s no-show socks,\u201d says publicist Jon Salas. \u201cThey\u2019re super comfortable, durable, light, and breathable.\u201d He tries to wear them as close to year-round as possible, which can be hard in New York City, but he especially likes them in the summer with sneakers because they \u201cshow a little ankle\u201d and the sock stays hidden. \u201cAnd you just can\u2019t beat the price,\u201d he adds. $5 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nMr. Gray 2-Tone Melange Invisible Sock Menswear consultant Nick Wooster is another no-show diehard. He told us, \u201cUnless it\u2019s snowing outside,\u201d he likes to wear no-shows, and his favorites are made by Mr. Gray. \u201cThanks to the exact fit and the quality of the yarn, they don\u2019t slide, and really grip my foot unlike any other.\u201d $22 at Mr. Gray Buy\n\nBest athletic socks for men\n\nBombas Men's Performance Running Ankle Sock For a \u201cdaily running sock,\u201d menswear designer and founder of Corridor, Dan Snyder, likes Bombas ankle socks. Jeremy Kirkland, host of the podcast Blamo!, is also a fan of Bombas for running and working out, which he says are \u201creinforced\u201d in key areas, but he prefers the crew-length version. $16 at Bombas Buy\n\nAmerican Trench Kennedy Luxe Athletic Sock For an athletic sock that can also double as something more stylish, copywriter Jon Roth likes American Trench\u2019s \u201cKennedy\u201d athletic socks. \u201cLike white briefs, there\u2019s old-school perfection in a pair of red, white, and blue tube socks, and American Trench makes some of the best. I wear these pulled up high with shorts and sneakers, but they\u2019re also a good choice for dancing around the house Risky Business style.\u201d $20 at American Trench Buy\n\nBest crew socks for men\n\nUniqlo Men's Color Socks Three of the people we spoke with praised Uniqlo\u2019s affordable and colorful cotton-blend crew socks. \u201cThey\u2019re medium height and thickness, so they\u2019re versatile for many different outfits and activities,\u201d says co-founder and creative director of Hawthorne Phillip Wong. \u201cThey also come in a wide range of amazing colors, so depending on your outfit, you can have a nice tonal moment.\u201d $4 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nUniqlo Men's Supima Cotton Dots Sock As stated earlier, Salas loves his Uniqlo no-shows, but as he puts it, \u201cI do need something longer when it\u2019s like 32 degrees out, and I still stick with Uniqlo.\u201d He likes their supima-cotton \u201cdots\u201d socks because \u201cthey\u2019re not super bunchy or thick, but they still manage to keep you warm.\u201d $5 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nCalvin Klein Soft Touch Crew Socks, 3-Pack For a truly versatile sock, writer Kevin Smith says these Calvin Kleins are his go-to\u2019s. \u201cThese are my favorite socks because they\u2019re long-lasting (I\u2019ve had mine for several years), durable, and very comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cThey never fall down, but at the same time they don\u2019t cinch your leg so hard that they leave an indent once you change into gym shorts after work.\u201d And at $13 for a 3-pack they\u2019re available at a great price. $13 at Lord + Taylor Buy\n\nTabio Power Fit Cotton Crew Socks, Pink For an upgraded take on the solid colored crew sock, men\u2019s-fashion writer Jordan Mixson \u2014 who also runs the sock-focused site the Sockateur \u2014 loves Tabio\u2019s made-in-Japan crew socks. \u201cI love their take on crew socks,\u201d he says. \u201cThey feel so smooth and silky, like a fancy dress sock.

These are part of the company\u2019s \u201cMuseum Collection,\u201d which features sock interpretations of a variety of iconic works of art, such as the Mona Lisa, Starry Night, and more. Rising also notes: \u201cThese socks do invite conversation, so make sure you\u2019ve at least perused the painting\u2019s Wikipedia page in preparation for any questions you might get.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnonymous Ism Patchwork Jaquard Socks When it comes to socks with \u201ccreative designs,\u201d Snyder is a big fan Japanese company Anonymous Ism. They\u2019re available in unique looks like this multicolored patchwork. $35 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nBest patterned socks for men\n\nHappy Socks Cotton Dot Socks For bold prints and designs, PR consultant Terence Edgerson is a fan of Happy Socks. \u201cI first got them as a gift, and then I went out and purchased more. They\u2019re so great because they never leave an itchy ring around my calves; they fit without being too tight, like I\u2019ve experienced with other socks. They also have this wide range of wild patterns, from near solids to socks with polka dots and lemons on them.\u201d $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nAfrisocks Kubolor Socks \u201cAt the moment I am obsessed with Afrisocks,\u201d says fashion and branding consultant Ronny Oppong.

Last but not least they\u2019re just comfy af.\u201d They\u2019re available in black, too, but Kirkland loves them in navy. \u201cI only buy socks in navy because it\u2019s the most versatile color to wear with jeans, chinos, and trousers.\u201d $23 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nBest dress socks for men\n\nPantherella Cotton Lisle Blend Over the Calf Dress Socks For dress socks, stylist Brian Coats prefers a longer \u201cover the calf\u201d model, and he likes this pair from Pantherella. \u201cThey actually become essential for your circulatory system when you have 25 showroom appointments a day,\u201d he says. $30 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nIssey Miyake Roketsu Socks $39 (was $55, now 29% off) For a bold and more high-fashion take on dress socks, Wong likes Issey Miyake. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially well-made dress socks that also work well with non-dressy outfits. And they always come in unconventional designs and perfect colors.\u201d $39 at Totokaelo Buy\n\nBugatchi Floral Socks Mixson is a big fan of Bugatchi\u2019s dress socks. \u201cThey have all kinds of prints and patterns made with mercerized Egyptian cotton,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s particularly into their floral designs.
