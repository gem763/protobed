REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo\n\nThe summit in Ankara, bringing together countries whose Syrian allies are combatants in a ruinous eight-year-old war, will focus on the Idlib region, the last remaining territory held by rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Iran\u2019s Hassan Rouhani have backed Assad against the rebels. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, along with the United States, European and Arab allies, has supported different rebel factions in the conflict.\n\nAssad\u2019s forces, aided by Russian air power, have regained control of most lands lost in the war. In recent months, Assad\u2019s forces have attacked Idlib, where Syrian and foreign radical fighters hold sway alongside other more moderate factions.\n\nUnder a deal with Moscow and Tehran two years ago, Turkey set up 12 military observation posts in northwest Syria aimed at reducing fighting between Assad\u2019s forces and rebels. The Turkish military posts have recently been caught in the crossfire due to the Syrian offensive in the region.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Friday, Erdogan warned that any Syrian government attack on the posts would draw retaliation from Turkish forces, possibly risking a direct confrontation between Ankara and Damascus.\n\n\u201cThe moment that the regime messes with our observation posts, if there is any attack, then things will take a very different direction,\u201d Erdogan told Reuters. \u201cWe will not hold back like we are now. We will take any necessary steps.\u201d\n\nErdogan and Putin agreed at talks in Moscow in August to \u201cnormalise\u201d the situation in the region, after Syrian troops encircled rebels and a Turkish post in a move Ankara said threatened its national security.\n\nWhile Putin and Erdogan have forged close ties over a range of issues like energy and defence cooperation, recent attacks by Syrian troops have also strained ties between Ankara and Moscow.\n\nPOSSIBLE MIGRANT WAVE\n\nThe fighting in northwestern Syria has also raised the risk of a new migrant wave towards Turkey, which currently hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees.\n\nThe United Nations has said that more than 500,000 people have been uprooted since late April, most of them escaping deeper into the rebel bastion and towards the border.\n\nWhile Erdogan has said that Turkey could not handle such an influx of refugees, he has also previously threatened to \u201copen the gates\u201d for migrants to Europe unless Ankara receives more international support.\n\nOn Friday, Erdogan reiterated his warning and said Monday\u2019s summit would aim to stop the migration from Idlib and establish a ceasefire to prevent any further civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cThe expectation here is not a momentary ceasefire. First, it is to put a stop to the migration here,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cSecond, to ensure a ceasefire here. Third, to seriously get terrorist organisations under control,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cTurkey, which is hosting 3.6 million refugees in its home at the moment, cannot take the millions of people that will arrive from there,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWe cannot carry that weight.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s ruling AK Party (AKP) suffered some stunning local election losses this year in part due to impatience among Turks over the Syrian refugees. Erdogan has said one million refugees could return to a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeast Syria, which Turkey is trying to establish with the United States.\n\nSyrian troops shelled the south of Idlib on Sunday, according to rescuers and residents in the rebel stronghold where a ceasefire had halted a fierce army offensive two weeks ago.\n\nThe summit also comes after Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group launched drone attacks on two of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco oil installations on Saturday. Washington later blamed Iran for the attacks, which Tehran dismissed as \u201cpointless\u201d on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan, Putin and Rouhani are expected to hold bilateral talks with each other before holding trilateral talks on the developments in Idlib. The three leaders will then hold a joint news conference.", "description": "The leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran meet on Monday to try to secure a lasting truce in northwest Syria following attacks by the government that risk deepening regional turmoil and pushing a new wave of migrants towards Turkey.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430153929&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0L4", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
