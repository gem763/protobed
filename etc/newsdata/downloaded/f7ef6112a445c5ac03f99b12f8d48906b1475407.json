That cannot be so and it is not so and it will not be so, and there can be no argument about that.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Some six Labour MPs and 17 independents backed the prime minister.\n\nThe European Commission said in a statement that it \u201ctakes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called Letwin Amendment meaning that the Withdrawal Agreement itself was not put to vote today\".\n\nThe statement, issued by spokeswoman Mina Andreeva, added: \"It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible.\"\n\nDowning Street declined to say how Mr Johnson intended to avoid negotiating an extension to Brexit, with a spokesman saying only: \u201cGovernments comply with the law.\u201d\n\nThe six Labour MPs supporting the PM were Kevin Barron, Ronnie Campbell, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint, Kate Hoey and John Mann.

He can no longer use the threat of a no-deal crash-out to blackmail members to support his sell-out deal.\"\n\nThe SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said that if Mr Johnson acted as if we was \"above the law\", he would find himself in court.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: \"The most urgent thing right now is the Prime Minister complies with the law.\"\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry, who led a successful legal action against Mr Johnson's five-week suspension of parliament, told MPs: \"Fortunately we are back in court on Monday morning. It will be possible then to secure the court's assistance if the prime minister has flouted the law and the promises he gave to the court.\"\n\nMr Bercow indicated that he is ready to sign the letter to Brussels requesting an extension if parliament or the courts instruct him to.", "description": "MPs have voted to withhold approval for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal\u00a0in a spectacular setback to his plans to take the UK out of the European Union.
