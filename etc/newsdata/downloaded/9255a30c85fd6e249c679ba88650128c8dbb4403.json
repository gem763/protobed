NPR affiliate Illinois Public Radio labeled Christian and conservative opposition to this law while it was being considered as stemming from \u201chate groups.\u201d\n\nThe explicit goal of such laws, which are also in place in California, Colorado, New Jersey, and Oregon, is to make children agree with the left\u2019s views of sexuality, which contradict the historic views of all major world religions. This is not only the open, stated goal of those pushing such laws but also explicit in the curriculum.\n\n\u201cImagine a generation of Illinois students having learned the positive contributions of LGBTQ people to U.S., Illinois, world history,\u201d Brian Johnson, CEO of the advocacy group Equality Illinois, told IPR. \u201cI think it\u2019s only going to have a positive effect on our society\u2019s view of LGBTQ people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has the potential to change the way society views the LGBT community. Who we decide to talk about and who we include in history reflects the values we have in our society,\u201d said Democrat state Rep. Anna Moeller, the new law\u2019s lead sponsor, to the local newspaper Daily Herald.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredibly diverse student body, which leads to more inclusiveness and tolerance,\u201d Chicago-area public school teacher Leslie Schock told the Daily Herald in response to Illinois\u2019s new LGBT curriculum requirements. \u201cThe kids don\u2019t really question why it\u2019s important to them. For the most part, throughout their entire childhood, gay marriage has been legalized.\u201d\n\nA Brown University study last year found indications that an identity politics-saturated environment can fuel a \u201csocial contagion\u201d of children identifying as transgender. Scholar Mary Eberstadt has written in great detail about how upending boundaries around sex undermines children\u2019s faith. Loss of faith, as well as sexual profligacy, is correlated with a host of social problems including mental illness, family chaos, government dependence, violence, and lawlessness.\n\nAP and District 65 Offer a Preview of Coming Instruction\n\nTo get a sense of what all Illinois public schools must begin teaching children starting next year, one can look at curriculum developed this summer in Illinois\u2019s Evanston/Skokie School District 65, as well as Advanced Placement history classes. Scholars noted AP products were given a decidedly leftist, identity politics slant in recent revisions. These classes educate the nation\u2019s top third of students and for many are the last history classes they ever take. Especially well-educated and high-income parents trust them as a way to get their kids a leg up on college and thus life.\n\nYet they are rapidly being corrupted by leftist ideology. Schock noted that she was teaching LGBT-themed materials before the Illinois law passed because the College Board integrated it into AP history classes in recent revisions. \u201cSchock teaches about the 1969 Stonewall riots for LGBTQ rights in New York City, feminism, and Latino and American Indian rights movements as part of the description of social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. She spends a class period on each topic,\u201d reported the Daily Herald.\n\nThis means that even in states that have not mandated LGBT curriculum, bright students are likely to be exposed to it through AP classes, which also influence non-AP curriculum. The Stonewall Riots are also taught to elementary school students as part of LGBTQ+ Equity Week curriculum being taught this week in District 65, a north Chicago suburb.\n\nThe district\u2019s Gender and Sexuality Educators\u2019 Alliance (GSEA) noted in a Sept. 12 email sent to all staff that \u201cThis work [of the district\u2019s Oct. 7-11 LGBTQ+ Equity Week] comes during an important time in Illinois history. A few weeks ago, Governor Pritzker signed House Bill 246 into law and as of July 1, 2020, all Illinois public schools will be required to include LGBTQ history in their curriculums [sic].\u201d District 65 teachers earned $35 per hour to create this curriculum over the summer, according to documents The Federalist obtained from an open records request.\n\nOn Oct. 8, District 65 school board President Suni Kartha sent parents and staff a statement: \u201cOur administration has heard from a number of parents who want the ability to opt their children out of this curriculum. The District 65 Board of Education does not support allowing students to opt out of this or any curriculum that seeks to include a more complete account of the role of historically marginalized people in our society, as such curriculum is vital to supporting our district mission of preparing students to contribute positively to a global and diverse society.\u201d\n\nAdhering to intersectionality requires saturating all classes with identity politics at all times. The district is also making sure children receive LGBT instruction all year long, not just in one week, as the teachers who wrote the LGBTQ+ Equity Week curriculum also developed \u201cmodular resources to support teachers who choose to include LGBTQ+ identities in their curriculum throughout the remainder of the year,\u201d according to district documents. Of course, even children parents might keep home from school for this one week are otherwise in class every day with teachers and peers who attended, and children talk.\n\nHow Do Teachers Feel About This? District Won\u2019t Say\n\nThe district\u2019s parents are wealthier and hold a higher percentage of college degrees than the overall U.S. population, with a $101,047 median household income and 70 percent who have obtained at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to federal data. District 65 manages 7,997 students, ages 3 to 14, and spends $18,649 per student per year, according to the most recent federal data.\n\nEvanston/Skokie School District 65 only encompasses preK-8 students. For this group of largely prepubescent children, since spring the district has been planning an October 7-11 \u201cweek of curriculum [that] seeks to address and affirm intersectional identities that encompass a combination of race, gender, and/or sexuality,\u201d according to a May 3 email from district official Sophie Leventhal.\n\nIn preparation for this week-long celebration of National Coming Out Day on October 11, Levanthal asked all district employees to fill out a survey. That survey asked staff to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, \u201cHow comfortable are you teaching and discussing LGBTQ+ curriculum?\u201d \u201cAre you open to growing in comfort, knowledge, and preparedness in order to effectively teach & discuss LGBTQ+ curriculum?\u201d and \u201cHow supported do you feel by district leaders specifically around LGBTQ+ equity?\u201d\n\nAll of these were required questions in order to complete the survey, which is available in full here. The district refused to supply the answers teachers provided, claiming results obtained five months ago are \u201cpredecisional.\u201d\n\nWhat Evanston/Skokie Schools Are Teaching Preschoolers\n\nDistrict 65\u2019s full LGBTQ+ week curriculum can be viewed online. To get a sense of of what this public school district is teaching the children in its care, and what the new LGBT curriculum in all Illinois public schools will look like starting next school year, let\u2019s look at a few selections from their preschool and kindergarten curriculum for this week. This is for children ages 3 to 5.\n\nTeachers were given a lesson plan on slides that include movies and a teaching script to show and say to the children each day of the week. The children are shown, among other things, a video of someone reading aloud the book \u201cHeather Has Two Mommies,\u201d famous transgender teen Jazz Jenning reading his picture book \u201cI Am Jazz,\u201d a book read aloud on video called \u201cMy Princess Boy,\u201d and the apparently highly awarded video below. The script tells teachers to use materials like these throughout the year, not just during LGBTQ+ Equity Week.\n\nThe curriculum teaches preschoolers and kindergarteners to compare mixed-race and adoptive families with families headed by same-sex couples and even possibly a polyamorous family \u2014 in this part of the video captured below, the boy says \u201cMy two moms are Marilyn and Adrian and my two dads are Michael and Barry.\u201d It\u2019s not explained what his two moms and dads call their arrangement. Maybe that\u2019s considered too risque for three-year-olds.\n\nThe children are also openly catechized in LGBT affirmations. For example, the script tells the teacher to say after one video: \u201cOK. Let\u2019s see what we learned. For each picture, you tell me if this is a family. Ready?\u201d The children are clearly expected to say \u201cYes\u201d to each.\n\nThe curriculum also introduces three-year-olds to the concepts of \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cgay,\u201d and \u201ctransgender.\u201d In the slide below, the teacher script below the image directs teachers to tell the children, \u201cIf students say it is not a family, review definition \u2013 people who love you and care for you. When they say yes, agree! Yes some families have 2 moms.\u201d\n\nThe script for the slide below directs teachers to tell preschoolers and kindergarteners, \u201cSometimes people use their bodies to help them know their gender, and some people know their gender in their heart.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther parts of the curriculum suggest to these small children that enjoying dress-up, playing with \u201cboy toys\u201d or \u201cgirl toys,\u201d or loving people of either sex or both sexes might mean they are gay or transgender. It also tells children that clothes communicate nothing about one\u2019s sex.\n\nIn the video of Jennings reading \u201cI Am Jazz,\u201d he tells the preschoolers that being transgender means \u201chaving a girl brain but a boy body.\u201d After reading, he also looks into the camera and tells the children \u201cyou can be just like Jazz.\u201d\n\nSpecial Needs Children Not Left Out\n\nThe LGBT curriculum also contains lessons for children classified as special needs. It includes the following slides. The following slide\u2019s teacher script says: \u201cEveryone has a sexual orientation! This is not just something for someone in the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d\n\nThe following slide\u2019s teacher script says: \u201cEveryone has a gender identity! This is not just something for someone in the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d\n\nIt also introduces K-8 special-needs children to various forms of sex and plenty of people and organizations to Google.\n\nSpecial-needs kids also see this video about a \u201cgender-fluid\u201d 11-year-old.\n\nPutting the Squeeze on Parents, Teachers\n\nDistrict 65 provided teachers a document from LGBT activist group Welcoming Schools that explains why parents do not need to be informed of these curriculum materials ahead of time: \u201cIn many states there are specific regulations for parental notification when the school curriculum addresses sexuality. However, when educators discuss family diversity, it is family \u2014 children\u2019s families \u2014 that are being discussed. \u201d It has become standard for school districts to teach LGBT material outside of sex ed, because sex ed typically operates under regulations such as parental notification and opt-out.\n\nIn a \u201cStaff Guide,\u201d the district tells teachers that students need to learn the right ideology to be financially successful.\n\nCultural competency is a 21st century skill that students will need to enter the workforce. We see daily examples of how intolerant thinking compromises the professional success of the people around us. Whether the conversation be about race, religion, language, gender, or sexuality, adults and students must be prepared to participate in conversations using facts and relevant vocabulary instead of myths, stereotypes, and slurs.\n\nThe district gave teachers more scripts to use in another document from Welcoming Schools about marriage. It says teachers should tell students about marriage that \u201cPeople can fall in love and want to be in a relationship, no matter their gender.\u201d And here\u2019s a sample Q&A with a student: \u201c\u2018Can Jorge\u2019s dads get married? I thought two men couldn\u2019t get married.\u2019 \u2018Yes, his dads can get married. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in a court case that all the states should allow people of the same gender to get married.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Staff Guide also tells school administrators how to behave during LGBTQ+ Week: \u201cEncourage people to be unafraid of backlash diving into this work and that you will answer any parental concerns; Be visible and supportive.\u201d\n\nEvanston/Skokie is the same school district where in 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported, administrators had staff divide themselves into separate \u201cracial identification\u201d groups of \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cindividuals of color\u201d for discussions of race and racism. The district also plans a Black Lives Matter week in February 2020 and refused to release the curriculum developed for it in response to an open records request.", "description": "To get a sense of what all Illinois public schools must begin teaching children starting next year, one can look at LGBT curriculum developed this summer.", "authors": ["Joy Pullmann"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cjmovie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
