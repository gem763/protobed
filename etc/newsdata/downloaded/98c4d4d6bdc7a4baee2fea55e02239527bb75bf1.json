As it did, it sent out an alert to international astronomers, so that they could track it themselves.\n\nHoloien received that alert and pointed two telescopes towards the incident and asked for more to look that way too.\n\nNasa's TESS was already looking towards the right part of space. It spends its time watching vast parts of the sky known as sectors for 27 days each, with the aim of spotting moments where stars go dark that could indicate a planet has passed in front of them.\n\nAstronomers thought it might also be able to catch the earliest moments of flare-ups around stars, such as supernovae and tidal disruptions. And it did see this one: first spotting a week before ASAS-SN saw it, but unable to tell Earth straight away because it sends back its data once every two weeks, and that must then be processed by Nasa.\n\nResearchers could then look back at that data and see the star as it was being torn up by the black hole.\n\n\u201cThe early TESS data allow us to see light very close to the black hole, much closer than we\u2019ve been able to see before,\u201d said Patrick Vallely, a co-author and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at OSU.\n\n\u201cThey also show us that ASASSN-19bt\u2019s rise in brightness was very smooth, which helps us tell that the event was a tidal disruption and not another type of outburst, like from the center of a galaxy or a supernova.\u201d\n\nMuch about tidal disruptions is still mysterious to astronomers, but observations of this kind could shed more light on why they happen. They are unclear about why they throw out so much UV emissions but so few X-rays, for instance.\n\n\u201cPeople have suggested multiple theories \u2014 perhaps the light bounces through the newly created debris and loses energy, or maybe the disk forms further from the black hole than we originally thought and the light isn\u2019t so affected by the object\u2019s extreme gravity,\u201d said S. Bradley Cenko, Swift\u2019s principal investigator at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \u201cMore early-time observations of these events may help us answer some of these lingering questions.\u201d", "description": "Nasa\u00a0has managed to get an unprecedented view of a black hole ripping apart a star.
