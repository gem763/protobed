The information is used to improve Siri's future performance and capabilities.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple said if consumers grant permission, only its own employees will be allowed to review audio to help improve the service.\n\n\"We realize haven't been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologize,\" Apple conceded.\n\nIt's not yet clear how Apple will seek permission, though in the past, Apple has typically requested permissions through prompts during software update installations.\n\nIn recent months, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have all acknowledged that people have been reviewing users' interactions with artificial intelligence assistants in order to improve the services. But users aren't typically aware that humans and not just computers are reviewing audio.\n\nThe use of humans to listen to audio recordings is particularly troubling to privacy experts because it increases the chances that a rogue employee or contractor could leak details of what is being said, including parts of sensitive conversations.\n\nApple said it will still use computer-generated transcripts to improve services, even if a user hasn't explicitly granted permission, or opted in.", "description": "The tech giant said it will still listen to Siri recordings, but only if consumers give permission", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/04/19/913d70de-c436-11e2-a43e-02911869d855/thumbnail/1200x630/e7b7db9b9636bd5f54a7e5303a724cde/apple-siri-620x442.jpg"}
