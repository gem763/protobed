I will destroy humans.\" She also got in a Twitter fight with Chrissy Teigen.\n\nIn a new essay detailing a journalist's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein over the past three decades, Edward Jay Epstein (the two are not related) says the wealthy financier told him in April 2013 that he was funding a Hong Kong group to build \"the world's smartest robot,\" named Sophia.\n\nSince the last conversation the two had on February 25 this year, Epstein was arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. He had previously been convicted in 2008 on two counts of soliciting prostitution from underaged girls in Palm Beach, Florida. He died by suicide in jail in August while awaiting trial.\n\nEpstein expressed a vision for Sophia the robot as early as 2013, but her makers deny he was involved in financing her\n\nSophia was built by Hanson Robotics, a Hong Kong company created and led by David Hanson. Hanson teamed up with Ben Goertzel, founder of open-source software project OpenCog, to create Sophia. Goertzel has openly thanked Epstein for \"visionary funding\" of his \"AGI research,\" Fast Company reported, and Sophia is powered by OpenCog's code.\n\nBut Hanson Robotics has denied that Epstein funded Sophia, saying in previous statements that none of Epstein's money \"were used towards Sophia or to the benefit of Hanson Robotics.\" The statement included Goertzel's confirmation. Hanson Robotics didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\njeffrey epstein More\n\nRick Friedman/Rick Friedman Photography/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nEven if Epstein didn't directly fund Sophia's construction, he told the journalist in 2013 that his main interest was cutting-edge artificial intelligence, and said Sophia would have \"more empathy than a woman.\" Epstein also said the team had run into difficulties simulating human skin, suggesting that the then-convicted sex offender kept close watch over the experiment he claimed to fund.", "description": "Sophia the robot garnered media attention for her quotable moments and diverse facial expressions.
