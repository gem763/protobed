I was pretty excited to get up and do it. I\u2019d been looking forward to it for a really long time.'\n\nOn his bib, where a runner's name would usually go, Moon had the phrase 'Jesus Save' in bold letters.\n\nPictured: Runners and medical service crews providing moon with CPR and other\n\nPictured: Moon's marathon bib that has the phrase 'Jesus Saves' after Moon collapsed during the eighth mile of the run\n\nHe told Fox News: 'So, before the race, my name was originally on the bib. One day I got a thought - I thought it was from God and that it should be a profession of faith -- and changed it to 'Jesus Saves,' so that another runner or someone in the audience would see it ... that Jesus saves us for eternity.'\n\nHis parents and his fiancee Amy Greene -whom he will marry in January - cheered him on from the sidelines.\n\nMoon is a former college football player and unsurprisingly his athleticism was shining through.\n\nAmy Greene (left), who is marrying Moon in January, was at the marathon race when her fiance suffered the heart attack\n\nHe was running eight-minute miles, but he reportedly knows this because it was recorded on his watch that tracked his progress.\n\nMoon doesn't remember anything after the first mile.\n\nWhen he reached Summit Avenue in St. Paul, crossing into the threshold of his eighth, something went wrong.\n\nMoon's heart began to beat irregularly and for a scary 10 seconds his heart stopped pumping blood.\n\nHe collapsed on the ground with a heart attack, suffering a concussion, fractured bones on the left side of his face and scraped up the left side of his body.\n\nIt would later be revealed the 25-year-old experienced ventricular tachycardia, which can cause cardiac arrest at its worst.\n\nMiraculously, Jesus was right behind him.\n\nJesus 'Jesse' Bueno, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, was running behind Mon and saw the man drop to the ground.\n\nHe ran beside Moon and instructed someone to call 911 as he searched for a pulse in Moon.\n\nBueno (pictured) was running behind Moon when the incident occurred and rushed to save him\n\nIt was hard to tell because Bueno's own pulse was beating so fast.\n\n'We\u2019ve got to start CPR,' he told a co-worker who was also running in the race.\n\nBueno began to breathe for Moon while his co-worker performed chest compressions for five to 15 minutes.\n\nBueno continued to help as authorities arrived and placed the defibrillator patches on Moon's chest to shock him back to life.\n\nMoon was taken to the Regions Hospital and Bueno finished the race in a state of shock.\n\nBueno said: 'It was surreal. I thought, \"Did that just really happen?\"'\n\nMeanwhile, Greene and Moon's parents began walking to the finish line because they thought they missed Moon run by.\n\nGreene told Kare 11: 'It was a lot. It was a lot'\n\nPictured: Bueno (left) and Moon (right) meeting after the the incident\n\nAuthorities called Green on her phone and escorted them to the hospital.\n\nMoon is recovering from the incident and, thankfully, doctors say the heart attack was most likely an anomaly.\n\nMoon, his family and Greene are thankful for Bueno and medical workers who stepped in.\n\n'We\u2019re just happy God had it happen where it did, where there were all these wonderful people that stepped up.'\n\n'Like I\u2019ve said, I went for a run, then all of a sudden, a bunch of strangers saved my life.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Runner Tyler Moon wore a 'Jesus Saves' bib while running a marathon in  Minneapolis, Minnesota, but had no idea someone named Jesus would save him when he suffered a heart attack mid-race", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20199830-0-image-a-41_1572040955915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
