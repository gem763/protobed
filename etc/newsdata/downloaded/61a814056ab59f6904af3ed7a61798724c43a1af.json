REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court upheld a ban on same-sex marriage and civil union partnerships on Friday after a lesbian identified as \u2018MK\u2019 launched the city\u2019s first judicial challenge on the issue, stating it violated her constitutional rights.\n\nRights group Amnesty International described the judgement as a \u201cbitter blow\u201d for LGBT+ people in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cSadly, the discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples will continue for the time being,\u201d Amnesty said in a statement.\n\nThe Court of First Instance ruled that the government was not obliged to provide an alternative legal framework such as civil unions, giving same-sex couples the equal rights and benefits enjoyed by opposite-sex married couples.\n\nThe court said that, while there are diverse and opposing views in society, it expressed \u201cno view on the associated social, moral and/or religious issues\u201d and that it had adopted a strict legal approach to the matter.\n\nHomosexuality has been decriminalized since 1991 in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The city has an annual pride parade and lively gay scene.\n\nIt does not, however, recognise same-sex marriage and LGBT+ activists voice concerns about widespread discrimination.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s top court in June ruled in favour of a gay civil servant fighting for spousal and tax benefits for his husband.", "description": "A Hong Kong court upheld a ban on same-sex marriage and civil union partnerships on Friday after a lesbian identified as 'MK' launched the city's first judicial challenge on the issue, stating it violated her constitutional rights.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442211278&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0M2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
