Biden was in \u201cno way connected\u201d to the president withholding military aid, as far as he knew.\n\nPressed by reporters in Iowa whether he was \u201caware\u201d that the military aid was tied to a probe of Mr. Biden, Mr. Pence responded, \u201cThat\u2019s your question. Let me be very clear, the issue of aid and our efforts with regard to Ukraine, were from my experience no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people have about corruption that took place, about things that happened in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his team have accused Mr. Biden, a leading Democratic candidate for president, of pressuring Ukraine in 2016 to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating a gas company that paid Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter $3 million. The elder Biden was vice president at the time and played a key role in U.S policy toward Ukraine.\n\nMr. Pence said of his contacts with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, \u201cI never discussed the issue of the Bidens with President Zelensky.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence also said he is discussing with the White House counsel\u2019s office whether to release transcripts of his phone calls with Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have no objection to that, and we\u2019re discussing that with White House counsel as we speak,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s focus with Ukraine from the very beginning was on enlisting more European support and supporting President Zelensky\u2019s efforts to advance reforms that would end an era of corruption in Ukraine. I was very proud that different from the last administration, we provided military assistance to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
