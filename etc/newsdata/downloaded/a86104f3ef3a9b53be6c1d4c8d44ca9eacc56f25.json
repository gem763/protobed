No-one will be inconvenienced as witnesses will not need to be called as a result of the guilty plea.\"\n\nBut Geraldine Dickinson, prosecuting, urged the court to carry on with the matter in Price's absence.\n\nShe said: \"Her solicitors knew about this date and knew about her whereabouts and that she's be returning to Gatwick this morning.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Even if she came back at 9am, she could have made an appearance at this court today.\"\n\nDistrict Judge Robert Hunter said: \"This hearing has already been adjourned once.\n\n\"This date was agreed by both sides. I am not inclined to further adjourn this matter.\"\n\nThe prosecutor pointed to Price's previous disqualifications, such as a three month ban in July 2018 and a further three month back in October 2018. Six points were added to Price's licence in January 2019.\n\nThe District Judge said: \"I am imposing another six points, which amounts to a disqualification of two years to the licence.\n\n\"I am also imposing a fine of \u00a3440, a surcharge of \u00a344 and prosecution costs of \u00a3100 to be paid in 28 days.\"\n\n(Image: Tim P.
