The Stena has not been released.\n\nUS Coast Guardsmen with Maritime Security Response Team East, Advanced Interdiction Team Detachment 1, during a training exercise in the Gulf Credit: Reuters More\n\nIran changed the Grace 1\u2019s name and sold the crude, though it did not disclose the buyer.\n\nSince then it has been sailing around the Mediterranean with its load, continually changing its destination port.\n\nThe US Treasury Department blacklisted the tanker on Friday, citing intelligence it was planning to deliver its crude to Syria.\n\nWashington warned any state against assisting the ship, saying it would consider that support for a terrorist organisation, namely, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, prompting Greece to deny the Adrian permission to dock.\n\nAccording to TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite tracking to record shipping movements, the vessel sent its last signal giving its position between Lebanese and Syrian waters sailing north at 5.53pm local time on Monday.\n\nAn aerial view shows a speedboat of Iran's Revolutionary Guard moving around the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which was seized in the Strait of Hormuz Credit: AP More\n\nIt is now thought to be sitting off the coast of Tartus, Syria, awaiting a ship-to-ship transfer via one of a handful of Iranian-linked tankers in the region, also currently with no Automatic Identification System signals active.\n\nIt is not against international law to turn the AIS off, but it is often done to try to get around sanctions.\n\nSilvia 1, an Iran-flagged tanker, turned off its transponder on August 29 having entered the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal, expected to deliver its cargo to Syria\u2019s Banyas refinery.\n\nStark I, a 159,681 dwt, Iran-flagged crude tanker, took a similar route, also dropping off communication late on August 30.", "description": "The tanker at the centre of a diplomatic row between Iran and Britain \u201cwent dark\u201d yesterday night off the coast of Syria, where it is suspected she may be delivering a controversial cargo of Iranian crude oil.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uI9lfJEeLiNUvOnIFVpdng--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/c525c0dd5e592cced28e6062cf0c74ce"}
