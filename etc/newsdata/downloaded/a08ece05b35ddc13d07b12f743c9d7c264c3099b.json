Between 2011 and 2018, China made official loan commitments to the region totaling about $6 billion, or about 21% of regional GDP.\n\nAs China spreads its influence beyond the South China Sea to the South Pacific -- a region comprised of island nations traditionally under U.S. hegemony and on Australia\u2019s doorstep -- officials in Washington and Canberra are increasingly concerned Beijing may use debt through infrastructure loans as leverage to establish military bases in the region.\n\nOpaque Lending\n\nLast November, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence criticized President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt-and-Road Initiative, which Morgan Stanley has said may total $1.3 trillion by 2027 -- dwarfing the funds the U.S. and allies have mobilized. Pence said the U.S. doesn\u2019t \u201cdrown our partners in a sea of debt\u201d or \u201coffer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nWhile the Lowy report said there was no evidence to suggest China was engaging in deliberate \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d in the South Pacific, it urged Beijing to adjust \u201cthe scale, nature, and opacity of China\u2019s lending activities\u201d in the region.\n\n\u201cIf China wants to remain a major development financier in the Pacific without fulfilling the debt-trap accusations of its critics, it will need to substantially restructure its approach, including adopting formal lending rules similar to those of the multilateral development banks,\u201d it said.\n\nChina has increased its economic and diplomatic footprint in the region by funding and building much-desired transport and utility infrastructure, compared with the traditional focus by U.S. and Australia on bolstering governance, health and education services.\n\nIncreasing Aid\n\nAccording to Lowy, between 2011\u20132017 China was responsible for 37% of all official sector loans to the region, with traditional creditors including Asian Development Bank and World Bank responsible for the bulk of the balance. China is the single largest creditor in Samoa and Vanuatu, and accounts for more than half of Tonga\u2019s total outstanding debt, it said.\n\nIn response to China\u2019s rising power in the region, the U.S. recently established a Directorate of Pacific Affairs within the White House National Security Council, which provides a hub for coordinating U.S. policy in the region with other like-minded countries, including Australia.\n\nAustralia unveiled a A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) infrastructure fund for the region last last year, while the U.S. joined a group that includes Japan, the European Union and the ADB to fund projects.\n\n\u201cThere is scope for Australia\u2019s more modest infrastructure lending plans to be sustainable,\u201d the Lowy report said. \u201cIf Australia wants to do more in the Pacific though, it should reverse the current stagnation in its overall aid budget.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jason Scott in Canberra at jscott14@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China should put the brakes on its lending in the South Pacific to avoid lumping economically vulnerable nations with unsustainable debt, according to a report released by an Australian think tank.\u201cThe sheer scale of China\u2019s lending and its lack of strong institutional mechanisms to protect", "authors": ["Jason Scott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
