Natural gas suppliers are not expected to curb deliveries despite the low prices, abundant supply, and tepid demand. The winter heating season in October is set to begin with temperatures around or above seasonal norms, early forecasts suggest.\n\nAll these factors combine to create a perfect storm for natural gas prices in Europe, which are set for a further fall this fall, at least until winter comes, analysts and industry professionals tell Bloomberg.\n\nLow liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices amid abundant supply and weaker Asian spot demand have helped Europe to fill its storage tanks to more than average levels this summer.\n\nNatural gas prices in Europe dropped to a ten-year low in early July as Russia and the United States continue to fight for market share.\n\nThanks to the lowest natural gas prices in a decade, storage tanks in many European countries are higher than the five-year average well ahead of the coming heating season. Traders continue to ship LNG cargos to Europe, potentially waiting for trading opportunities when the winter season approaches and prices rise.\n\nAs of September 2, storage facilities in Europe were 92.95 percent full, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe. The levels of natural gas in storage now are much higher than what is typical for early September.\n\nAt the same time, apart from maintenance at Norwegian gas export facilities, the biggest pipeline suppliers to Europe\u2014Norway and Russia\u2014aren\u2019t restricting deliveries even in the face of prices at a ten-year low and the prospect of further price declines.\n\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom admitted last week that its natural gas exports to Europe plus Turkey would drop this year from the record levels seen in 2018.\n\nYet, the Russian gas giant\u2014which holds around 33 percent of Europe\u2019s natural gas market\u2014is still fighting for market share, Niek van Kouteren, a senior trader with Dutch energy company PZEM, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWhen we have an opportunity, we make extra sales,\u201d Gazprom Export\u2019s deputy department head Mikhail Malgin told analysts at a conference call last week.\n\nRelated: Colorado Drillers Ramp Up Production As Stricter Regulation Looms\n\nAnalysts believe that low gas prices won\u2019t discourage suppliers from trying to deliver more volumes into the European market.\n\nThis means that in the short term, supply is likely to outstrip demand in the so-called \u2018shoulder season\u2019 when the summer heat waves with high demand for cooling have ended while the winter heating season hasn\u2019t begun yet. Add high storage levels across Europe, and prices are set to dip further, although they are now sitting at their lowest in ten years.\n\nAccording to Norbert Ruecker, head of economics at Julius Baer Group, Dutch benchmark natural gas prices could be set for another 20-percent decline in the fall, and \u201cIf things turn out really bad, maybe the bear case is even lower,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\n\nIn addition to supply exceeding demand, the start of this year\u2019s heating season in October could see above normal temperatures in many parts of mainland Europe, IBM\u2019s The Weather Company said last month.\n\nHigher than usual volumes in Europe\u2019s storage is not all that bad, especially if the talks between Ukraine and Gazprom on the gas transit to Europe stall and Russia were to cut off supply to European markets via Ukraine.\n\nBut in case there are no extreme events on the European gas market in the coming months, natural gas prices are poised to drop even lower than they are now.\n\n\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Natural gas prices in Europe are set to drop even lower than the current ten-year lows this fall...", "authors": ["Tsvetana Paraskova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
