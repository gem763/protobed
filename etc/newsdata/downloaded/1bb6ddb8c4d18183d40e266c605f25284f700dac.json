Photo: Stephen Chernin/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump Organization has never been shy about profiting off of Donald Trump\u2019s position as president. But being associated with a hate-mongering, would-be authoritarian isn\u2019t always good for the bottom line. An acknowledgment of that came in recent weeks when the Trump Organization stripped the president\u2019s name from its ice-skating rinks in New York City, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete rebranding,\u201d Geoffrey Croft of NYC Park Advocates told the Post. Trump\u2019s name, once splashed all over Wollman Rink and Lasker Ring, is now hard to find, according to reports in the Post and the Times. It\u2019s gone from the boards surrounding the ring, the skate-rental desks, and the employee uniforms. It\u2019s still on the Zamboni, but Croft told the Post that\u2019s coming off too.\n\nThe changes did not come at the request of the city, which owns the rinks and has a contract with the Trump Organization to operate them. The Trump Organization made this decision on its own. One theory why: The rinks suffered a slight dip in revenue in recent years and the Trump Org is trying to hide its association with a guy who\u2019s largely despised in NYC. The Times reports:\n\nIn the operating year that ended on Sept. 30, 2015, the rinks generated about $8.9 million. The figure climbed to $9.3 million in the next operating year, which ended shortly before Mr. Trump became president. In the 12 months that ended on Sept. 30, 2018, annual revenue had dropped to about $8.7 million.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know if this decline is due to anti-Trump sentiment, but there\u2019s at least a little anecdotal evidence. In 2017, a Wollman Rink party for students of the tony Upper East Side Dalton School was reportedly canceled because of its association with Trump.\n\nAnother theory, shared with the Times by Democratic city councilman Mark Levine, is that the company is trying to prevent upheaval when its contract to run the rinks comes up for renewal in 2021. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the public to associate the Trump name with these properties,\u201d Levine told the paper. \u201cThey know that there would be too much public pressure against renewal.\u201d\n\nLevine has argued in the past that the city should preemptively sever its contracts with the Trump Organization because the company is \u201cdeeply entangled in a criminal conspiracy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s name has been stripped from other properties in New York City, but this appears to be the first time the Trump Organization did the stripping itself.", "description": "The Trump Organization has scrubbed nearly all appearances of the President\u2019s name from his two Central Park ice skating rinks.", "authors": ["Adam K.
