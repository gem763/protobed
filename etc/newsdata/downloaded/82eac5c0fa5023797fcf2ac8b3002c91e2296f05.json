DNA patterns in the blood of 60 patients with hypersexual disorder were measured and compared to 33 samples from healthy volunteers.\n\n8 852 regions of DNA methylations were investigated to identify any variations between the samples. DNA methylation can affect gene expression and the function of genes, which can reduce their activity. Findings were also compared to samples from 107 subjects, of which 24 were alcohol dependent, in order to explore an association with addictive behaviour.\n\nIt was revealed that there were two region of DNA that were altered in hypersexual patients. The DNA identified targets genes that are not normally expressed at particularly high levels in the brain and are involved in the regulation of oxytocin. Oxytocin plays a central role in the regulation of pair-bonding behaviour.\n\nTreatment for hypersexuality\n\nThe comparison with alcohol-dependent subjects revealed the same DNA region to be significantly under-methylated, suggesting that it may be primarily associated with addictive components of hypersexual disorder, which include sex addiction, dysregulated sexual desire, compulsivity and impulsivity.\n\nAdrian Bostrom, from the department of Neuroscience at Uppsala University, Sweden, who conducted the study with researchers from the Andrology/Sexual Medicine Group (ANOVA) at Karolinska Institutet said, \"We set out to investigate the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms behind hypersexual disorder so we could determine whether it has any hallmarks that make it distinct from other health issues.\" According to Bostrom, this study is the first of its kind seeking treatment for hypersexuality.\n\nThe authors noted that the mean difference in DNA methylation was around 2.6% between patients with hypersexual disorder and healthy volunteers, so the impact on physiological changes could be questioned. However, evidence suggests that even subtle methylation changes could have wide-ranging consequences for more complex conditions such as depression or schizophrenia.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "A new study has revealed that men and women suffering from hypersexual disorder may have an oxytocin imbalance.", "authors": ["Deeanne Daniels"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9411/28035a9c689a4ca3878a3bc8755f4f92.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
