Like many of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, it is likely to face swift legal challenges in federal courts.\n\nTrump said he is taking the action to \u201cprotect the availability of health care benefits for Americans,\u201d and said \u201ctaxpayers bear substantial cost\u201d in paying for medical expenses of people who lack health insurance.\n\n[Legal challenges aim to derail Trump\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule that could limit path to citizenship for poor immigrants]\n\n\u201cImmigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our health care system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs,\u201d Trump said in the proclamation.\n\nAnalysts said the proclamation appears to target family-based migration, the type of \u201cchain migration\u201d that the Trump administration and White House aide Stephen Miller, an immigration hawk, have been unable to persuade Congress to reduce. The White House has pushed for policies that would favor wealthier immigrants with special skills over immigrants from poorer countries, including in Latin America.\n\nTrump\u2019s proclamation comes as the administration is also preparing to implement a new \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule Oct. 15 that seeks to deny green cards and U.S. citizenship to poor immigrants.\n\nTo obtain an immigration visa, foreigners must prove they will be covered by \u201capproved health insurance,\u201d such as a family or employment-based policy, within 30 days of entering the United States, unless they are affluent enough to cover their \u201creasonably foreseeable medical costs.\u201d\n\nAmong the legal provisions Trump invoked to support his proclamation is Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which grants the president authority to declare certain migrants ineligible for asylum because it \u201cwould be contrary to the national interest\u201d and \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe section is the same legal authority he invoked during the 2017 travel ban, which mainly limited travel of nationals of certain Muslim-majority countries.\n\nDoug Rand, a former White House official in the Obama administration who worked on immigration policy, said Trump\u2019s proclamation is likely to affect the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens waiting overseas for permission to come to the United States, including parents, spouses and siblings. Children are exempt.\n\nHe said the new rules would not affect the relatives of immigrants already in the United States.\n\nThe proclamation also does not appear to affect immigrants arriving on work visas, refugees or those seeking asylum at the Mexican border, he said, but he called the new rule \u201ca gigantic, sweeping change to the legal immigration system.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policymaking, this is an incredibly flimsy document,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no idea what the process was and it just kind of happened at 7 o\u2019clock on a Friday. Where did this come from? What was the process? Who was involved in this?\u201d\n\nIn the proclamation, Trump said \u201clawful immigrants are about three times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance,\u201d without providing a source for the information. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nScholars have long debated the costs and benefits of immigration to the United States, with some focusing on the costs of health care and education while others note that immigrants and their children contribute millions in income, property and sales taxes.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study said about 1 in 4 \u201clawfully present immigrants\u201d lacked health insurance, compared with less than 1 in 10 U.S. citizens as of 2017.\n\nBut a National Academies of Sciences report in 2016 concluded immigration had a positive effect on economic growth overall in the United States, though immigrants were more likely to compete with less-educated Americans for jobs.\n\nTrump required the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of homeland security, and the heads of other appropriate agencies, to submit a report on the proclamation six months after it takes effect.", "description": "Exceptions will be made for children of U.S. citizens and others.", "authors": ["Maria Sacchetti", "Reporter Covering Immigrant Communities", "Immigration", "Customs Enforcement", "October At Pm", "Maria Sacchetti Covers Immigration For The Washington Post", "Including U.S. Immigration", "The Court System.
