(AP) - The stats speak for themselves.\n\nAfter three games, the New York Giants are ranked last in the NFL in yards allowed passing per game (332.3), 31st in yards per game (460) and 31st in points allowed per game (31.3).\n\nThe Giants are also 16th in sacks, toward the bottom of the league in yards rushing per game, have one interception and forced no fumbles.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the recipe for success - and the Giants know it.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are the numbers,\u201d Giants defensive coordinator James Bettcher said after Thursday\u2019s practice session, as his team prepares to host the Washington Redskins on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t pay too much attention to the numbers. There are times that we have been toward the top as well. Our players are working very hard on defense.\u201d\n\nBettcher said that the Giants are coming off a second half against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers where they played well, enabling the team to come back from an 18-point halftime deficit to win 32-31, allowing just three points in the second half.\n\nBettcher was also encouraged by two solid days of practice.\n\n\u201cWe had two outstanding days of practice,\u201d Bettcher said. \u201cI think we realize that how you get better is with repetition. You identify the problem and go over it. We have to call things better, coach things better and execute better. Those things have to happen for us to play better.\u201d\n\nOne of the most glaring troubles the Giants have experienced has been with their secondary. Even in victory, the Giants allowed Jameis Winston to pass for 380 yards and for receiver Mike Evans to finish with 190 yards, mostly going up against cornerback Janoris Jenkins.\n\nAnother secondary member under some criticism is safety Jabrill Peppers. Acquired in the trade with the Cleveland Browns for Odell Beckham, Jr., Peppers, the New Jersey native, has struggled somewhat, especially in pass coverage.\n\n\u201cI think Jabrill has played extremely hard,\u201d Bettcher said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the ball going his way a ton of times. When I see Jabrill, I see a guy who is competing his tail off and working just as hard as everyone else.\u201d\n\nWhile Jenkins was unavailable after practice, Peppers talked with reporters.\n\n\u201cI definitely have to play better if I\u2019m going to play that position,\u201d said Peppers, the Browns\u2019 first-round selection in 2017 out of Michigan. \u201cI\u2019m hungry out there, but one of my problems has been that I\u2019ve been trying to force the issue.\n\n\u201cInstead of letting the game come to me, I\u2019m pushing myself. I don\u2019t want to be forced into situations and be out of position on plays. I tend to second-guess myself a lot and there have been plays were I have been a little late to the ball. Those were plays that should have been made.\u201d\n\nPeppers was asked if he had seen the Giants\u2018 defensive team statistics.\n\n\u201cIt definitely hurts,\u201d Peppers said. \u201cI try not to pay too much attention to stats. Maybe later in the week, I\u2019ll take a look at them. But it\u2019s early in the season. I\u2019m not going out looking for them. I think it\u2019s definitely motivation to get better.\u201d\n\nPeppers downplayed the personal importance of Sunday\u2019s game, considering that the player he replaced at strong safety with the Giants, Landon Collins, is now the starting strong safety with the Redskins.\n\n\u201cI think I would be prepared for whoever we were going to face,\u201d Peppers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a divisional foe and we\u2019ll see them twice. But I\u2019m not too worried about it.\u201d\n\nRookie cornerback DeAndre Baker is also paying no mind to the Giants\u2018 team defensive statistics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to that stuff,\u201d said Baker, the team\u2019s first-round draft pick out of Georgia. \u201cI don\u2019t think any secondary wants to have the worst number of yards. I think we have to take it upon ourselves to make plays better. But I think we\u2019re all going to take the same approach.\u201d\n\nThe Giants will be without defensive captain and veteran linebacker Alec Ogletree, who sat out practice again with a pulled hamstring. Ogletree, the seven-year veteran, hurt himself trying to return an apparent fumble that had already been blown dead.\n\n\u201cI definitely wish they (the officials) made the right decision and blown the whistle,\u201d Ogletree said. \u201cI saw the ball falling. I thought it was an incomplete pass, but people were saying, \u2018Pick up the ball, pick up the ball.\u2019 I didn\u2019t hear a whistle. It\u2019s the kind of play where you\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t make it any better. I\u2019m just going through the rehab process, not take any chances and whenever they (the team doctors) clear me to come back, then I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The stats speak for themselves.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Hague"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/giants_buccaneers_football_45716_c0-326-3785-2532_s1770x1032.jpg?df8b5c5335189e450a3875cc221003e5e013dd83", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
