That\u2019s the norm. Less normal is the tendency for a car to do a full-on flip, since NASCAR tries its best to keep cars on the ground.\n\nBut if you think an unexpected flip over a pack of race cars going roughly 320km/h was enough to scare the driver of the airborne No. 62, Brendan Gaughan, you would be very wrong. Gaughan came out of his required stop at the medical centre ready to rate his stunt like a gymnastics competition, and that he did.\n\nGaughan, who was laughing to start the interview, called it \u201cone easy, quick flip.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure \u2014 no, I am definitely sure \u2014 I\u2019ve been more upset about hitting my shin on the corner of the couch. But this kind of reaction is very Brendan Gaughan, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with him.\n\nGaughan, who doesn\u2019t race full time in any of NASCAR\u2019s three national touring series anymore but has entered all four \u201crestrictor plate\u201d Cup Series races this year, via Racing Reference, wrecked just after lap 180 of a scheduled 188 at Talladega.\n\nHe was up near the front of the field at the time of the flip, since \u201cplate\u201d races at tracks like Daytona International Speedway and Talladega put drivers on a more equal level even if they\u2019re not competing full time.\n\nBut Gaughan evidently wasn\u2019t meant to stay up there, and he evidently wasn\u2019t too bothered by it. He ended the interview by saying he\u2019d be back to race in the Daytona 500 in February, hopefully with the same nonchalant attitude and the same luck escaping bad wrecks unharmed.", "description": "Toward the end of the NASCAR Cup Series race at Talladega Superspeedway on Monday, which was delayed from Sunday due to rain and a lack of lights at the track, there was a giant wreck.
