He recalls his days of blazers and butterfly-chasing\n\n\u2018She was the most lovely aunt,\u201d says Jacob Rees-Mogg. \u201cWonderfully kind, and took a lot of trouble with her nieces and nephews.\u201d The leader of the Commons is taking a pause from pushing Brexit to speak about his father\u2019s sister, the avant-garde film-maker Anne Rees-Mogg. Yes, you read that right \u2013 the Rees-Mogg clan has a little-known arty streak. Long before Jacob was lounging in front of cameras in parliament, he was making rather different appearances in his Aunt Anne\u2019s experimental films.\n\nThe works were shown in a former British Rail canteen in north London that had been taken over by a film-makers\u2019 cooperative in the 1970s. There, in a screening area set up at one end of the large, leaky-roofed space, Anne\u2019s filmic collages captured Jacob and his siblings mugging sweetly for the camera. He was, apparently, her favourite.\n\nAnne considered herself \u2013 her contemporaries told me \u2013 the black sheep of the family. A committed socialist and champion of women\u2019s and gay rights, her politics could not have been further from those of her conservative Catholic family. Though Jacob remembers her fondly \u2013 \u201cShe even took me to see the first Superman film \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine that could have been her scene\u201d \u2013 her friends and members of the London Filmmakers\u2019 Co-op are less sanguine about the associations of her last name.\n\n\u201cShe would have turned in her grave if she knew what Jacob had become,\u201d says John Smith, who served with her on the board of the co-op, at the time the place to be for artists interested in film-making. \u201cBut she absolutely doted on him. Even as a baby, she would regularly bring him up in conversation. She thought he was the most marvellous person on the planet.\u201d\n\nThe MP for North East Somerset scoffs at this: \u201cI doubt that\u2019s true. I think people say that because I\u2019m known. She was devoted to all her nieces and nephews.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In Transmogrification, which also starred Jacob\u2019s older sisters \u2013 and Alexei Sayle.

What is unusual about Anne, who died of cancer in 1984, is the way her family and memories became the focus of her work. She had been a land girl in the war, doing her bit for Britain by working in agriculture, and many of her films circle around the different places she called home: the stately family pile in Somerset; her house in north London, whose demolition she chronicled in one of her films; and her south London flat. Trinkets recur, from seashells on a mantlepiece to images of the countryside, as do snippets of old footage, like the scene in which three Rees-Moggs from a previous generation step into a fancy open-top car.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t celebrate the establishment, which is obviously what one associates with Jacob and even more so with his father William,\u201d says David Curtis, founder of the British Film and Video Study Collection at Central Saint Martins in London. \u201cWilliam was happy to be establishment \u2013 editor of The Times, a land owner in Somerset and all that. That wasn\u2019t the side of family Anne was interested in. She was interested in place and the location of childhood memories.\u201d\n\nAnne\u2019s films, many of which can be seen free on BFI Player, were made almost like scrapbooks and the footage she shot was casual, diary-like, though Jacob says she knew exactly what she wanted when she was directing her subjects. Her students, from the Chelsea College of Art, appear throughout her work, as do her nieces and nephews in Somerset, where she frequently visited.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Game \u2026 a screengrab from Grandfather\u2019s Footsteps, 1983, with Jacob, left, and brother Thomas.

In Living Memory, from the same year, Jacob catches butterflies in a field. In Grandfather\u2019s Footsteps, one of her major works made three years later, Jacob tromps with his brother Thomas towards the camera in a game of Mother May I. Thomas, the elder, is dressed in jumper and anorak, like any other boy. Jacob, meanwhile, is already showing a taste for what will become his infamous attire: a too-large tweed blazer. \u201cI had quite strong political views even when I was little,\u201d he tells me. The sleeves hang over his hands and the shoulders extend out from his skinny frame, as he smiles shyly at the camera.\n\nWhen I go on telly now, I'm quite conscious. But when you're under 10, you're just doing something jolly\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nervous-making,\u201d the MP recalls. \u201cWhen I go on telly now, I\u2019m quite conscious there are going to be people watching it. But when you\u2019re under 10, and you\u2019re asked to appear in a film for your aunt, you aren\u2019t thinking, \u2018Where will this be screened and who will watch it?\u2019 You\u2019re just thinking your aunt\u2019s asking you to do something, it\u2019s a jolly thing to do.\u201d\n\nIn some ways Anne was ahead of her time. Her focus on personal memory chimes with later feminist work that took seriously everyday concerns, and her technique of collaging together memories with pop songs and her own lightly self-mocking commentary, feels contemporary. But in the 1970s in London, her films were absolutely beyond the pale. Artists\u2019 film-making was still a nascent practice, centred among a group whose work was strictly anti-narrative and anti-pictorial.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Focus on memory \u2026 Anne Rees-Mogg in one of her own films. Photograph: London Film-Makers\u2019 Co-operative/BFI\n\nAs the name implies, the London Filmmaker\u2019s Co-op, whose board Anne chaired in the early 80s, was a co-operative. Membership was conferred by the deposit of a film, and equipment was collectively owned. But the political significance of the structure ran deeper than just organisation: politics were conflated with style, form was politics and politics form. So the acceptance of other kinds of work was not simply a challenge to fashion. It was a challenge to belief.\n\n\u201cAnne was aware of a certain orthodoxy at the Co-op and was keen to be an irritant,\u201d says Curtis. \u201cShe was quite partisan in supporting people who were doing other things, particularly film-makers whom she cherished and whom she nurtured at Chelsea.\u201d Anne does seem to have been regarded as an extraordinary tutor and fought to have different types of art-making taken seriously. Film wasn\u2019t yet considered fine art and, for her 20 years there, she taught in the painting department.\n\n\u201cShe was marginalised,\u201d says the film-maker Guy Sherwin, who studied with her. \u201cBut perhaps because she was unique and eccentric, people were drawn to her. She wasn\u2019t cuddly or matronly, but was able to communicate with people on a personal level, and took people under her wing. At Chelsea, where you had people like Howard Hodgkin and Patrick Caulfield, it was quite a severe, patriarchal environment.\u201d\n\nThe video artist Anna Thew, one of her Chelsea proteges, remembers Anne\u2019s reaction when Thew failed to achieve the results Anne had expected. \u201cShe raged,\u201d Thew says. \u201cShe kicked the edit room door with her plastic lam\u00e9-spangled sandals.\u201d It\u2019s a cruel irony that Jacob seems to have a similar fighting spirit, albeit for beliefs that would be at odds with Anne\u2019s, such as his vote against gay marriage, his attempts to limit contraception, and his stance on reducing benefits.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Political gulf \u2026 Jacob Rees-Mogg leaves a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street this week. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\nShe was not right-wing. So it was an early way of realising somebody one loved could have a different political view\n\nJacob acknowledges this political gulf. \u201cIt\u2019s true that she was not very right-wing,\u201d he says. But that didn\u2019t stop him discussing politics with her as a child. \u201cI suppose in a way it was very useful,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an early stage of realising that somebody who one loved could have a different political view and it didn\u2019t make any difference to the personal relationship.\u201d\n\nThough Jacob likes to plays the part of a toff \u2013 and the Temple Cloud home is undeniably grand \u2013 Anne\u2019s work tells different stories about the family, showing them as a typical Somerset lot, attached to the land but moving with the times. Grandfather\u2019s Footsteps begins from a box of negatives she found in a glass cigar box. They were taken by her great-grandfather, a Victorian country clergyman filled with enthusiasm for the possibilities of the modern age.\n\nWhile Anne might have had her differences with her Brexiteer nephew, she would have been cheered to see what has happened with artists\u2019 film-making, now a medium particularly welcoming to a variety of identities and voices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone should ever do what they are told,\u201d she says in Grandfather\u2019s Footsteps. \u201cIf you look back at obedience to fashion in writing, in painting, in film-making, it just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s just always academic to do what other people think is correct.\u201d\n\nYou might say it\u2019s a trait that runs in the family.\n\n\u2022 Anne Rees-Mogg\u2019s films can be seen on BFI Player.", "description": "Long before he reclined for the cameras in Parliament, the Tory MP had a career as an actor \u2013 in experimental films made by his socialist aunt.
