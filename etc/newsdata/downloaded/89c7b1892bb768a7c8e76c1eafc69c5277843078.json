I'm letting you go.' 'Letting me go where?' 'You've done terrific for me, but I'm going to bring in some of the young kids.\"\n\n\"This is when the Class of '92 were around. I was older then, a little bit gobby.\n\n(Image: Shaun Botterill/ALLSPORT)\n\n\"'Who?' 'I'm going to play Gary Neville.' 'Gary Neville? What's he got? Come on, Gaffer. You're gonna play a kid?' 'Yeah'.\"\n\nThe coach, who is now back with the Red Devils as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No.2, also revealed that Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo were his favourite players to be around on the training pitch.\n\nHe added: \u201cScholesy was my favourite player to be around. He could do anything, a mischief maker. But Ronaldo was a machine. He loved the game. As a coach that\u2019s a great thing, because it keeps you going.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\u201cWhen he came, he\u2019d need a ball on his own. There was the team, and him. He wouldn\u2019t share that ball with anybody. So you\u2019d have to come up with ways of integrating him into the group. Now the group did a bit of that, because they\u2019d smash him around.\n\n\"Then, as a coach, you would make up things. In training games you\u2019d condition Ronaldo to two touches. And he hated it, because he couldn\u2019t do his thing. He\u2019d have to control it and pass it. But it integrated him into the team.\n\n\u201cHe used to go mad with me and a few of the other coaches. But he got better. Certainly, the things he learnt at United he took to Real Madrid .\u201d", "description": "Phelan, a versatile right-back during his playing days, arrived at Old Trafford from Norwich in 1989", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images", "Shaun Botterill Allsport", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715042.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-106520865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
