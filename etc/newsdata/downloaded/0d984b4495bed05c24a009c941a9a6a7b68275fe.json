It\u2019s all Jones knows.\n\nOne of his favourite documentaries is Ice Guardians - a Netflix film about players known as \u201cenforcers\u201d in the Canadian National Hockey League who are routinely sent out to fight on behalf of their team-mates and who suffer, inevitably, an enormous physical toll as the years wear on.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the documentary, one of the players is asked what they\u2019d do differently if he had his time again and he replies; \u2018I\u2019d do it all again, I\u2019d just go harder.\u2019 I loved that.\u201d Jones explains.\n\nWith a record-breaking 139 caps to his name, nine British and Irish Lions caps including one as captain, three Grand Slams and enough accolades to make any man blush, the one club Ospreys man has already achieved more than most rugby players could ever dream.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Physically, he remains monstrously competitive.\n\nWhen Wales beat England in Cardiff, it was Jones who took it upon himself to man-mark one of England\u2019s most potent physical threats; Kyle Sinkler. There was only ever going to be one winner.\n\n\u201cAlun Wyn is going to go down as a legend of the game in Wales,\u201d Warren Gatland said.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to recognise the contribution he has made to the game and what a competitor he is. How demanding he is of himself and others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have had a lot of experiences with him and watched him mature, grow up, have kids and go from being a young man to a petulant rugby player to a more relaxed and focused man because of his other responsibilities.\n\n\u201cHe led incredibly well by example and attitude in the Six Nations. He was the player of the Six Nations and is recognised worldwide as one of the best players in his position in the world. He thoroughly deserves that.\n\n\u201cThe bigger the occasion, the bigger the challenge, the more he tends to thrive.\u201d\n\nThe admiration for Jones, who was referred to as \u201cMr Angry\u201d in his early days of international rugby but has been mellowed by time, fatherhood and perspective, is by no means restricted to his team-mates.\n\n\u201cAlun Wyn Jones is what I\u2019d call a proper Test player,\u201d England head coach Eddie Jones said. \u201cEvery time he plays it\u2019s a seven out of 10. If he plays well it\u2019s an eight out of 10. If he plays poorly he\u2019s a six and a half.\n\n\u201cHe gives you everything he\u2019s got. He\u2019s in the middle of everything and is one of those players when you put him on the field the other blokes are going to follow him. He\u2019s an outstanding player.\u201d\n\nGreatness has long since been achieved but increasingly the question is being asked in Wales; Is Alun Wyn Jones our greatest ever? Deliver the World Cup in Japan, and there will be no need to even ask.\n\n\u201cHe is arguably the greatest Welsh rugby player ever,\u201d said former Wales and Lions captain Ryan Jones at the Pro14 launch recently.\n\n\u201cHistory will tell us when he smashes the cap records and if he lifts a World Cup he\u2019s going to be held in the highest esteem of all.\u201d\n\nIn the short-term, Jones will buckle down and prepare himself judiciously and meticulously, as he always has done, for what is surely his fourth and final World Cup.\n\nAfter that, the Lions captaincy will be up for grabs on the tour to South Africa in 2021, before he contemplates his place among the greats of all time.\n\nJones himself is not fussed by the attention. Now the father of two young children and with a sense of perspective he did not possess when he began his professional rugby journey as an 19-year-old back in 2006.\n\nFor him, all that matters now is delivering for his team and his family. The rest is just noise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny when people ask me about status,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is status? It\u2019s all about the environment you\u2019re in. I know my status at home and I\u2019m definitely not top of the tree there.\u201d\n\nAs he negotiates his 35th year, Jones knows his place. In rugby terms at least, it\u2019s at the very top table. Alun Wyn Jones is only looking forward.", "description": "Alun Wyn Jones\u00a0celebrated his 34th birthday four days before Wales defeated\u00a0Georgia 43-14 in their opening Pool D fixture at the City of Toyota Stadium on Monday.", "authors": ["Sam Peters"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/10/Alun-Wyn-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
