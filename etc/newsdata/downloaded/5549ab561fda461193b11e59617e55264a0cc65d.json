Twenty five years ago was 1994. pic.twitter.com/6PbqATHrqk \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 13, 2019\n\nSo air and water were cleaner at some point more the 25 years ago or when \u201cnobody\u201d was here; it wasn\u2019t quite clear what he intended to say at the House Republicans\u2019 annual retreat Thursday.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly quirky is that Trump amended his statement as a way to fact-check himself for the press (listen to his remarks above). But it still wasn\u2019t factual. It\u2019s not true that the air is the cleanest in the \u201centire history\u201d of the country \u2014 or even in the last 25 years. Trump has made that same inaccurate boast several times.\n\nSome air quality trends improved from 2016 to 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s latest report. But others, including concentrations of two kinds of particulate matter and the number of days with unhealthful levels of pollutants for sensitive groups, worsened.\n\nWorldwide, the U.S. ranks 27th for air and water quality, according to the Environmental Performance Index. It ranks 10th for air quality but 88th on exposure to particulate matter, an indication of negative health effects, and 29th for water and sanitation. The nation is tied for first place with nine other countries for drinking water quality. But some U.S. communities are grappling with lead contamination of their drinking water.\n\nTwitter critics had a comment or two.\n\nAh, 1994. The year Columbus sailed here so Washington could conquer all the airports and populate this deserted continent. \u2014 (((Nunes' Butt, Super PhD))) \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@ButtNunes) September 13, 2019\n\nSomeone needs to hand him a glass of water from Flint and make him drink it on air in front of everyone. \u2014 Laura #stablegenius Gilbert (@GilbertKla2) September 13, 2019\n\nAnd how did we get cleaner air and water?
