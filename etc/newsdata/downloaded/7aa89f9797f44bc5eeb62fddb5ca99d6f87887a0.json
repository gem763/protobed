Irma was a Category 5 monster that was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded. Both had widespread devastation even though they were on the opposite ends of the category scale.\n\nTropical Storm Dorian is projected to become a hurricane before it makes landfall in Puerto Rico on Wednesday afternoon. It could become a Category 3 by the time it's expected to hit Florida on Monday.\n\nHal Needham, a hurricane scientist at Louisiana State University, explained on the weather site WXshift in 2017 that a storm's category doesn't fully convey how much damage it could cause.\n\n\"Hurricanes and tropical storms throw three hazards at us: wind, rainfall, and storm surge,\" he wrote. \"Think of the impacts separately. Storms with weaker winds are more likely to stall and dump heavier rainfall. This shocks people, as it would seem intuitive that a Category 5 hurricane would tend to dump more rain than a Category 1 hurricane. But the opposite is true.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at the type of damage that storms like Dorian can cause.", "description": "Hurricane Irma could have been called a \"Category 6\" storm because its wind speeds were so high, even though that's not an official classification.", "authors": ["Rebecca Harrington"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59af2bd26eac401c008b8c25-1334-667.jpg"}
