Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a net profit of EUR620 million.\n\nNet interest income slipped to EUR1.08 billion from EUR1.12 billion.\n\n\"In my new role as CEO, I have led a strategic review of the bank and we have developed a new business plan to ensure stronger financial results meeting new financial targets,\" Chief Executive Frank Vang-Jensen said.\n\n\"Our new plan will significantly improve Nordea's operating performance through strengthened customer focus and improved operational efficiency as well as cost reductions and income growth initiatives,\" he said.\n\nThe bank posted one-offs in the quarter that included an impairment charge for IT intangibles of EUR735 million, a restructuring provision of EUR204 million to cover the costs of redundancies, an additional loan loss provision of EUR282 million and an expense related to the sale of Luminor shares of EUR75 million.\n\nNordea said that for 2020, it expects to reach a cost base of below EUR4.7 billion with planned continued net cost reductions beyond 2020. Its new financial targets for 2022 are a return on equity above 10% and a cost-to-income ratio of 50%.\n\n\"Our new capital policy stipulates a management buffer of 150-200 basis points above the regulatory CET1 requirement and a dividend pay-out ratio of 60%-70%, both starting from 2020,\" the bank said. \"We will continuously assess the opportunity to use share buybacks as a tool to distribute excess capital.\"\n\nFor this year, Nordea said it is targeting a dividend of EUR0.4 a share.\n\nNordea's common equity Tier 1 ratio--a key measure of financial strength--fell to 15.4% at the end of the quarter from 20.3% a year earlier.\n\nWrite to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 01:17 ET (05:17 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
