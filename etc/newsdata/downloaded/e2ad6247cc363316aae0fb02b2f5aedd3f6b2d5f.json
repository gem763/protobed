Ron DeSantis\u2019 (R) suspension of Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\n\nIsrael was sheriff during the botched response to the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting.\n\nBreitbart News reported that Florida\u2019s Senate would consider possible reinstatement of Israel during a special session. That session began Monday.\n\nParents of Parkland victims rallied against Israel\u2019s reinstatement. The South Florida Sun Sentinel quoted Mitch Dworet, father of fallen student Nick Dworet, saying, \u201c[Israel\u2019s] lack of leadership and poor training of his rank and file played a role in the death of Nick and the injury of my other son.\u201d\n\nDworet urged Florida Senators to \u201cnever let [Israel] regain that office.\u201d\n\nLocal 10 News reports the Senate Rules Committee voted 9-7 to uphold Israel\u2019s suspension.\n\nAndrew Pollack, father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, responded to the vote by tweeting:\n\nJustice and accountability came together today with the \u2066@FLSenate\u2069 upholding former Sheriff Israel\u2019s suspension. Disappointing to see not one Democrat voted to put public safety over party. You are a disgrace \u2066\u2066@Book4Senate\u2069! https://t.co/BcqLSADaEk \u2014 Andrew Pollack (@AndrewPollackFL) October 22, 2019\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
