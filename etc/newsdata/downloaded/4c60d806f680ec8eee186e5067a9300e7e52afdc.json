The same day, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the final details of a \u20ac54 billion (about $80 million Cdn) plan to curb Germany's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe announcement comes just days ahead of the United Nations Climate Action Summit.\n\nGermany's Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has warned that the country's coalition government could fall if ministers can't agree on an aggressive climate action plan.\n\n\"The coalition cannot continue when it is not prepared to clarify without hesitation how Germany will achieve its climate goals by 2030,\" Schulze said in an interview with a German newspaper. \"If we, as a nation of industry, cannot demonstrate how to do it, we cannot expect other countries will join.\"\n\nYoung climate activists attend a protest outside Germany's chancellery in Berlin on Sept. 13. (Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters)\n\nTwenty years ago, Germany had a reputation as being a leader in addressing climate change. But after investing billions in renewable energy, Germany will miss its 2020 targets agreed to under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Germany high-speed highway, the autobahn, maintains an almost sacred untouchability, and travelling within the country is often cheaper by plane than train.\n\nEven today, coal is still the second largest source of electricity in the country. Earlier this year, the government came up with a plan to wean the country off coal \u2014 but not until 2038.\n\nTransition is far from complete\n\nFell was a Green member of the German parliament from 1998 to 2013, and he's been referred to as the father of Germany's energy transition.\n\nHe was one of the people responsible for introducing Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act, which became law in April 2000.\n\nIt was a keystone in the country's clean energy transition or revolution \u2014 Energiewende in German \u2014 whose goal was to transition Germany to a low-carbon, nuclear-free economy by mid-century.\n\nHans-Josef Fell, president of the Energy Watch Group, was a Green member of the German parliament from 1998 to 2013. He\u2019s been referred to as the father of Germany\u2019s energy transition. (Kristin Nelson/CBC)\n\n\"From 2000 to 2010 we had the massive investing of the whole population in Germany with renewables,\" says Fell. \"Millions of people \u2014 private people \u2014 with solar rooftops, farmers with biogas, co-operatives ... they created wind farms and hydro power stations and plenty others. So it was a real success story.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s the German state invested massively in renewable energy, which helped to revolutionize the entire industry. Renewable energy only accounted for 3.5 per cent of Germany's power in 1990. By 2018, 35 per cent of the country's power came from solar, wind, biogas and other renewable sources.\n\nYou can see the effects right here in Berlin. ... Now I know kids who have never seen snow. \u2014 Clara Mayer\n\nBut Germany's energy transition is far from complete. Coal is still the second largest source of power in the country.\n\nFell blames Merkel's government for rolling back renewable energy policies and, he says, giving in to pressure from the fossil fuel lobby.\n\n'We're just saying, \"Keep the promises that you've made,\"' says Clara Mayer, 18, a spokesperson for Fridays for the Future Berlin. (Kristin Nelson/CBC)\n\nIn recent years the German government has been pushed to act, in part, by students who have shaken the political landscape.\n\nFridays for Future protests, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, have spread like weeds throughout Germany over the last year. Demonstrations take place every week in dozens of locations, and the young people have seized the attention of the Germany public.\n\nEven Merkel acknowledged the student protesters have pushed her to act faster.\n\n\"We're just saying, 'Keep the promises that you've made' ... and that's basically why we're on the streets,\" said Clara Mayer, spokesperson for Fridays for the Future Berlin. The 18 year-old carried a bullhorn, ready to address the crowd gathered in front of a fountain at a park in central Berlin.\n\nHer message to German politicians was clear.\n\n\"I say they have to act now. They have all realized that we are a strong force and that we can actually affect elections,\" said Mayer.\n\nMayer speaks with people at a Fridays for Future rally in Berlin. Politicians have realized 'that we are a strong force and that we can actually affect elections,' she says. (Traven Benner)\n\nShe has been protesting since February, and she is not alone in her concern.\n\nPolls show climate change is the No. 1 concern for a majority of Germans.\n\nIn July, Germany experienced the hottest day on record. And for the second year in a row dry, hot weather led to crop failures, dying trees in the country's fabled forests and extremely low water in the Rhine River.\n\n\"You can see the effects right here in Berlin,\" said Mayer. She says her dad used to pull her to school in a sleigh in the winter, \"and now I know kids who have never seen snow.\"\n\nProtesters attend a Fridays for Future event in Berlin on Aug. 16. (Kristin Nelson/CBC)\n\nMayer wants radical change, and she believes young people must take the lead since they're \"the people who would have to endure the catastrophes.\"\n\nShe is critical of Germany's leadership and has little patience for adults who ignore the problem and whose lifestyles contribute to climate change.\n\n\"That's where our movement can change things because we have the kids,\" said Mayer. \"The kids can go home and tell their parents: 'Wait, no. We're not flying this summer.' And we have to vote for a party that will fight climate change.\"\n\nWritten by Kristin Nelson with files from The Associated Press.
