PA/Bali Boo/Amazon\n\nReporting in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, researchers from McGill University wondered whether plastic teabags could be releasing micro and nanoplastics into the beverage during brewing.\n\nGiven that scientists do not know yet whether these microscopic particles are harmful to humans, the team also wanted to explore effects of the plastic on small aquatic organisms called \"Daphnia Magna\", or water fleas, which are model organisms often used in environmental studies.\n\nTo conduct their analysis, the researchers purchased four different commercial teas packaged in plastic teabags. The researchers then cut open the bags, removed the tea leaves and washed the empty bags.\n\nNext, they heated the teabags in containers of water to simulate brewing conditions.\n\nUsing electron microscopy, the team found that a single plastic teabag at brewing temperature released about 11.6bn microplastic and 3.1bn nanoplastic particles into the water.\n\nThe researchers state that these levels are thousands of times higher than those reported previously in other foods.\n\nIn another experiment, the researchers treated water fleas with various doses of the micro and nanoplastics from tea bags.\n\nAlthough the animals survived, the team reported that they did show some anatomical and behavioural abnormalities.\n\nThe researchers concluded that while the findings are concerning, further studies are needed to determine if the plastics could have more subtle or chronic effects on humans.\n\nLast year, Clipper \u2013 one of the UKs biggest tea brands \u2013 announced it was launching a plastic-free tea bag made from bananas.\n\nThe company revealed that, as of October 2018, it had moved all production to a new type of tea bag that, instead of the plastic polypropylene seal, uses natural plant-based materials.\n\nThe tea bags are made using a blend of abaca, which is made from a species of banana plant, and a biopolymer made from a non-GM plant material known as PLA.", "description": "Cups of tea could be contaminated with millions of microscopic plastic particles, new research suggests.
