He has been taken into custody and charged with one count of distribution of a controlled substance. Court documents allege that Pettit had agreed to sell Miller 30 mg oxycodone pills, cocaine, and Xanax. But on September 5, 2018, he allegedly gave Miller counterfeit oxycodone that had been laced with fentanyl. Illegal fentanyl is a \u201cpotent and often deadly\u201d synthetic opioid. Over 72,300 Americans died from opioid usage in 2017, according to the CDC. It\u2019s unclear if Miller knew the pills had fentanyl in them. Two days later, Miller died in his home of an accidental overdose \u2014 a combination of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, according to the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office.\n\nAn affidavit supplied with the court documents alleges that Pettit sent a direct message to his friends on Instagram on the day of Miller\u2019s death, reading, \u201cMost likely I will die in jail.\u201d If convicted, Pettit may face a maximum of 20 years in prison. The anniversary of Miller\u2019s death is September 7, just three days away. In the year since, Miller has been posthumously featured on songs including \u201cTime,\u201d by the Free Nationals, and \u201cThat\u2019s Life,\u201d with 88-Keys and Sia, which deals with addiction.", "description": "Cameron James Pettit was arrested for allegedly selling Mac Miller fentanyl-laced drugs two days before the rapper\u2019s death.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/04-mac-miller.w1200.h630.jpg"}
