And I don't know about you, Mr Speaker, but I think the leader of the opposition has now run out of excuses.\"Johnson is expected to make a fourth attempt for an election using a different rule and a new bill on Tuesday.Unlike Monday's failed attempt, a bill only needs a simple majority to pass.KIM Da-mi, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
