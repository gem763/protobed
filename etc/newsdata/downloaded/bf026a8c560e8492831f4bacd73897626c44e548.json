The large quantitative funds are becoming smarter and more powerful while markets are arguably becoming more efficient.\n\nTechniques such as natural language processing are becoming more sophisticated. In the past a computer could count the number of positive and negative words in a relase, but now its extended to how positive or negative those words or even phrases are.\n\nAs the computing power increases the extent to which they can process and trade information relative to a human increases exponentially.\n\nThe long tail\n\nTraders say that as a result the short term opportunities around corporate profit results are becoming harder to exploit and the time in which stocks settle at an appropriate price is quicker.\n\nOne well travelled market expert explained over lunch last week that today most of a bulge bracket brokers' revenues are generated from about 10 per cent of clients - and they tend to be the fast trading quantitative funds exploiting short and medium term inefficiencies in prices.\n\nThe other 90 per cent is a long tail of slower moving fundamental analysts that don't trade nearly as frequently and may actually be more expensive to service than their business generates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at certain times these clients are important. They provide the capital to back initial public offerings and capital raisings that provides the windfall fees that feed the broking machine.\n\nIncreasingly, both in Australia and offshore, hedge funds are playing a more active role in providing funds in capital raisings, making them even more valuable clients of brokers.\n\nThe other related structural change is the role and relevance of sell side research. Over the past decade there has been a hollowing out of the sell-side as the cost and complexity of a large and extensive research function outweighs the benefits.\n\nAs Goldman Sachs analysts (ironically) in a paper last year, the number of sell side stock estimates on Australian small caps has fallen by 30 per cent from its peak with half the index covered by less than five analysts. The estimates are also becoming increasingly 'stale' which they said was leading to greater share price volatility, and greater 'information assymetry'.\n\nWhat's consensus?\n\nThe sum of this is that 'consensus earnings' aren't as valuable as they used to be.\n\nThis should provide an opportunity for fundamental investors but quantitative funds are taking this into account and adjusting their trading strategies accordingly to exploit inefficiencies.\n\nWhat do these changes mean for equity markets? Those on the frontline are convinced that machines are becoming ever more powerful and more dominant in setting prices/\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as the fund managers that refused to invest in the latest crop of initial public offerings have demonstrated, they can still play an active role in capital allocation.\n\nDan Loeb of US hedge fund Third Point told investors recently that activism was one of the few sources of alpha (outpeformance) that could be generated by large funds as the rise of passive funds means more stock ownership is \"concentrated among owners who are agnostic to company fundamentals and valuation.\"\n\nMeanwhile he says \"typical fundamental analyst has behaviour and biases that quant algorithms attempt to replicate and exploit\"\n\nAs a particularly aggressive activist investor Loeb is talking his book. But his message is valuable. The key to long term survival for active investors is to do what the passive and quants cannot.\n\nThat means using their discretion and when the moment calls for it their active influence.", "description": "There are massive structural changes in equity markets but fundamental investors are showing they're still relevant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_29/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/81b033c16b574cd61b04c6107855611a4f02eff4", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
