News.\n\nThe outlet reported on Tuesday that after just a month together, the pair have decided to part ways but at least one of them has hopes for a reconciliation.\n\nIt's over: Demi Lovato's recent romance with Bachelorette's Mike Johnson has officially flamed out according to sources who spoke with E! News\n\n'Demi and Mike's fling has fizzled out and they aren't seeing each other or texting like they were before,' the insider said.\n\nThe added that the end wasn't anything dramatic and just the natural flow of a fling.\n\n'Nothing happened, it just ran its course,' they said.\n\nThe source went on to say that Demi was 'definitely' into the former reality show contestant - a fact that he himself intimated previously when he called her the 'aggressor' in the pair.\n\n'Demi and Mike's fling has fizzled out and they aren't seeing each other or texting like they were before,' the insider said. 'Nothing happened, it just ran its course.' (Mike pictured with Hannah Brown on The Bachelorette)\n\n'Demi was definitely interested in Mike at one point,' E! reported, 'but it was short-lived and she wasn't ever planning on dating him seriously.'\n\nWhile the 27-year-old popstar has been mum on the relationship, Johnson talked quite a bit about it on a podcast.\n\nDuring an appearance on iHeartRadio\u2019s Almost Famous podcast he said: 'We\u2019ve gone on more than one date.\n\nThe former Bachelorette star told the podcast that Lovato was a great kisser and he was turned on by her confidence.\n\n'Demi was definitely interested in Mike at one point,' E! reported, 'but it was short-lived and she wasn't ever planning on dating him seriously.'\n\nJohnson added: 'For one, I\u2019m all about her too and she definitely was the aggressor. I find it incredibly sexy. I love that.\n\n'Like you want me, come at me. If I want you, I\u2019m going to come at you and I\u2019m coming at her as well.'\n\nE! reported that Mike is 'optimistic' about his changes of rekindling things with the hitmaker.\n\n'Mike hopes they can have a second chance again,' the source shared. 'But for now, he's fine with being friendly.'\n\nAwkward: After recently admitting on Strahan, Sara & Keke that he regretted saying Demi was a 'good kisser' and the 'aggressor' during podcast, Johnson awkwardly asked out one of the co-hosts\n\nDuring an appearance on Strahan, Sara & Keke, Johnson admitted that he regretted being so open about dating Demi.\n\n'I made a mistake,' He told the trio. 'I don't like dating in public.'\n\nClearly not one to learn a lesson, he then transitioned to awkwardly asking out host Keke Palmer.\n\nHe said: 'But if I were to ask you if we could go on a date in public...'\n\n'I made a mistake,' He told the trio. 'I don't like dating in public. But if I were to ask you if we could go on a date in public...'\n\nBefore Mike could finish his sentence, the audience drowned him out with applause as the Hustlers star was visibly uncomfortable.\n\nPalmer, 26, tried to avoid the question, turning to her co-hosts who were pretending not to listen: 'What's the next question? Michael, you got the next question.'\n\nStrahan then played the protective father role: 'Mike, I'm gonna tell you something. Demi's my girl, I love this one here too. Now, you mess up, I'm coming for you. You don't want that.'\n\nThe group laughed off the exchange as Palmer tried to change the topic: 'Ladies, I'm at work.'", "description": "Demi Lovato's recent romance with Bachelorette's Mike Johnson has officially flamed out according to sources who spoke with E!
