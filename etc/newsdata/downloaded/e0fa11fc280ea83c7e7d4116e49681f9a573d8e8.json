Yesterday Boris Johnson's deal passed because 19 Labour MPs walked through the lobby to vote for a Brexit deal that would be bad for our NHS, bad for our economy and bad for our environment.\n\n\"It seems that Jeremy Corbyn has thrown Boris Johnson another lifeline this morning, as six white men met to discuss pushing through a Brexit deal which will wreck our country.\n\n\u201cJeremy Corbyn is a Brexiteer, and Remainers won't forget if a shady backroom deal between Johnson and Corbyn helps to deliver Brexit.\"", "description": "It comes after both Labour and the Tories said they would back an election if the EU granted a three month Brexit extension", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20686506.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Jeremy-Corbyn-Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
