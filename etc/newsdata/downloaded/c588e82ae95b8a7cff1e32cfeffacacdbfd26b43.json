Jason Chaffetz\u2019s assertion that the Trump administration should be applauded for its transparency was apparently so ridiculous that several Fox News hosts took him to task over it on Tuesday.\n\nNoting at the top of Fox News daytime chatfest Outnumbered that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was reportedly listening in on the infamous July 25 call between President Trump and the Ukrainian leader, co-host Melissa Francis pointed out that it was just last week when the secretary denied having any first-hand knowledge of the conversation.\n\nTurning to Chaffetz, who was serving as the show\u2019s \u201cOne Lucky Guy,\u201d Francis then asked the ex-Utah lawmaker about an op-ed he wrote for Fox News that insisted Trump\u2019s transparency is driving Democrats nuts and screwing up their impeachment dreams.\n\n\u201cBut I am wondering\u2014we are just learning that Michael Pompeo was on the call. Does that fit into the thesis that you have there?\u201d Francis pressed Chaffetz.\n\nThe one-time House oversight chair went on to claim that Trump was \u201cMr. Transparency\u201d when it came to providing Democrats with documents and records, pointing to the release of the call transcript as well as items he provided during the Mueller report. (It should be noted, however, that Trump refused to be interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and has yet to release any of his tax returns, among other records.)\n\n\u201cWhy are we hearing about Mike Pompeo being on the call, though?\u201d Francis pushed back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s relevant.,\u201d Chaffetz replied.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant that the Secretary of State was on that call,\u201d a surprised Harris Faulkner interjected.\n\nChaffetz, meanwhile, pivoted to impeachment, wondering aloud whether anyone could justify impeaching the president over Pompeo\u2014who is fighting congressional subpoenas related to Ukraine\u2014from being on the call or not. Francis, meanwhile, shot back that this \u201cwas about lying\u201d and transparency.\n\n\u201cActually, it seriously is about judgment,\u201d Faulkner added. \u201cIf you are there in that moment, and you have the opportunity to try to turn some judgment wheel, you can do that as Secretary of State. Not everybody on the call can do that.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cCertain times in the call that legal experts actually have argued for and against impeachment in this country would have changed some things. Mike Pompeo, former CIA, seems like the type of person who might have done that for the president. That\u2019s why he\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nChaffetz again argued that Trump didn\u2019t need to release the call transcript before contending that the call itself showed no quid pro quo or the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. Furthermore, he asserted that Pompeo not being upfront about his involvement in the call was a \u201csuperfluous issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about transparency, it is a big detail to leave off,\u201d Francis concluded. \u201cThat your Secretary of State was on the call. That it is about, you know, putting everything out there. You\u2019re saying he\u2019s putting everything out there, that would be a detail to put out there.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant that the secretary of state was on that call,\u201d a surprised Harris Faulkner interjected.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569949527/outnumbered_29_mvjpxm", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
