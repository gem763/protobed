The rallying cry shouted by many on the streets was, \u201cThere is no National Day celebration, only a national tragedy.\u201d\n\nOpposition politician Lee Cheuk-yan said the Day of Mourning protests were a condemnation of \u201c70 years of suppression\u201d by the Chinese Communist Party and a solemn remembrance of \u201cthose who sacrificed for democracy in China,\u201d including the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, an event Beijing has sought to erase from the history books.\n\n\u201cWe also condemn the fact that the Hong Kong government, together with the Chinese government, deny the people of Hong Kong the right to democracy,\u201d Lee said, as quoted by the Hong Kong Free Press.\n\nThe HKFP quoted a demonstrator who said Chinese Communist Party ruler Xi Jinping \u201cwants the world to think everyone in China loves him,\u201d but \u201ca lot of people here feel the opposite.\u201d\n\nThis particular protester was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, portrayed as a sign of resistance against tyranny in the 1980s comic book V for Vendetta and the more recent movie based on it. Others brandished every symbol of resistance or freedom they could find, from dressing like Captain America to lugging around giant Winnie-the-Pooh dolls covered with protest slogans. Winnie-the-Pooh is banned and aggressively censored in China because Xi Jinping has been mockingly compared to Pooh and his honey-infused rotund physique.\n\nXi gave a morning speech in Beijing in which he pledged to respect the limited autonomy granted to Hong Kong and Macau under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and promised to keep Hong Kong prosperous and stable.\n\nXi then rolled out a gigantic military parade bristling with advanced Communist weapons that started in Tiananmen Square. Among the dignitaries gathered at the site of the 1989 massacre to salute the marching troops was Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, whose absence from her own city was duly noted and mocked by the protesters.\n\nThe police moved aggressively against rallies that were deemed illegal, and the protesters responded with everything from songs and chants to bricks and firebombs. They scrawled graffiti on buildings, trampled on photos of Xi, and tore down National Day banners. Protest leaders denounced Hong Kong\u2019s MTR railway system, a frequent target of criticism, for trying to impose a de facto curfew on the city by shuttering many of its stations.\n\nProtesters scuffled with some pro-China counter-demonstrators, including some who described themselves as \u201cflag protection squads\u201d determined to prevent acts of vandalism against the People\u2019s Republic of China flag. The main flag-raising ceremony in Hong Kong was essentially sealed off from the public and broadcast by television to avoid the possibility of protest disruptions.\n\nThe police shooting occurred in the Tsuen Wan district and was filmed by University of Hong Kong students. Live rounds were reportedly fired in the air as warning shots in several other locations, but the 17-year-old at Tsuen Wan became the first person to be shot by police with lethal ammunition during the current protest movement:\n\nVideo shows a protester in Hong Kong being shot at close range.

He was filmed saying \u201cMy chest really hurts\u201d before he lost consciousness. He was said to be in critical condition at the time of this writing.\n\n\u201cA large group of rioters was attacking police officers in Tsuen Wan. Police officers warned them, but they were still attacking police. A police officer\u2019s life was seriously endangered. In order to save his and other officers\u2019 lives, they fired at the attacker,\u201d a statement from the police department claimed. Footage of the shooting showed the young man swinging a baton at riot police.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the shooting was a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d use of force that \u201crisks inflaming the situation.\u201d He called for a \u201cconstructive dialogue to address the legitimate concerns\u201d of Hong Kong citizens.", "description": "A teenage protester becomes the first person shot by police with live ammo during the Hong Kong protests on China's National Day.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/protester-shot-in-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
