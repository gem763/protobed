That is expected to be confirmed by Thursday's third-quarter GDP data.\n\nThe protests, which started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades and also pose the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.", "description": "Hong Kong braces for Halloween havoc as protesters target party district", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T0IO-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
