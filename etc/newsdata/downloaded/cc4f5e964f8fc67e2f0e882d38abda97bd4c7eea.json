Ideally, sunnies will offer 100 per cent protection against UV rays \u2013 meaning absolutely no UV light will pass through the lenses.\n\nSome glasses will offer slightly less protection than 100 per cent \u2013 and these are acceptable, while others are purely ornamental props which are not to be trusted to be of any use.\n\nIt is worth saying that in many cases, even very cheap sunglasses offer decent protection \u2013 which is hugely relieving and an assurance that even if you are on a budget you won\u2019t have to compromise on health.\n\nVery small children often take against sunglasses, whipping them off and discarding them just as soon as they are put on, so it is always worth either opting for a pair which have an integral strap, or that come with a cord so that at least if they come off they won\u2019t be completely lost!\n\nIn each case, we looked at the strength and flexibility of the frame \u2013 before any children had got their mitts on them. Did they feel malleable? Was the part which bridges the nose soft? What about the arms? Were they curved or straight? The glasses were used on a handful of children aged between 14 months and nine years old.\n\nWe asked each child if they felt comfortable or not, and when we removed the glasses checked for marks on the bridge of their noses or behind their ears which might indicate an unwelcome tightness.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The frame is also BPA-free and hypoallergenic. We noticed that the arms are straight, without the usual \u201cbehind the ear\u201d hook that most shades have, and discovered that this is to follow a little one\u2019s growth. The lenses are polarised and \u201ccategory three\u201d, meaning they filter 100 per cent of the ultraviolet rays.\n\nThe \u201clemonade\u201d was our hue of choice but if yellow doesn\u2019t make you mellow there is a massive swatch of other colours like \u201corange firework\u201d and \u201cmarine blue\u201d to choose from. Our little tester of just three was obsessed by the packaging, a smart tray box inside which was a soft felt pouch to keep her shades safe. Really smart, clever sunnies.\n\nBuy now\n\nBabiators original keyhole sunglasses: \u00a322.50, Babiatiors\n\nOur three-year-old tester loved her turquoise pair (not least because they came with a durable case complete with a metal clip which can hook onto bag or buggy). They stayed comfortably in place without pinching or nipping the skin on her nose or near her ears.\n\nThey are also extremely lightweight, so unlike some cheaper brands, little ones won\u2019t find them falling down their noses every two seconds. The frames are rubber. making them both flexible and durable \u2013 and almost immune to any breakages. It\u2019s a huge relief to let a toddler play with sunglasses safe in the knowledge that they really won\u2019t break!\n\nBabiators have UV400 lenses that offer 100 per cent UVA and UVB protection against the sun\u2019s rays as well as a one-year warranty against both breakage and loss.\n\nBuy now\n\nNext heart sunglasses: \u00a35, Next\n\nThese shades are so much fun, with a quirky retro vibe for children aged 18 months to six years. They offer filter category-three protection against the sun\u2019s rays, which is pretty high. Our two-year-old tester adored these, and at this price you won\u2019t find yourself freaking out if (read: when) one of the arms gets snapped off by an overzealous toddler.\n\nBuy now\n\nSunnylife pineapple sunglasses: \u00a37, Sunnylife\n\nAlthough these sunnies, with the rainbow sheen lenses, look like too much fun to offer anything serious like sun protection, actually, they absolutely do: rated UV 380, which is just short of 100 per cent. For children aged four and older, these will be a huge hit at the beach, barbecues or anywhere where merriment is the order of the day.\n\nBuy now\n\nJojo Maman Bebe baby and children\u2019s sunglasses: \u00a37, Jojo Maman Bebe\n\nWe plumped for the red, but there are four other colours to choose from including a hot pink and understated black. The plastic lenses are UV 400, so offer complete protection against the sun. We particularly liked how the lenses curved slightly round, offering decent cover to the outer corners of the eyes of our three-year-old tester. We found that these were snug and secure around the head of our tester, but had they not been, it\u2019s good to know Jojo offers a sunglasses strap, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nAdventure banz green camo sunglasses: \u00a310, Banz\n\nSuitable for babies and children up to the age of five, these look like a rather brilliant cross between swimming goggles and wraparound sports sunnies. As the name suggests these glasses lend themselves to action and movement and are perfect for little ones with ants in their pants who like running, biking, paddling and rough and tumble. The strap around the back of the head remains in place \u2013 we barely had to readjust it to our 14-month-old tester.\n\nThey are 100 per cent UVA/UVB protective. We were really impressed by the embedded silicone nose and brow piece which ensure they aren\u2019t abrasive against the face and actually feel soft and comfortable on young skin. We loved the camo green version, although there\u2019s a wealth of styles to choose from.\n\nBuy now\n\nSuneez vedra sunglasses: \u00a325, Suneez\n\nThese are said to be \u201cvirtually unbreakable\u201d thanks to being created out of a flexible material which bends easily but won\u2019t snap. And, we have to say, we gave them a run for their money \u2013 all sorts of pushing and pulling and misuse resulted in, well, no damage. This is of course extremely reassuring given how much potential there is for children to damage their own property all the livelong day.\n\nThey also block 100 per cent of all harmful rays. We were pretty impressed with the microfibre pouch which not only protects the glasses but doubles up as a handy cleaning cloth. Be gone sticky paw prints! We loved the dual colourways \u2013 very cool and not easy to misplace (plus each pair of glasses comes with a strap).\n\nBuy now\n\nRayBan new wayfarer junior sunglasses: \u00a360, RayBan\n\nSuitable for older children, aged between eight and 12 years old (\u2019tis a brave, stupid or eye-poppingly rich parent who would merrily give a small child a pair of terribly expensive shades), this junior version of Rayban\u2019s most well-known style is just as cool. Square lenses, snug fit and complete protection from UV rays, these are really beautiful shades for very cool kids. There are no fewer than 18 colourways to choose from, but we think black is the most stylish.\n\nBuy now\n\nKi Et La Jokakids kids sunglasses: \u00a321, Kidly\n\nThese grow with your child, such is the flexibility of these ergonomic aviators which don\u2019t put pressure on the bridge or squash the temples. Plus, they are virtually unbreakable. They boast 100 per cent UVA and UVB sun protection. The anti-blue light filter also reduces glare. Perfect for children aged four to six. The glasses also come with a cord which will greatly reduce the possibility of misplacement.\n\nBuy now\n\nSainsburys Tu cat eye sunglasses: \u00a34, Sainsburys\n\nAny fashionista would be happy with this eyewear: cat-eye shape with a gloss tortoiseshell finish. These are fabulously ostentatious but not only do they look super chic, they offer 100 per cent UV protection. And all this for just \u00a34. You really can\u2019t say fairer than that.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Kids sunglasses\n\nIzipizi\u2019s sunglasses come top for us \u2013 not least because a stranger approached us and asked whether we knew if they came in adult sizes. These are smart, quality, clever and comfortable \u2013 well worth the cash. But a close second would have to be the Tu cat eye shades \u2013 tres chic.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
