Biden and his son in exchange for promised U.S. military aid, according to a government transcript released Wednesday, an account that the president said wrecks Democrats\u2019 push for impeachment even as he girded for a long fight.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a nothing call,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the United Nations. \u201cThere was no pressure.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump did ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation of the Bidens during the July 25 phone call. That disclosure prompted House Democrats to harden their position on moving forward with impeachment. They said it is proof that Mr. Trump sought help from a foreign leader to interfere with a U.S. election.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s release of the transcript unleashed another furious round of partisan accusations a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, announced that her troops were opening a formal impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said the details of the phone call were \u201cfar more damning\u201d than he had imagined.\n\n\u201cWhat those notes reflect is a classic mafialike shakedown of a foreign leader,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Justice Department clears Trump of wrongdoing on Ukraine call\n\nMrs. Pelosi said after the release of the transcript that the president\u2019s conduct \u201cwill not stand.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference wrapping up three days of meetings at the United Nations, Mr. Trump expressed enormous frustration about another impeachment threat after the long-running drama of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI thought we won,\u201d the president said wistfully. \u201cI thought it was dead.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of former aides who had to pay legal fees in the Mueller investigation and said, \u201cWhat these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.\u201d\n\nHe accused House Democrats of mounting the impeachment effort this week to obscure his administration\u2019s \u201ctremendous achievements\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThat was all planned, like everything else,\u201d Mr. Trump said with bitterness in his voice.\n\nThe president said Mrs. Pelosi surrendered her authority in the name of extreme partisanship.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been taken over by the radical left,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPeople are really angry at the Democrats. Nancy Pelosi, unfortunately, as far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that the impeachment drive will backfire and propel Republicans to take back the House next year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a very bad position,\u201d he said of House Democrats. \u201cI really think the Republicans will take over the House. Nancy Pelosi was forced [by liberal Democrats] into a position that she didn\u2019t want to be in, and she wasn\u2019t tough enough to stop it. A lot of her members now are having second thoughts.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign said it raised $5 million in the first 24 hours after Mrs. Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry. Several polls this week show public support for impeachment eroding, with at most one-third of voters in favor.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s criminal division said it already had investigated Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president about Mr. Biden and concluded that Mr. Trump did not violate campaign finance laws.\n\nA separate division of the department also ruled that the administration did not break the law by failing to quickly share a whistleblower\u2019s complaint with Congress over the Ukraine matter, saying it didn\u2019t meet the definition of \u201curgent\u201d to trigger immediate action.\n\nMr. Trump said he authorized congressional Republicans to provide \u201cfull transparency\u201d on the whistleblower\u2019s report, which the House and Senate intelligence committees received Wednesday after weeks of stonewalling by the administration.\n\nIn a rare bipartisan move, the House passed a nonbinding resolution by a 421-0 vote to rebuke Mr. Trump for delaying the release of the whistleblower complaint and reprimanding the White House for its \u201chighly inappropriate efforts\u201d to discredit the complaint.\n\nBut in a predictable split on the complaint, Democrats who saw it late Wednesday said it corroborated their concerns while Republicans downplayed it.\n\nMr. Zelensky, who met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday at the United Nations, told reporters he didn\u2019t feel pressured during their phone call this summer.\n\n\u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said in halting English as he sat next to Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved [in] democratic open elections of USA. We had good phone call. It was normal.\u201d\n\nThe president had his 30-minute phone call with the Ukrainian leader ostensibly to congratulate Mr. Zelensky on his party\u2019s victories in parliamentary elections.\n\nBut Mr. Trump also broached the question of whether Mr. Biden pressured Ukraine in 2016 as vice president to stop the investigation of a Ukrainian gas company that had paid Hunter Biden $3 million.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William Barr] would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump said on the call. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nHe also asked Mr. Zelensky to work with his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, as he dug into the origins of the Russia collusion investigation that dominated nearly three years of his presidency and found no conspiracy with Moscow.\n\nMr. Zelensky responded on the call that the country\u2019s new prosecutor would be loyal to him.\n\n\u201cHe or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,\u201d he pledged to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Biden said in a statement that the transcript shows Mr. Trump \u201cimplored the president of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has put his own political interests over our national security interest, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian pressure,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cCongress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable.\u201d\n\nThe president also defended Mr. Giuliani for poking around Ukraine in search of information related to the 2016 campaign, the missing emails of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and how the Russian meddling investigation enveloped the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cRudy\u2019s looking to also find out where the phony witch hunt started, where it started,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the former New York mayor. \u201cWhere did it start? How come it started?\u201d\n\nHe said his team is still trying to learn what happened to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 33,000 deleted emails from her term as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of evidence like that,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s corrupt government.\u201d\n\nTurning to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe have corruption also, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter whether he still wants the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cNo, I want him to do whatever he can. This was not his fault; he wasn\u2019t there [in 2016]. But whatever he can do in terms of corruption, because the corruption is massive.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden\u2019s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and he knows nothing, and they\u2019re paying him millions of dollars, that\u2019s corruption,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nAsked how he would have felt if President Obama tried to dig up dirt on him from foreign leaders in 2016, Mr. Trump responded, \u201cThat\u2019s what he did, really \u2026 how that whole witch hunt started.\u201d\n\nThe two presidents bantered in front of reporters, joking about the timing of their meeting in the midst of the political firestorm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to be on TV than by phone,\u201d Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian, told Mr. Trump to laughter.\n\nDuring their call this summer, the two leaders also talked about the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and the controversy over the Democratic National Committee servers that were hacked in 2016. But no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d is evident in the written account of the phone conversation, which was compiled by national security aides who listened to the call and took notes.\n\nAlthough there is no overt link to U.S. military aid, Mr. Trump does ask Mr. Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d immediately after reminding the Ukrainian leader that the U.S. has spent \u201ca lot of effort and a lot of time\u201d on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said on the call. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people. \u2026 The [DNC] server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation. \u2026 I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nThe DNC hired CrowdStrike initially to examine its servers in the Russian hacking affair. The DNC never turned over the servers to the FBI.\n\nThe president also mentions the recently completed investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller over unfounded allegations of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani believe the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d investigation had its origins in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThey say a lot of it started with Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky. \u201cWhatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said the U.S. is helping Ukraine \u201cmuch more than the European countries are doing, and they should be helping you more than they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cGermany does almost nothing for you,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good, but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr. Zelensky replied, \u201cYou are absolutely right. I\u2019m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially, when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday based on their suspicions that Mr. Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader into investigating the Bidens by withholding $391 million in military aid last summer. Mrs. Pelosi said Mr. Trump had committed a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Constitution.\n\nCongressional Republicans said the transcript of the Zelensky call proves the president did nothing wrong.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said \u201cI don\u2019t mind\u201d that Mr. Trump raised concerns about the Bidens in the call.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very appropriate for the president of the United States to suggest that you\u2019ve got a corruption problem,\u201d Mr. Graham told reporters. \u201cDid the president of the United States suggest to the Ukraine, \u2018I will withhold money unless you go after my political rival\u2019? The answer is absolutely not. That\u2019s why I wanted the phone call to be released.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham said Mr. Biden\u2019s son \u201cwas receiving money from the Ukraine, was on the board of a company that was the subject of an investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t see that conflict, you\u2019re blind,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican and the party\u2019s 2012 nominee for president, said the transcript was \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower reported the conversation to authorities Aug. 12, citing information from \u201cWhite House officials\u201d and saying it appeared Mr. Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine to assist in his 2020 election.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general concluded that the whistleblower showed political bias but said the report was credible and urgent enough that the director of national intelligence needed to share it with Congress.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s office of legal counsel said that was not the case.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether such a complaint falls within the statutory definition of \u2018urgent concern\u2019 that the law requires the DNI to forward to the intelligence committees. We conclude that it does not,\u201d wrote Steven A. Engel, assistant attorney general at the office of legal counsel.\n\nThey also ruled that the president\u2019s conversation was a diplomatic communication and not an intelligence activity and the president isn\u2019t a part of the intelligence community anyway, so his behavior is not part of the DNI\u2019s purview.\n\n\u201cSuch matters simply do not relate to \u2018the funding, administration or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority\u2019 of the DNI,\u201d Mr. Engel concluded.\n\nMr. Trump said he \u201chated\u201d to release the transcript of the phone call but felt there was no other way to address the accusations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the concept of releasing calls. It\u2019s hard to do business that way,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cBut you folks [in the media] were saying such lies.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI used to be the king of getting good press. [But] if you see the way they treat my family \u2026 It\u2019s so bad for our country.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell Jr. and Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
