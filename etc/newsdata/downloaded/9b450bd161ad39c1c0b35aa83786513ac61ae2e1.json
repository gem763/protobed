They staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d in Wellington, New Zealand. They obstructed a major roundabout in Berlin, parked a pink sailboat outside the prime minister\u2019s office in Dublin and splattered fake blood on Wall Street\u2019s \u201cCharging Bull\u201d sculpture.\n\nThe group\u2019s message is that climate change is an emergency that requires drastic and immediate action.\n\nAnd it has already seen some success.\n\n\u201cExtinction Rebellion is widely credited with accelerating policy change in the U.K.,\u201d said Robert Falkner, a fellow at Chatham House, a think tank.\n\nBut the group\u2019s tactics test public tolerance for social and economic disruption. And some say Extinction Rebellion\u2019s specific demands are wildly unrealistic.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that people were free to protest but that \u201cblocking people from being able to go and do their day-to-day job doesn\u2019t necessarily take us any closer to the climate action they are calling for.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemonstrators march in an Extinction Rebellion protest in Melbourne, Australia, on Monday.

The last time Extinction Rebellion staged a protest on this scale, in April, more than 1,000 people were arrested, in a police operation that cost nearly $20 million.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan conceded that \u201cbolder action\u201d is needed to take on climate change, but he criticized the movement for potentially overwhelming an already stretched police force.\n\nAnticipating police frustration, protester Paul Stephens, a 55-year-old retired detective sergeant, stood outside Metropolitan Police headquarters Monday morning handing out fliers to officers.\n\n\u201cFrom their perspective, it\u2019s a waste of time; from our perspective, it\u2019s not,\u201d he said, explaining that the strategy was to \u201ccreate a dilemma for the police\u201d so they either had to allow the demonstrations to continue or arrest 1,000 \u201cotherwise law-abiding people\u201d for committing low-level offenses.\n\nThe protesters are walking a tightrope \u2014 they want to spark enough disruption to effect change but not so much that they alienate the public.\n\nExtinction Rebellion has grown in parallel to the climate strike protests inspired by teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. It has attracted not just schoolchildren but also young professionals, parents, grannies and others concerned about climate change and habitat loss. And, pretty much from the beginning, Extinction Rebellion\u2019s strategy has been very different from that of the students skipping school on Fridays to protest peacefully.\n\nHundreds of protestors have stormed ANZ Lambton Quay and are having a die in outside.

Their first large demonstration took place last November, when activists blocked five bridges in London and police made 85 arrests.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s founders include Gail Bradbrook, a former biophysicist, and Roger Hallam, who is in prison for his role in \u201cHeathrow Pause,\u201d a splinter group that planned to shut down Heathrow Airport with low-flying drones.\n\nBut organizers say Extinction Rebellion is not reliant on leaders. On the streets in London, protesters can join small \u201caffinity groups,\u201d which support each other and communicate largely via encrypted mobile apps Signal and Telegram. Some crowdfund legal fees for those who want to be an \u00ad\u201carrestable.\u201d\n\nTo get attention for their cause, protesters have glued themselves to roads, stripped in Parliament and staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d at London\u2019s Natural History Museum.\n\n[Climate activists trying to spray a government building lost control of the hose]\n\nWithin Britain, Extinction Rebellion has three demands of government: to \u201ctell the truth\u201d by declaring a climate emergency; to pledge to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2025 and halt the loss of biodiversity; and to enlist a citizen assembly \u2014 a group of representatives from the wider public \u2014 to guide the way forward.\n\n\n\nProtesters spray a stencil slogan on the wall of the building housing the Treasury during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London. (Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nAlong with the student climate strikers and British naturalist David Attenborough, they have helped to change the content and tone of the conversation about climate change.\n\nA day after Extinction Rebellion representatives met with government officials, the British Parliament declared a climate emergency. A few weeks later, the government pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, the first major economy in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question of whether we should act. It\u2019s what\u2019s reasonable action to take and how fast can we go,\u201d said Bob Ward, a spokesman for the London School of Economics\u2019 Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.\n\nBritain\u2019s 2050 target is much further out than what Extinction Rebellion wants. But Ward said the government\u2019s goal is already ambitious and will require massive changes to the transport sector and how people heat their homes. Extinction Rebellion, he said, is not \u201coffering an alternative analysis that shows 2025 is doable.\u201d\n\nOrganizers are aware that their demands are unlikely to be met as the result of the next two weeks of protests. They are unsure of what comes next. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to become like Glastonbury, something fun to do every April and October,\u201d said one organizer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nClare Farrell, one of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s co-founders, said there has been tension inside the group over tactics. The Washington Post spoke with her at the group\u2019s office in east London, where the walls are plastered with posters that read \u201cRebel for Life\u201d and others bearing the group\u2019s symbol, a circle to represent the planet and an hourglass to show that time is running out.\n\nFarrell recalled an April demonstration in which activists glued themselves to a train in London\u2019s financial district.\n\nIt was not an easy sell inside the group. \u201cSome still thought it was radical, some are just getting to terms with the fact they can sit on a road. . . . We need to make sure we don\u2019t push too hard, too fast, in one place.\u201d\n\n\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists block streets around Chatelet square in Paris on Monday. (Yoan Valat/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThis month\u2019s protests are the group\u2019s boldest \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 yet.\n\nAndrew Medhurst, head of finance, said the group earmarked about $1.2 million for October in London to pay for entertainment, portable toilets and meals for about 20,000 people a day. The group also pays about 190 of its activists, who can claim up to $500 a week.\n\nOver the past year, Extinction Rebellion has raised $2.8 million through a mix of crowdfunding and big donations from sources including the British rock band Radiohead and the U.S.-based Climate Emergency Fund, whose founders include philanthropist Aileen Getty and filmmaker Rory Kennedy.\n\nMedhurst worked for three decades in London\u2019s financial district before quitting his job.\n\n\u201cI suddenly got a big kick up my backside,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized that unless there were drastic changes, my kids won\u2019t need a stock portfolio, they will need food and shelter.\u201d\n\nMany activists in the streets of London on Monday echoed that idea.\n\nThey included Vishal Chauhan, 30, who gave up his job as an emergency room doctor, where he earned around $80,000 a year, to devote himself to Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cI love being a doctor,\u201d Chauhan said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t make sense being in hospital treating people for diabetes or pneumonia knowing that they or their children might experience TB, cholera, famine, food shortages.\u201d\n\nHe said part of him hopes a warming world is not as catastrophic as scientists predict.\n\n\u201cI hope one day I will regret leaving\u201d medicine, he said. \u201cI hope I will look back and say, \u2018you\u2019re an idiot, why did you believe what 99 percent of scientists believe?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nPeople clean up fake blood around the Fearless Girl statue after Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in New York on Monday.
