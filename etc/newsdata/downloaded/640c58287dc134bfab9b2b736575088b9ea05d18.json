And with each charge against him, Trump has perfected the art of deflection, seemingly gaining strength by bullying and belittling those who have dared to take him on.\n\nNow Trump is facing a high-velocity threat like none he's confronted before.\n\nIt has rapidly evolved from a process fight over a whistleblower complaint to an impeachment inquiry within two weeks. Much of the evidence is already in public view. A rough transcript of a phone call in which Trump asks Ukraine's president to help investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden. The whistleblower's detailed letter alleging the White House tried to cover up the call, and possibly others.\n\nUnlike special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year investigation, which circled an array of people in Trump's orbit but not always the president himself, Trump doesn't have the benefit of distance. His words and his actions are at the center of this investigation.\n\n\"The Mueller report , it was always Manafort this and his son that. There was a cascade of players,\" said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, referring to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. \"This was just Donald Trump and a disturbing conversation with another world leader.\"\n\nSo, suddenly, Washington is different and the history of Trump's presidency has changed. By year's end, he could become only the third American president impeached by the House of Representatives.\n\nThat new reality caught Trump and his advisers off guard, according to people close to the president. If anything, they thought the specter of impeachment had been lifted after the Mueller investigation ended without a clear determination that Trump had committed a crime.\n\nThe contours of that investigation played to Trump's strengths. Mueller spent two years in silence, allowing the president to fill the vacuum with assertions that the investigation was a \"hoax\" and a \"witch hunt.\" The details of the investigation that did leak out were often complicated and focused on people in Trump's sphere. Even Mueller's pointed statement that he had not exonerated Trump did not seem to stick. There was ultimately plenty of smoke, but no smoking gun.\n\nNumerous other Democratic inquiries appeared likely to meet a similar fate, including House investigation into Trump's business dealings, his tax returns and a variety of administration scandals. For many Americans, they were one big blur of investigations without any clarity of purpose.\n\nThen the whistleblower gave the Democrats what they needed: a simple, easily explainable charge \u2014 that the president sought a foreign government's help for personal political gain \u2014 and his words to back it up.\n\nFor House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., and several Democratic moderates who had resisted calls for impeachment, the calculus shifted . It was now more of a risk to recoil from impeachment than charge ahead.\n\n\"What we're seeing right now is a completely different moment in the history of this country,\" said Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla.\n\nOne thing that didn't change \u2014 at least not immediately \u2014 was the clear partisan divide over Trump's actions, both in Washington and across the country.\n\nAccording to a one-day NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted Wednesday, 49% of Americans approve of the House formally starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump. Among Democrats, 88% approve of the investigation, while 93% of Republicans disapprove.\n\nMike Staffieri, a retiree and Republican who lives just outside of Richmond, Virginia, said Democrats were trying to \"throw enough poop at the wall and hope something sticks.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, some Trump allies concurred, confidently dismissing the impeachment inquiry as just another partisan effort to take down a president who is despised by many Democrats.
