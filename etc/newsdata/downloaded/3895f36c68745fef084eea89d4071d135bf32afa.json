This is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis guy, like all bullies, is a coward. He does not want to run against me.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump to determine whether he acted improperly by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for releasing aid. The president has also called on China to investigate the Bidens for \u201ccorruption.\u201d There is no evidence either Biden or his son committed any wrongdoing.\n\nA vote to impeach in the House would have to be followed by a trial in the Senate.\n\nWarren Fires Aide for \u2018Inappropriate Behavior\u2019 (5:22 p.m.)\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after investigating allegations of \u201cinappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nCampaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement that over the past two weeks senior leaders of the campaign \u201creceived multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior\u201d by McDaniel. The campaign hired outside counsel to conduct an investigation, she added.\n\n\u201cBased on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,\u201d Orthman said.\n\nThe campaign did not specify the nature of the complaints. -- Emma Kinery and Sahil Kapur\n\nBullock Raises $2.3 Million in Third Quarter (4:56 p.m.)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock raised $2.3 million in the past three months, the smallest third-quarter take disclosed so far by a campaign.\n\nThe campaign said he doubled the number of individual contributions and his average online donation was $24. It did not say how many unique contributors he had.\n\nBullock, the governor of Montana, who has made getting big money out of politics a major theme of his campaign, raised far less than the fundraising leader, Bernie Sanders, who brought in $25.3 million, or author and political novice Marianne Williamson, who took in $3.1 million.\n\nThe Bullock campaign said it would apply to the Federal Election Commission for taxpayer-financed matching funds, which would add up to $250 for each contributor\u2019s aggregate donation. In exchange, the campaign will be limited to how much it can spend in the primaries -- set at $48 million in 2016. That application will require approval from the FEC, which doesn\u2019t have a quorum of four commissioners to make decisions.\n\nBullock currently polls at less than 1% in the RealClearPolitics average. He didn\u2019t qualify for the Democratic debate in September or for the next one, in Ohio on Oct.15. -- Bill Allison\n\nBiden Says Son Hunter May Join Him on the Trail (1:38 p.m.)\n\nJoe Biden said his son Hunter would join him on the campaign trail, despite attacks from Donald Trump over his business dealings in Ukraine, but equivocated on where or when.\n\nIn an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal on Thursday, Biden was asked whether Hunter would campaign with him.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. But when pressed, Biden said that Hunter Biden lives in the West, and that they hadn\u2019t worked out any specifics.\n\nTrump has accused Biden and his son of \u201ccorruption\u201d over Hunter\u2019s involvement with a Ukrainian energy company. House Democrats have begun an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Trump acted improperly by asking the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens in exchange for U.S. weapons. There is no evidence either Biden or his son committed any wrongdoing.\n\nHunter Biden has not made any appearances with his father during the campaign to date. When asked why Hunter would be an asset, he replied: \u201cBecause he\u2019s my son,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine young man.\u201d -- Max Berley\n\nWarren Tries Again With Corporate Legislation (11:03 A.M.)\n\nElizabeth Warren reintroduced her Accountable Capitalism Act on Friday, a measure that would require companies to allow employees to select at least 40% of a corporation\u2019s board of directors.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden declined to say Friday whether he\u2019d vote to convict and remove President Donald Trump from office if he were still in the Senate.\u201cI am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,\u201d he told reporters in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m a former vice president, I know what occurred in", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cUMRQT6ZfQ1n6hWiS3a5aA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/4391eedc3ad6b299f7f3e42623e2ea44", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
