(0941.HK) said its net profit for the first three quarters of the year fell 14% from a year earlier, as intense competition weighed on results.\n\nNet profit for the January-September period was 81.8 billion yuan ($11.55 billion), the telecom operator said Monday. The decline was a slight improvement from the 15% drop in the first half of the year.\n\nOperating revenue extended a downturn as well, edging 0.2% lower on year to CNY566.7 billion, the company said.\n\nThe period's average revenue per user per month for mobile services fell 3.8% from the first six months, it said.
