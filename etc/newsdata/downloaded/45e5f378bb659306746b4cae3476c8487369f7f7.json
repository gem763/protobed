It looks intriguing and is translated by the great Natasha Wimmer.\n\nThe book that changed my life\n\nThe character of Jo March in Little Women drew me to decide to be a writer, and leave all scientific dreams behind.\n\nThe book I wish I\u2019d written\n\nThe Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi is the perfect book for any age. It addresses creation, the war between good and evil, redemption, and transfiguration in one beloved tale. I have loved it since age seven and have long wished to write something similar.\n\nThe book that had the greatest influence on my writing\n\nJean Genet\u2019s The Thief\u2019s Journal, with its mix of autobiography and poetic fiction, has given me a genre to aspire to.\n\nThe book I think is most underrated\n\nThe Blind Contessa\u2019s New Machine by Carey Wallace is exquisitely written. I don\u2019t know how popular it has been, but I found it to be a jewel.\n\nThe book that changed my mind\n\nHermann Hesse\u2019s The Glass Bead Game did not change, but expanded my mind, presenting an entirely new process of mapping the creative intellect.\n\nThe last book that made me cry\n\nAfter surrendering to the omnipresent atmosphere of Villette by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, I was heartbroken at the book\u2019s end. So much so, that I wrote a small alternative ending.\n\nThe last book that made me laugh\n\nArtforum by C\u00e9sar Aira is the latest translation in his immense output. All his brilliant little books are laced with mirth.\n\nThe book I couldn\u2019t finish\n\nI was reading Mark Twain\u2019s The Prince and the Pauper when I was young. It gave me such anxiety that I threw up. I never finished it \u2013 and still can\u2019t bear to.\n\nThe book I\u2019m most ashamed not to have read\n\nI have had an elegant three volume edition of The Man without Qualities by Robert Musil for a few years and have not yet tackled it. I believe it is time.\n\nMy earliest reading memory\n\nFalling in love with books before I could read. I was certain they contained treasure, and reading Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s A Child\u2019s Garden of Verses I found I was right.\n\nThe book I give as a gift\n\nThe Children\u2019s Crusade by Marcel Schwob, because it is so beautiful.\n\nThe book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for\n\nWoolgathering, as it is the purest expression of my imagination.\n\n\u2022 Year of the Monkey by Patti Smith is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a312.99).
