Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and backing Israeli sovereignty over the annexed Golan Heights have made Mr. Trump widely popular among Israeli Jews, with 79% in a recent survey by the American Jewish Committee approving of his handling of relations with Israel.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump went a step further and said he would work toward a mutual defense treaty with Israel. Mr. Netanyahu warmly embraced the idea, even though both countries have discussed and rejected it in the past, with Israel saying it didn\u2019t want its actions constrained.\n\nThe bond between Messrs. Netanyahu and Trump, however, also potentially deepens the rift between Israel and millions of American Jews, a predominantly liberal community where 36% approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of U.S.-Israel relations and 26% endorse the president\u2019s overall performance, according to the survey.\n\nSchism American and Israeli Jews are divided on a number of political issues.

American 50% 39 11 88% 5 7 Israeli\n\nSeveral American Jewish organizations have condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s recent remarks that Jews voting for the Democratic Party show great disloyalty, saying these were the latest in a pattern of statements that revive anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nThe problem for Israel is that this anger with Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and political style have increasingly fueled disenchantment with the Jewish state itself\u2014a process that weakens support from a crucial community and frays the historically bipartisan nature of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.\n\n\u201cWhile the Israeli government appears to be President Trump\u2019s greatest fan, American Jewry is sometimes horrified by his words and actions,\u201d said Itzik Shmuli, a lawmaker from Israel\u2019s left-wing Labor Party. \u201cThe clear effort of President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu to turn Israel literally into a local branch of the Republican Party\u2014and at a clear cost of an ever-growing detachment between Israel and the Democrats\u2014is a harmful and serious trend.\u201d\n\nSome Democratic politicians have embraced the so-called BDS campaign to boycott, divest and sanction Israel for its treatment of Palestinians, as have a handful of left-wing American Jewish organizations, such as the Jewish Voice for Peace. The group\u2019s co-director, Rabbi Alissa Wise, described Israel earlier this month as \u201cthe greatest obstacle to peace in the Middle East.\u201d Though such opinions remain a minority view, they are a sign of alienation between American Jews and Israel.\n\nA split between Israel and American Jews, should it solidify, \u201cwould be a very big tragedy for the Jewish people,\u201d said Jerusalem Rabbi Michael Melchior, who served as minister of diaspora affairs in a center-left government in 1999-2001.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research poll conducted in April, some 42% of American Jews now believe that Mr. Trump favors Israel too much, compared with 15% among evangelicals, and 26% among all U.S. Christians.\n\nMr. Trump visited Jerusalem in 2017.

The American Jewish idea is that Judaism is a universal religion, that we are not a nation or a people, that our duty is to all of humanity, and that America is the promised land, and that the Land of Israel is not the promised land,\u201d he said.\n\nThat fundamental gap, he added, has prompted many Israeli right-wing politicians to essentially give up on liberal American Jews and focus on friendlier constituencies such as evangelicals.\n\nA religious schism reinforces these differences. Conservative and Reform streams of Judaism that are practiced by most American Jews aren\u2019t legally recognized in Israel, where the Orthodox establishment dominates religious matters and Mr. Netanyahu relies on the support of ultra-Orthodox political parties.\n\nMr. Netanyahu unveiled a new Jewish settlement in the Golan Heights named after President Trump in June, after Mr. Trump in March recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty there.

American Jews are well to the left of the Israeli left-wing on many issues, and Aipac, the most prominent American pro-Israel lobbying organization, is finding itself to the left of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s current policies.\n\nAipac still supports a two-state solution in the Palestinian conflict, despite Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s promises to annex West Bank land and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. It has also criticized the Israeli leader\u2019s August decision\u2014which followed a request by Mr. Trump\u2014to bar a visit by Democratic Congress members Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar because of their support for the BDS movement.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is the Netanyahu-Trump alliance in Israel\u2019s best interest? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s embassy move was another such marker. It was welcomed across Israel\u2019s Jewish political spectrum, including by left-wing politicians such as Mr. Shmuli. Only 7% of Israeli Jews opposed the decision.\n\nYet, more American Jews disapproved than approved of it, according to last year\u2019s survey by AJC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic challenge we are facing: Growing apart is something extremely disturbing,\u201d said Isaac Herzog, executive chairman of the Jewish Agency, an Israeli quasi-government body in charge of Jewish immigration and ties with the diaspora.\n\nA completely different life experience is part of the reason, he said in an interview in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cMy kids that grew up here\u2014they would sing \u2018Give Peace a Chance\u2019 but they know they have to serve in the army. A young North American Jew can opt whether to be Jewish or not,\u201d said Mr. Herzog, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Netanyahu for prime minister as the center-left\u2019s candidate in the 2015 elections. \u201cMy son could be on the border of Gaza trying to block 50,000 Palestinians with hand grenades and knives, and his parallel on campus somewhere in North America may look at him as the villain in the conflict.\u201d\n\nWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is looking to capitalize on his alliance with President Trump in an election on Tuesday, but the relationship has a flip side: it deepens a rift between Israeli and American Jews.", "authors": ["Yaroslav Trofimov", "Yaroslav.Trofimov Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107129/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
