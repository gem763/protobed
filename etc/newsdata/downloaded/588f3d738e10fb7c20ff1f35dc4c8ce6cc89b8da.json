Morgan devised a \"Volfefe Index\" to analyze how the president's tweets are influencing volatility in U.S. interest rates.\n\nJ.P. Morgan found that the index, named after Trump's infamous and still mysterious \"covfefe\" tweet, explains a measurable fraction of the moves in implied rate volatility for 2-year and 5-year Treasurys.\n\n\"This makes rough sense as much of the president's tweets have been focused on the Federal Reserve, and as trade tensions are broadly seen as, first and foremost, impactful on near-term economic performance and, likewise, the Fed's reaction to such developments,\" wrote the authors of the J.P. Morgan report.\n\nTrump's market-moving messages most often address trade and monetary policy, with key words including \"China,\" \"billion\" and \"products.\" These tweets are increasingly less likely to receive favorable responses, such as likes or retweets, from the president's followers.", "description": "President Trump's market-moving tweets most often address trade and monetary policy, with keywords including \"China,\" \"billion\" and \"products.\"", "authors": ["Emma Newburger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106111813-1567619894549rts2p6d1.jpg?v=1567619963", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
