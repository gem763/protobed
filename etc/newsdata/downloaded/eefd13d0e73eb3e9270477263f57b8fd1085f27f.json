They couldn\u2019t confirm Euro 2020 qualification as had been hoped, but did confirm a host of gradually forming problems which Gareth Southgate is going to have to solve if they are to have any chance of fulfilling so much promise and talent.\n\nA party turned into an inquest \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t just refer to the group of fans that predictably disgraced themselves in Prague with arrests before the game.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It was probably their worst performance in some time, maybe since Tunisia in the World Cup, even if much of it has been signposted.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It will always put any defence under more pressure, and it doesn\u2019t create enough for the attack.\n\nHere, a 4-2-3-1 system designed to accommodate Mount as a number-10 did produce one of the game\u2019s few moments of actual quality \u2013 in that pass for Kane to so brilliantly flick in for Raheem Sterling to win the penalty \u2013 but also produced a number of specific problems.\n\nIt mean there were acres of space for the Czechs to run into, and no one in the England side to really assert control of that area. That was never going to be Jordan Henderson here, whose performance was symbolised by two wayward long-range passes just when he attempted to pick a ball. Declan Rice meanwhile hasn\u2019t fully settled into this English team.\n\nOn the whole, it ensured a fairly chaotic and shapeless match, where the intensity of Czech running was initially one of the more influential factors.\n\nEngland actually seemed a bit surprised by the ferocity of it, and it led to more errors, and a few moments of danger around the box.\n\nThat\u2019s just open play, though. The set-pieces are another matter, that do point to something more systemic.\n\nLittle wonder Southgate accepted that it has become a \u201csituation\u201d \u2013 he pointedly refused to use the word \u201cproblem\u201d in his pre-match press conference \u2013 to \u201csolve\u201d.\n\nSome of it seems basic.\n\nMichael Keane was heading the ball straight into the error at his own penalty spot, only making it even more difficult.\n\nHence the Czechs responded to Kane\u2019s penalty with haste, and ease. Centre-half Jakub Brabec capitalised on the errors of his English counterparts by bundling the ball past Jordan Pickford. Patrick Schick might have done better, then, from a similar situation moments later.\n\nSouthgate had admitted beforehand the side have made \u201cobvious errors\u201d in recent games, but these were beyond obvious. They were staring everyone in the face. It will provoke bigger discussions about the exact make-up of that defence, especially at centre-half.\n\nThe problem for the Czechs was that their game was based on energy, and they always looked like they would run out.\n\nIt was if they gave England as much as they could early on, until there would come a point when they\u2019d have to dig in a bit more doggedly.\n\nBut dig in they did. They started to pick more holes in England\u2019s defence, rather than forcing them.\n\nAlex Kral and Lukas Masopust brought two magnificent saves out of Pickford, before the moment came.\n\nMan-of-the-match Masopust cut the ball back for substitute Zdenek Ondrasek, who fired past Pickford.\n\nCzech\u2019s chances of reaching Euro 2020 now look alive.\n\nEngland\u2019s chances of actually winning the competition now look further away than they have for a long time.\n\nThe win, and celebration, never came.\n\nThe questions and criticisms, however, have arrived in force.\n\nSouthgate suddenly has a lot to think about.", "description": "Qualification will have to wait at least another game for England \u2013 but an actual trophy may have to wait much longer.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/21/harry-kane-defeat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
