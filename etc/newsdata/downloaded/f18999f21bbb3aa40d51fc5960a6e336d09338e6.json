People who opposed or questioned climate science were making the world \u201ca much worse place\u201d, he added, and Google \u201cshould not be aligned with such people\u201d.\n\nBut five years later, Google still funds more than a dozen organisations that deny the climate crisis and oppose political action to try to solve it. Among them is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the group that launched the notorious Cooler Heads Coalition two decades ago, a group of conservative and libertarian pressure groups dedicated to dispelling the \u201cmyths\u201d of global heating.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\n\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.\n\nThe project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"\n\nOne aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.\n\nAnother aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Google, providing financial backing to groups such as CEI and the Cato Institute \u2013 staunch free marketeers \u2013 has nothing to do with climate science, and everything to do with its effort to curry favour with conservatives on its most pressing issue in Washington: protecting an obscure section of the US law that is worth billions of dollars to the company.\n\nThe law \u2013 known as section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2013 was established in the 1990s, at a time when the internet was in its infancy, and helped to give rise to internet giants, from Google to Facebook, by offering legal immunity to the companies for third party comments, in effect treating them as distributors of content and not publishers.\n\nSection 230, in effect, allowed Google and Facebook to be shielded from the kinds of libel laws that can ensnare other companies, such as newspapers.\n\nThe law has important advocates across the political spectrum, from Democrats who hail it as a triumph of free speech, to Republicans who say it has promoted free enterprise and innovation.\n\nBut now some lawmakers, including Republicans, think it might be time to revise section 230. The senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has said Google\u2019s alleged bias in favour of Democrats means it is not a neutral platform and should not be protected from liability.\n\nGoogle\u2019s decision to give to groups such as CEI reflects an attempt to win friends in Republican and conservative circles, and support those lawmakers on the right who are champions of section 230.", "description": "Company wants to curry favour with conservatives to protect its \u2018section 230\u2019 legal immunity  * Revealed: Google made large contributions to climate change deniersEric Schmidt being interviewing on Bloomberg in 2014.
