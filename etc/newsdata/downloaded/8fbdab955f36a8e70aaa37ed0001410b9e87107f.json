It can give you real resilience as you\n\nget older.\n\nResearch has shown that people with optimistic \u00adattitudes have fewer illnesses and recover more quickly than \u00adpessimists when they are unwell.\n\nThis is because \u00adpessimism weakens the immune system. Studies have even shown that people with negative or hopeless attitudes are at greater risk of developing heart disease.\n\nOptimists are more likely to feel they can take charge of their health and not just passively slide into old age.\n\nThey tend to take better care of \u00adthemselves too. They sleep better, don\u2019t drink or smoke too much, exercise \u00adregularly and are freer from depression. They live longer and age more gently.\n\nIt\u2019s worth cultivating an optimistic mindset, believe me.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nLearn to stress less\n\nYou have probably heard that stress can be very ageing \u2013 and to a certain extent that\u2019s true.\n\nHowever it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. There is good stress and bad stress, and you can learn how to turn the bad kind into the good.\n\nBy this I mean it\u2019s possible to manage stress so that it increases our productivity rather than reduces it.\n\nWe all differ in how we react to stress. Some people thrive on challenges, while others react with fear, anxiety and worry. So how you feel depends on how you personally respond to stress in the first place.\n\nIf you react positively, there\u2019s no problem. But people who don\u2019t handle stress well live shorter lives. So dealing calmly with stress is a trick worth learning in order to ensure a longer and happier life.\n\nHere are tried and tested \u00adtechniques to help you cope with stress.\n\nSmile, smile, smile\n\nWhen we smile it acts as a trigger to the mind and body to release chemicals that induce pleasant emotions.\n\nThe same thing happens when someone smiles at you.\n\nBut did you know you can store this good feeling in your memory, and call up the good feelings whenever you want to?\n\nStart by recalling the sensation of smiling in your mind, and visualise an image that makes you smile. Hold that image\n\nin your mind and breathe slowly and calmly.\n\nNow, smile back at that image. The change in your facial muscles may be very slight but you should feel a peaceful sensation.\n\nBecome fully aware of that sensation and embrace it. Next time you\u2019re feeling stressed, smile inwardly to yourself to recall this happy feeling.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMake time to meditate\n\nMeditation can sound complicated or intimidating, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s simply a way of quieting the mind.\n\nWhen your mind is quiet, you will feel a sense of peace and absence of stressful feelings.\n\nWhen we meditate, we empty our minds of thoughts and problems.\n\nThis allows us to be in the present moment, rather than being separated from it by our thoughts, feelings, plans and \u00adexpectations.\n\nTry this simple meditation exercise:\n\n1 Sit comfortably with your spine straight. Focus your attention on your abdomen as you inhale and exhale in a natural way.\n\n2 Take a few deep breaths without straining. Let the flow of your breath settle into its own natural rhythm, while keeping focused and aware during the whole process.\n\n3 Allow your attention to focus on the changing rhythm of your breath.\n\nWhen your attention\n\nbegins to wander, gently but firmly bring it back to your breathing.\n\n4 Count your breaths: on exhalation count one, on the next exhalation count two, and so on until you reach 10. Then start over again.\n\nPractising this technique will help with concentration. Your attention will improve and your mind will become clearer and calmer. You can do it anywhere and anytime, and just 10 minutes twice a day will reap benefits.", "description": "Dr Miriam Stoppard reveals how to look after your mental health in later years", "authors": ["Miriam Stoppard", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Blend Images", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735432.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_African-American-woman-stretching.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
