Anyone who defied the order were branded \"sell-outs\", and risked being assaulted and even killed. This time, the lockdown will be for two and possibly three weeks.\n\nBamenda - the biggest English-speaking city with a population of about 400,000 - has been in lockdown since last week, while in other areas the lockdown started this week.\n\nRead more about Cameroon:\n\nIn the days leading up to the lockdown, transport fares more than doubled as thousands of people fled villages, towns and cities for safer areas in mainly French-speaking Cameroon - including the capital, Yaound\u00e9, and the commercial heartland of Douala.\n\nThis has worsened the humanitarian crisis, with some people stranded at bus stations in the two cities because they have nowhere to go.\n\nDespite this, some government officials have buried their heads in the sand - the North-West governor, Adolphe L\u00e9l\u00e9 L'Afrique, described those fleeing as holidaymakers returning to their homes before the start of the new academic year.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The majority of people in Cameroon are French-speaking\n\nWith such an attitude, many people are in despair, wondering whether there is a future for them - and more importantly their children - in mainly English-speaking Cameroon or whether they should emigrate.\n\nI myself moved to Canada in January, as Bamenda - where I lived - became too dangerous for me to work as a journalist.", "description": "Schoolchildren have become pawns in the conflict in the mainly English-speaking regions of Cameroon.", "authors": ["Peter Tah", "Cameroonian Journalist"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9900/production/_108586193_c.jpg"}
