I suppose it\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to speak to Real about and it\u2019s between me and them... we\u2019ll have to come to some sort of conclusion.\u201d\n\nBale, who has been backed to remain in Spain after a change of heart by Zidane, said he had taken the turmoil in his stride and has since ended a scoring drought going back to March with a brace in Real\u2019s 2-2 draw at Villarreal last weekend.\n\n\u201cI know there was a lot of talk, with people saying the good, bad, or whatever they wanted ... things in football can turn quickly and it\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the worst time of my career, it\u2019s not been ideal but I know how to deal with it.\n\n\u201cYou get rewarded with the work you put in and I\u2019ve started the season well.\u201d", "description": "Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale expects his rocky relationship with the Spanish club to experience more turbulence despite a strong start to the campaign after almost leaving them in the close season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426812072&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850KQ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
