Kennedy\u2019s decision to go to the moon in this newly published biography.\n\n\u201cApollo 13,\u201d by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger\n\nWhile the Apollo 13 mission took place after the main events covered in the \u201cMoonrise\u201d podcast, I still found it useful to read astronaut Jim Lovell\u2019s account of his training, as he was also part of the Apollo 8 mission, the first human trip to the moon.\n\n\u201cApollo in the Age of Aquarius,\u201d by Neil Maher\n\nNeil Maher, who appeared as a guest on Episode 11 of the \u201cMoonrise\u201d podcast, examines how the Apollo program intersected \u2014 sometimes collaborating, sometimes colliding \u2014 with social movements of the 1960s, including women\u2019s rights, civil rights, the environmental movement and protests against the Vietnam War.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cApollo to the Moon,\u201d by Teasel Muir-Harmony\n\nThis is a guide to artifacts from the Apollo missions, which each reveal unique stories about the space race. Teasel Muir-Harmony is the curator of the National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Apollo collection. She also appeared as an expert on \u201cMoonrise\u201d and was hugely helpful in furthering my understanding of the geopolitics of the Apollo story.\n\n\u201cAstounding,\u201d by Alec Nevala-Lee\n\nThis book has fascinating details about the golden age of science fiction, particularly the lives and careers of sci-fi creators John Campbell, Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. In addition to using this book as a font of information for \u201cMoonrise,\u201d I interviewed author Alec Nevala-Lee about his science fiction expertise for several of the podcast episodes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom the Earth to the Moon,\u201d by Jules Verne\n\nThis novel, originally published in 1865 by French author Jules Verne, is considered one of the first science fiction depictions of launching humans on a rocket to the moon. It inspired a generation of rocket designers and sci-fi readers to dream of space travel.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJohn F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon,\u201d John M. Logsdon\n\nSpace historian John Logsdon pulls together a detailed account of John F. Kennedy\u2019s Apollo decision and its lasting effects on U.S. space policy.\n\n\u201cMaster of the Senate\u201d and \u201cThe Passage of Power,\u201d by Robert A. Caro\n\nThese two biographies in Robert Caro\u2019s massive (and ongoing) series about Lyndon B. Johnson were extremely useful in constructing an image of Johnson\u2019s role in shaping U.S. space policy, from Sputnik through Apollo.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRight Stuff, Wrong Sex,\u201d by Margaret Weitekamp\n\nMargaret Weitekamp, a historian with the National Air and Space Museum, appeared regularly on the \u201cMoonrise\u201d podcast. This book of hers looks at the first program that attempted to put women in space in the 1950s and \u203260s, telling the interwoven story of the U.S. space program and the women\u2019s rights movement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRocket Men,\u201d by Robert Kurson\n\nThis is a great account of the Apollo 8 mission, the first time humans flew all the way to the moon. We tell a (much abbreviated!) version of the Apollo 8 story in episode 11 of \u201cMoonrise.\u201d\n\n\u201cRockets and People \u2014 Volume III: Hot Days of the Cold War,\u201d by Boris Chertok\n\nBoris Chertok worked under Soviet rocket designer Sergei Korolev, and this volume of his autobiography gives a rich firsthand account of Korolev\u2019s final days, as chronicled in \u201cMoonrise\u201d Episode 10.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRocket Ship Galileo,\u201d by Robert A. Heinlein\n\nThis young-adult fantasy book about a trip to the moon served as the basis for the film \u201cDestination Moon,\u201d one of the earliest Hollywood depictions of space travel. The influence of such works on popular culture \u2014 and, subsequently, U.S. space policy \u2014 is explored in Episode 6 of \u201cMoonrise.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSpace and the American Imagination,\u201d by Howard McCurdy\n\nHoward McCurdy is a professor in the School of Public Affairs at American University, and he appeared regularly on the podcast. This book in many ways has a similar aim to \u201cMoonrise\u201d \u2014 it examines the way fictional imagery in popular culture shaped real policy decisions involving the space program.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSpaceflight and the Myth of Presidential Leadership,\u201d by Roger Launius and Howard McCurdy\n\nBoth Roger Launius and Howard McCurdy were frequent guests on the \u201cMoonrise\u201d podcast, and their book is a collection of essays on the intersection between presidential politics and space policy. It illuminates patterns and differences among the many American presidents who had a hand in shaping U.S. space goals.\n\n\u201cThe Age of Eisenhower,\u201d by William I. Hitchcock\n\nWilliam Hitchcock\u2019s biography of Dwight Eisenhower was instrumental for me when I was creating the presidential podcast, and I found myself rereading several chapters of it for \u201cMoonrise\u201d to better understand Eisenhower\u2019s thinking on Sputnik and the United States\u2019 military interests in space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness,\u201d by Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin was the first woman to win the prestigious Hugo and Nebula science fiction awards. This novel of hers, published in 1969 \u2014 the same year as the Apollo 11 moon landing \u2014 is an example of science fiction\u2019s use of space settings as laboratories for exploring social and cultural dynamics on Earth.\n\n\u201cThe Red Rockets\u2019 Glare,\u201d by Asif Siddiqi\n\nAsif Siddiqi is one of the foremost experts on Soviet space history. His book \u201cThe Red Rockets\u2019 Glare\u201d showcases his meticulous research into the early Soviet space program. Particularly useful for me in making \u201cMoonrise\u201d were his detailed accounts of Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev\u2019s role throughout so much of the space race.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d by Tom Wolfe\n\nWhile astronauts are far from the main characters of \u201cMoonrise,\u201d this classic Tom Wolfe nonfiction work is a great jumping-off point for understanding NASA\u2019s culture in the 1960s.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Smithsonian History of Space Exploration,\u201d by Roger Launius\n\nRoger Launius appeared regularly on the \u201cMoonrise\u201d podcast, sharing his expertise across a wide array of space-history topics. In this massive book, he gives a thorough overview of all things space \u2014 from ancient studies of the stars to future projects to explore them.\n\n\u201cThe Space Barons,\u201d by Christian Davenport\n\nChristian Davenport is a colleague of mine at The Washington Post who covers NASA and the private space industry. He was a great help throughout my reporting process, and his book provides a really informative and engaging look at the figures leading, and financing, space exploration today.\n\n\u201cVon Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War,\u201d by Michael J. Neufeld\n\nMichael Neufeld is a historian with the National Air and Space Museum, and his biography paints a complex, nuanced portrait of German-turned-American rocket engineer Wernher von Braun. Neufeld was a guest on several \u201cMoonrise\u201d episodes, particularly contributing his expertise on von Braun\u2019s Nazi past and his story of coming to the United States after World War II.", "description": "Loved the \"Moonrise\" podcast?
