Pick the leaves off a stick of celery? Don\u2019t dare eat an apple core?\n\nAccording to the latest food trend, we should be eating every morsel of our food \u2013 including all of the above. So-called sustainable eating is all the rage, with eco-warrior food bloggers and writers inventing new recipes to minimise our food wastage.\n\nEven restaurants have got in on the craze, with chefs making vinegars from left over veg and using old fruit pith to flavour cocktails.\n\nNow, intriguing research shows the trend isn\u2019t only healthy for the planet, but for our bodies, too.\n\nMany of the odds and ends we bin could provide us with vital vitamins and minerals that ward off disease. And it\u2019s not just apple cores and vegetable stalks \u2013 eating eggshells could protect against bone-wasting diseases.\n\nHere we reveal what else you should savour and how to turn peels and piths into a delicious \u2013 and nutritious \u2013 treat.\n\nEggshells are exceptionally high in the mineral calcium, essential for building bones, teeth and nails\n\nMORE CALCIUM IN EGGSHELL THAN MILK\n\nWHY should I eat them?\n\nEggshells are exceptionally high in the mineral calcium, essential for building bones, teeth and nails. One 2013 study by researchers in Argentina found that just half a large shell could provide the entire daily recommended calcium intake of roughly 700mg per day. One glass of milk contains roughly a third of this.\n\nHOW do I eat them?\n\nThey must be sterile before eating to prevent the risk of salmonella, sometimes carried in raw eggs. This is easily achieved by soaking them in boiling water, or roasting in a hot oven. Then, crush into a powder and add them to food for a calcium boost.\n\n\u2018The best way to use eggshell is powdered and added to bread, pizza or spaghetti,\u2019 say scientists at Rosario University in Argentina. \u2018There are small changes in texture and no changes in flavour.\u2019\n\nBut dietician Cherry Hagger issues some caution: \u2018Getting calcium from dairy products is preferable, as they don\u2019t have to be sterilised to avoid salmonella risk.\u2019\n\nOne 2013 study by researchers in Argentina found that just half a large shell could provide the entire daily recommended calcium intake of roughly 700mg per day. One glass of milk contains roughly a third of this\n\nMELON SEEDS ARE HIGH IN PROTEIN\n\nWHY should I eat them?\n\nJust two tablespoons of watermelon seeds contains about 10g of protein \u2013 4g more than in an egg. Protein is essential for building muscle, and experts recommend we eat roughly 20g at every main meal.According to studies published in the Journal Of Agriculture And Food Chemistry, unlike other plant proteins, the little black seeds provide a range of amino acids \u2013 the building blocks that make up protein.\n\nThey also contain Vitamin B \u2013 essential for healthy blood cells \u2013 and magnesium, which enhances brain connectivity and reduces the risk of muscle cramps.\n\nDon\u2019t chuck the watermelon rind either \u2013 that\u2019s the white bit between the flesh and the skin. \u2018It\u2019s high in fibre and the mineral potassium, which is important for kidney function,\u2019 says Susanne Masters, a botanist and researcher at Holland\u2019s Naturalis Biodiversity Center.\n\nHOW should I eat them?\n\nDried or roasted watermelon seeds are now available in many supermarkets. You can make your own by adding a sprinkling of spices\n\nand roasting in the oven for ten minutes.\n\n\u2018Make a pickle with the watermelon rind using a brine of water and salt,\u2019 says Masters. \u2018This creates bacteria called lactobacilli, which is beneficial for gut health.\u2019\n\nJust two tablespoons of watermelon seeds contains about 10g of protein \u2013 4g more than in an egg\n\nDON\u2019T TRIM SPROUTS... OR CHUCK VEG LEAVES\n\nWHY should I eat them?\n\nThe outer leaves of many green vegetables we love to hate \u2013 Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli \u2013 are a nutritious part of the plant. \u2018The outer layers usually get the most sunlight, which means they create more beneficial compounds than the inner parts do,\u2019 says Masters.\n\nAdding them to dishes could help give a vitamin and mineral boost. Leaves on root veg are similarly healthy. One tablespoon of beetroot contains about 130 micrograms of folic acid, essential for nerve health and in pregnancy, but there\u2019s far more in the \u2013 often discarded \u2013 leaves. \u2018The same is true for carrot, celery and radish leaves,\u2019 says Masters.\n\nHOW should I eat them?\n\nRaw, roasted or tossed into a stir-fry. \u2018Give outer layers a good clean if they are dirty. Then they are perfectly edible,\u2019 says Masters. Avoid boiling, as water can wash away nutrients.\n\nIf celery leaves are looking worse for wear, sitting the stalks in water on a windowsill will help bring them back to life.\n\nCITRUS PEEL IS BETTER THAN A WHOLE ORANGE\n\nWHY should I eat it?\n\nThe peel of citrus fruit, including oranges, lemons and limes, has higher concentrations of healthy flavonoid compounds than the juicy, sweet flesh. Flavonoids are chemicals in plants known to boost the immune system, helping bodily cells fight off disease.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture, a single tablespoon of orange peel provides nearly three times more Vitamin C than the fruit itself, not to mention four times the fibre, which is essential for bowel health. \u2018Citrus peel is made by the plant to protect its seeds and fruit, so it contains the highest concentration of flavour and health-boosting compounds,\u2019 says Masters.\n\nHOW should I eat it?\n\nThe pith of circus fruits can be added to dressings. \u2018Try the Japanese spice shichimi, which contains roasted, ground orange peel,\u2019 recommends Masters.\u2018If you use it during cooking, you\u2019ll get an extra hit of flavonoids.\u2019\n\nThe peel of citrus fruit, including oranges, lemons and limes, has higher concentrations of healthy flavonoid compounds than the juicy, sweet flesh\n\nEAT THE APPLE CORE FOR GOOD GUT BACTERIA\n\nWHY should I eat it?\n\nYou might be considered bizarre for polishing off the apple core, but your friendly gut bugs will thank you. Inside the core lies a tenth of the apple\u2019s friendly bacteria, which boasts a host of health benefits for digestive health and the immune system.\n\nAccording to researchers at Austria\u2019s Graz University of Technology, stem and seeds showed highest bacterial abundance. The crunchy peel had the lowest concentration.\n\nHOW should I eat it?\n\nMany worry about eating apple seeds, as they contain amygdalin which degrades into poisonous cyanide in the body. But, according to Masters, eating the odd apple core is unlikely to have a toxic effect. \u2018The toxicity only happens when the seeds are crushed or chewed, and if you eat lots of the seeds in one go,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very unlikely this will happen to anyone who eats apples in normal quantities.\u2019\n\nThe average adult would have to eat 150 crushed seeds in one sitting to risk cyanide poisoning \u2013 roughly 20 apples\u2019 worth.\n\nYou might be considered bizarre for polishing off the apple core, but your friendly gut bugs will thank you\n\nHEALTH HACKS: Got a headache? Eat something spicy\n\nResearch suggests that chillis might have a positive effect in treating migraines. In a small study of 18 patients, a nasal spray containing a synthetic chilli-pepper extract helped alleviate pain from migraine and cluster headaches.\n\nIt was thought to work by desensitising nerves in the head and lowering levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, a brain chemical associated with headache pain and other migraine symptoms. Two-thirds of patients reported total relief within one minute when using the spray.\n\nSome natural health advocates claim that eating spicy foods, or including more chilli in the diet, has a similar effect but there is no scientific evidence for this. A word of caution: munching on spicy chillis has been blamed for causing excruciating headaches, too.\n\nYes please: Aman grounding pulse point\n\nA rollerball scent blended with calming amber oil and damask rose \u2013 a combination said to relax the mind after a few deep inhalations.
