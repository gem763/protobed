REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nIt was unclear whether the specialist would work inside the White House or act as an outside adviser, with discussions still ongoing about the effort, the sources said.\n\nTrump had announced former Republican lawmaker Trey Gowdy as an outside legal adviser, only to find out that lobbying rules would prevent Gowdy from working on impeachment until January, when the impeachment push could be either over or in its final stages.\n\nThere had been a sense inside the White House that no new officials were needed specifically to handle communications around the inquiry, but this has changed in recent days as Trump mounts pressure on Republicans for a more robust defence.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said on Thursday that the White House is working on getting a team together to work on communications.\n\n\u201cI talked to Chief of Staff Mulvaney. I think they\u2019re working on getting a messaging team together,\u201d Graham said during a news briefing, referring to White House\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nGraham pointed to the impeachment process of former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who \u201chad a team that was organised, that had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question, and they were on message every day.\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton defended himself but he never stopped being president,\u201d Graham said.\n\nWhite House officials are conducting a daily call with some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to coordinate strategy, exchange viewpoints and work on messaging, a source familiar with the effort said.\n\nThere remains a need for a more robust internal strategy for managing the impeachment furore in much the same way the White House had a small team in support of the storm-tossed nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a U.S. Supreme Court justice, said a Republican official close to the White House.\n\n\u201cI would love to see them get more aggressive and more tactically on top of things,\u201d said the source. \u201cA Kavanaugh-style mini team with a couple dedicated staff would be beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a legal fight, it\u2019s a political fight,\u201d the source said.", "description": "White House officials are discussing the possibility of bringing in a specialist to handle communications involving the Democrats' impeachment inquiry as Republican officials clamour to defend President Donald Trump, sources familiar with the effort said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444653176&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N21J", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
