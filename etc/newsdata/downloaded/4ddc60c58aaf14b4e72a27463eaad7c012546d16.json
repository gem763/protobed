If we\u2019re going to have a permanent presence there, we\u2019ll need it, so learning as much as we can about it is crucial. That\u2019s why the agency is sending a rover called VIPER to the Moon\u2019s south pole \u2014 its first long-term surface mission since 1972.\n\nVIPER, or the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, will touch down in December 2022 if all goes according to plan. Its mission: directly observe and quantify the presence of water in the permanently shadowed polar regions.\n\nThese perennially dark areas of the Moon have been collecting water ice for millions of years, since there\u2019s no sunlight to melt or vaporize it. NASA already confirmed the presence of water ice by crashing a probe into the general area, but that\u2019s a bit crude, isn\u2019t it? Better to send a robot in to take some precise measurements.\n\nVIPER will be about the size of a golf cart, and will be equipped with what amounts to prospecting gear. Its Neutron Spectrometer System (mentioned yesterday by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine ahead of this announcement) will let the rover detect water beneath the surface.\n\nWhen it\u2019s over a water deposit, VIPER will deploy\u2026 The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrain, or TRIDENT. Definitely the best acronym I\u2019ve encountered this week. TRIDENT is a meter-long drill that will bring up samples for analysis by the rover\u2019s two other instruments, a pair of spectrometers that will evaluate the contents of the soil.\n\nBy doing this systematically over a large area, the team hopes to create a map of water deposits below the surface that can be analyzed for larger patterns \u2014 perhaps leading to a more systematic understanding of our favorite substance\u2019s presence on the Moon.\n\nThe rover is currently in development, as you can see from the pictures at the top \u2014 the right image is its \u201cmobility testbed,\u201d which as you might guess lets the team test out how it will get around.\n\nVIPER is a limited-time mission; operating at the poles means there\u2019s no sunlight to harvest with solar panels, so the rover will carry all the power it needs to last about a hundred days there. That\u2019s longer than the U.S. has spent on the Moon\u2019s surface in a long time \u2014 although China has for the last few years been actively deploying rovers all over the place.\n\nInterestingly, the rover is planned for deployment via a Commercial Lunar Payload Services contract, meaning one of these companies may be building the lander that takes it from orbit to the surface. Expect to hear more as we get closer to launch.", "description": "NASA is looking for liquid gold on the Moon \u2014 not oil, but plain-old water.
