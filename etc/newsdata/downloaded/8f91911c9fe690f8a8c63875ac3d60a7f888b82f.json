Sordid tales of late-night drives, suicide, desire and femme fatales with killer smiles. Beautiful piano, dirty guitar, and Mark Lanegan lending his devilish tones. The score to the best film noir never made.\n\nBruce Springsteen \u2013 The Rising (2002)\n\n\u2018Astonishing\u2019: masepod\n\nFor me, The Rising by Bruce Springsteen has got to be in there. That someone 30 years into their career can write a requiem for America in the post-9/11 age is astonishing in itself. This album restarted his career, which had tailed off in the 90s, and includes some of his best and most poignant work. Come on, rise up!\n\nGreen Day \u2013 American Idiot (2004)\n\n\u2018A solid piece of Americana\u2019: Shoe Banerjee, 37, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nI just think it\u2019s a great album and a solid piece of Americana. It cemented Green Day as a serious band with serious artistic cred. I listened to it on a loop in my car for about two years straight after it came out, so I sort of maxed out on it \u2013 but it\u2019s still (as a whole) my favourite album of the century.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Serious artistic cred ... Green Day. Photograph: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images\n\nThe Libertines \u2013 The Libertines (2004)\n\n\u2018A breath of fresh air\u2019: Stevencharles71\n\nWhere are the Libertines? Either of the first two albums, but the second album in particular? After the previous decade left guitar music on a life-support machine, with Britpop (there were a few exceptions, but not Oasis or Blur) the tumour at the centre of the disease, the Libertines were a breath of fresh air, with two incredibly strong albums and the only real competition for the Strokes during the earlier years of the 21st century.\n\nCate Le Bon \u2013 Reward (2019)\n\n\u2018Any of her albums deserve to be on this list\u2019: pennerigate\n\nI haven\u2019t fully thought about all the missing albums [from the Guardian\u2019s list], and I get that you can\u2019t include everything but Thundercat\u2019s Drunk, Syd Arthur\u2019s Apricity, Troubleman\u2019s Time Out of Mind, Cate Le Bon\u2019s Reward \u2026 in fact, any of Cate Le Bon\u2019s albums deserve to be on this list! And although Kate Bush\u2019s Aerial was welcomed, I thought her album 50 Words for Snow was unusual and brilliant to listen to throughout winter and definitely worth the place of one or two others on this list.\n\nDillinja \u2013 Cybotron (2001)\n\n\u2018An incredible piece of work\u2019: junglist92\n\nI would have liked to have seen the inclusion of Dillinja\u2019s Cybotron. Truly, music that changed the face of the drum and bass scene. It elevated him to the title of the King \u2013 and you can hear it and more importantly feel it in this album. I\u2019ve never heard anyone else use the lower ranges of sub-bass to such devastating effect. It is an incredible piece of work. I remember seeing people on dancefloors literally stop dancing and shaking their heads in disbelief, in awe of what they were hearing, when any number of tracks from this album came on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest At the top of his game ... Bob Dylan. Photograph: Christopher Polk/GETTY IMAGES\n\nBob Dylan \u2013 Shadows in the Night (2015)\n\n\u2018The arrangements are fantastic\u2019: LyntonCrosby\n\nI\u2019m disappointed there was no room for Bob Dylan\u2019s Shadows in the Night. His best album in a long time, and vocally he is at the top of his game. It\u2019s a cover album of songs previously recorded by Frank Sinatra and the band treat the songs with respect \u2013 the arrangements are fantastic. I suffer from terrible earworms and this album is one big earworm for me. I still wake up with different songs from it whirling around my head.\n\nBT \u2013 This Binary Universe (2006)\n\n\u2018Pushes the boundaries\u2019: RadioHedgeFund\n\nAn astounding album by a true visionary, TBU pushes the boundaries of what is possible in music. Brian Transeau experimented with rewiring old instruments, writing his own audio software from scratch and even creating his own instruments to create a soundscape unlike anything else around.\n\nPsykovsky \u2013 Tanetsveta (2010)\n\n\u2018Music made by far-future aliens\u2019: dholliday\n\nMy favourite musician behind only Pink Floyd. Tanetsveta is an epic trip into what our reality sounds like if we had no frequency filters. Alternatively, think of it as music made by far-future aliens who are attempting to communicate with us. At over two hours long, with an at-first impenetrable, punishing, heavy-speed sound, it\u2019s not an easy listen! But the layers and melody it reveals are cosmic, after breaking in you\u2019ll start to hear more ambience than heavy. Truly transcendental. I know each tiny lick by heart, it\u2019s become a familiar comfort.\n\nThe Weeknd \u2013 Trilogy (2012)\n\n\u2018He revolutionised the genre\u2019: mattjedge\n\nOne glaringly obvious omission (to me, at least) is the Weeknd\u2019s Trilogy. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, sure, the lyrics are dark and misogynistic and downright uncomfortable to listen to at times \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult to listen to modern R&B without hearing its influence everywhere. The darker sound, slower pace, sparse sampling. He revolutionised the genre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alison Goldfrapp performing at Glastonbury festival 2017. Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images\n\nGoldfrapp \u2013 Black Cherry (2003)\n\n\u2018Cool electro with a hint of glam\u2019: lotusblue\n\nThe Strokes\u2019 debut album more or less saved indie-rock from the generic dumper. Agree with its placing so high [in the Guardian\u2019s list], but disappointed to not see Goldfrapp. Cool electro with a hint of glam that surely must have influenced a whole generation of synth-botherers. Black Cherry is the one for me from their impressive canon.\n\nHallucinogen \u2013 In Dub (2002)\n\n\u2018Its only failing is it was never released on vinyl\u2019: 1789wasAgoodYear\n\nMy favourite album of all time is from 2002 \u2013 Hallucinogen\u2019s In Dub. I grew up on classical music, but got into electronica through Tangerine Dream and the new wave of the 80s into the 90s. This is Simon Posford remixed by OTT. This album ticks all the boxes for me. Its only failing is it was never released on vinyl.\n\nJohnny Cash \u2013 American III: Solitary Man (2000)\n\n\u2018He had a new vulnerability to this voice\u2019: Huw Edwards\n\nOn his first album since being diagnosed with a neurological disorder in 1997, the 68-year-old Johnny Cash had a new vulnerability to his voice. When he sings, \u201cThere\u2019s no sickness, no toil nor danger in that bright land to which I go,\u201d he sounds like a man ready to go home.\n\nThe Darkness \u2013 Permission to Land (2003)\n\n\u2018Hawkins has the talent to execute what he\u2019s learned\u2019: stripsidebob\n\nThis album is definitely in the Top 10. Justin Hawkins is a student of rock and has the talent to execute what he\u2019s learned. He\u2019s also, by turns, Partridge-esque, witty and an arch ironist. There are some people you meet who can elevate a social gathering by force of their generosity of spirit and natural good humour.", "description": "After we published our list of the greatest albums this century, we asked for your own suggestions \u2013 from dark R&B to revolutionary drum\u2019n\u2019bass", "authors": ["Guardian Readers", "Rachel Obordo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aca461d40512797d57e8feba64b6edf7eb36cef/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cba3838c78d04ac7112c3822e96736c5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
