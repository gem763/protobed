It is so dense a single sugar-cube worth of neutron-star material would weigh the same as the entire human population of Earth (100 million tons).\n\nNeutron stars are objects formed from the collapsed cores of large stars following a supernova explosion. They are also known as pulsars due to the pulses of radiation they emit as they rotate at high speeds.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Scientists say this star is approaching the limits of how compact a single object can become without crushing in on itself.\n\n\u201cNeutron stars are as mysterious as they are fascinating,\u201d sad lead researcher Thankful Cromartie, a pre-doctoral fellow at Virginia University.\n\n\u201cThese city-sized objects are essentially ginormous atomic nuclei. They are so massive that their interiors take on weird properties. Finding the maximum mass that physics and nature will allow can teach us a great deal about this otherwise inaccessible realm in astrophysics.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We don\u2019t know what they\u2019re made of and one really important question is, \u2018How massive can you make one of these stars?\u2019 It has implications for very exotic material that we simply can\u2019t create in a laboratory on Earth,\u201d said Maura McLaughlin, astrophysics professor at West Virginia University.\n\nThe neutron star is a pulsar that emits beams of radio waves like a lighthouse as it spins. Pulsars get their name because of twin beams of radio waves they emit from their magnetic poles as they rotate hundreds of times each second.\n\nAstronomers measure these radio waves to work out the mass of stellar objects. They can do this thanks to its orbiting companion star.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This phenomenon \u2013 known as \u201cShapiro Delay\u201d \u2013 is because the gravity from the white dwarf star slightly warps the space surrounding it.\n\nThis warping means the pulses from the rotating neutron star have to travel a little bit further. Astronomers measure that delay to calculate the mass of the white dwarf, which in turn provides a measurement of the neutron star.\n\nOnce the mass of one of the co-orbiting bodies is known they can accurately determine the mass of the other.\n\n\u201cThe orientation of this binary star system created a fantastic cosmic laboratory,\u201d said Scott Ransom, an astronomer at National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and co-author on the paper.\n\n\u201cNeutron stars have this tipping point where their interior densities get so extreme that the force of gravity overwhelms even the ability of neutrons to resist further collapse.\n\n\u201cEach \u2018most massive\u2019 neutron star we find brings us closer to identifying that tipping point and helping us to understand the physics of matter at these mind boggling densities.\u201d\n\nPulsars spin with such speed and regularity that astronomers can use them to study the nature of space-time, the mass of stellar objects and our understanding of general relativity.", "description": "The most massive neutron star ever recorded has been discovered by astronomers 4,600 light years from Earth.
