And that was all campaigning Democrats needed.\n\nAway they went; impeachment, they cried.\n\nThen came Hollywood.\n\n\u201cHe MUST be impeached,\u201d screamed actress Debra Messing, from Twitter.\n\nHow predictable.\n\nBut now, come to find out, whoops, oops, turns out this guy cited in The New York Times, this guy cited in the book making the claim against Kavanaugh, was, drumroll please, a real defender of the Clintons. On top of that, the authors-slash-reporters acknowledge that their entire arguments and allegations against Kavanaugh were formed by \u201cgut reaction\u201d to the past accusations that flew fast and furious during his confirmation hearings \u2014 and not from fact.\n\nWhat an utter hit job. What a complete smear campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is right: Kavanaugh, indeed \u201cshould start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue,\u201d as he tweeted.\n\nThis is how the Takedown of Kavanaugh, Part Two, commenced. Robin Rogrebin and Kate Kelly, a couple of reporters at The New York Times, wrote the book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d In it, they go back in time to the 2018 confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh when a woman, Deborah Ramirez, accused him of exposing himself to her at a party during his freshman year at Yale University. Ramirez\u2019s claims were unsubstantiated; Kavanaugh outright denied them. Enter Kelly and Rogrebin. With their \u201cgut\u201d instincts.\n\nIn their book, and in their piece in The New York Times, they say a classmate, Max Stier, \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nFrom that, several of the Democrat Party\u2019s top contenders for the White House \u2014 Kamala Harris, Bernie Sander, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro \u2014 called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201c[He] must be impeached,\u201d they all agreed.\n\nBut then came this teeny, weeny, itty, bitty update from The New York Times: A little revision made late Sunday evening \u2014 after all the trashing calls for impeachment of Kavanaugh came \u2014 that said several friends of this supposed Ramirez victim said she actually admitted she didn\u2019t remember the alleged sexual assault.\n\nHow convenient.\n\nThe piece in The New York Times also forgot to mention this teeny, weeny, itty, bitty piece of information, as well \u2014 that Stier served as a defense attorney for Bill Clinton. Instead, he\u2019s described as a \u201crespected thought leader.\u201d\n\nOnce again, how convenient.\n\nThis is what\u2019s going on here: Democrats haven\u2019t been able to impeach Trump.\n\nDemocrats weren\u2019t able to prevent the seating of one of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court picks, the highly esteemed \u2014 and properly constitutionally compassed \u2014 Kavanaugh.\n\nSo they\u2019re using their backup plan, the smear campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s despicable. It\u2019s detestable. It\u2019s a grotesque media-Democrat strategic takedown attempt of one of the legal world\u2019s finest minds.\n\nAnd it\u2019s classic textbook libel. America\u2019s political and media worlds should not be allowed to operate this way. If Kavanaugh doesn\u2019t fight back, the Democrats, the media, the left-leaning operatives in this country \u2014 the shameless left-leaning operatives \u2014 will only be emboldened to go after the next guy, the next gal, with even more firepower.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
