She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, he declared that he \u201cdidn\u2019t say that\u201d he thought Iran was\n\nresponsible for the attack on Saudi oil\n\nrefineries.\n\nOn Sunday, he denied that he had said he would meet with Iran with no conditions.\n\nLast month, he said, of the ongoing trade war, that he \u201cnever said China was going to be easy.\u201d And, responding to the Texas and Ohio massacres, he said he wanted \u201cmeaningful Background Checks\u201d for firearms sales \u2014 something he \u201cnever said\u201d before.\n\nThere are just a few asterisks to attach to the above statements:\n\nHe did meet Roberts. At Trump Tower. In a nationally televised interview. (\u201cThanks for having us here at your palace,\u201d said she. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great honor.\u201d)\n\nHe did suggest he thought Iran was responsible for the attacks, hours before denying he said it.\n\nHe did say at least twice, on TV, that he would meet with Iran with \u201cno preconditions.\u201d\n\nHe also had previously said a trade war with China would be \u201creally easy to win\u201d and that he wanted \u201cpowerful, strong\u201d background checks.\n\nThis is the guy who claimed he has \u201cone of the best memories in the world\u201d?\n\nActually, he forgot that, too. \u201cI don\u2019t remember saying that,\u201d he once declared in a deposition.\n\nMaybe the president\u2019s mind isn\u2019t what it once was. Maybe he misrepresents past statements to get out of trouble. Either way, while the political world focuses on the lapses of 76-year-old Joe Biden, 73-year-old Trump acts as if his frontal lobe is made of Swiss cheese.\n\nTake just a few others from this year.\n\nHe said of the de-nuclearization of North Korea: \u201cI never said speed.\u201d But asked seven months earlier about the pace of North Korea\u2019s denuclearization, he replied: \u201cVery quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in Greenville, N.C., he said: \u201cI never said we were going to get, as an example with our vets, that we were going to get choice.\u201d But in October 2016, he promised: \u201cWe\u2019re going to give our veterans the right to see their doctor of their choice.\u201d\n\nHe said of his border wall: \u201cI never said, \u2018I\u2019m going to build a concrete.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to build a wall.\u2019 \u201d But 10 months earlier, he stood in front of a (concrete) wall prototype in San Diego and said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking very much at the wall with some see-through capability . . . and then solid concrete on top, or steel and concrete on top.\u201d\n\nHe said of his oft-repeated claim that Mexico would pay for the wall: \u201cObviously, I never said this and I never meant they\u2019re going to write out a check.\u201d\n\nBut in 2016, Trump proposed to stop some immigrants\u2019 wire transfers to Mexico unless \u201cthe Mexican government will contribute the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall.\u201d\n\nThe misfires, like Biden\u2019s, are not necessarily a new phenomenon. In 2016, Politifact found Trump claiming he never said what he actually had said about wind farms, Jon Stewart, calling John McCain a \u201closer,\u201d calling women animals, Marco Rubio, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Megyn Kelly, Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz\u2019s wife, Lee Harvey Oswald, David Duke, Bill Kristol, violent supporters, nuking the Islamic State, arming Japan with nukes, guns and those with disabilities.\n\nBut the lapses have become more\n\nserious.\n\nOf Obamacare, he said, \u201cI never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days. I have a long time.\u201d Actually, he said, \u201cwe have to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 so important.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that \u201cI never said Russia did not meddle in the election.\u201d But, standing at Vladimir Putin\u2019s side, he famously said: \u201cPresident Putin says it\u2019s not Russia. I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201d\n\nAnd now he \u201cnever met\u201d Roberts? Then who was that talking with her in Trump Tower on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Dec. 5, 1999?\n\nTwenty years is too long ago? How about 10 hours?\n\nAt 5:15 a.m. Monday, Trump tweeted that Iran stuck to \u201ca very big lie\u201d about a previous attack. \u201cNow they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d His meaning was unmistakable. But when a reporter asked him that afternoon to clarify why he thinks \u201cIran is responsible for the attack,\u201d Trump replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s deceit or memory malfunction, the consequence is the same: Friends and foes alike know that the president\u2019s word is not to be taken seriously.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The president\u2019s word is not to be taken seriously.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
