Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) are expected to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s (I-VT) 2020 presidential campaign over the weekend, according to reports.\n\nNew: Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will also endorse Sanders, according to source. AOC will, as @daveweigel and @WaPoSean first reported, will do the same on Saturday in NYC. \u2014 Greg Krieg (@GregJKrieg) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post stated Tuesday that Ocasio-Cortez is expected to announce her support for Sanders\u2019s White House bid alongside the senator on Saturday at his first rally since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to Saturday,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez spokesperson Corbin Trent teased in a statement.\n\nDuring tonight\u2019s CNN-New York Times\u2019 Democrat presidential debate, Sanders teased that he would have a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at his \u201cBernie\u2019s back\u201d rally in Queens, New York.\n\n\u201cThe endorsement could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer,\u201d notes the Post.\n\nOcasio-Cortez worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nThe development comes after Sanders said that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack.\n\nThe Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health concerns would force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign, in the short term, at least.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart.\n\n\u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cPeople should think that according to the doctors I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d\n\nThe 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack.\n\nSanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Far-left freshman congresswomen Reps.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) are expected to endorse Sen.
