And what better way to show that spirit than bringing a collection to New York inspired by the American artist Judy Chicago.\n\nDelafontaine told The Associated Press she drew inspiration from the feminist artist known most widely for her art installation \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d currently located in the Brooklyn Museum. Chicago also played with smoke, photographing colorful billows in the desert and other locations.\n\nIt was those photos that spoke to Delafontaine.\n\n\u201cI start with an artist that is Judy Chicago and her color explosion in the desert and I really wanted to have this explosion in the city,\u201d she said.\n\nModels in muted orange, petal pink, lavender and burgundy walked Saturday alongside a pool of water at Lincoln Center.\n\n\u201cI was really involved with this location that is super urban, very graphic,\u201d said Delafontaine of the pool with the Reclining Figure statue resting in the center. \u201cAnd I wanted to mix this location with very feminine and fluid dresses with color.\u201d\n\nWhile flowing skirts and dresses did make for fluid silhouettes, belts accentuating waistlines, leather mini-shorts, slits in skirts and transparent materials kept the looks modern and chic.\n\nSkirts, dresses and shorts were paired with shoes that went to mid-calf, either a lacing gladiator sandal or sneaker boots adorned with the signature Longchamp horse.\n\nAnd while the ready-to-wear collection certainly stood on its own, that doesn\u2019t mean that Longchamp forgot the product that started it all: Its handbags. From tiny coin purses clutched by the handle to shoulder bags with intricate designs and leather tassels, that original craft wasn\u2019t neglected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about creativity,\u201d said Delafontaine. \u201cIt\u2019s true that doing the bags is a creative exercise, of course. Ready-to-wear is another world because it\u2019s on the body, but I think it\u2019s all about telling a story, playing with the color, with the material.\u201d\n\nWalking in the show was model Kaia Gerber, daughter of Cindy Crawford. Kendall Jenner, Kate and Lila Moss, Julianne Moore and Linda Cardellini sat front row.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Longchamp doesn't want to be remembered as exclusively French.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ragan Clark"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/fashion_longchamp_97099_c0-177-4240-2649_s1770x1032.jpg?294b0492ec19c0d483fedae32156347e6012d96e", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
