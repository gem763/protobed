No, I think this whole situation has a far simpler explanation: President Trump leads one of the most virulently anti-immigrant administrations since 1954, when \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d resulted in the deportation of one million Mexicans. In its efforts to reduce immigration levels and reverse the nation\u2019s increasingly diverse demographic trends, the Trump administration is targeting even those migrants who are suffering life-threatening illnesses.\n\nI asked Jonathan what he would say to those who wanted to deport him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me,\u201d was his response.\n\nNothing is more compelling and moving than a child fighting for his own life.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jorge Ramos", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Contributors Trump-Immigration-Uscis.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
