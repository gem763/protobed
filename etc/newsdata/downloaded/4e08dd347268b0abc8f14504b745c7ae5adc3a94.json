Classes at UCLA were also canceled.\n\nThe flames roared up a steep hillside near the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles' Brentwood section illustrated the danger the state faces as high winds batter both ends of California and threaten to turn any spark into a devastating inferno.\n\nNo deaths from either blaze were reported, but a firefighter was seriously injured in the fire in Sonoma County wine country.\n\nSome 2.2 million people lacked electricity after California's biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, shut it off over the weekend in the northern part of the state to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes during windy weather. More deliberate blackouts are possible in the coming days because another round of strong winds is expected.\n\nKathy Griffin tweeted terrifying footage of the fire approaching her mansion in Los Angeles\n\nPosting the tweet, she said: 'No, I'm not one of those a-holes stopping on the side of the freeway to get this video. Took it from my driveway'\n\nA firefighter tries to hose down flames as a home burns in the Getty fire area along Tigertail Road\n\nA man walks past a home being destroyed by the Getty fire in Los Angeles\n\nThe company, which was driven into bankruptcy after its equipment ignited several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted Monday that despite the outages, its power lines may have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPG&E also has said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Sonoma County fire.\n\nThat blaze, which broke out last week amid the vineyards and wineries north of San Francisco, doubled in a day to at least 103 square miles (267 square kilometers), destroying 96 buildings, including at least 40 homes, and threatening 80,000 more structures, authorities said.\n\nAbout 156,000 people were under evacuation orders because of the fire, mostly from the city of Santa Rosa.\n\nThe flames didn't discriminate. In wine country, farmworkers who toil in the vineyards were among those displaced. In Los Angeles, Kathy Griffin, LeBron James and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger were driven from their homes.\n\nKathy Griffin tweeted a video of the flames fast approaching her home. She tweeted: 'No, I'm not one of those a-holes stopping on the side of the freeway to get this video. Took it from my driveway. Endless thanks @LAFD @LAPDHQ and all first responders. They are tireless heroes!#GettyFire'\n\nLos Angeles Lakers star LeBron James revealed his family had to evacuate their house in the middle of the night, saying the fires were 'no joke'.\n\nFirefighters pull hoses and spray flames at they try to save a home in Pacific Palisades\n\nFirefighters try to dampen the Getty fire as it climbs a hillside on Mandeville Canyon\n\n'Man these LA (fires) are no joke,' the Los Angeles Lakers star tweeted, using an emoji for the word 'fires.' ''Crazy night.'\n\nThe Hollywood premiere of Schwarzenegger's 'Terminator: Dark Fate' was canceled Monday night.\n\nOthers who own homes in the evacuation zone include Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat running for president, who was not home at the time; Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger; and rapper and producer Dr. Dre.\n\nAnxious residents made their way down steep hillsides in the middle of the night in Range Rovers, Teslas and Maseratis. They left behind homes decorated for Halloween - skeletons hanging from homes, goblins sitting on front steps, cobwebs draped over bushes - as a plume of smoke glowed like a giant pumpkin.\n\nDavid Boyle, 78, awoke at 3 a.m. to his doorbell ringing and police officers pounding on the front door. They warned him the wildfire was advancing toward his house near the Getty complex.\n\n'They said, 'You need to evacuate.' I'm like, 'When?' They said, 'Now,'' Doyle said.\n\nHe grabbed dog food and his wife's jewelry and hustled his dogs out the door. They went to a recreation center.\n\n'It's a fact of life when you live in this area,' he said. 'Every place has some problem with disasters. People talk about earthquakes here, but I don't think it's as bad as hurricane season.'\n\nNatalie Rodriguez, a nursing student at Mount Saint Mary's University in Los Angeles, told ABC News she woke up to the smell of smoke just before 2am.\n\n'Even inside the dorms it was very smoky and it was hard to breathe,' Rodriguez told ABC News. 'You could feel the heat from the flames that were so close to us on the other side of the mountain.'\n\nShe said she and her roommates fled campus in the middle of the night.\n\nNearby, UCLA has canceled its classes.\n\nSmoke and flames crawl down a hill overlooking the 405 Freeway in West Los Angeles\n\nTens of thousands of people were ordered to clear out as the fire spread to more than 600 acres and burned at least five homes, authorities said.\n\nThe evacuation area extended west into Pacific Palisades, encompassing some of the most exclusive real estate in California, where celebrities and wealthy professionals live in estates nestled in canyons or on ridgetop retreats that cost tens of millions of dollars but are surrounded by tinder-dry vegetation.\n\nHours after homes had burned, some of the 1,000-plus firefighters battling the flames were hosing down smoldering ruins. Others attacked flare-ups in the brush-covered wilderness around neighborhoods.\n\nHelicopters beat the air, and the buzz of chain saws echoed from the canyons. Hills were charred black, and in some places, white ash was all that remained.\n\nA firefighters gets in position to hose down flames as a home burns in the Getty fire area along Tigertail Road\n\nFlames consume a home as the Kincade Fire tears through the Jimtown community of Sonoma County\n\nWind whips embers from a tree as the Kincade Fire burns in unincorporated Sonoma County\n\nThe fire shut down southbound lanes of Interstate 405, a major commuting corridor and the route to Los Angeles International Airport from the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe Getty, with its collection of priceless art, was not threatened, fire officials said. The museum gave assurances that its artworks are protected by state-of-the-art technology.\n\nBut Mount St. Mary's University evacuated 450 students from its nearby campus. And the University of California, Los Angeles, canceled classes - not because of any direct threat from the flames but because of disruptions caused by the fire.\n\nFlames from the Kincade Fire consume a car in the Jimtown community of unincorporated Sonoma County\n\nA firefighter drags a hose closer to battle a grass fire on East Cypress Road in Knightsen\n\nFlames from the Kincade Fire consume a home and car in the Jimtown community of unincorporated Sonoma County\n\nSimilarly in Northern California, some 40 school districts in Sonoma County canceled classes, as did the University of California, Berkeley, which had no power because of the outages.\n\nWith no rain and more wind in the forecast, the coming days could be grim.\n\n'This is when we have the most potential for large and damaging fires,' said Thom Porter, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 'All of California is in play right now.'\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the weekend.\n\nThe biggest evacuation was in Sonoma County, where some people who packed up and fled had done so two years ago, when devastating wildfires swept through the region, killing 44 people.\n\nAt an evacuation center at Napa Valley College, 15-year-old Francisco Alvarado said he, two younger brothers and his parents decided to leave their Calistoga home ahead of evacuation orders. Two years ago, the family had to flee in the middle of the night.\n\n'I'm pretty mad that we have to keep evacuating,' he said. 'I just want to be home. I'm trying to leave here tomorrow. I want to sleep in my bed.'\n\nA resident covers his face as he is evacuated as a wildfire approaches in Santa Clarita\n\nFirefighters from San Matteo work to extinguish flames from the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County\n\nSusi Weaver, the manger for the Hawkeye Ranch in the Mayacamas Mountains above Geyserville, Calif., sprays down the dry brush as the the Kincade Fire delivers firebrands across the property\n\nA car passes burning trees on Geysers Road as the Kincade Fire tears through unincorporated Sonoma County\n\nSan Francisco skyline is photographed from Grizzly Peak Boulevard in Oakland", "description": "A wildfire on Los Angeles' wealthy west side destroyed several homes and forced thousands to flee early Monday, while a blaze in Northern doubled in size.", "authors": ["Associated Press And Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/01/20306602-0-image-a-19_1572311781273.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
