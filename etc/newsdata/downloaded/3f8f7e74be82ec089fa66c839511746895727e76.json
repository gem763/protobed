Rajesh Kalia, an Indian army spokesman, said three Indian civilians were also injured in the Pakistani firing. Kalia called it an \u201cunprovoked\u201d violation of a 2003 cease-fire accord between India and Pakistan.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military later said in a statement that \u201cunprovoked cease-fire violations\u201d by Indian troops killed three civilians and one soldier and wounded another five civilians and two troops across the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.\n\nThe statement said Indian troops targeted civilians in Jura, Shahkot and Nousehri sectors. It said Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire on Indian soldiers.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have a long history of bitter relations over Kashmir, which is divided between the rivals but claimed by both in its entirety. The renewed fighting comes amid an ongoing lockdown in Kashmir that was put in place after India stripped the region of its semi-autonomy in early August.\n\nSince then, soldiers from the two nations have regularly engaged in cross-border shelling and firing along their de facto frontier in Kashmir, where rebel groups are fighting for the territory to be united either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting the hostilities in violation of the 2003 accord.\n\nIndia accuses Pakistan of arming and training anti-India rebels and also helping them by providing gunfire as cover for incursions into the Indian side. Pakistan denies this, saying it offers only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiris who oppose Indian rule.\n\nRebels have been fighting Indian rule since 1989. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the armed uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.\n\nOn Aug. 5, India\u2019s Hindu nationalist-led government stripped Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status and imposed a strict crackdown, sending in tens of thousands more additional troops to the region, which is already one of the highest militarized zones in the world. India has arrested thousands of activists and separatist leaders in the days leading up to and after the revoking of Kashmir\u2019s special status.\n\nMore than two months later, the region remains under a communications blockade. Authorities have restored landline and some cellphone services, but the internet remains suspended.\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Zarar Khan in Islamabad contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pakistani and Indian soldiers traded fire in disputed Kashmir on Sunday, killing at least seven people on both sides, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aijaz Hussain"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/india_kashmir_gunbattle_89675_c0-0-2252-1313_s1200x700.jpg?138fc8a59be5cacfbe07b144984f083abfe88d11", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
