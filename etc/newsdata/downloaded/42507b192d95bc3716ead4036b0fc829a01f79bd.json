(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nColumnist\n\nYou may have seen the news: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had the temerity to get a haircut in Washington for which she paid what seems like a relatively normal price for a D.C. mid-range salon. This was, indeed, a shameful act! She should have considered her options and chosen a haircut at a price point that would not lead us to cry foul! Certainly the amount she paid \u2014 $80 for the haircut, $160 for low-lights \u2014 is not the only amount one might pay. There are many good, cheaper options, as you will see!\n\n$0 \u2014 Use a sword to chop off your own hair\n\nPros: Costs nothing!\n\nCons: If you don\u2019t already own a sword, purchasing one can be expensive; works best if you are a cartoon character; resulting cut may be uneven.\n\n$0 \u2014 Never cut hair, wear in long braid\n\nPros: Never have to pay for haircut.\n\nCons: Adventitious princes may attempt to climb hair.\n\n$0 \u2014 Never cut hair, make no effort to maintain hair\n\nPros: People cannot be upset at the price you pay for haircut or maintenance \u2026\n\nCons: \u2026 but will instead be mad at you for \u201cshowing disrespect\u201d to your office.\n\n$0 \u2014 Jealous friend sneaks up to you in the night and gives you a free bob!\n\nPros: Free, and you get to live in an F. Scott Fitzgerald story.\n\nCons: Have to spend years cultivating enemy-ship with Bernice; must go on record as opposing bobs.\n\n[Alexandra Petri hosts a live chat with readers every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Submit questions here.]\n\n-$25 \u2014 The Jo March (Convince a willing barber to buy your hair so as to help your family, as your father is away at the war.)\n\nPros: THEY PAY YOU! Compared to this, Jeff Sessions\u2019s regular $20 haircut is downright WASTEFUL.\n\nCons: ALAS, YOUR ONE BEAUTY! YOUR CHESTNUT MANE! A WOMAN\u2019S CROWNING GLORY!\n\n-\u20a310 (francs) \u2014 The Fantine\n\nPros: Pays a debt; TEN FRANCS MAY SAVE YOUR POOR COSETTE!\n\nCons: Slippery slope to tooth-selling.\n\n$20 \u2014 Go to the Capitol Hill barber\n\nPros: The same Jeff Sessions paid! No one can be upset at such frugality!\n\nCons: You will get same haircut as Jeff Sessions, and everyone will be upset.\n\n$300+ \u2014 A normal haircut\n\nPros: Will probably look good?\n\nCons: Your beauty, augmented by the haircut, will be too powerful and will enrage people!\n\nDon\u2019t worry. There does exist, in the middle of this range, some number of dollars you can pay for a decent haircut that will not enrage people. This is not simply the consequence of being a woman in public, of leaving people enraged because you look good or enraged because you have not made what they deem a sufficient effort to look good. It\u2019s fine!\n\nRead more from Alexandra Petri:\n\nHow to do workplace discrimination right\n\nYou can\u2019t impeach the president!
