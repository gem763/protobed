This twist followed an evening board meeting in which he was expected to be sacked anyway.\n\nSavers who invested when the fund was at its peak in June 2017 have already seen 40 per cent wiped off their nest eggs, meaning a \u00a310,000 investment would now be worth about \u00a36,000. They were warned last night they will get significantly less as the costs of winding up the fund and selling its assets are deducted.\n\nAs savers who trusted Mr Woodford face an agonising wait to see what is left, MPs hit out at the veteran fund manager for raking in \u00a363million from his doomed investment empire over the past four years despite his poor performance.\n\nThere was also condemnation for the \u00a38.8million in fees that his Oxford-based firm, Woodford Investment Management, has taken from helpless investors in just over four months since banning withdrawals from Equity Income.\n\n'I\u2019m glad he\u2019s been sacked but it should have happened sooner' Richard Batchelor has little confidence he will get much of his \u00a32,000 investment back and has accused fund manager Neil Woodford of being \u2018arrogant and unsympathetic\u2019. The former printing company owner, 66, and his wife Kitrina, 67, had about \u00a3300,000 in a personal retirement plan, and about \u00a32,000 of this was invested in Equity Income in 2010, on the recommendation of his then-financial adviser. Mr Batchelor, who lives in Ferndown, Dorset, welcomed the news Mr Woodford had been sacked as fund manager. The father-of-two said: \u2018Neil Woodford has been very arrogant and unsympathetic throughout this whole process. I am glad he has been sacked but it should have happened a lot sooner. \u2018He\u2019s lost all credibility. I would never again put money into anything which has even been associated with Neil Woodford.\u2019 Gabriel Herbert, a financial services worker, had around \u00a318,000 invested in Equity Income, but withdrew \u00a38,000 on the advice of colleagues shortly before it was suspended in June. Miss Herbert, 64, from London, said: \u2018This was a fund where ordinary people invested money. I invested as soon as it opened, mainly because Hargreaves Lansdown was promoting it so much and hailing Woodford as a star investor. It should have been suspended and wound up before it lost as much money as it did.\u2019\n\nCampaigners said his fall from grace \u2013 after a hugely successful career as a stock-picker at US giant Invesco \u2013 has highlighted the \u2018wildly excessive fees\u2019 charged by supposedly \u2018superstar\u2019 fund managers.\n\nIn a statement last night, Mr Woodford, whose main home is a \u00a313.7million mansion in Gloucestershire, said: \u2018We have taken the highly painful decision to close Woodford Investment Management. I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management.\u2019\n\nLast night, Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, said the huge fees generated by Mr Woodford\u2019s company \u2018add insult to injury\u2019 for savers and described the 59-year-old\u2019s downfall as a \u2018wake up call for regulators\u2019 to provide better protection for investors.\n\nEquity Income savers face waiting up to a year to get back what is left of their investments as the fund is wound down and all its assets in various companies are sold off.\n\nAt its peak the fund was worth \u00a310.2billion, which has now fallen to around \u00a33billion. It has lost around \u00a3700million since the lock-in period was imposed to give Mr Woodford enough time to dispose of shares he had bought in difficult-to-sell assets, such as obscure companies which are not listed on the stock exchange.\n\nFund supervisor Link Fund Solutions said last night the assets would be sold by American investment firms Blackrock and Park Hill, and insisted this would lead to a \u2018better outcome for investors\u2019 than reopening the fund and risking a flood of demands for repayment.\n\nMr Woodford, once described as the \u2018man who can\u2019t stop making money\u2019, remained defiant last night, saying: \u2018This was Link\u2019s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of Woodford Equity Income fund investors.\u2019\n\nBut in a final insult, investors were told they would not be refunded the \u00a38.8million in fees that have been deducted since the fund was frozen in June.\n\nLast night MPs urged Mr Woodford to hand back some of the millions he has earned to his investors.\n\nFrank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: \u2018It would be a good move to put this money back into the fund, so that those who invested in good faith will suffer smaller cuts to their savings.\u2019\n\nLuke Hildyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre think-tank, said: \u2018The asset management industry charges wildly excessive fees to savers and pension funds in order to pay supposed superstar managers.\u2019\n\nYesterday Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs on the Treasury committee the Woodford saga showed the need for reforms to protect investors.\n\nAn investigation has been launched by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, into the events leading to Equity Income\u2019s suspension.\n\nRUTH SUNDERLAND on the arrogance of City outside Neil Woodford who lost his golden touch and then saw his financial empire turn to rubble\n\nNeil Woodford, who last night suffered the ultimate humiliation of seeing his financial empire collapse, was once the most acclaimed investment guru in Britain with a Pied Piper following among small investors.\n\nBut, as anyone who has met him will testify, the downfall of the 59-year-old is due to fatal flaws in his character. Greed, naturally \u2013 it comes with the territory \u2013 but above all arrogance.\n\nEven now, Woodford\u2019s self-belief is so unshakeable he says he cannot accept the decision to close down his flagship fund. Unbelievable though it may seem, he still believes he could have traded his way out of trouble.\n\nThe shaven-headed money man has the build of a scrum half and the dress sense of a Mondeo-driving golf-club habitue, favouring chinos and jumpers rather than a suit. Woodford is also an enthusiastic rider\n\nThis is a man who has such faith in his own abilities he thinks that when his investments go down, it means the market, not him, is wrong.\n\nIt is a vertiginous fall for a man who seemed to have a genius for making money.\n\nHis followers were attracted by an impeccable track record: in his previous job, he helped small investors turn a typical \u00a310,000 investment into a stupendous \u00a3230,000 over 20 years.\n\nSo it is not surprising thousands entrusted him with their life savings when he set up his own firm, Woodford Investment Management, which is now being wound down.\n\nThose savers stand to lose most of their money and Woodford is a City pariah whose name goes into the annals of shame along with the likes of Sir Philip Green and Fred Goodwin.\n\nThe shaven-headed money man has the build of a scrum half and the dress sense of a Mondeo-driving golf-club habitue, favouring chinos and jumpers rather than a suit.\n\nUnlike his disillusioned investors, he can console himself with the many millions he has extracted along the way.\n\nHe lives with his blonde wife Madelaine and their two children in a huge farm in the Cotswolds, near Highgrove House, the country home of the Prince of Wales.\n\nHe lives with his blonde wife Madelaine and their two children in a huge farm in the Cotswolds, near Highgrove House, the country home of the Prince of Wales. The Woodfords also have a second luxury home on the Devon coast (pictured centre)\n\nFrom there, he commuted to his office on an industrial estate outside Oxford by Porsche \u2013 or one of his other cars which also include an Audi \u2013 at the crack of dawn each morning.\n\nEnviably, Chez Woodford boasts a huge equestrian complex for their horses: his hobby is amateur three-day eventing.His enthusiasm for all things horsey was acquired when he took up with Madelaine, 47, his former secretary who became the second Mrs Woodford. He and his first wife, Jo, did not have children.\n\nThe Woodfords also have a second luxury home on the Devon coast.\n\nThe couple paid cash for the \u00a36.35million six-bedroom property two years ago.\n\nQuite a lifestyle for a man who has always felt himself to be an outsider among the Eton and Oxbridge-educated fund management types who infest the City. He is a grammar school boy from Berkshire from a relatively modest background, who studied agricultural economics at Exeter University.\n\nHis father Victor printed postcards for a living.\n\nIn happier times, that did not prevent Woodford from being what seemed like a stock-picking genius.\n\nHe spent most of his career at fund giant Invesco, where his stellar track record meant that when he left in 2014 to set up his own firm, he raised \u00a31.7billion in just a fortnight.\n\nThose close to him say the move to shut down his main fund came as something of a surprise, which is an indication, perhaps of wilful blindness to the level of anger aimed at him.\n\nYet the last time I saw Woodford, he claimed that when he looks at himself in the mirror in the morning he doesn\u2019t see an investment legend, but all his human frailties.\n\nWith his business and his reputation in ruins, he certainly has a lot to reflect upon today.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of investors are facing huge losses after the investment empire run by disgraced City fund manager Neil Woodford crumbled to dust last night.", "authors": ["James Salmon", "Lucy White", "Fiona Parker For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760008-0-image-a-23_1571173610773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
