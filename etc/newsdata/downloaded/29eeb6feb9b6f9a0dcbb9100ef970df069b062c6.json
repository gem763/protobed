It's also the source of some confusion, between young people who understand it's an expression of mirth, and some older people who think they're replying to bad news with \"Lots of Love.\"\n\nGretchen McCulloch's book Because Internet explores the generational differences in online speak. (Yvon Huynh/Riverhead Books)\n\nInternet-speak between generations\n\nAuthor Gretchen McCulloch has examined those generational differences in her book Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language.\n\nShe explained that while Pearson may have created LOL to express his real-world laughter, within about 15 years it had come to mean something else.\n\n\"It became \u2014 instead of being 'I am literally laughing out loud' \u2014 sort of aspirational laughter,\" said the Montreal-based linguist.\n\n\"I acknowledge this is funny. Maybe I wish I was laughing out loud, or I would be laughing out loud but I'm not actually doing so.\"\n\nIt became \u2014 instead of being 'I am literally laughing out loud' \u2014 sort of aspirational laughter. - Gretchen McCulloch\n\nIn more recent years, younger users have gone a step further, and used it as \"a marker of irony or softening.\"\n\n\"So, if you say to someone, 'I hate you LOL.' That doesn't mean 'I hate you, and I'm laughing about it.' That means 'I'm joking about hating you.'\"\n\nShe added that when speaking out loud, older people often say each individual letter \u2014 L-O-L \u2014 and write it in capitals. By contrast, younger people said it as a word \u2014 lol \u2014 and write it in lowercase.\n\nBut despite the confusion that can arise from differing interpretations of internet-speak, McCulloch insists that \"it's OK for different people to talk differently.\"\n\n\"Just because I'm saying: 'Oh younger people tend to do,' that doesn't mean if you're an older person, you have to adopt that,\" she said.\n\nShe hopes her book can encourage people to have those conversations about online language.\n\n\"It can be useful to have these meta-conversations about what makes sense to you,\" she said.\n\n\"Is this thing that you're saying \u2014 am I interpreting it the way you're intending it?\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
