The eruptions are typically rather tame. Every once in a while, however, the same types of eruptions turn violent and explosive.\n\nNew research suggests rapid magma crystallization is responsible for the dark side of basaltic eruptions.\n\nHazardous basaltic eruptions are known as Plinian eruptions, named for Pliny the Elder, the Ancient Roman writer who first described the damage caused by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nTo better understand why these mostly gentle eruptions turn deadly, scientists conducted a combination of in situ and ex situ experiments \u2014 both in the field and in the lab. They also ran numerical models and analyzed basaltic magma samples from the highly explosive 1886 Tarawera eruption in New Zealand.\n\nWhen magma is rapidly expelled from a volcano, it cools rapidly and triggers crystallization. Their analysis showed this process increases the magma\u2019s viscosity and causes rapid fragmentation, enhancing the magma\u2019s explosiveness.\n\n\u201cWe found that, under certain conditions consistent with highly explosive eruptions, crystallization can occur within a couple of minutes during magma ascent,\u201d Fabio Arzilli, researcher at the University of Manchester in England, said in a news release.\n\nPreviously, scientists argued the process of magma crystallization was too slow to account for explosive basaltic eruptions, but the latest research \u2014 published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience \u2014 showed that under right temperatures and chemical conditions, the process can occur surprisingly fast.\n\n\u201cOur results imply that all basaltic systems on Earth have the potential to produce powerful explosive eruptions,\u201d Arzilli said. \u201cThis has important implications for the volcanic hazard and risk, on not only the regional, but also the global scale.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 Most volcanic eruptions are of the basaltic variety.
