(April 16, 2019)\u2014The Atlantic is beginning production on an ambitious narrative podcast examining Hurricane Katrina, reported and hosted by staff writer Vann R. Newkirk II, under the leadership of executive producer Katherine Wells. The podcast will be a limited-run series and will launch in the fall.\n\n\u201cKatherine is a tremendously talented producer and editor, with a deep understanding of audio storytelling,\u201d said executive editor Adrienne LaFrance. \u201cSo it makes great sense to pair Katherine with a reporter like Vann, who runs toward the biggest and most complex stories, and has a natural instinct for excavating forgotten histories as a way to understand what lies ahead.\u201d\n\nThe podcast will examine humanity\u2019s changing relationship to nature through the lens of Hurricane Katrina, as one of the most catastrophic\u2014and misunderstood\u2014events in recent American history. Newkirk, Wells, and their production team will revisit the main players, reassess the pivotal moments, and relive the histories of lost communities across the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u201cThis podcast brings the power of our longform journalism to audio, and builds on The Atlantic\u2019s long record of contextualizing and clarifying our nation\u2019s most important events,\u201d said Wells.", "description": "Ambitious audio series marks The Atlantic\u2019s first longform narrative podcast.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/a/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png"}
