Then their conversation neared its end.\n\n\"You want this closed?\" Farrow asked about Lauer's office door.\n\n\"I've got it,\" Lauer answered.\n\nFarrow saw Lauer pushing a button on his desk, which swung the door shut.\n\nLast week, Lauer denied he had a button that \"could lock the door from the inside.\" He also denied he raped an NBC employee, an allegation included in Farrow's book.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Despite numerous erroneous reports in the past, there was not a button in my office that could lock the door from the inside. There was no such locking mechanism. It didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cIt would have been impossible to confine anyone in my office, for any purpose, and I have never attempted to make anyone feel as if they were confined in my office. I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex.
