As he laid out Facebook\u2019s commitment to free expression, he also emphasized that those values were already coming under threat from China.\n\n\u201cIf another nation\u2019s platform sets the rules,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201cour nation\u2019s discourse could be defined by a completely different set of values.\u201d\n\nA full transcript of the speech is available here.\n\nConcerns about Chinese censorship have come to a head amid the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. A number of US companies have attempted to stifle internal shows of support for those protests in deference to Chinese partners, including the NBA and Blizzard, which banned a professional Hearthstone player for comments made in a post-game interview.\n\nDemocrats have stepped up criticism of Facebook in recent months, most notably from Democratic front-runner Elizabeth Warren. In response, Zuckerberg has made a number of apparent overtures to conservative leaders, including private dinners with right-wing pundits like Tucker Carlson and Hugh Hewitt.\n\nBut while the partisan landscape has grown more fraught for Facebook, Zuckerberg presented the rise of Chinese internet companies as a broader national threat to American free expression:\n\nA decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese. We\u2019re beginning to see this in social media too. While our services like WhatsApp are used by protestors and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app, mentions of these same protests are censored, even here in the US. Is that the internet that we want?\n\nZuckerberg was likely referring to guidelines presented by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, which were obtained by The Guardian last week. As written, the guidelines effectively ban criticism of the Chinese government, and forbid \u201cdemonisation or distortion of local or other countries\u2019 history such as May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Cambodian genocide, Tiananmen Square incidents.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, TikTok said that the guidelines published by The Guardian were outdated, and emphasized that US moderation decisions are made by a US-based team and are not influenced by foreign government.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,\u201d a TikTok representative said. \u201cTo be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content.\u201d\n\nThe specter of a Chinese competitor to Facebook has been raised in the past to disarm regulators, most recently when seeking support for the proposed Libra cryptocurrency. But Zuckerberg\u2019s comments are likely to heighten the conflict between Facebook and its Chinese competitors, and put the ongoing conflict at the center of future debates over moderation policy.\n\n\u201cAre we going to continue fighting to give more people a voice to be heard,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Georgetown today, \u201cor are we going to pull back from free expression?\u201d\n\n3:08PM ET: Updated with statement from TikTok.", "description": "In a speech at Georgetown University on October 17th, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg drew a sharp contrast with Chinese companies like TikTok owner ByteDance.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1s2MYUZgWfbZFXAslSPtSYd_kkE=/0x0:2880x1508/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19296493/Screen_Shot_2019_10_17_at_1.43.25_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
