A demonstration was held in the same location last Thursday.\n\nProtesters, who were predominantly middle-age and elderly, chanted \u201cMoon Resign!\u201d and \u201cArrest Cho Kuk!\u201d as they waved signs and Korean flags. Many were also quick to criticize Moon as a North Korean sympathizer.\n\n\u201cWe want Moon Jae-in out,\u201d said protester Scott Chang, 68. \u201cHe\u2019s a liar and we can\u2019t trust him.\u201d\n\nThe scandal surrounding Cho Kuk has tarnished Moon, who won the presidency in 2017 with an image built on transparency in the wake of former President Park Geun-hye\u2019s impeachment on corruption charges.\n\nMoon\u2019s approval rating fell this week to 44.4 percent, according to a survey released on Monday by pollster Realmeter. The approval number was down 2.9 points from the week before and represents Moon\u2019s lowest point since his inauguration.\n\nMoon addressed the deepening political divide for the first time Monday, saying it was \u201cnot desirable,\u201d and that the political rift is moving beyond \u201cproductive discussions.\u201d\n\nHe also defended the need to reform South Korean prosecution as \u201curgent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite a wide variety of opinions, the reform of the prosecution is urgent, and its reform is the will of the people,\u201d Moon said.\n\nCho Kuk laid out a sweeping plan for reform of the prosecutor\u2019s office on Tuesday, aiming to cut down on its power for special investigations and adopt measures for human rights protections. Critics have long claimed that prosecutors wield too much discretion and that their investigations have been politically motivated.\n\nHowever, his political opponents question Cho\u2019s fitness for the office as allegations swirl around him.\n\n\u201cHow can [Cho] be in charge of the justice ministry when he has violated the rules?\u201d Jiyeon Ihn, chief spokeswoman for conservative political party Our Republican Party, told UPI. \u201cMoon Jae-in needs to step down and Cho should be arrested and detained.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean prosecutors have launched an investigation over questionable investments in a private equity fund tied to Cho\u2019s family while he was presidential secretary, following the arrest of a Cho relative suspected of operating the fund.\n\nCho and his wife have also been accused of forging documents in order to help their daughter gain admission to medical school. The justice minister\u2019s home was raided by prosecutors last month and Cho\u2019s wife has been summoned for questioning three times.\n\nThe minister denies all the allegations.\n\nCounter-protests in support of Moon and Cho and calling for prosecutorial reform have also been held. A candlelight demonstration took place on Saturday near the Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office in southern Seoul and another is planned for this weekend.", "description": "SEOUL, Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Conservative groups called Wednesday for the arrest of embattled South Korean Justice Minister Cho Kuk and the resignation of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
