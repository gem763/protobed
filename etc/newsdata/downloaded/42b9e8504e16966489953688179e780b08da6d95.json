Larry Taylor\u2019s Senate Bill 3 advanced on a 7-3 vote. Democrat Eddie Lucio broke party ranks to vote for it; Kel Seliger was the lone Republican to vote against it.\n\nTaylor and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick rebuffed efforts by school districts and teacher unions to dilute or restrict SB 3, which would redirect some education funding to parents to use as they see fit and provide a tax credit for businesses that contribute to a scholarship fund to help pay for private school tuition.\n\nWith passage in the Senate virtually assured, Patrick and his allies appear ready to use school choice as a bargaining chip in end-of-session negotiations with the House.\n\nHouse Education Committee Chairman Dan Huberty said earlier this month that he opposes the Senate bill. He suggested it might not get a hearing.\n\nThe Kingwood Republican has filed a bill that would increase the basic allotment for all public schools and earmark more funding for students with dyslexia.\n\nThe Texas Charter Schools Association praised the measure for aiming \u201cto correct systemic failures in a dated finance scheme.\u201d\n\nA \u201cgrand bargain\u201d could be in the offing, said Allan Parker, president of the pro-school choice Justice Foundation.\n\n\u201cThere are people who want more money for schools, but only if there\u2019s something for parents \u2014 and that has to be school choice,\u201d Parker told Watchdog.org. \u201cThere\u2019s an unwillingness to spend more unless there\u2019s a consumer mechanism that allows students to seek a better alternative.\u201d\n\nParker said more than 1,000 low-performing schools across Texas point to the necessity of expanding choices.\n\n\u201cSimply inflating the bureaucracy isn\u2019t going to improve accountability,\u201d he asserted.\n\nMonty Exter, lobbyist for the Association of Texas Professional Educators, the state\u2019s largest teacher organization, told the Senate committee, \u201cThere are plenty of things you could do to help Texas education. Implementing a voucher program is not one of them.\u201d\n\nParker said rank-and-file teachers should support choice.\n\n\u201cSchool choice gets them out from under a bureaucracy where principals don\u2019t support them on discipline. Under SB 3, every school becomes a school of choice \u2013 for students and teachers,\u201d he said.\n\nKenric Ward reports for Texas Watchdog.
