The rate of tree-felling in the Democratic republic of Congo has doubled in the past five years.\n\nThe New York Declaration on Forests (NYDF) is a voluntary and a legally non-binding agreement to take action to halt global deforestation.\n\nIt was first endorsed at the United Nations Climate Summit in September 2014, and by October 2017 40 governments, 57 multi-national companies and 58 non-government organizations had endorsed the declaration.\n\nPolitical action\n\nDespite the bleak outlook on a global scale, the report did highlight the positive steps being made in Indonesia, which has long been associated with devastating deforestation.\n\nThe authors said political action was a contributing factor. The country's president has banned the development of peatlands and primary forests.\n\nHowever, researchers highlighted why the overall picture was so gloomy and why halting deforestation was so vital in the battle against climate change.\n\n\"Halting deforestation and restoring tropical forests, for example, could provide up to 30% of the mitigation required to help meet the Paris Agreement,\" explained Eszter Wainwright-Deri, forestry technical advisor at the Zoological Society of London.\n\n\"This cannot be achieved while zero-deforestation commitments continue to be dishonoured.\"\n\nThe WRI's Mr Hanson concluded: \"\"We are losing the battle but we should not give up hope. This report, among other things, gives a clarion call that we need to re-energise commitment, action and financing towards the NYDF.\"", "description": "A historic global agreement aimed at halting deforestation and curbing dangerous carbon dioxide emissions has failed, according to a report.", "authors": ["Mark Kinver", "Environment Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12738/production/_108767557_hi055976462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
