(Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013, is one of six members not in Schengen, alongside the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus.)\n\nThe zone\u2019s external borders cover 50,000 kilometres, according to the European Parliament.\n\nAlthough held up as a major part of the European ideal, Schengen was one of the first casualties of the migrant crisis and wave of terrorist attacks, with many members throwing up internal border checks and temporary security controls in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 most of which are still in place.\n\n\u201cSaving Schengen is a race against time and we are determined to win that race,\" Donald Tusk said at the height of the crisis, in 2016.\n\nBut with immigration still dominating politics, and the rise of populism, as well as the distraction of Brexit, many of the temporary measures have yet to be rolled back.\n\nHungary\u2019s Viktor Orban has made huge political capital out of his new razor-wire-topped border fence with Serbia and aggressive rhetoric about defending Europe from migrants.\n\nSix Schengen countries still apply internal border controls: France, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.\n\n\u201cThese controls are even in place at borders between Schengen members, such as France and Spain,\u201d notes Marco Stefan, a research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS).\n\nIn a report into the Schengen dysfunction published last year, MEPs concluded that many internal borders are still in place \u201cbecause we are paying the price of problems that are outside the scope of Schengen, such as asylum policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Schengen area is one of the greatest achievements of the European Union,\u201d wrote the lead author, Carlos Coelho, a Portuguese member of the EPP.\n\n\u201cNational governments made Schengen into the scapegoat for the failures of security policies. Yet, Schengen is not the problem, it is the solution. If Schengen perishes, the Europe of citizens that we have today will vanish.\u201d\n\nThe CEPS\u2019 Stefan said the grey area in Schengen\u2019s rules that allow members to bend the rules \u201cwill need to be looked at\u201d by the incoming European leadership.\n\n\u201cA major issue is the lack of a comprehensive evaluation mechanism for providing evidence of why a suspension of free movement is needed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still unresolved.\u201d\n\nFinal frontier\n\nBorder control is a major issue in Croatian membership of Schengen, not just because migrants continue to use the Balkans as a route towards western Europe, but because the former Yugoslav nation has 1,300 kilometres of border with non-EU countries.\n\nCandidate countries must meet the requirements for a common standard in four areas: airport border checks, visas, police cooperation, and personal data protection.\n\nZagreb has had to convince Brussels that it will be able to effectively manage the EU\u2019s external border, at precisely the time the frontier is under its greatest pressure since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nHumanitarian groups estimate there are at least 5,500 women, men and children in two Bosnian towns near the Croatian border, Bihac and Velika Kladusa, living in former factories without basic amenities. Bosnia cannot offer them adequate protection or living conditions, and many migrants see crossing into Croatia as their main aim.\n\n\u201cControl over the EU\u2019s external borders is the most demanding aspect of our preparations,\u201d the country\u2019s interior secretary, Terezija Gras, told Reuters on Tuesday. \u201cWe have already fully equipped our border with Serbia and now we\u2019re doing it on the border with Bosnia.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe have shown very clearly that we are up to the job, We have one of the strongest border police forces in Europe. We are capable of protecting what is not only the border of Croatia but also the EU. We have done a lot since the 2015 crisis.\u201d\n\nYet there are signs that Croatia\u2019s approach to controlling its borders has been too strong.\n\n\u201cThere are doubts regarding Croatia\u2019s capacity to effectively implement consistent border control given the wealth of evidence of authorities violating the rights of migrants trying to cross and this is something that needs to be looked at closely,\u201d said Marco Stefan of CEPS.\n\nIn 2018, there were instances of migrants being pushed back over the border into Bosnia, against EU conventions.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Amnesty International said European governments are not only \u201cturning a blind eye to vicious assaults by the Croatian police\u201d but also funding their activities as part of efforts to improve security.\n\n\u201cTo understand where the priorities of European governments lie, one only needs to follow the money,\u201d said Massimo Moratti, Director of Research for Amnesty International\u2019s Europe Office.\n\n\u201cTheir financial contribution towards humanitarian assistance is dwarfed by the funds they provide for border security which includes equipping Croatian border police and even paying their salaries.\u201d\n\nThere are also questions, Stefan says, over the training and deployment of thousands of extra Frontex border guards being recruited to boost Europe\u2019s defences.\n\n\u201cWhere will they be trained, and according to what standards?\u201d Stefan said.\n\nNeighbour disputes\n\nCroatia\u2019s accession has been further complicated by its territorial dispute with Slovenia over waters in the northern Adriatic Sea. Also formerly part of Yugoslavia but now a full member of the EU, Slovenia has previously threatened to veto Croatia\u2019s candidacy.\n\nIn 2009, the two countries agreed to rely on international arbitration to resolve their dispute over a sliver of land and sea border in the northern Adriatic.\n\nBut Croatia withdrew after media reported that separate talks had been held between the Slovenian arbitration judge and a Slovenian representative.\n\nEarlier this month, Miro Cerar, Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister, said Croatia must accept an arbitration decision if it is to avoid being vetoed - although there are signs that position has softened.\n\nSlovenia sees the timing of Croatia\u2019s technical approval as politically-motivated, coming as outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, an avowed expansionist, tries to secure his legacy.\n\nMarjan Sarec, Prime Minister of Slovenia, called the decision \u201cquestionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are somewhat concerned that this is done along political lines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that Juncker and [Croatian Prime Minister Andrej] Plenkovic are members of the same European [political] group.\u201d\n\nIt means Zagreb still has some hurdles to overcome before it can join Schengen. \"Croatia will need to continue working on the implementation of all ongoing actions, in particular, its management of the external borders,\" the European Commission said on Tuesday.\n\nAnother problematic area is Pelje\u0161ac, Croatia's southern isthmus pointing towards Montenegro. It can only be reached via the mainland by crossing through a narrow corridor of Bosnian territory that was designed to grant Bosnia sea access. The double-crossing is already the cause of long traffic delays during the summer, and there are fears that could worsen with tighter border checks.\n\nHowever, Croatia is expected to complete a vast bridge in 2021 that takes traffic over the Bosnian territory; the project has been delayed by Bosnian fears that it would impede big ships at its only open-sea access.\n\nCash benefits\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos hailed Croatia\u2019s completion of testing on Tuesday as a step that would \u201ccontribute to further strengthening the Schengen area\u201d as well as promoting the ideal of inclusiveness.\n\nBut there are more tangible benefits for the EU\u2019s beacon in the Balkans, where tourism accounts for almost 20% of GDP.\n\nSchengen entry would remove border controls for the 11.6 million tourists (75% of total foreign visitors) annually to Croatia from Schengen-area countries, according to analysts IHS Markit.\n\nIt would also boost tourism from visitors to Europe, who are granted a visa valid for Schengen countries, by adding Croatia to their permitted itineraries.\n\nShipping, which accounts for 4% of Croatia's GDP, also stands to benefit, according to IHS Markit analyst Andrew Birch.\n\n\u201cRijeka is already a busy seaport, particularly for energy transport, with an oil pipeline connection to Budapest,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe removal of border controls on cargo transport from Croatia to the EU interior would boost port activity, as it is the closest seaport to Hungary and Slovakia, with motorway connections already established.\u201d\n\nRegardless of trade deals, keeping borders open is big business in itself. A report from the Bertelsmann Foundation estimated that the reintroduction of permanent border controls would lead to a growth loss of \u20ac470 billion in total for the EU until 2025.", "description": "What does Schengen expansion mean for Europe, and can the EU overcome its border policy crisis triggered by the migrant influx that began in 2014?", "authors": ["Alastair Jamieson"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/94/93/34/1000x563_cmsv2_7fabc67e-7d60-5036-9e45-c33329312c30-3949334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
