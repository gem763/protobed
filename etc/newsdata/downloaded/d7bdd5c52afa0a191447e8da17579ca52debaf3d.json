Will this program help teachers stay in the city?", "language": "en", "text": "In exchange for buying in the District, teachers would have to repay the down payment when they sell the house, and Landed would get 25 percent of any increase in the home value. The start-up would absorb 25 percent of any loss sustained in a sale.\n\nAD\n\nThe median home price in the District was $570,000 in 2018, according to Bright MLS, a real estate listing service.\n\nBowser said fewer than half of the city government\u2019s 37,000 employees live in the District.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe city has to play a part in keeping people of all incomes in the city,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cThe vibrancy of our city depends on it, and the quality of our classrooms depends on it.\u201d\n\nEconomically thriving cities such as the District are grappling with making homeownership feasible for educators in the communities where they teach. City leaders don\u2019t want teachers decamping for school systems in more affordable cities when they are ready to purchase a home or have children.\n\nAD\n\nIn Northern California\u2019s Silicon Valley, the Santa Clara Unified School District rents housing units to teachers at below-market rates. The East Side Union High School District in the San Jose area is exploring a controversial plan to transform district property into affordable rentals to attract teachers to the expensive city. Voters will decide on the proposal in March.\n\nAD\n\nLanded \u2014 whose investors include the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, started by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan \u2014 says it has helped more than 250 teachers on the West Coast and in Denver purchase homes.\n\nThe District, where teachers in the traditional public school system are among the highest paid in the nation, is Landed\u2019s first partnership on the East Coast.\n\nAD\n\nCouncil member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) agreed the city should be ensuring teachers have the opportunity to live in the District. But she believes a private company should not profit off the home-sale price. Instead, she said, the profit from a sale should be used to alleviate rising costs for the next middle-income resident who wants to purchase it.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we want to make sure that teachers can buy homes in the city,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cMy concern is that there might be ways for us to do it where the equity can stay in the house instead of go to the company.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAll employees in traditional public and charter schools in the District are eligible to purchase a home with Landed\u2019s help. Employees in the traditional public school system\u2019s central office also qualify.\n\nAD\n\nWhen an employee purchases a home, Landed is listed as a second buyer on the mortgage. The buyer can purchase Landed\u2019s equity in the property at any time, giving the company 25 percent of any value increase based on an appraisal.\n\nAlex Lofton, co-founder of Landed, said the program is ideal for employees who are able to pay a monthly mortgage but struggle to raise enough cash for a down payment. In the District \u2014 where the teacher retention rate is lower than other urban school districts \u2014 prospective buyers often need a 20 percent down payment to be a competitive bidder.\n\n\u201cHelping great educators become homeowners keeps them in their classrooms and connected to their communities,\u201d Lofton said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe initiative announced Wednesday is the District\u2019s latest effort to keep city employees and middle-class residents in the city. The partnership does not cost the city any money.\n\nBowser this year proposed spending $20 million to spur development of homes for families earning up to $141,000 a year. But the effort was controversial, with some residents and activists questioning whether the city should be subsidizing home purchases for middle-income residents when so many people are homeless or living in decrepit housing.\n\nThe D.C. Council thwarted the proposal, but Bowser invoked the failed plan at a news conference Wednesday conference and said she still wants it to happen.\n\nAD\n\nBowser said the partnership with Landed would complement existing programs intended to help residents purchase property.\n\nLorrie Cariaga \u2014 a first-grade teacher in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo \u2014 said she and her husband had been living in a cramped townhouse with their dog and three small children. She wanted a bigger space, but couldn\u2019t afford the necessary 20 percent down payment on the $721,000 home she hoped to purchase 15 minutes away from her school. But she sold her townhouse, put down $72,000 and Landed matched it \u2014 giving her a competitive offer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe prices here are skyrocketing with all the tech companies moving in, and people have the money to purchase so you are dealing with a competitive market,\u201d Cariaga said. \u201cHomes are close to a million dollars here, and teacher salaries are not.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTiffany Choi, president of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association, said she doesn\u2019t know any teachers who have purchased a home through Landed in Denver. But she said the solution should be to pay teachers more, not partner with a program that attempts to make housing more affordable for educators.\n\n\u201cAny program that offers affordable housing for teachers may have good intentions, but ultimately is an insult to the profession of teaching because the real solution would be to pay teachers a living wage like other professionals,\u201d Choi said.\n\nAD", "description": "Educators will get help with down payments through a partnership with a San Francisco start-up.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
