Interns were also told that they would not receive their own copies, these sources said.\n\nThis was all a standard facet of the Trump intern orientation process, billed as an \u201cethics training\u201d\u2014underscored by implicit legal threats from President Donald Trump\u2019s in-house lawyers.\n\nWhite House spokespeople and Jackman did not provide comment on the record for this story.\n\nTo veterans of other administrations, the act of compelling interns to sign these types of NDAs would seem odd, if not downright unenforceable or legally dubious. To this White House, it\u2019s standard operating procedure.\n\n\u201cAll White House employees\u2014from senior officials to interns\u2014understand the necessity of discretion based on the fact that they hold positions of public trust, with an emphasis on public ,\u201d said Ned Price, who served as a spokesman for the Obama National Security Council. \u201cBut this White House\u2019s approach to non-disclosure agreements, even for interns, seems to suggest that guarding against criticism of the president and his family\u2014what most of us would consider to be protected speech\u2014is just as important as safeguarding the sensitive information the American public entrusts to the government.\u201d\n\nOne Trump NDA, reviewed by the Associated Press shortly before he stepped into office, barred Trump employees from dishing on any behind-the-scenes details and stressed that those in breach could be sued for going against members of the Trump clan. This NDA covered not only Trump Organization staffers, but also 2016 campaign volunteers. Not even the person who made the hallmark \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat was exempt.\n\nIn late 2016, when The Daily Beast interviewed dozens of veterans and staffers of Trump\u2019s NBC reality TV series The Apprentice for a series of investigations, sources always insisted on speaking anonymously due to their strict non-disclosure agreements.\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped one-time Trump loyalists or staffers from breaking them, or even taking the president or his team to court to challenge the legality of one of Trump\u2019s preferred methods of shutting people up. On Wednesday, Jessica Denson, a former Hispanic outreach coordinator for the Trump campaign, filed a class action in an attempt to invalidate the NDAs the campaign had ordered its employees to sign. Denson and her legal team argue that the campaign NDAs were \u201cunlawful\u201d and didn\u2019t permit staffers to make claims for workplace discrimination, for instance.\n\nEarlier this year, former Trump aide and friend Cliff Sims came out with the latest tell-all book about life, backstabbing, and tumult in Trumpworld. The tell-all infuriated the president, and led to the Trump campaign filing an arbitration claim against Sims, claiming he violated an NDA.\n\nThis resulted in the former White House official instead suing Trump, alleging that the president had attempted to \u201csilence\u201d former staffers and had trampled on his First Amendment rights.\n\nBut any staffer who was surprised by the attempt to keep them quiet, wasn\u2019t paying attention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, there could be some kind of a law that you can\u2019t do this,\u201d Trump told The Washington Post during the presidential election, when asked if he would force \u201cemployees of the federal government\u201d to sign NDAs. \u201cBut when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nAccording to a story in the Post published last year, President Trump had ordered that senior White House staffers sign NDAs, which came with scary-sounding penalties for ever violating them, at the dawn of the Trump era. The then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House counsel\u2019s office leaned on reluctant officials to ultimately sign them, according to the report, in the \u201cearly months of the administration.\u201d The NDA, obtained by the Post in its draft form, featured a whopping $10 million violation fee.\n\nIn the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama administrations, NDAs were sometimes handed out to those dealing specifically with classified, or sensitive, information. However, ones resembling the far-reaching NDAs of the Trump Organization, campaign team, and White House\u2014agreements that have essentially nothing to do with national security, but instead mere fealty to the president and his family members\u2014were unheard of.\n\nFurthermore, many legal experts have argued that these Trump-era NDAs are, quite simply, legally unenforceable and merely an intimidation tactic. In fact, some maintain that even trying to enforce these with White House interns could result in financial blowback\u2014for the White House officials.\n\n\u201cGagging interns is playing with legal fire. There is no White House exemption in the longstanding appropriations rider that employees who try to obstruct communications with Congress are subject to salary cutoff,\u201d Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project in Washington, D.C., told The Daily Beast. \u201cNor is the White House exempt from criminal liability since 1980 for obstructing witnesses in any federal investigation.\u201d\n\nAnd in the case of former aides, the threat of a Trumpian NDA has consistently turned out to be all but completely empty. If anything, the NDAs are part of a White House culture infected by aggressive, omnipresent leaking, and the agreements have done virtually nothing to staunch it.\n\nAfter publication of his scorched-earth comments about the Trump family in Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire & Fury, the president\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon was sent a letter by Trump\u2019s infamous, Gawker-killing attorney Charles Harder threatening a lawsuit.\n\nThe scary Harder letter aside, nothing happened.\n\nDuring the media rollout last year of UNHINGED, the book by former Apprentice star and ex-senior Trump administration official Omarosa Manigault Newman, Harder sent the publisher Simon & Schuster a letter threatening them \u201cshould you proceed with publishing and selling the Book.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch claims would include, among others, tortious interference with the Agreement, and inducement of Ms. Manigault-Newman to breach the Agreement,\u201d it read.\n\nAgain, for all that legal bluster: Crickets.", "description": "Not even the interns are exempt from the legally dubious rite of passage that is signing a Trump NDA.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1550716425/190220-Swin-White-House-tease_wgyhlg", "published_at": "2019-02-21"}
