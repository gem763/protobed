Though blood moons are considered fairly common, we are heading into a bloodless period, making this one even more special.\n\nWhat is a blood moon?\n\nA blood moon is the unscientific name for a total lunar eclipse, which is when Earth passes in between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow over the moon as sunlight is blocked.\n\nDuring this process, some sunlight is filtered through the Earth's atmosphere, reflecting onto the moon to give a red appearance.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty\n\nWhy is it called a blood moon?\n\nThe term blood moon harkens back to a time when people were superstitious about the influence of a lunar eclipse, but also when people had no knowledge of what was going on.\n\n\"The real reason that the term blood moon exists is because people used to be terrified of eclipses - thousands of years ago, if the moon suddenly went red without warning in the sky, people would look up and be terrified,\" explained Tom Kerss, an astronomer from the Royal Observatory Greenwich.\n\n\"That would have been seen as a sign or omen of something terrible happening, as the moon looks like it's stained with blood at that point.\n\n\"It does evoke something I suppose in the way that the moon appears, but the real technical term would simply be a total lunar eclipse.\"\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If you don't have access to a longer lens, wait for the moon to get lower and closer to the horizon, and frame the eclipse with buildings or scenery instead.\n\nWhen was the last blood moon?\n\nThe last blood moon took place in July 2018, though clouds largely obscured the celestial phenomenon in the UK.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "The sky is about to be lit up by an astonishing blood moon, turning our nearest neighbour\u00a0a deep red and skygazers' eyes towards the sky.
