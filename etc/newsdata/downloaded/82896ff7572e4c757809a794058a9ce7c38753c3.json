Some 10%, including 13% of college graduates, are looking for a better or more stable job.\n\nPolling company YouGov surveyed 2,605 adults on behalf of personal-finance site Bankrate.com between Sept. 27 and 29. Since then a key economic indicator in the bond market, the so-called yield curve, has switched from a pessimistic reading to a more optimistic one.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve estimates the U.S. economy will grow this quarter at an annualized rate of 1.3% above inflation. But geopolitical news, including Brexit and trade conflict between the U.S. and other countries, have continued to cast clouds.\n\nRecession fears can be self-reinforcing, if they cause consumers to scale back on spending. That is especially true of they cut back going into the holiday shopping period, a key period for many consumer businesses.\n\nWhile recent news has improved, many Americans remain poorly positioned if the economy does turn down next year. Some 40% told the pollsters they were under-prepared for a recession, including 16%, equivalent to about 40 million Americans, who said they were not prepared at all.\n\nThe economy is expected to be a hot issue\u2014as usual\u2014in next year\u2019s presidential election. The poll shows some of the key battlegrounds\u2014such as white voters, and those in the Midwest\u2014are no more optimistic than the rest of the country.", "description": "Geopolitical news, including Brexit and trade conflict between the U.S. and other countries, have continued to cast clouds.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT367_arends_ZG_20191015160835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
