However, industrial companies play a vital role in the global economy. Many firms in this sector are the first link in the chain for businesses, whether those customers make high-tech mobile devices or the packaged foods you buy at the grocery store. These industrial stocks aren't well known because you don't see their brands regularly, but they are multi-billion-dollar businesses with entrenched relationships around the world. That makes them stable and this supports reliable dividend payments. If you're an income-oriented investor, you should give serious consideration to the industrial sector and these nine companies.\n\nABB Ltd. (ticker: ABB)\n\nSwitzerland-based ABB is the perfect example of an under-the-radar industrial stock worth a look for your income portfolio. It's a massive $40 billion stock, neck-and-neck with insurance giant Progressive Corp. (PGR) or electric vehicle icon Tesla (TSLA) in terms of market value. ABB also employs some 150,000 people worldwide, and boasts nearly $30 billion in annual revenue across a diversified business that deals with robotics, transportation and automation. Manufacturers need ABB gear to run their factories and move their goods around the global economy. As a result, it has a reliable business that supports a generous dividend you can bank on for the long haul.\n\nCurrent yield: 4.2%\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nAmid all the talk of a trade war with China, heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar has experienced volatility. But despite the ups and downs, CAT is pretty much right where it was to start the year -- and longer term, it has more than doubled its share price since 2016. That's because you simply can't compete with the brand and scale of this nearly $70 billion industrial giant. From construction equipment to mining machinery to industrial turbines, CAT helps support the very foundations of the economy. Even if construction of roads, factories and office buildings may slow during tough times, it never completely stops -- and neither does demand for Caterpillar equipment.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.4%\n\nCummins (CMI)\n\nAs a leading brand in diesel technology, Cummins is literally the engine that moves the largest businesses in the world. You'll find its brand on top of emergency generators, trucks, trains and agriculture gear all around the globe. Admittedly, a move away from fossil fuels poses a long-term threat to CMI. However, \"clean diesel\" engines that are more fuel efficient and create less exhaust are an important bridge between the economy of today and a distant future where everything runs on renewable resources. Growth is flat, but with $22 billion in annual revenue and a generous dividend that is only about one third of total earnings, this industrial stock should keep paying investors for many years to come.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.4%\n\nCovanta Holding Corp. (CVA)\n\nCovanta is an industrial waste management firm that operates primarily in the United States and Canada, working with municipalities to clean things up and sometimes even turn that trash into electricity. The business is dirty, ranging from wastewater treatment to recycling landfill operations, but it is a decidedly crucial service for the communities CVA serves. Best of all, this industrial stock is decidedly insulated from big-picture downturns since humans will keep producing waste no matter what happens to the stock market. And as a shareholder, you'll get a portion of Covanta's profits returned back to you via reliable dividends.\n\nCurrent yield: 5.9%\n\nEmerson Electric Co. (EMR)\n\nMissouri-based Emerson is a technology and engineering company that serves a wide array of industries. Its measurement and analytics gear is used in oil and gas refining, pharmaceuticals and food and beverage applications while its climate technologies arm focuses on refrigeration and HVAC businesses for both commercial and residential use. Heat sensors and flow monitors aren't incredibly sexy pieces of technology, but EMR stock thrives thanks to a wide variety of customers and constant demand for its products. And with a dividend that remains roughly 60% of total earnings, there is plenty of potential for investors to see increased income from this stock in the future.", "description": "Remember the industrial sector.
