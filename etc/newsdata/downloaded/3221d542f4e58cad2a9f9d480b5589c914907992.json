Devin Nunes (R-CA), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG), with whom an intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint against President Trump, \u201cknowingly changed\u201d the complaint form in order to help get the complaint out publicly.\n\nNunes told Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Sunday host Matt Boyle, \u201c[The ICIG is] either totally incompetent or part of the deep state, and he\u2019s got a lot of questions he needs to answer because he knowingly changed the form and the requirements in order to make sure that this whistleblower complaint got out publicly.\u201d\n\nNunes\u2019s comments come after the ICIG, Michael Atkinson, testified to lawmakers on Friday.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s either incompetent or in on it, and he\u2019s going to have more to answer for, I can promise you, because we are not going to let him go; he is going to tell he truth about what happened,\u201d Nunes added.\n\nNunes also said the intelligence official who filed the complaint had filled out an old complaint form that said the complainant must have firsthand information related to the alleged wrongdoing. The form was updated sometime after the official filed his complaint, to not require firsthand knowledge.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, you have the change of the forms. \u2026 You no longer had to have firsthand information; you had to have secondhand information. Clearly they backdated it to August. The evidence is clear that it didn\u2019t change on the website until the 25th of September,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo the form that the whistleblower filled out \u2014 he actually filled out the old form that said you had to have firsthand knowledge. The whistleblower readily admits he doesn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge. So conveniently the IG did this, claims that was always the case, claims it wasn\u2019t the law; I already told you, he\u2019s going to have more questions to answer,\u201d he said.\n\nListen to the whole interview here:", "description": "Devin Nunes said the intelligence community inspector general \"knowingly changed\" the whistleblower complaint form in order to help get it out publicly.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Devin-Nunes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
