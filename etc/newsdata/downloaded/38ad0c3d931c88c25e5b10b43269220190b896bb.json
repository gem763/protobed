He visited around five or perhaps 10 times, she said. \"I didn't think it was awkward at all.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe quipped that she once offered Johnson the chance to have a go on her dancing pole but he refused.\n\n\"He sat down with his tea and started muttering,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked again about the nature of their relationship she said: \"Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer model, I really am not going to answer that question.\"\n\nAsked if she loved him, she said: \"I care about him deeply as a friend and do we share a very close bond. But I wish him well, I want him to be happy.\"\n\nReuters", "description": "Jennifer Arcuri's relationship with Boris Johnson is under scrutiny but she denied the British Prime Minister showed her favouritism and refused to say if they had intimate relations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6304%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_293%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b0aefbd6a039d8c52183fc171ff0b044985f4bed", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
