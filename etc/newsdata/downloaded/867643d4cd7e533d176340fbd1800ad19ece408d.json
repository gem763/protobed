The article, though focused on Deborah Ramirez\u2019s uncorroborated claim that while undergraduates at Yale, Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her, added a new charge: \u201cA classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student.\u201d\n\nThe story prompted at least five Democratic presidential candidates to demand Kavanaugh's impeachment, including Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nLast year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019\n\nI sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\n\n\n\nHe must be impeached. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019\n\nSince the story broke, the media and left-leaning politicians have been caught up in a self-congratulatory smirk-fest over the relitigation of the the Kavanaugh controversy. But, for several reasons, the Left will likely rue the day the New York Times published the hit piece on Kavanaugh.\n\nFirst, the article omitted several facts relevant to the new charge against Kavanaugh. While the writers identified then-Yale student Max Stier as the witness to Kavanaugh\u2019s supposed misconduct, they failed to mention that Stier had previously butted heads with Kavanaugh when he served on Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s team, with Stier representing Bill Clinton during the impeachment proceedings.\n\nEven more damning to Stier\u2019s claim are the additional details included in the book but (initially) excluded from the Times article. \"The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident,\" reads an Editor's Note from the Times, added after conservative media exposed the omission.\n\nBy omitting these facts initially and then being forced to correct the record, the Times has lost much of its credibility, especially on the Kavanaugh controversy. The Times just reminded the country how shaky its reporting is as the country prepares for the 2020 election.\n\nThe hit piece on Kavanaugh has also served to remind Republicans of what the Left put the man and his family through during the confirmation hearings. That righteous indignation propelled conservatives to the polls in the 2018 midterm elections, helping Republicans to make gains in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate results established that voting against Kavanaugh was a losing proposition, as many red-state Democratic senators who voted against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation lost reelection. The losers included Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Bill Nelson of Florida, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Riling up the Republican base when we are just a year out from the 2020 presidential election does not seem like the brightest strategy.\n\nNot only are the Left\u2019s renewed attacks on Kavanaugh angering the Right and likely boosting turnout next November, they are quieting internal conservative squabbling . The schism on the Republican side between the MAGA and Never Trump folks seemed near-absolute, except when it came to Kavanaugh. A united Republican Party cannot be defeated.\n\nThe continuous flogging of Kavanaugh also risks forcing the hand of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham. Since he replaced Sen. Chuck Grassley as chair, he has done nothing in response to the bogus claims presented to the committee against Kavanaugh. The New York Times hit piece might just be the impetus Graham needs to act.\n\nFinally, the renewed attacks on Kavanaugh are likely to gird him for the legal battles to come. Had liberals left things as they were, there was a chance Kavanaugh might try to redeem himself in the eyes of liberals. Kavanaugh\u2019s showcasing of his hiring of an all-female staff of law clerks reeked of virtue signaling and suggested he might feel the need to prove himself. How better to prove to liberals you aren\u2019t a misogynist than to uphold Roe v. Wade? However, Kavanaugh likely now realizes he will always be the bad guy in their eyes, so he might as well stick to his principles rather than pander to the Left for an unattainable acceptance.\n\nThe longer the press pushes the Kavanaugh story, the more damage done to the Democratic Party \u2014 but also the more damage done to the justice\u2019s wife and young daughters. So, for the sake of the Kavanaugh family, here\u2019s to hoping the media realizes its political miscalculation imminently.\n\nMargot Cleveland (@ProfMJCleveland) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.
