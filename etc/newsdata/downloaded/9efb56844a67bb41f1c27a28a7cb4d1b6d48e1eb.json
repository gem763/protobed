But in the same article, the AP offered some notable behind-the-scenes details on the ways in which the White House prepares \u2013 or least tries to prepare \u2013 for these calls.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s apparently a problem with Trump\u2019s complete disinterest in preparing for important discussions.\n\nOne individual with firsthand knowledge of how the Trump calls with foreign leaders are handled said the president \u201chates\u201d such \u201cpre-briefs\u201d and frequently has refused to do them. Trump doesn\u2019t like written background materials either. [\u2026] The person said a six-page pre-brief with attachments was once prepared for Trump before a call to a foreign leader. But that turned out to be too long, as did a single-page version. Preparing pre-brief note cards that offered about three talking points for Trump to make on a call was the norm.\n\nThis is, of course, unsettling, though it\u2019s also consistent with everything we\u2019ve learned about the president\u2019s process. Trump can\u2019t even be bothered to read his daily presidential intelligence briefing. Some aides have routinely found that \u201ceven a single page of bullet points\u201d is too taxing for the president\u2019s limited attention span. A Trump confidant said a couple of years ago, \u201cI call the president the two-minute man. The president has patience for a half-page.\u201d\n\nThe AP article went on to note that Trump has a habit of taking his note cards and ripping them up after his conversations. Since the Presidential Records Act still exists, White House aides have to \u201cput the papers out on a table and tape them back together to preserve them as official presidential records.\u201d This, too, is consistent with what we\u2019ve heard before.\n\nThis tidbit from the AP report, however, was new to me: \u201cOccasionally, while on the phone with foreign heads of state, Trump has handed the receiver to his daughter, Ivanka Trump, so she can talk with the leader.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\nIt\u2019s hardly a secret that the American president holds his adult daughter in high regard. Earlier this year, Trump even offered Ivanka the opportunity to lead the World Bank \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s very good with numbers,\u201d the president said \u2013 and possibly serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBut the fact remains that Ivanka Trump, before getting a powerful White House job, previously created a consumer fashion brand and made frequent appearances on her father\u2019s reality show. As the New York Times noted over the weekend, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka has also retained a stake in the family business even as she serves as a White House adviser, and last year she received trademarks in China related to her separate fashion ventures. Her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, maintains a stake in his own family\u2019s real estate business, which has received and sought funding from international sources as well.\u201d\n\nSo why is it, exactly, that the Republican president \u201coccasionally\u201d has his daughter speak to world leaders?\n\nIs it unreasonable to wonder how Republicans might react if President Hillary Clinton, after refusing to thoroughly prepare for meetings with international officials, occasionally handed the phone to Chelsea Clinton?", "description": "Why is it, exactly, that the Republican president \"occasionally\" has his daughter speak to world leaders?
