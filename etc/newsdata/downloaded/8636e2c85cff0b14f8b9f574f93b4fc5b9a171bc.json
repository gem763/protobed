Markets include #stocks, #bonds, #forex, #Bitcoin & #Commodities.\n\nNew alignments: None\n\nPresident Trump can talk about 0% or negative interest rates all he wants, but the reality is, something else is going on behind the scenes, forces that the President or Fed cannot control. The U.S. repo rate has been climbing higher for days and the Fed funds rate has been pushing against/above its upper bands for days. What gives?\n\nThe Fed is quietly offering billions of dollars to banks willing to swap investment grade government bonds. The Repo rate, the overnight borrowing from brokers-dealer, hedge funds, and institutions, suggests trouble is brewing behind the scenes. Negative interest rates throughout the global, policies executed by lawyers that do not understand how markets work, have damaged the European bond market. This also includes the Japanese market.\n\nThe trouble is zero and negative interest rates. Repo rates agreements function best when interest rates are positive. Negative interest rate poise a problem when held by short-term traders such and dealers and hedge funds. Traders only care about momentum. If negative rates don't fall further, the game of musical chairs stops, negative interest rate bonds must be sold in a market where there's no long term buyers.\n\nRepo rates also assume that government debt is AAA and risk-free. Most readers and subscribers, however, know that government's planning to borrow until infinite is not risk-free. The public debt market is a game of musical chairs that few understand. When the music stops, there will be panic. The view that will save the day assumes that the public sector will not change the rules about their operation and existence. It's an unbelievable real risk that could also apply to gold if the world viewed fix currency as a solution. It doesn't, so gold might be left alone to trade freely. Ever wonder why the U.S. stock market is rising despite a slowing global economy and rising uncertainty? It's a place to park for safety, not risk. Up become down, yet few recognize it.\n\nUsing the Matrix\n\nThe value of the Matrix is far more than a study of price. Trends are a function of price, volume (force), volatility, and TIME. The order of their importance is as follows: (1) TIME, (2) volatility, (3) volume & price alignment. Volume and price alignment, a setup that triggers action, favors Grade A & B, early cycle markets under high compression (\u2193COM). \u2193COM suggests extremely low volatility, a quiet trend ready to explode into high compression (\u2191EXP). Weekly and monthly breakout signals are not finalized until the end of the week and month, respectively. Signals generated before that could be temporary. Keep this in mind when reading alignment.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Eric De Groot covering: BTC/USD.
