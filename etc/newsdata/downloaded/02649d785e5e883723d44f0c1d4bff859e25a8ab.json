It seems all we heard about was domestic violence, child abuse and murder and all these crazy things. Kneeling, protesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was part of the committee that advised Commissioner Goodell for the conduct policy revisions, and it actually made an impact. You\u2019re not hearing those kinds of stories coming out of the NFL right now in terms of headlines.\u201d\n\nThese changes the league has made over the last several years appear to be paying off. Last year, the average NFL game drew 15.8 million viewers during the regular 2018 season, marking an increase of 5 percent when compared to 2017, when games drew an average audience of 14.9 million viewers.\n\nThis season, the Green Bay Packers\u2019 victory over the Chicago Bears in Week One averaged a Total Audience Delivery (TAD) of 22.7 million, which is the most-watched sporting event since Super Bowl LIII in February, according to television and data analytics company Nielsen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe steady increase in ratings and viewership will certainly help the NFL as they prepare to negotiate their contract for Monday Night Football with Disney\u2019s ESPN, which will expire after the 2021 season. The league\u2019s contracts with FOX, NBC and CBS are up a year later.", "description": "This week's Thursday Night Football game between the Eagles and Packers saw an 18 percent increase in viewership when compared to last season's Week Four game.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/NFL-GettyImages-1167116582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
