Given the declining , couldn't black gold have acted just a little bit stronger? Let's take a look at what it means for our open position \u2013 time to head for the exits, or brace ourselves for a more opportune exit point being hit?\n\nLet's start with the most important sentence in mind. We are closing the speculative long position and taking respectable profits off the table.\n\nWhy did we change our mind regarding oil's most likely short-term potential? Because of how used to react to the USD Index, how it reacted on Wednesday and how it reacted on Thursday.\n\nWe previously wrote the following:\n\nIn the very recent past - the last several days - the USD Index and moved in the opposite ways. Thursday's and Friday's upswing in crude oil corresponded to declining USD. And the USD Index seems to be bottoming.\n\nInstead of bottoming right away after we wrote the above, the moved even lower and reached its next support level. Based on how and the USD behaved, we lowered our profit-take level. You see, crude oil continued to follow USD's lead, but the strength of crude oil's response was weak. Oil moved higher, but insignificantly so. This link is even more bearish based on what we saw on Thursday. If price doesn't react bullishly to what used to be a bullish factor, it's an indication that the price wants to move in the opposite direction.\n\nTo be clear: the above is not enough to make the short-term outlook bearish on its own. However it is enough to make the short-term outlook relatively neutral. And if the outlook is neutral, then (opening) no position, neither long nor short, is justified from the risk-to-reward point of view.\n\nThe question remains whether one should close the position right away or wait for a better exit price. We initially (before Thursday's USD decline) planned to bet on a very short-term increase in price. However, today's lack of a big rally is too bearish for us to justify keeping the long position any longer.\n\nThe chart below is what we had prepared a few hours before publishing this analysis.\n\nCrude Oil\n\nWhat we focused on was the breakout above the rising resistance line and crude oil's breakout above the declining short-term resistance line and its verification. It reversed at the intersection of two lines, which increased the odds that we had just seen a reversal.\n\nIndeed, moved higher after the above moment, but based on a big pre-market decline in the USD Index, crude oil was able to rally to only 53.30. This means that it was not able to even get back to its recent high. This is a very bearish sign and one that almost makes us open a short position right away.\n\nNo, we are not opening it (we prefer to see how closes today), but we do think that the profits on the long position should be taken off the table. At the time of writing, crude oil was trading at $52.97, which provides us with a significantly more than $1 profit since we entered the current long position earlier this month, close to the bottom.\n\nThe next trade will probably be a short position, at least based on the monthly chart below.\n\nMonthly Crude Oil\n\nCrude oil reversed in a profound way in September, which suggests that lower prices are likely in the following months. The sell signal from the monthly Stochastic indicator also remains intact. That's in tune with the same indicator on the daily timeframe. The outlook is simply not as bullish as it used to be in the previous days.\n\nConsequently, in our view, no position is currently justified form the risk-to-reward point of view. We might open a new short position soon, but we are not doing so right now.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Przemyslaw Radomski, CFA covering: US Dollar Index Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
