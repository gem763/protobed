The Wallabies will start their renowned openside mix of captain Michael Hooper and David Pocock for the 25th time in Saturday\u2019s Test at the Sapporo Dome, in the only change to the XV who stunned the All Blacks in Perth last month.\n\nJames Horwill: 'If the Wallabies turn up, they can beat anyone' | Paul Rees Read more\n\nLukhan Salakaia-Loto is demoted to the bench in a sour piece of news for the big blindside flanker on his 23rd birthday. Coach Cheika insisted it was a tight call but said 31-year-old Pocock, attending his third World Cup, brings the mature qualities that might be needed if things start turning pear-shaped against a Fiji team stacked with attacking weapons.\n\n\u201cFor the first game of the World Cup, I went for a little bit more experience, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done this before, the two boys playing together. We\u2019ve worked on the possibility of this kind of combination for the last couple of weeks and they\u2019ve been working well together.\u201d\n\nCheika said the selection was no reflection on Salakaia-Loto, the only player to have appeared in all 400 minutes of Australian Test action this year. The Queensland Reds enforcer stood out in the 47-26 demolition of the world champions in Perth and his absence could place pressure on a Wallabies lineout that has been functioning well.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nCheika said while there were obvious differences between the two, the nod to Pocock wasn\u2019t simply because of his breakdown prowess. \u201cRest assured, these players [Pocock and Hooper] aren\u2019t selected just for their play on the ground. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other facets to the game where they can contribute to the team, both in attack and defence. And from an experience point of view as well.\u201d\n\nThe other most contentious selection was the halves, where Nic White and Christian Lealiifano were again favoured over the 2015 World Cup pairing of Will Genia and Bernard Foley. Cheika said \u201cthe ability to create, in attack and defence\u201d made the difference in another difficult call.\n\nTen of the starting team are at their first World Cup. It is the third for Pocock and fullback Kurtley Beale; and the second for outside centre James Hooper, Michael Hooper and prop Scott Sio. O\u2019Connor\u2019s previous appearance was at the 2011 tournament.", "description": "Wallabies captain Michael Hooper will be reunited with David Pocock after coach Michael Cheika named the pair in Australia\u2019s starting XV", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe5f1c1a735dc92216d4470e53a85817acdb8aa0/0_22_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c169541061144d4db8a309c79d8e460", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
