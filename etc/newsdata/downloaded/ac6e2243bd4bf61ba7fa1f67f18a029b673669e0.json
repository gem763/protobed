The decisions that are made in this town don\u2019t just affect the people in the U.S., they affect the globe every day,\u201d Butler said Sunday. \u201cI think people around the world are counting on us to be able to stand up in D.C.\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re a high-powered politician, student or government worker, if you live or work in downtown D.C., you\u2019ll probably feel the impact of the protest. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhich streets are they shutting down, and for how long?\n\nIn Shut Down D.C.'s ideal world: all of them, all day long.\n\nOrganizers hope to bring \u201cthe whole city to a gridlocked standstill,\u201d according to the group\u2019s website. To do so, they will target \u201ckey infrastructure\u201d likely to have the biggest impact on District residents\u2019 and commuters\u2019 ability to get around, according to the site.\n\nIn practice, this means protesters are meeting up early Monday morning at four different locations: some are gathering at 6:30 a.m. at the L\u2019Enfant Plaza Metro station and at Folger Park, while others are massing at Columbus Circle at 7 a.m. and still others near Farragut Square at 7:30 a.m.\n\nIn the hours that follow, participants will in part target heavily-trafficked intersections and streets, according to Butler, though she declined to say which ones. Shut Down D.C. has published several maps detailing information about traffic volume, levels of employment downtown and sites where prominent oil and gas lobbyists work.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to bring the city to a standstill \u2026 there will be people throughout the city focusing on making that happen,\u201d Butler said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many streets the protesters will actually be able to close, or for how long they\u2019ll remain shut down. According to Facebook, the event is slated to last from 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., a timeline Butler confirmed Sunday.\n\nD.C. police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck declined to say Sunday whether he thought Shut Down D.C. would be able to achieve its stated goal of bringing traffic to a standstill.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re anticipating a potential impact to the surface transportation in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to address it, as big or small as the footprint is in the city.\u201d\n\nSo, what exactly are police planning?\n\nD.C. police have taken several steps to prepare, including mobilizing extra officers, Sternbeck said. He declined to say how many additional officers the department will deploy.\n\nSternbeck said the department is also collaborating with \u201cour local government partners\u201d to coordinate a response. Officials will activate D.C.'s Emergency Operations Center and Joint Information Center on Monday to monitor \u201cpotential disruptions to District operations,\u201d according to a joint news release issued Friday by the District Department of Transportation, the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and D.C. police.\n\n\u201cThe Bowser Administration is currently monitoring first amendment activities planned by local climate change organizations,\u201d the release said. \u201cAlthough we are unaware of specific locations that will be impacted, there is the potential for traffic delays and disruptions throughout the District.\u201d\n\nWhat should you do to prepare?\n\nFirst of all, stay informed.\n\nSternbeck said police are encouraging District residents to keep abreast of developments Monday morning by signing up for D.C. alerts and by monitoring \u201cour social media messaging.\u201d\n\nSecond, he said, consider switching up your commute. Sternbeck suggested those who normally drive into the city for work consider taking \u201cdifferent transportation modes\u201d such as Metro.\n\nOr \u2014 if you can \u2014 just stay home. Come Monday, \u201cmaybe you should telework,\u201d Sternbeck said.\n\n\u201cYou know, if the opportunity presents itself \u2026 then take advantage of that opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nButler offered slightly different advice.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to work and join us on Monday!\u201d she urged. \u201cIt\u2019s a climate emergency and we need this stuff to happen right now.\u201d\n\nWhy shut down the streets?\n\nIn part, it\u2019s simple logistics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking action in Washington, D.C., because that\u2019s where we live, work and go to school,\u201d the group says on its website. \u201cIf we lived in Cleveland, we would be trying to disrupt business-as-usual in Cleveland.\"\n\nThe site notes that demonstrations Monday form part of a broader wave of youth-led unrest over a rapidly changing climate. The traffic stoppage is one of more than 1,400 events taking place around the world Sept. 20-27 as part of a Global Climate Strike.\n\nNonetheless, the D.C. protest is unique: The nation\u2019s capital arguably boasts more highflying political players per square inch than any other place on Earth.\n\n\u201cThe folks driving downtown to work at the White House, Capitol Hill or numerous corporate lobbying offices on K Street are influencing or making decisions that directly impact people across the globe,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe have to be willing to put the kind of pressure necessary on this town to ensure they start making decisions that are about communities and people, not corporate profits.\"\n\nStill, Shut Down D.C. knows its protest will affect more than just Trump administration employees. The group consulted with organizations \u201cled by people of color, immigrants and working-class people in the area\u201d ahead of the demonstrations, according to its website, and \u201cheard enthusiastic support.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not take this action lightly,\u201d an FAQ on the site states. \u201cWe know that this shutdown will cause massive disruption to people who bear little responsibility for the climate catastrophe we are facing.\u201d\n\nButler added: \u201cStopping business as usual is what\u2019s necessary in a moment like this: we need to stop acting like everything is okay!\u201d\n\nWho is protesting?\n\nThe Shut Down D.C. coalition includes activists from a wide range of climate and social justice organizations \u2014 more than two dozen at last count, according to Butler. Participating groups include Black Lives Matter D.C., Code Pink, Metro D.C. Socialists of America and Werk for Peace.\n\nPeople unaffiliated with any particular organization are also likely to join the protests. On Facebook, a page devoted to the event had garnered 2,468 \u201cguests\u201d as of Sunday afternoon, though Butler said it\u2019s \u201calways hard to tell\u201d how many of those who\u2019ve indicated interest online will actually show up.\n\nThe Shut Down D.C. website urges all comers to help snarl traffic: \u201cParents, workers, college students, and everyone who is concerned about the climate crisis will skip work and school and put off their other responsibilities to take action on the climate crisis,\u201d the site states.\n\nThe group is also asking that protesters sign an online \u201cPledge of Resistance.\u201d Butler said more than 1,000 people had signed the pledge as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhy nurses, America\u2019s most trusted professionals, are demanding \u2018climate justice\u2019\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nThe group has officially adopted the U.S. Youth Climate Strike platform, according to its website.\n\nThat platform demands myriad steps, including the Green New Deal, an ambitious and controversial package of government initiatives proposed by Democratic Party progressives to address climate change. The Green New Deal broadly aims to transition the country from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2030.\n\nShut Down D.C. is also calling for an end to the extraction and leasing of fossil fuels; for the government to honor treaties previously forged to protect indigenous lands; the restoration and protection of at least 50 percent of lands and oceans across the globe; and the end of all deforestation by 2030, among other things.\n\nHas this ever happened before?\n\nYes.\n\nIn May 1971, roughly 25,000 (mostly young) people calling themselves the \u201cMayday Tribe\u201d tried to shut down all traffic in the city to protest the Vietnam War. Participants planned to station themselves on 21 key bridges and traffic circles to prevent federal employees from getting to work, L. A. Kauffman wrote in her book \u201cDirect Action.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for the demonstrators, the Nixon administration obtained the Mayday Tribe\u2019s detailed tactical manual, according to Kauffman. Police and military forces \u2014 Nixon took the unusual step of deploying the National Guard, the Army and the Marines \u2014 swooped in to arrest most protesters before they could get into position.\n\nFor the short time the demonstrations lasted, they did have some effect: Traffic stalled, and the protests inspired some government employees to either stay home or arrive at their offices before dawn.\n\nA handful of legislators had a more novel reaction: At least three members of Congress opted to canoe across the Potomac River to Capitol Hill, Kauffman wrote.\n\nThis story has been updated to include attribution for some historical details about the 1971 May Day protests.", "description": "Organizers hope to bring \u201cthe whole city to a gridlocked standstill.\u201d To do so, they will target \u201ckey infrastructure\u201d likely to have the biggest impact on District residents\u2019 and commuters\u2019 ability to get around, according to the group's website.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
