To confirm it was him, they stole a pair of Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear \u2014 long, white boxers \u2014 and obtained a blood sample, both for DNA testing, the force\u2019s commander, Mazlum Abdi, said in a phone interview on Monday.\n\nAmerican officials would not discuss the specific intelligence provided by the Kurds, but said that their role in finding Mr. al-Baghdadi was essential \u2014 more so than all other countries combined, as one put it \u2014 contradicting President Trump\u2019s assertion over the weekend that the United States \u201cgot very little help.\u201d\n\nYet even as the Syrian Kurdish fighters were risking their lives in the hunt that led to Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death this weekend, Mr. Trump abruptly shattered America\u2019s five-year partnership with them.", "description": "Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from Syria upended a 5-year alliance and threw the plans against al-Baghdadi into disarray.", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard", "Eric Schmitt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/world/28syria-kurds-sub10/28syria-kurds-sub10-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
