And for two-and-a-half years, misguided lower court decisions have been preventing those laws from ever being enforced \u2014 at immense cost to the whole country,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pointed to the speedy deportations ruling as a chief example.\n\n\u201cExpedited removal\u201d has been part of federal law for decades, and has been upheld as a valid tool to remove people without having to go through a lengthy immigration court process. The Bush and Obama administrations limited use to within 100 miles of the border, but the Trump administration says the law contains no such restriction.\n\n\u201cThat tool is vital to addressing the many aliens in the United States who have no right to remain here. A single judge is now prohibiting the Government from enforcing the law as written,\u201d Ms. Grisham said.\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed by President Obama in 2013 to the district court in Washington, D.C., said the administration cut too many procedural corners in changing the expedited removal guidelines, and discounted the potential dangers of snaring citizens or others in the speeded-up process.\n\nShe issued a nationwide injunction to remain in place while she hears full arguments in the case.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, it would seem that some consideration of how many people might be erroneously swept up in the expanded expedited-removal dragnet, and/or how often such identification errors have occurred with respect to the agency\u2019s expedited-removal practices in the past, would be in order,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPerhaps even more momentous was the ruling by Judge Dolly M. Gee in California.\n\nShe shot down Homeland Security\u2019s attempt to nix the Flores settlement, a Clinton-era court agreement that she updated in 2015 to limit the amount of time immigrant families who are in the U.S. illegally can be held in detention.\n\nThat 2015 ruling caps detention at about 20 days, which is far too short to complete the families\u2019 immigration cases. Once released, the cases get delayed for years, giving the families a chance to disappear into the shadows.\n\nJudge Gee\u2019s 2015 ruling has been blamed for inviting the surge of migrant families that reached record levels this year \u2014 and led to children being abducted or rented to adults trying to portray as families to take advantage of the \u201cloophole.\u201d\n\nAt its peak in May, the Border Patrol nabbed nearly 85,000 migrants that month who tried to sneak into the U.S. as families. That was more than 20 times higher than the number arrested in May 2015, before Judge Gee\u2019s ruling took effect.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan had proposed a replacement for the Flores settlement that would allow detention until deportation, in dorm-like facilities subject to standards.\n\nJudge Gee, in a brief ruling Friday, said Mr. McAleenan\u2019s proposal fell short of Flores, so she wouldn\u2019t allow it as a replacement.\n\n\u201cThe Flores Agreement is a binding contract and a consent decree,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDefendants cannot simply ignore the dictates of the consent decree merely because they no longer agree with its approach as a matter of policy.\u201d\n\nMs. Grisham complained that Judge Gee had upended the detention system Congress has written into law by \u201ccreating a new system out of judicial whole cloth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis destructive end-run around the detention and removal system Congress created must end,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
