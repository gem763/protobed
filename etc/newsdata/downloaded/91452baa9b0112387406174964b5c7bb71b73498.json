For shame.\n\nWhat this nation needs are public servants who serve the people with strength and character \u2014 not Republicans who pretend to be Republicans while fighting all-things-Republican.\n\n\u201cI support getting the facts in that inquiry that\u2019s happening,\u201d Scott said, CNN reported. \u201cSo I think this is \u2014 these are serious allegations we need to \u2014 we need to make sure that we do the fact finding and figure out what exactly did happen.\u201d\n\nScott could\u2019ve chosen any number of statements to make about this inquiry.\n\nHe could\u2019ve, for example, make the point that an inquiry into impeachment is about as real as a pre-crime \u2014 that both are simply figments of imaginations based on suppositions. And that in the case of the impeachment inquiry, the imaginations are based on the hope and hate of Democrats to take down Trump.\n\nHe could\u2019ve spoken about the long, long list of previous Democrat attempts to impeach this president, going back to pre-inauguration days, as evidence of the whole politicization of the process and as means of showing the dubious nature of these current so-called impeachable allegations.\n\nHe could\u2019ve taken the high road and said nothing; he could\u2019ve said that this is America and in America, the crime comes before the prosecution and in that spirit of American justice, he was going to refrain from commenting on the current inquiry.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t.\n\nScott, who won a second gubernatorial term in 2018, in a state that went overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016, in a state known for far-left progressive policies, in the state that brought to Congress the socialist-minded Sen. Bernie Sanders, has been an anti-Trumper from the get-go.\n\nScott\u2019s criticized Trump\u2019s remarks about \u201cThe Squad\u201d \u2014 Reps. Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley \u2014 as racist.\n\nHe\u2019s criticized Trump\u2019s pick of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and called on the Senate to delay confirmtion.\n\nHe\u2019s criticized Trump\u2019s roll-back of climate change regulations.\n\nHe\u2019s criticized Trump\u2019s foreign trade policy; he\u2019s criticized Trump\u2019s immigration and border plans.\n\nHe\u2019s criticized so much that one wonders, how is he even Republican?\n\nAnd of course, he\u2019s not. Not really. Scott\u2019s another one of those Republican In Name Only pols who muck about the bottom of the political barrel, serving the other party\u2019s bidding by being the token voice of the other side \u2014 while not really being on the other side. As if we\u2019re all somehow fooled.\n\nThe media call him a moderate.\n\nThe Democrats characterize him as a Republican they can work with \u2014 a voice of reason among the other crazy radicals in the GOP.\n\nAnd now, the press is going to fawn over him because he\u2019s become the Republican Who Wants To Impeach Trump \u2014 the message being that, by gosh, if even a Republican sees validity in impeaching Trump, well then, Trump must definitely, decidedly, no doubt about it have done something really impeachably wrong.\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget: Scott\u2019s a RINO. A Democrat in disguise.\n\nVirginia\u2019s governors are elected for two-year terms, but there are no limits on how many terms they can serve. Scott hasn\u2019t yet announced his intent for 2020. But you can be sure he has further political aspirations.\n\nAnd in a state known around the nation as a progressive stronghold, you can be sure Scott\u2019s support for this impeachment inquiry has much to do with advancing his own career and little, nay nothing, to do with the so-called \u201cserious allegations\u201d against Trump.\n\nIf he were an honest or honorable guy, he\u2019d just jump Republican ship and declare membership in the Democratic Party.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
