It\u2019s a hard moment for us, a difficult moment, but we are United \u2013 we need to keep fighting.\n\n\u201cProbably it\u2019s the most difficult time since I\u2019ve been here. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. We cannot score even one goal in [the last] two games. It\u2019s difficult to say something. Sorry to the fans.\n\n\u201cWe conceded a goal from a corner for us. That cannot happen. It is not acceptable. Not just this game; the whole season is not good.\u201d\n\nDe Gea\u2019s sentiments were echoed and endorsed by a manager who appears in danger of breaking all sorts of unwanted records at Old Trafford after the most underwhelming of starts to the season. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create enough chances to deserve to win,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r who expressed sympathy with his centre-half Harry Maguire for missing his side\u2019s best chance, a clear close range first-half header.\n\n\u201cIt was such a disappointing performance, particularly in the first half,\u201d said the Norwegian. \u201cI\u2019d like to say sorry to the fans that we\u2019re not wining games. The second half was better but the decision-making wasn\u2019t good enough. Confidence is a big thing. At the moment when there\u2019s a decision to be made, the players don\u2019t make it instinctively, that\u2019s affecting everyone.\n\n\u201cThese boys give everything they\u2019ve got for the shirt but we\u2019ve given ourselves a very tough task to get to the top six, let alone the top four; we need to start getting results fast. We need to win almost every game. We need to raise our game, especially away from home, we need to raise our supporters\u2019 mood.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r waves to fans after the match. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nSolskj\u00e6r conceded that his side had been caught cold by the rapid counterattack which prefaced Longstaff\u2019s winner. \u201cWe weren\u2019t set up for the counterattack and that shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s just not going for us but I\u2019ve missed bigger chances than Harry.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the international break will be a time of soul searching with a tactical rejig under consideration. \u201cWe need to clear our heads,\u201d said Manchester United\u2019s manager. \u201cWe need to find a solution. We\u2019ve got to make the decision to see if this is the way to keep going [tactically].\u201d\n\nNewcastle 1-0 Manchester United: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nAfter winning his first game as a manager against the club he once played for, Bruce was somewhat happier. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ironic Matty Longstaff\u2019s beat Manchester United in his first game, I\u2019ve been trying for 20-odd years,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager, whose side responded superbly following last Sunday\u2019s 5-0 thrashing at Leicester. \u201cIt was typical Matty that the first thing he said when he came off was \u201cthank you\u201d. It\u2019s been a difficult week but I\u2019m delighted with the performance.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea apologised to the club\u2019s fans for their \u2018unacceptable\u2019 performance in their 1-0 defeat at Newcastle", "authors": ["Louise Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e7506a6993cc6cd58375f7fa4b928a2eb1a273/0_48_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98ebb4c49ce88a657263baaf70d008ee", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
