She told the Tribune she \u201cmust be responsible for the taxpayers who pay for everything that goes on.\u201d\n\nIn addition to bread-and-butter issues, teachers are hoping to force the city to commit to easing a housing crisis that has driven out many of the city\u2019s black residents. More than 16,000 students were counted as homeless in 2018. It means teachers, in addition to educating students, often have to ensure their basic needs are being met.\n\nElementary special-education teacher and union delegate Katie Osgood recalled working at a school where she had a special education student who was homeless and slept in homeless shelters on the weekend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe had to find out if she had food and clean clothes,\u201d Osgood said. \u201cThis is what our little guys deal with.\u201d\n\nDestiny Harris, a 2019 graduate of Whitney M. Young Magnet High and an activist, battled the city for months as it prepared to turn a shuttered school into a police academy. She said it was emblematic of how the city prioritized resources.\n\n\u201cChicago Teachers Union is demanding that students be treated like they matter,\u201d said Harris, now a freshman at Howard University.\n\nThis is the second time Chicago teachers have gone on strike in seven years. In 2012, teachers battled with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel, pushing back on his efforts to institute merit pay, tie teacher evaluations to standardized test scores and expand charter schools. It made the city a focal point in the debate over an education policy that favored charter schools and evaluating teachers through standardized testing, and strained the relationship between Emanuel and the union. Teachers nearly went on strike again in 2016, narrowly averting a job action with a last-minute compromise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is the second time this year that educators in a large urban district have gone on strike, representing the latest in a wave of teacher activism that has swept the nation. In January, teachers in Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-largest school system, went on strike, demanding more resources for traditional public schools. And last year, teachers in a half-dozen states left classrooms for picket lines, demanding higher pay and more classroom resources.\n\n\u201cYou see a common thread from West Virginia to Los Angeles to Chicago,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation\u2019s second-largest teachers union. \u201cIt\u2019s about making the sacrifice to help create welcoming and safe environments for our kids and not taking \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "In addition to bread-and-butter issues, teachers are hoping to force the city to commit to easing a housing crisis that has driven out many of the city\u2019s black residents.", "authors": ["Moriah Balingit", "Reporter Covering National Education Issues", "Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5GXB4Yi5-jZNQ94Tgu8YZl7mzw0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LLO6RNXQI4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
