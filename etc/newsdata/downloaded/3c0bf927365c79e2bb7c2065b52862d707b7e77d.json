Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Ocasio-Cortez grills Zuckerberg over political ad policy MORE (D-Mass.) lashed out at charter schools in her latest \u201cplan\u201d on education is no surprise. She\u2019s counting on the teachers unions to propel her, and the progressive agenda, into the White House.\n\nWarren called for an end a federal program that helps the most successful charters reach more students \u2014 the very charter networks that are proving they can turn out first-generation graduates that not only enroll in college, but earn degrees\n\nSome of the biggest grants go to networks that are partnering with traditional public school districts \u2014 the very schools she says she wants to favor \u2014 to help them achieve similar college graduation rates for their low-income students. Isn\u2019t that what progressives want charters to be, laboratories of innovations for districts?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd just to make things a bit home-town squirmy for Warren, an $800,000 federal grant helped Boston-based Brooke charters build a high school that seems destined to break all records in college success rates for low-income minority students.\n\nWhile no one expected Warren to support charter schools, she could have expressed her opposition a lot smarter. Calling for an end for for-profit charters is fine. She could have tossed in online charters as well. Their track record is spotty, for sure. Calling for \u201ctougher scrutiny\u201d of charters \u2014 always a crowd pleaser for the swelling pushback movement against charters \u2014 would have worked as well.\n\nCalling for the end of the federal Charter School Program, which Congress granted $440 million in its latest budget, may sound like a progressive \u201cgimmie\u201d position to take, but those dollars may rank as some of the smartest money to come out of Washington.\n\nLet\u2019s consider two of the biggest grantees in this year\u2019s awards: The national KIPP charter network got $86 million over five years to create 52 new schools and Texas-based IDEA network got $116 million over the same time period to be used to add new schools and expand grades.\n\nBoth networks are key players in the push to raise the college graduation rates for low-income minority students \u2014 a rate that\u2019s horrifyingly low. Only about 11 percent of first-generation, low-income students earn a bachelor\u2019s degree within six years of leaving high school, compared to 60 percent of students from well-off families.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe problem is not about enrollment: Over the past decade the number of first-generation students enrolling in college has surged. The problem is their graduation rate, which has barely improved. That adds up to a lot of heartbreak and wasted college loans.\n\nBoth KIPP and IDEA are pioneers in reversing that trend. The first KIPP alumni to reach the six-year point graduated at rates well below expectations, which prompted KIPP to use its elaborate data tracking to improve its K-12 practices, develop sophisticated college matching guidance strategies and put together teams that track students through college.\n\nThe rising college graduation rates at KIPP show the impact, and now KIPP is sharing those hard-earned strategies in collaborations with traditional districts: New York City, Newark, Miami and San Antonio. A new collaboration with a major urban district is expected to be announced soon.\n\nA similar story emerges at IDEA, which practices what it calls \u201cdemocratization\u201d of college \u2014 making college enrollment, and graduation, routine for all students, even the low-income students in the Rio Grande Valley, where the network got its start.\n\nToday 45 percent of IDEA\u2019s alumni earn bachelor\u2019s degrees within six years, a rate that\u2019s three times higher than expected, given the demographics of their students. And that success rate keeps growing, despite its expansion. Today, IDEA serves 52,000 students in 95 schools; by 2020 it will serve 102,000 students in 202 schools, thanks in part to the federal grants.\n\nThis is what Elizabeth Warren wants to cancel?\n\nSo if Warren wasn\u2019t thinking of striking out at Brooke, and she wasn\u2019t thinking of harming the promising collaborations we\u2019re seeing between charters and districts around college success, what was she thinking?\n\nRichard Whitmire is a former president of the Education Writers Association.
