He said such talks could take \u201cthree years or more\u201d.\n\nThe current transition period, during which the UK will stay in the single market and customs union but not be part of the EU\u2019s decision-making bodies, finishes at the end of December 2020.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement allows for the transition period to be extended by \u201cone to two years\u201d but Boris Johnson has said he will not trigger such a prolongation.\n\nThere is growing concern among MPs that voting through the withdrawal agreement without amendment will create a new cliff edge in which Brexiter MPs could manoeuvre to get the UK out of the EU\u2019s structures without a deal.\n\nResponding to comments made by the leader of the Brexit party, Nigel Farage, Barnier told MEPs during a debate in the European parliament that the \u201crebuilding\u201d arrangements with the UK would take years to complete.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat we are doing at the moment is unpicking 44 years of cooperation \u2026 I was surprised by Mr Farage \u2026 saying that this agreement opens doors to three further years of negotiation. Well of course.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to negotiate beyond Brexit, and the divorce settlement, maybe two three or more years for some areas to rebuild everything that has had to be unpicked as a result of those who wish Brexit and we have to get a balanced agreement following all the rules to avoid tax, social and environmental dumping. And we have to make sure that we have universities, Erasmus, police, judicial, security, defence cooperation. Foreign policy as well.\u201d\n\nBarnier was speaking in Strasbourg after Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, in effect confirmed the EU would grant a Brexit delay beyond 31 October, with the terms of the extension of UK membership depending on developments in Westminster.\n\nAs MPs prepare for their first vote on the revised Brexit deal, Tusk told the European parliament that the EU\u2019s final response to Boris Johnson\u2019s letter seeking an extension would be given in the coming days.\n\nTusk told MEPs in Strasbourg: \u201cThe situation is quite complex following events over the weekend in the UK and the British request for an extension of the article 50 process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m consulting the leaders on how to react and will decide in the coming days. It\u2019s obvious that the result of these consultations will very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn\u2019t decide.\n\n\u201cWe should be ready for every scenario but one thing must be clear, as I said to Prime Minister Johnson on Saturday, a no-deal Brexit will never be our decision.\u201d\n\nAfter a series of MEPs backed a further delay during a debate in the European parliament, Tusk added: \u201cThank for your responsible position on Brexit and the extension. Through this you show common sense and a sense of dignity.\n\n\u201cAfter what I have heard today in this chamber I have no doubt that we should treat the British request for an extension in all seriousness.\u201d\n\nQ&A What does the 'Benn act' say? Show Hide The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson's government leaving the EU without a deal. It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal. If neither of those conditions are met \u2013 and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on 'super Saturday' \u2013 it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act. The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests. Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 Martin Belam\n\nAn extra hurdle to the UK leaving by 31 October appeared to be put in the way by Guy Verhofstadt, the coordinator of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group.\n\nHe told MEPs that the chamber should withhold its approval for the deal until further assurances were received over the government\u2019s treatment of EU citizens, including 200,000 people who are regarded as being vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe do not want EU citizens involved in another Windrush scandal in Britain,\u201d the former prime minister of Belgium said. \u201cThat cannot happen.\u201d\n\nJohnson was forced to send a letter on Saturday asking to extend the UK\u2019s membership beyond 31 October after the Commons said it would withhold approval of the deal until all the related legislation was passed.\n\nThat move triggered the Benn act, under which the prime minister had to seek an extension to 31 January unless a deal had been approved by the Commons over the weekend.\n\nIn comments that will antagonise the Democratic Unionist party, which is opposing the revised deal, Tusk said the agreement struck had been possible due to Johnson\u2019s acceptance of a border being drawn in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\n\u201c[The deal] is based on the deal that we agreed with the previous government,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cThe changes concern the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland formerly known as the backstop.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:33 Brexit process 'a waste of time and energy', says Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 video\n\nTusk added: \u201cPrime Minister Johnson\u2019s acceptance to have customs checks at the points of entry into Northern Ireland will allow us to avoid border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland and will ensure the integrity of the single market\u201d.\n\nThe president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the EU had done it all could to find a compromise, a process he described as \u201ca waste of time and waste of energy\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt took a huge amount of work to arrive at this point. I listened to Prime Minister Johnson in the same way as I listened to Prime Minister May.\u201d\n\nThe European parliament will not vote on the Brexit deal this Thursday, as had been planned.\n\nAn extraordinary session of the chamber could be called as late as 31 October if Westminster passes the withdrawal agreement through all the legislative stages in both the Commons and the House of Lords. The next sitting of the chamber would otherwise be on 14 November.\n\nManfred Weber, the leader of the European People\u2019s party, the largest group in the EU parliament, said MEPs should not be in a rush to give their support for the deal. \u201cThere is no need to hurry up,\u201d Weber said,", "description": "EU\u2019s chief negotiator says 14-month transition not long enough to reach new trade deal", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6c30a6721826823bb03e679d91e6da571d6115/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbe597d176afa995a6707646b2d3d2a0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
