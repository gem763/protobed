General Assembly here Wednesday, asserting that Tehran will \u201cnever negotiate\u201d with Washington unless the Trump administration pulls back the economic sanctions it has imposed on the Islamic republic over the past year.\n\nIn a tempered but indignant speech before the annual gathering of world leaders, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani lambasted the Trump administration, claiming it \u201cfailed to honor the commitment\u201d that the former Obama administration made to the 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran.\n\nMr. Rouhani decried President Trump\u2019s withdrawal last year from the accord \u2014 a move Trump administration officials say was necessary on claims the deal wasn\u2019t working to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear program and had failed to address other Iranian provocations, including Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile activities that violate U.N. resolutions, as well as its support for militant proxies around the Middle East.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has said the goal of ramped-up U.S. sanctions against Iran is to pressure Tehran into new and wider-reaching negotiation with Washington, Mr. Rouhani said Wednesday that such a negotiation simply won\u2019t happen as long as new American sanctions remain in place on Tehran.\n\n\u201cOur response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government and people of Iran have remained steadfast against the harshest sanctions in the past one and half years and will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with a weapon of poverty, pressure and sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian president did, however, suggest the door could be open to future talks if the Trump administration is willing to return to the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which had eased sanctions against Tehran in exchange for limits to its nuclear program.\n\n\u201cThe only way for talks to begin is to return to commitments and compliance\u201d with the original deal, Mr. Rouhani said. \u201cStop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are satisfied with the minimums, we will also convince ourselves with the minimums,\u201d he said, asserting that the nuclear deal \u201cwas a minimum for you and for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, if you require more, you should also give and pay more,\u201d Mr. Rouhani added.\n\nDespite claims by the United States and several of its allies that Iran is a purveyor of terrorist movements bent on fomenting religious and other unrest in the Middle East, Mr. Rouhani claimed that \u201cwe Iranians have been the pioneers of freedom-seeking movements in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile seeking peace and progress for our nation as well as our neighbors, we have never surrendered to foreign aggression and imposition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot believe the invitation to negotiation of people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions of history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow someone can believe that the silent killing of a great nation and pressure on the life of 83 million Iranians, particularly women and children, are welcomed by American government officials who pride themselves on such pressures and exploit sanctions in an addictive manner against a spectrum of countries such as Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China and Russia,\u201d the Iranian president said. \u201cThe Iranian nation will never ever forget and forgive these crimes and these criminals.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian president\u2019s remarks came hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued in a speech on the sidelines of the General Assembly Wednesday morning that Mr. Rouhani and other Iranian leaders are prone to projecting false narratives about their country at the annual gathering in New York.\n\n\u201cToo many people listen \u2026 and take their words as relevant or important or material or accurate,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at an event hosted by United Against Nuclear Iran, a bipartisan advocacy group focused on stopping the Islamic republic from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cRouhani is desperate to deceive, because the world is awakening to the truth,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cThe truth is that Iran responds to strength, not to supplication. President Trump knows that. More and more nations are beginning to stand up to Iran\u2019s thuggish behavior and disengaging [from Iran] economically.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo went on to assert that Mr. Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal not only to \u201ctake a stand for American national security,\u201d but because \u201cthe deal only made Iran\u2019s blood-thirsty ambitions more brazen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, Iran has a long history of unprovoked aggression \u2014 40 years now \u2014 against its own people, against its neighbors and, indeed, against civilization itself,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cThe list is long, from murdering and torturing their own people to killing Americans from Lebanon to Iraq to harboring al Qaeda even today. Iran has rampaged for four decades and sadly with too few consequences. During the nuclear deal negotiations, Iran\u2019s malign activity didn\u2019t abate one bit.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s developments came a day after Mr. Trump suggested in his own U.N. speech that he was preparing to ramp up sanctions pressure on Iran in the wake of the Sept. 14 attacks against Saudi oil infrastructure \u2014 attacks that U.S., Saudi and European officials have blamed on Iran.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
