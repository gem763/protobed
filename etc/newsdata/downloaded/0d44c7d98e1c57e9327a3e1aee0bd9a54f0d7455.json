I need the slight skips in songs. I need the frantic wiping of the CD in order for it to work properly. I need inconvenience at the highest level.\n\nMore specifically though, I need just one song from that soundtrack and I\u2019ll be set for (after)life: Kiss The Girl.\n\nWe all know it. We all love it. We all used to listen to the bootleg remix of it while imagining ourselves with our main crush, \u00e0 la Prince Eric and Ariel.\n\nBut what exactly makes it stand out from the rest? Good question, no one. Let me break it down for you.\n\nThat intense hit of nostalgia\n\nAs previously stated, the nostalgia factor of Kiss The Girl is next level.\n\nAs soon as the vocals of Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) kick in, I\u2019m immediately transported back to my old bedroom, where I\u2019d built a makeshift boat, sitting opposite the soft toy that was most reminiscent of my crush, pretending that I was being serenaded by a crab.\n\nYeah look, I was a slightly left-of-centre kid, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone out there who did the same thing.\n\nPlease. Anyone? I need this.\n\nSamuel E. Wright\u2019s soothing voice\n\nI don\u2019t know the science behind it, but I have a very strong emotional reaction to Samuel E. Wright\u2019s voice. It\u2019s just\u2026I dunno, in another world I just feel like we\u2019d be a cute couple, y\u2019know?\n\nJust to be completely transparent, I do not want to date a crab \u2013 just the crab\u2019s voice. That\u2019s far less weird.\n\nBut who can deny that E. Wright crooning, \u201cBoy you better do it soon, no time would be beetterrr\u201d is by far the most invigorating line in any song that\u2019s ever existed?\n\nIn a nutshell, Sebastian\u2019s singing voice is perfection.\n\nThe sheer number of remixes it spawned\n\nSure, the OG bootleg remix I mentioned will forever be my #1 (next to the official song), but there are hundreds, nay, thousands of remixes out there which are sure to satisfy each and every one of you.\n\nAnd let me be very clear about this: people do not just remix any old song. They only remix songs that they think are worthy of their time.\n\nSo, if Kiss The Girl has the stamp of approval from DJs, what else really matters?\n\nAshley Tisdale herself froths it\n\nI like whatever Ashley Tisdale likes.\n\nUnnecessary belts around the waist? Sure, why not? I can buy a belt, I earn money now.\n\nDisney crossovers that don\u2019t really make much sense? If I was a Disney star too I would certainly do that.\n\nGetting married to the love of your life? Well sure, in a perfect world I would be happy to do that, but not all of us are Ashley Tisdale so how about we just lay off the scrutiny \u2013 I\u2019m a catch.\n\nThis took an interesting turn, I\u2019m just going to move right along.\n\nIt just makes you feel ~so~ ~good~\n\nA song can be technically perfect but it just doesn\u2019t hit you in the face as you expect it to.\n\nNot only is Kiss The Girl technically a masterpiece (keep in mind I\u2019m neither a music professional nor do I have two working ears), it gets you right in your gut.\n\nNo song has won me over in the same way Kiss The Girl did, and I\u2019m more than content with that. Why search for another tune when my songmate has been with me this entire time?\n\nThe entire song and scene as a whole\n\nIf you told me there was an alternate universe that hadn\u2019t been gifted with Kiss The Girl, I would weep harder than I did when Mum threw out my jar of avocado pips.\n\nFrom the very beginning, when Sebastian requests turtles, ducks, grasshoppers and reeds to act as his percussion, strings and winds, you know it in your heart this is an experience like no other.\n\nI get genuine butterflies when he sings, \u201cShe don\u2019t got a lot to say, but there\u2019s something about her\u201d, and I just can\u2019t explain why. Perhaps we\u2019ve all felt the same way about someone we like? The entire song is essentially the background music to every interaction anyone\u2019s ever had with their ride-or-die.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a time crunch, do yourself a favour and at least watch from 1:56 \u2013 AKA the climax of the song. Everyone\u2019s involved and the suspense will kill you every damn time.\n\nTake my word very seriously: Kiss The Girl will be my funeral song. If I hear anything other than the perfect \u201980s banger then you can expect some serious grave-rolling.", "description": "I just need just one song from 'The Little Mermaid' soundtrack and I'll be set for life:\u00a0'Kiss The Girl'.
