But this was just a few days ago \u2013 Thursday night.\n\nI pulled into the driveway of my home in Alexandria, Va. The antiquated, muddy, AM radio wave ricocheted off the ionosphere. It struggled to reach the equally antiquated car radio in my 2004 Toyota. The signal popped and crackled. The sound wafted in and out like a Caribbean tide.\n\nBut if you were conversant in the lingua franca, you knew exactly what you were listening to. Every few seconds, a few words breached through the miles.\n\nMARTY BRENNAMAN ON FINAL GAME: \u2018HARDEST DAY OF MY LIFE\u2019\n\n\u201cThe batter now\u2026\n\n\u201cAquino, back in the first\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026.second base\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Milwaukee...dugout\u2026\u201d\n\nThis was the final Cincinnati Reds radio broadcast of Marty Brennaman. A game between the Reds and Milwaukee Brewers. For 46 seasons, Brennaman has been the voice of the Reds. His first year in the booth was the first year I was old enough to remotely pay attention to baseball.\n\nBut then came the legendary Reds clubs of 1975 and 1976. The Big Red Machine. Arguably the best teams ever assembled in the game. And everyone was paying attention, regardless of their age.\n\nI learned baseball from three people. My dad, my grandpa and Marty Brennaman.\n\nDad would hit hot grounders to me in the backyard at our home just outside Jacksonburg, Ohio. I\u2019d field them with a thin, Clete Boyer glove that Dad used back in the 1950s. Dad once described to me how badly he got hurt being hit by a pitch by Joe Nuxhall\u2019s brother during a pickup game in Hamilton.\n\nAND THIS ONE BELONGS TO MARTY: BRENNAMAN CALLS FINAL GAME\n\nMy grandfather lived next door. He would regale me with stories about Earle Combs, a Hall of Fame outfielder for the Yankees back in the 1920s and \u201830s who grew up not far from his home in Kentucky.\n\nThen there came tales about Charlie Root, who pitched for the Cubs and grew up just down the road in Ohio. Root is best known as the pitcher who was on the mound for Chicago when Babe Ruth \u201ccalled his shot\u201d in the 1932 World Series.\n\nFinally, there was Marty Brennaman.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter whether we were talking about the 1976 Reds \u2013 with the great Pete Rose and Johnny Bench \u2013 or the revolting 1982 Reds, stocked with the likes of Paul Householder and Rafael Landestoy. Marty was who I heard, all summer long.\n\nAnd, for the record, even though I have only had three brief encounters with Marty, any Reds fan just calls him \u201cMarty.\u201d Everyone knows who \u201cMarty\u201d is.\n\nIt like Bono. Pele. Cher. Oprah. Adele.\n\nAnd Marty.\n\nI recall sitting on the edge of my bed, up way past my bedtime on September 20, 1977. The Reds were in San Diego. Dad said I could listen to the Reds bat in the bottom of the first before going to bed.\n\nI listened intently as George Foster cracked his 49th home run of the season, en route to 52. Marty had the call. Dad asked me: \u201cDo you think he can crack 50?\u201d But then it was bedtime.\n\nI can tell you where I was in our living room on June 16, 1978, listening to Marty call the final out of Tom Seaver\u2019s only no-hitter. We rushed home from my own knothole league game, listening to the 7th and 8th innings on the radio.\n\nI can describe my shock listening to Marty during the second game of the 1990 World Series between the Reds and A\u2019s. I was sitting with a friend high in the center field seats at Riverfront Stadium.\n\nThe game went into extra innings. I scored the game and listened to Marty on a Sony Walkman. Suddenly Marty made a strange request over the air for Reds pitcher Tom Browning to come back to the ballpark.\n\nBrowning\u2019s wife had gone into labor and he apparently headed to the hospital. This was before mobile phones and emails and text messages. The Reds had burned through their pitching staff and worried they might need Browning to pitch if the game went on much longer.\n\nThe only way the Reds could reach Browning was through the sound of Marty\u2019s voice, in hopes he was listening.\n\nThe Reds prevailed in the bottom of the 10th and Browning\u2019s services weren\u2019t needed.\n\nI learned baseball from three people. My dad, my grandpa and Marty Brennaman.\n\nI\u2019ve been in Washington since 1993. I\u2019ve always had a pre-selected button on my car radio for 700 kHz. That\u2019s WLW-AM in Cincinnati. WLW\u2019s carried the Reds games for decades. It\u2019s the only station in the U.S. that ever broadcast at 500,000 watts.\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt flipped the switch to jack up the power from the White House in 1934. Today, WLW boasts a 50,000 watt \u201cclear channel\u201d signal. The station is known for a legendary transmitter located off Tylersville Road, north of Cincinnati. It\u2019s just a mile or two from the home of former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\nIf you live outside of Cincinnati and want to hear the Reds late at night, chances are you can pick them up on WLW anywhere in the eastern United States. The station boasts that it reaches \u201c38 states\u201d at night. That\u2019s true, depending on the weather and cloud skipping. And this is how I have mostly listened to the Reds at night, driving home from work in Washington.\n\nLots of sportscasters are known for signature catchphrases.\n\n\u201cHow about that?\u201d by the Yankees\u2019 late, great Mel Allen.\n\nWhen it was clear the Los Angeles Lakers had things in hand, play-by-play man Chick Hearn would indicate they \u201cput the game in the refrigerator.\u201d\n\nWhen the Washington Capitals defeat an opponent, whether it be the Canadiens or Flyers, John Walton always says \u201cGood morning, good afternoon and good night Montreal (or Philadelphia, or whomever).\u201d\n\nMarty was known for his pronouncement \u201cand this one belongs to the Reds\u201d at the end of every Cincinnati victory.\n\nThere\u2019s something romantic about a tagline like that. But for me, the line I always remembered from Marty is \u201cthere\u2019s a drive\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter if it was George Foster in the 1970s, Dave Parker in the 1980s or Eugenio Suarez today. There was just a way that Marty would utter that phrase.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a drive\u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d hear the crack of the bat. And then Marty\u2019s pitch would dramatically rise with the din of the crowd.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a drive \u2026 deep left center field \u2026.\u201d\n\nWhen you heard Marty say \u201cthere\u2019s a drive\u201d the Reds were about to do something great. That call was shorthand. It wasn\u2019t a home run \u2013 yet. But with Marty\u2019s astute eye and voice, you knew it soon would be.\n\nThose three words \u2013 and just the way Marty said them \u2013 were a theatrical tease. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be a home run. Just a long fly ball to the warning track.\n\nThose words filled with anticipation the few seconds it took the ball to clear the fence. You could see the \u201cdrive\u201d rocketing toward the wall, be it Riverfront Stadium, Wrigley Field or Candlestick Park.\n\nThat expression may have been the most intimate in Marty\u2019s broadcast repertoire. Only those who listened regularly knew the little secret. It was going to be a home run. But he just injected the drama into it. Rarely was Marty wrong on such calls.\n\nMarty\u2019s last game was Thursday afternoon in Cincinnati against the Brewers. Not a night game. Naturally, I was stuck at the Capitol, covering impeachment. I didn\u2019t get to hear any of the game live. And since it was an afternoon game, WLW\u2019s signal wouldn\u2019t have reached Washington until the sun set.\n\nNightfall is when AM signals start skipping off the clouds and ionosphere. People in New York hear stations in Detroit. Listeners in Detroit tune in stations from Nashville. If things weren\u2019t so busy on Capitol Hill, I could have listened to a crisp broadcast online. But what\u2019s the fun in that?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSo I turned on the rebroadcast as I drove home. The signal wasn\u2019t great. WLW is known for its distinctive, diamond-shaped, Blaw-Knox tower, piercing the sky north of Cincinnati. But reception was spotty.\n\nI could only hear a few of Marty\u2019s words. Then, a wall of electronic interference would fill the frequency before dissipating.\n\nJust a few lines here and there.\n\n\u201c\u2026 the right-hander.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201c\u2026 Castillo sights the sign \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 Joey Votto \u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then the signal and the voice disappeared \u2013 for good.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE BY CHAD PERGRAM", "description": "For 46 seasons, Marty Brennaman has been the voice of the Cincinnati Reds.
