No evidence has surfaced to substantiate Musk\u2019s claims.\n\nYet Musk refuses on several occasions to accept total responsibility for falsely calling Unsworth a pedophile. It is, Musk constantly insists, partly Unsworth\u2019s own fault for having insulted Musk in the first place. This \u201cinsult,\u201d of course, was nothing more than going on TV to claim Musk\u2019s efforts to help rescue the children stuck in the cave was a publicity stunt.\n\nBut, beyond that, the transcript provides even deeper insight into the Muskian brain, replete with circular logic, bizarre inferences, sweeping claims about entire people and countries, and great distrust in \u201cthe media,\u201d a term he regularly deploys to characterise all reporters and outlets. It is a distrust rooted in his presumption he can say and do whatever he wants whenever he likes.\n\nWithout knowing the tone in which Musk said many of the remarks, it\u2019s a distinct possibility he was simply not taking this deposition very seriously. Perhaps he was simply cavalier in his responses because he doesn\u2019t care about the legal or financial ramifications of having defamed Unsworth should he be found to have done so.\n\nBut, it\u2019s also possible Musk\u2019s mind is simply a dark place, one where being mean or unfair to him \u2014 or, whatever he interprets as meanness or unfairness \u2014 is grounds for any and all recourse he deems appropriate, including but not limited to wild accusations about one\u2019s criminality and moral fibre.\n\nThis would be in keeping with his attempts to \u201cdestroy\u201d a whistleblower, spying on employees and unions, and the general cultish discourse he promotes among his most ardent followers, fostering a climate against \u201cthe shorts,\u201d big oil, and other groups out to destroy him, a group to which Unsworth belonged as soon as Musk saw the CNN interview.\n\nYou\u2019re either with him or against him.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s clear Musk believes he erred in some capacity by calling Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d and \u201cchild rapist.\u201d In an email to a PR consultant disclosed in other court documents, as reported by BuzzFeed, Musk called himself a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d for doing so and described it as \u201cone of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nBut the transcript lends plenty of evidence to suggest he regrets, in his words, how his actions were \u201cself-inflicted\u201d and gave \u201cthe haters\u201d more ammunition.\n\nIt is not the fact that he did something wrong, but he enabled his enemies, of whom there are many, to insist that he did.\n\nThe following are excerpts from Musk\u2019s deposition on various topics. You can read the full deposition as it was released here.\n\nThailand Is \u201cA Place Where Dodgy People Go\u201d\n\nWhat Pedophiles \u2018Look Like\u2019\n\nOn Whether Pedophilia Is Worse Than Murder\n\nOn Research\n\nOn How Elon Musk Was Maybe Right All Along\n\n\u2018He Seemed Suspicious\u2019\n\nBefore the lunch break, Musk did not use the phrase \u201che seemed suspicious\u201d when asked why he thought Unsworth may be a pedophile; instead, he outlined his theory about Thailand being a \u201cdodgy place\u201d and Unsworth being an old, creepy-looking guy.\n\nAfter they came back from lunch, any time he was asked why he thought Unsworth may have been a pedophile, he replied only with \u201che seemed suspicious.\u201d\n\nSarah Who?\n\nI can think of someone else who is too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t engage in publicity stunts.\u201d\n\nHmmm.\n\nHow Mean People Are Being To Elon Musk\n\nOn The Media\n\nA key aspect of the case involves Ryan Mac, a reporter with BuzzFeed News. When Mac emailed Musk asking for comment on a story about the \u201cpedo guy\u201d tweet, Musk replied to him in an email that began with \u201cOff the record.\u201d\n\nMusk then relayed erroneous information provided by the con man to Musk\u2019s assistant that Unsworth had married a 12-year-old child bride. This information was completely fabricated to bilk Musk out of $74,000 by telling him what he wanted to hear. Musk not only fell for it, but relayed this to Mac in the email, believing Mac would not publish it. However, Mac never agreed to to the conversation being \u201coff the record\u201d and published it.\n\nAs a result, a good portion of the deposition involved what Musk believed he was accomplishing by leaking this unsubstantiated rumour to Mac. In short, Musk claimed he thought Mac would investigate this claim rather than publish the email, because Musk thought we had \u201canother Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\n(Epstein was not a major international news story at the time, although he had been convicted of soliciting a prostitute in 2008; the New York Times reported Epstein was advising Musk for his legal troubles regarding his August 2018 tweet on taking Tesla private, although Musk and Tesla deny that).\n\nIn other words, Musk expected Mac to investigate a completely unsubstantiated claim that just so happened to confirm the very horrid allegation Musk tweeted after 45 minutes of research based on highly circumstantial evidence.\n\nThe fact that Mac instead published Musk\u2019s emails \u2014 which Musk considered a breach of journalistic ethics, even though all parties to a conversation must agree for it to be \u201coff the record\u201d \u2014 was a further stain on the entire media industry, as far as Musk was concerned.\n\nOn Having A Thick Skin Against Criticism\n\nDespite paying a private investigator $74,000 to confirm that a man who insulted him on television is a pedophile, Musk claimed he has \u201ca pretty thick skin at this point.\u201d\n\nOn How Elon Musk Takes Full Responsibility For His Actions\n\nHow Hard This Has Been For Elon Musk", "description": "As part of his ongoing defamation lawsuit filed by Vernon Unsworth, the cave-diver\u00a0Elon Musk called a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter and told a reporter is a \u201cchild rapist,\u201d Musk was deposed by Unsworth\u2019s lawyers, forcing him to talk for hours about the incident in excruciating detail....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/cb1shzc4m1lzfbxnitha.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
