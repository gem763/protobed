White dismissed any notion he dislikes Askren and praised what he has brought to the organization since he joined 11 months ago.\n\n\u201cPeople always think there\u2019s some type of animosity between us and I get excited if he doesn\u2019t win a fight or whatever,\u201d White said. \u201cI like Ben Askren. I like what Ben Askren has brought to the UFC in the three fights that he\u2019s been here, and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s next for him.\u201d\n\nDespite Askren\u2019s losing record with the promotion, White doesn\u2019t regret the November 2018 trade with ONE Championship. In an unprecedented move, the UFC sent former flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson to ONE in exchange for former Bellator and ONE champ Askren, who had been retired.\n\nTuesday, the UFC president even gave Askren partial credit for helping mold Saturday\u2019s UFC 244 headliner between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz into the \u201cBMF\u201d mega-fight it has become. Masvidal\u2019s popularity skyrocketed after he picked up the fastest knockout in UFC history against Askren in July.\n\n\u201cNo regrets, whatsoever,\u201d White said, of the trade. \u201cThat fight was incredible over the weekend. Loved that fight. Fun fight to watch. Ben brought a lot of hype to the UFC. People were excited about him coming in and fighting and seeing what he could do.\n\n\u201cThe fight with Ben and Masvidal was what built Masvidal into what he is right now and going into this weekend. Without Askren, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nGallery Demian Maia def.
