Molnar\u2019s defence did not oppose the application.\n\nNow his mother has spoken publicly for the first time, describing the events of that night as a \u2018tragedy\u2019 - one that her son would have to live with his role in for the rest of his life.\n\nMolnar\u2019s confrontation with Yousef, on March 2 this year, came after a row over a cannabis deal that went wrong report the Manchester Evening News\n\nMolnar was unanimously cleared of the murder and manslaughter of Yousef, 17, in July by a jury on the basis of self-defence and is currently locked up in a young offenders institution.\n\nThe former public schoolboy was locked up after he admitted possessing the knife which caused Yousef\u2019s fatal wound, and perverting the course of justice by lying that someone else had inflicted the fatal injury to police.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt ended the promising life of Yousef, a straight-A student from Burnage who dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon.\n\nAnd it was the devastating climax of Molnar\u2019s descent from the privileged life of independent schools, designer gifts, expensive holidays and nights out that he had enjoyed as the son of two Hale entrepreneurs.\n\nMolnar's mum, the co-founder of a chain of Cheshire nurseries, said her son fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine what Yousef\u2019s parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this,\" said Stephanie Molnar.\n\n\u201cJoshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef\u2019s death in the act of self-defence and the impact of this acceptance is massive.\n\n\u201cHe will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cWe are also acutely aware that the hurt and loss that Yousef\u2019s family is experiencing are infinitely greater than anything we are going through and nothing I can say can make up for or change that.\n\n\u201cThere were no winners in this case,\" she said.\n\nYousef was the academically gifted boy who won a bursary to one of the country's best independent schools.\n\nMolnar was his friend from the leafy outer suburbs, who wanted for nothing materially.\n\nBy the time Josh Molnar fell out, catastrophically, with his friend Yousef, he had left a series of schools and his relationship with his family was strained.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of increasing cannabis use, he began living what his own lawyer described as the double, fantasy life of a juvenile, \u2018middle class gangster\u2019, \u2018playing around with knives\u2019 and getting into fights.\n\nAs the son of company directors Mark and Stephanie Molnar, from Hale, who divorced several years ago, so much more was expected of him.\n\nJosh Molnar\u2019s father Mark, 56, a maths graduate, is a company director and business consultant, while his mother, Stephanie, 51, co-founded of a chain of Cheshire nurseries.\n\nAt the age of 15 Joshua Molnar began using cannabis.\n\nHe was not an academic high achiever like his friend Yousef.\n\nIt was on the rugby field, in school teams and with Altrincham Kersal RFC, where he played for their winning U-16 side, where he expressed himself, and found vent for his aggressive streak.\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\nCultivating a bad boy image, among other private school kids on the streets and at parties in suburbs like Wilmslow and Hale, provided another escape.\n\nHe took to carrying a knife, he has said to protect himself from muggings, and because of peer pressure that made him feel \u2018I should be doing that\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf I had a pretty cool knife I would show it off a bit,\u201d he told his trial.\n\nExactly a year before Yousef died, Molnar was a guest at a party.\n\nHeld at a \u00a31m property, there was security at the gated entrance and youngsters from Greater Manchester\u2019s independent schools made up the guests.\n\nWhen a fight broke out Molnar, his trial heard, punched another boy before stepping back and pulling out a knife from his waistband.\n\nJosh Molnar denied having had a knife at this party in his trial.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nBut young, prosecution witnesses would testify that he seemed to take pleasure in taking out a kitchen knife and - saying nothing - watching as the room fell silent in fear.\n\nThe picture that emerges of Josh Molnar, from some who know him, is not of a nice, middle class boy who fell under bad, more streetwise influences.\n\nRather, he was the bad influence, the one who always took things one step too far.\n\nThis is not something that his family would accept. They say Josh, whose elder sister was a 'Miss Cheshire' contestant in 2017, was a \u2018typical\u2019 teenage boy.\n\nHe was just five when he left his first private school, Hale Preparatory School, after a show of \u2018aggressive behaviour\u2019.\n\nA source close to the family said he had never been expelled from any school and that he had left Hale Preparatory School because he had 'struggled with their teaching methods'.\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\nFrom there he was moved to Bollington Primary School in Altrincham, where he was 'very happy', the source said.\n\nBut his secondary school career was troubled.\n\nAt the \u00a312,000-a-year Cheadle Hulme School, he was considered by some as a flash bully - they recall mundane, high school stuff, like him barging into pupils he didn\u2019t like in the corridors and publishing pictures on his social media of his latest designer purchase.\n\nDuring his time at CHS he struggled academically, his parents got divorced, and, a source close to his family says, 'suffered series of family bereavements'.\n\nHe left when he was asked to repeat Year 9.\n\nAs he got older it seemed he was embarrassed by his comfortable background and determined to kick against it.\n\nThe showy pictures stopped, replaced by pictures of cannabis. He sold his designer clothes and started wearing tracksuits.\n\nFrom there, his parents sent him to Ellesmere College, a boarding school in Shropshire.\n\nIn its guide to public schools, writers at society magazine Tatler describe themselves as 'big fans' of Ellemere's approach.\n\nThe school has a strong focus on sport and nurturing pupils who aren\u2019t naturally academic high-flyers.\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\nMolnar played rugby for the first team and got six GCSEs, before leaving Ellesmere to be closer to home and moving on to a state comprehensive, Wilmslow High School.\n\nHe ended up leaving Wilmslow High - 'by mutual consent' - after cannabis was found in his Hugo Boss bag. It had been stolen from him and when it was found drugs were inside, a source close to his family said.\n\nMolnar would tell friends that at times he had run away from home and talked of sleeping in his mother\u2019s car, telling his subsequent trial, pointedly, that while he could pick his friends, \u2018I don\u2019t always get on with my family\u2019.\n\nA source close to the family said neither of his parents was aware he had ever run away from home, and that they \u2018don\u2019t recall\u2019 him ever sleeping in his mother\u2019s Alfa Romeo.\n\nAny suggestion that he had been allowed to go off the rails, the source said, was 'complete nonsense'.\n\nHowever, selfie videos, where he acted out violent scenarios, charted his descent into what his own lawyer would call \u2018idiotic fantasies\u2019, fuelled by a love of drill music tracks which glorified the use of knives.\n\nHe filmed himself with a machete in the mirror of his bedroom, sniggering as he made violent stabbing motions towards another boy, the point of the blade coming just a few centimetres from his face.\n\nThe other boy makes stabbing movements towards Molnar with his own knife as both laugh.\n\nAnother clip shows Molnar using a lit firework to light a spliff before tossing it over his shoulder to explode near a car.\n\n(Image: MGS/MEN Media)\n\nThe soundtrack is a drill tune by Next Up, with lyrics like, \u201cBack out my shank (knife) and dip it, ballistic; Push in my shank and twist it.\u201d\n\nIn February this year, Molnar shot another video where he appeared to make slashing movements across the throat of someone in the distance, with a machete, before poking the blade into a mattress.\n\nThen, on March 2, he stabbed somebody for real; his friend Yousef Makki, through the heart, on Gorse Bank Road in leafy Hale Barns, an act the jury accepted, by their verdicts, was self-defence.\n\nYousef, 17, was a pupil at Manchester Grammar School. Unlike Molnar, his parents would never have been able to afford independent school without financial help.\n\nThe knife that killed Yousef was delivered with enough force that the hilt went into his chest, inflicting a 12cm deep wound which went right through his heart.\n\nEarlier that night, Molnar, Yousef and a third boy had been socialising.\n\nThey had smoked some cannabis, and there were knives - the third boy had bought them online.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe third boy had also arranged to buy some more cannabis - \u00a345 worth, from an alleged dealer with a teenage, Cheshire clientele.\n\nInstead, Molnar ended up getting beaten up by the alleged dealer\u2019s friends, and his custom-built Starling \u00a32,000 carbon fibre racer, a gift from his father, was tossed over a hedge.\n\nNeither Yousef, or the third boy, helped him in the fight.\n\nMolnar\u2019s trial heard he blamed the third boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, for arranging the ill-fated drug deal, and he claimed Yousef had taunted him, calling him a \u2018pussy\u2019.\n\n\"I can't remember if Yousef laughed a bit or said something but I got more annoyed,\" Molnar told jurors.\n\nHe admitted he pushed Yousef after the jibe, and said Yousef answered with a punch.\n\nAs Molnar put it in his trial: \u201cI was just kind of a bit confused. I wasn\u2019t really expecting it.\n\n\"And then I have looked up and Yousef is quite annoyed at me at this point.\n\n\"I believe I saw him, he had taken his knife out. And he looked like he was going to hit me again, saying \u2018c\u2019mon, c\u2019mon\u2019.\n\nYousef, he said, would not back down from a confrontation, and he \u2018just didn\u2019t want to get beaten up again\u2019.\n\nFeeling \u2018quite on edge\u2019, \u201cI have started to take a knife out of my pocket\u201d, he said. \u201cI just wanted to warn him off, trying to get him to leave me alone.\u201d\n\nAsked how the knife ended up \u2018inside Yousef\u2019, he said: \u201cNot really. I do not know what I did. I don\u2019t know how it all came together.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath, Molnar described how he made an attempt to help Yousef, taking off his top and using it to try and stem the bleeding.\n\nBut he also threw the blade into a bush and lied that the knifeman must have been in a car, a VW Polo, that he claimed had driven away from the scene of the stabbing.\n\nSentencing him in July, the judge Mr Justice Bryan told Molnar: \u201cThe backdrop to your offending is depressingly all too familiar.\n\n\u201cA warped culture whereby the possession of knives is considered to be \u2018cool\u2019 and \u2018aesthetically pleasing\u2019, and knives are routinely carried on our streets.\n\n\u201cMix that with youth as well as drugs and drug dealing, as in the present case, and it is a recipe for disaster and the tragic, but all too predictable, events that unfolded on the early evening of 2 March 2019, with the loss of the young life of your friend Yousef Makki who had everything to live for, and the irreparable harm that resulted, which has changed the lives of his family and friends for ever.\u201d\n\nToday Molnar remains locked up, subject to a 16-month detention and training order.\n\nIt is expected he will be released in March.\n\nThe other boy who was out with him and Yousef on the night is serving a four-month sentence for possessing a knife.\n\nSeven months on from the night that changed his life for ever - and horrifically ended that of his friend, Molnar's mother Stephanie says this.\n\n\u201cCircumstances on the night of 2 March led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife.\n\n\u201cHe was found not guilty to the charges of murder and manslaughter, based on self-defence, in a unanimous verdict.\n\n\u201cThe events of that night were a tragedy.\n\n\"These were three friends going out on a Saturday.\n\n\"They should all still be here to lead fulfilling lives but they are not.\n\n\u201cThe jury heard the evidence over a four-week trial.\n\n\"Every single one of the twelve members of the jury, diverse in age, ethnicity, gender and background, felt not guilty was the right verdict based purely on the evidence.\n\n\u201cWe fully support all the positive steps to celebrate Yousef\u2019s life and anything positive in the future that can come from this tragedy is something we would welcome and contribute to in whatever way possible.\u201d", "description": "Yousef Makki died after he was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife in the upmarket village of Hale Barns, Cheshire", "authors": ["John Scheerhout", "Image", "Manchester Evening News", "Pa", "Men Media", "Mgs Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20503777.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Josh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
