The issuance consists of notes backed by a pool of first-ranking Australian automotive-loan receivables originated by Mercedes-Benz Financial Services Australia Pty Ltd (MBFSA). The notes were issued by Perpetual Corporate Trust Limited as trustee for Silver Arrow Australia 2019-1 (the issuer). Silver Arrow Australia 2019-1 ----A AU3FN0051041; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; RO:Sta ----B AU3FN0051058; Long Term Rating; New Rating; NRsf KEY RATING DRIVERS Obligor Default Risk: Fitch derived asset specific default and recovery base-case expectations and applied a granular approach to setting default multiples and recovery stresses, using historical loss data provided by MBFSA. Fitch's gross default and recovery base-cases of 2.6% and 45.0%, respectively, are developed from an asset pool comprised of lease receivables backed by motor vehicles with weighted-average (WA) seasoning of 18 months and an average contract balance of AUD53,070.04. Fitch expects stable asset performance supported by sustained economic growth in Australia. Fitch forecasts steady GDP growth of 2.3% for 2020, stable labour markets and low interest rates to support the Outlook on the rated notes. Cash Flow Dynamics: Fitch completed full cash-flow modelling and determined that full and timely payment of principal and interest was made to the class A notes in all 'AAAsf' scenarios. Structural Risk: Fitch evaluated structural risk through the review of transaction documentation and structural features. A liquidity reserve, funded by issuance proceeds, will ensure stable cash flow for the class A notes and trust expenses. Counterparty Risks: Fitch evaluated counterparty risk through the review of transaction documentation and structural features. Servicer, Operational Risk: All assets were originated by MBFSA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler AG (DE: ) (A-/Stable/F1). Fitch undertook an onsite operational review and found that the operations of the originator and servicer were consistent with the market standards for auto lenders. Residual Value Risk: There are no residual value positions in the portfolio; however, refinance risk exists as 79% of the remaining outstanding contract balances have balloon contracts. Refinance risk on loans with a balloon payment has been considered by Fitch in the default multiples. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and is likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased credit enhancement may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Expected Rating Sensitivity to Increased Default Rates Original rating: AAAsf Defaults increase 10%: AAAsf Defaults increase 25%: AAAsf Defaults increase 50%: AA+sf Expected Rating Sensitivity to Reduced Recovery Rates Original rating: AAAsf Recoveries decrease 10%: AAAsf Recoveries decrease 25%: AAAsf Recoveries decrease 50%: AAAsf Expected Rating Sensitivity to Increased Defaults and Reduced Recoveries Original rating: AAAsf Defaults increase 10%/recoveries decrease 10%: AAAsf Defaults increase 25%/recoveries decrease 25%: AAAsf Defaults increase 50%/recoveries decrease 50%: AA-sf USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was available. Fitch conducted a review, as part of its ongoing monitoring, of a small targeted sample of MBFSA's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis, according to its applicable rating methodologies, indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: - loan-by-loan data provided by MBFSA as at 30 September 2019; - loss and recovery data provided by MBFSA as at 30 June 2019; and - transaction documentation provided by Allen Overy, the issuer's counsel. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
