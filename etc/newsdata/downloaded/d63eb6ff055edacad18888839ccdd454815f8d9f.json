Robb) and Nate (Jurell Carter) onto a fishing boat after learning about their secret affair from Peter Barton (Anthony Quinlan).\n\nThe soap badboy set pulses racing in a heart-stopping scene, as he expressed to Nate his plan to make Moira's secret lover pay.\n\nEventually Cain's anger got the better of him, and he knocked Nate out off-screen before trapping him in the below-decks of his boat.\n\nAs Nate escaped, the pair began a dramatic fist fight while Moira begged her husband to just let him go and divorce her instead.\n\nNaughty: Cain had been plotting his revenge after discovering that his wife Moira had been having a steamy affair with Nate\n\nViolent: Things eventually came to blows as Cain and Nate were involved in a fist fight, which led the farmhand to drop the bombshell that he was Cain's son\n\nIt was then that Nate dropped the explosive bombshell, saying: 'You're pathetic, old man. Nate. Short for Nathaniel. Look at me and remember.'\n\n'You see me now... Dad? You must have known that I'd come for you one day. I'm your son.'\n\nCain's utter bewilderment at the revelation was difficult to hide, and as Moira asked whether this was a joke, Nate's response that her 'use was over' hinted that their affair was simply part of his revenge plot.\n\nScary: Using his real name Nathaniel, Nate revealed he headed to the village for revenge after Cain abandoned him at a young age\n\nWho's the mum? Given Nate's age, it is thought that Cain fathered him before he first arrived in the village in 2000\n\nIn the midst of the drama, the boat's sail swung around and knocked Moira into the water, and the episode ended on a heart-stopping cliffhanger as her fate hangs in the balance.\n\nViewers were left reeling by Nate's explosive bombshell, with many taking to social media to share their reaction.\n\nSeveral fans also shared their horror as it dawned on them that Nate had sleeping with his stepmother.\n\nStunned: Cain struggled to hide his bewilderment after learning about his long-lost child, with viewers at home equally shocked\n\nCreepy: Several fans were quick to point out that this meant Nate had been sleeping with his stepmother\n\nOne posted: 'So Nate basically slept with his stepmum?' while another wrote: 'I'm sorry but am I the only one who's creeped out that Nate slept with his dad's wife...'\n\nSome viewers also noted Nate's previous relationship with Amy Wyatt, who of course fell pregnant aged 15 after a steamy night with Cain years earlier.\n\nOne tweeted: 'I don't know what sounds worse... Moira is having an affair with her stepson... Or Nate's 'girlfriend' Moira is the mother of Nate's half-brother???'\n\nAnother added: 'So Nate slept with his stepmum and also dated his little brother's mum... my head sweetie!'\n\nNaughty: The episode ended on a cliffhanger, as the boat's sail knocked Moira into the water, with her fate hanging in the balance\n\nFreaky: Several viewers also noted that Nate's previous relationship Amy Wyatt meant he was also involved with his younger brother's mum\n\nNate first arrived in the Emmerdale village in April, and quickly ruffled feathers when he became involved in a steamy affair with Rhona Goskirk, before eventually catching Moira's eye.\n\nGiven Nate's age, it appears that Cain fathered him before his first appearance in Emmerdale in 2000, but bosses have hinted that viewers will learn more about his complicated history in the coming days.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether Moira will be rescued from the water, and whether she and Cain can recover from another marital crisis.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Wednesday at 7pm on ITV.", "description": "Viewers took to social media to share their shock at Cain's secret child, while others were horrified to realise that this meant Nate had been sleeping with his stepmother.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/08/20073020-0-image-a-45_1571816937687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
