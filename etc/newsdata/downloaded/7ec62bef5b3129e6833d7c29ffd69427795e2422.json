But as she trotted round the 40,000-seat Khalifa stadium in Doha on Sunday night she was greeted by banks of empty seats and a ghostly silence.\n\nObservers reckoned there were no more than 1,000 people still in attendance and many of them were journalists tapping away to deadline. Asher-Smith\u2019s mother later tweeted she had seen more spectators at England Athletics\u2019 age-group championships in Bedford.\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce confirms status with 100m world championship gold Read more\n\nAsher-Smith\u2019s teammate Beth Dobbin was even more blunt. \u201cI watched Dina\u2019s victory lap and that was a bit heartbreaking because what she did was insane and there was no one there,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like she was robbed of that moment.\u201d\n\nThe organisers have since blamed the start of the working week and an event schedule designed for European TV audiences. But that cannot hide a simple fact. These world athletics championships have been a PR disaster for athletics, for the sport\u2019s president, Sebastian Coe, and for Qatar, a country which has spent the past decade buying up rights to host major events, including the 2022 football World Cup.\n\nEven Denise Lewis, the 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion who is not known for controversial views, has stuck the boot in, telling the BBC: \u201cOur governing body has let our athletes down massively.\u201d Meanwhile Eurosport, which holds Olympic TV rights across Europe, also mocked the lack of crowd for the women\u2019s sprint final. \u201cThe Doha crowd roars with approval,\u201d it tweeted with a gif of tumbleweed.\n\nIt is all a far cry from the promises made by Qatar in its first bid for these championships in 2011. \u201cNo empty seats,\u201d the prospectus said, adding that \u201cthe atmosphere surrounding the world championships will be fantastic\u201d.\n\nThat was a pledge that always looked spurious. But at least it was made several years ago. Coe, who was on the evaluation commission that inspected Doha\u2019s bid for the 2019 championships and is reported to have later voted for it, said he hoped it would be \u201cspectacular\u201d just a few days ago.\n\nInstead the stadium has often looked at least half empty, even though large parts of it have been covered with fabric and the capacity reduced to 21,000. And that is despite attendances being bolstered by organisers giving thousands of migrant workers from Africa and India free tickets.\n\nOn Monday they claimed that attendances had been \u201csolid\u201d for the first two days, at around 70%, but conceded \u201cnumbers were down on our expectations on day three with the start of the working week in Qatar\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe challenge we face with a competition schedule that is geared to support global TV viewership is that some finals are not starting until the late evening. This impacts on the number of spectators remaining until the end of the session. We are confident that our renewed efforts will encourage the local community to come and witness the stunning performance of the world\u2019s best athletes.\n\n\u201cWe know it is a balance and we are pleased global viewers can tune in to watch the live action from Doha.\u201d\n\nThis, though, was a disaster foretold. After Doha was controversially awarded the championships \u2013 having offered \u00a323.5m towards extra sponsorship and a promise to build 10 new tracks around the world minutes before the vote in 2014 when it defeated Eugene and Barcelona \u2013 the former IAAF board member Helmut Digel called it \u201cincomprehensible\u201d.\n\nHowever Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Odriozola, a Spanish IAAF executive well-versed in the lingua franca of sports politics, cut to the heart of the matter. \u201cAll Doha have is money,\u201d he said.\n\nControversial Christian Coleman wins men\u2019s 100m gold in 9.76sec Read more\n\nFor many sports federations that is enough, whatever the athletes may think. Yet with every passing hour, more of them are voicing discontent. The French decathlete Kevin Mayer, the world record holder, has called the championships a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Other athletes have claimed they are being treated as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d by a governing body that has forced marathon runners and race walkers to compete in 31C heat and high humidity, which has led to some being carried off the course in wheelchairs.\n\nPlay Video 0:39 'I'm 32, I'm a mum and here I am breaking barriers,' says Fraser-Pryce after 100m win \u2013 video\n\nAs Belarus\u2019s Volha Mazuronak, who finished fifth in the women\u2019s marathon in the early hours of Saturday morning, put it: \u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t finish. It\u2019s disrespect towards the athletes. A bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take the world championships here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.\u201d\n\nNo one doubts that track and field has lost most of the momentum gained from the London 2017 world championships, which were watched by 750,000 people in the flesh and millions more on television. On Sunday evening Adam Gemili admitted it had been a \u201cweird\u201d event, adding: \u201cIt makes the British championships look quite good.\u201d A colleague, the race walker Tom Bosworth, was even more cutting: \u201cThe only people carrying this sport are the athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IAAF truly should be ashamed.\u201d\n\nHowever, Coe continues to maintain that track and field must venture into new territories to help spread the word. Tell that to the 1,972 athletes from 208 countries here in Doha. For many this will be the pinnacle of their careers. How sad, then, that it has turned into a nadir for their sport.", "description": "Empty seats and ghostly silence have been the sad feature of the world athletics championships in Doha \u2013 a PR disaster for the sport, the IAAF, Sebastian Coe and Qatar", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df7f43f96f4bc0a6efde65c92170522a0f55fb4b/0_148_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ee1595b3b4dfc0446b67d80b830eb48", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
