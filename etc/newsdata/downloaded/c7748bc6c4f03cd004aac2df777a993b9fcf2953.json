But I\u2019m scared so, for now, it\u2019s all about contour.\"\n\nHow she is making her nose look 'thinner' has been dismissed by fans, who refuse to believe that she hasn't gone under the knife.\n\nFans of the reality star have been critical when she has seemingly turned to photoshop to manipulate images, especially when the Kardashian family make claims of being \"real\".\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nSo, the state of Khloe's nose has fallen into one of three categories, whether it has been changed cosmetically, digitally enhanced or, as Khloe has claimed, been contoured by expert make up artists.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
