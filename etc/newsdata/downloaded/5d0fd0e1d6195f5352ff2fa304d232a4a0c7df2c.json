The Justice Department said the scheme was focused on the bank\u2019s precious-metals desk, involving offices in New York, London and Singapore, and involved thousands of fraudulent orders intended to benefit the traders\u2019 positions.\n\nIn addition to spoofing and other federal offenses, the indictment charged all three men with racketeering, a claim that is more typically found in cases against organized crime entities. Authorities said it represents the first time that defendants accused of spoofing electronic derivatives markets have been charged with racketeering.\n\n\u201cBased upon the fact it was conduct that was widespread on the desk, it was engaged in thousands of episodes, that it is precisely the kind of conduct that the RICO statute is meant to punish,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said Monday.\n\nSpoofing involves submitting orders to exchanges that traders have no intention of fulfilling, according to regulators. The problematic orders are typically sent in large volume on one side of the market, creating the appearance of greater interest in buying or selling. When spoofers get the trade they want, they cancel the other orders, sometimes leaving their counterparties with a loss.\n\nJPMorgan placed Mr. Smith, 55 years old, and Mr. Nowak, 45 and a managing director at the firm, on leave, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Jordan, 47, left the bank in 2009 and subsequently worked as a metals trader at other banks.\n\nAn attorney representing Mr. Smith declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Jordan couldn\u2019t be reached. Lawyers for Mr. Nowak said in a statement that he plans to fight the charges and expects to be exonerated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly regrettable that the DOJ decided to go forward with a prosecution of Mike Nowak, who has done nothing wrong,\u201d said the lawyers, David Meister and Jocelyn Strauber of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.\n\nWhile the CFTC has settled numerous civil cases related to spoofing charges, prosecutors have a mixed record when it comes to advancing criminal charges.\n\nA jury in Connecticut last year acquitted Andre Flotron, a former UBS Group AG metals trader accused of spoofing futures markets. The Justice Department in April dropped spoofing charges against another defendant, Jitesh Thakkar, after a federal jury in Chicago couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict in his trial.\n\nMr. Benczkowski said Monday that the case against the JPMorgan traders is stronger than prior ones because the alleged misconduct went on for many years, and the government has the backing of \u201cmultiple cooperating witnesses.\u201d\n\nThe JPMorgan traders earned millions of dollars and imposed losses on counterparties totaling tens of millions, said Mr. Benczkowski. He declined to be more specific about the alleged gains from fraud on a call with reporters.\n\nThe indictment includes some electronic messages attributed co-conspirators of Messrs. Smith, Nowak and Jordan. One of the men, Christian Trunz, pleaded guilty last month in Brooklyn federal court to one count of conspiracy to engage in spoofing and one count of spoofing. An attorney for Mr. Trunz didn\u2019t return a phone message seeking comment.\n\n\u201cSo you know its gregg bidding up on the futures trying to get some off,\u201d Mr. Trunz wrote in one message, according to the indictment.\n\nThe response from an alleged co-conspirator: \u201csweet mate.\u201d\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday separately filed a civil enforcement action in the Northern District of Illinois against Mr. Nowak and Mr. Smith.\n\nThe other co-conspirator identified in the criminal case, John Edmonds, pleaded guilty in October 2018 to commodities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, commodities fraud, price manipulation and spoofing.\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, the CFTC said Mr. Trunz settled its civil charges and doesn\u2019t face any immediate financial penalties because of his cooperation with the regulatory agency.\n\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "description": "The Justice Department said it has charged a former and two current JPMorgan Chase precious-metals traders for their alleged participation in a racketeering conspiracy involving precious metals futures contracts.", "authors": ["Dave Michaels", "Dave Sebastian"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107430/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
