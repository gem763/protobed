Meanwhile, the main card also features the latest chapter in the career of one of the sport\u2019s most remarkable athletes, as well as the eagerly awaited Bellator debut of one of the best kickboxers on the planet.\n\nHere are four burning questions ahead of Saturday night\u2019s fights.\n\n****\n\nDoes Rory MacDonald or Douglas Lima walk away with the belt \u2026 and $1 million?\n\nThe main event in Uncasville serves up a million-dollar championship rematch as Rory MacDonald looks to retain his title against the man he defeated to win the belt in January 2018, Douglas Lima, in the final of the Bellator welterweight grand prix.\n\nMacDonald (21-5-1 MMA, 3-1-1 BMMA) followed up that title win with an unsuccessful shot at the middleweight strap before moving back home to 170 for the tournament and retaining his title with a draw against Jon Fitch and a unanimous decision over Neiman Gracie.\n\nWhile MacDonald heads into the weekend with a loss, a draw and a win from his last three, Lima (31-7 MMA, 13-3 BMMA) arrives in Connecticut on the back of a submission over former champion Andrey Koreshkov and stunning knockout of Michael Page in the semfinals. On paper, at least, the Brazilian carries the momentum edge, but MacDonald is a big-game performer.\n\nWill \u201cThe Red King\u201d retain the title and walk away with the check, or will \u201cThe Phenom\u201d become a three-time Bellator champ and bank a cool million in the process?", "description": "MMA Junkie's Simon Head runs down the top storylines heading into Bellator 232, where the welterweight grand prix reaches its conclusion.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rory-macdonald-douglas-lima-bellator-222.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
