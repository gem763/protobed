Recently, Denver-based talk show host Benjamin Allbright reported that the Patriots were among several teams that inquired about the availability of Denver Broncos wideout Emmanuel Sanders. On Sunday, Evan Lazar of CLNS Media confirmed that the Patriots called the Broncos about Sanders several weeks ago, but Denver wanted New England to call back closer to the deadline because they want to determine their record first before making any move.\n\nThe Broncos dropped to 2-5 following an embarrassing 30-6 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday. Lazar also reported that the Patriots called the Atlanta Falcons and inquired about wide receiver Mohamed Sanu. Earlier, former Patriots executive Mike Lombardi suggested that the Patriots work out a trade with the Falcons for Sanu. In the offseason, the Patriots already had a package in place for Sanu but the Falcons backed out at the last minute.\n\nThe Falcons may want to sell before the deadline after dropping to 1-6 following a 37-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday where Sanu caught just one pass for three yards. Whether the Patriots acquire Sanu or Sanders, both of them would make immediate impact to the Patriots\u2019 offense. This season, Sanu has caught 32 passes for 310 yards and a touchdown while Sanders has caught 30 balls for 367 yards and two scores for the Broncos.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Looks like Broncos general manager John Elway changed his mind as per latest report by ESPN's Adam Schefter. According to Schefter\u2019s sources, the Broncos are now open to listen to offers for Sanders and they expect to receive a third-round pick or better for the veteran wideout.\n\nSchefter said the Broncos received a fourth-round pick from the Houston Texans for veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas last year, and they expect more for Sanders.\n\nPatriots eyeing another Bengals wideout\n\nIt was also reported that the Patriots are eyeing Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green via trade. But Lazar reported that the Patriots are also interested in the Bengals other receiver Alex Erickson, who went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\nErickson had his best game so far in his Bengals\u2019 career after catching eight passes for 137 yards and no touchdown in their 27-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. Erickson\u2019s performance against the Jaguars surpassed his total receiving yards in his first six games where he tallied only 109 yards on 11 catches. Meanwhile, the Bengals announced that Green won\u2019t play until after the Oct. 29 trade deadline, according to Schefter.\n\nEarlier, the Bengals declared that they won\u2019t trade Green, but could change their mind after slipping to 0-7 this season.", "description": "The Patriots almost traded for Sanu in the offseason but the Falcons backed out at the last minute.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Ken Kluska", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Brady Talks About Trade Deadline", "Ny Tabloids Mock Jets Qb Darnold After Loss To Patriots", "Patriots Betting Favorite To Land Broncos", "Wr Sanders", "Inquired About Bucs", "O.J.
