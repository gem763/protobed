(AP) - The Winnipeg Jets extended their winning streak over the New Jersey Devils to seven games in a way coach Paul Maurice can\u2019t recall in 25 years of coaching.\n\nThe Jets overcame a late 4-0 second-period deficit, got shootout goals from Kyle Connor and Blake Wheeler and spoiled the debut of No. 1 overall pick Jack Hughes by rallying to beat the Devils 5-4 on Friday night.\n\n\u201cNot four,\u201d Maurice said when asked the last time a team he coached overcame a four-goal deficit. \u201cI have had some threes. I don\u2019t remember a four. I am sure over the last 25 years it has happened. I just can\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nThis one will be hard to forget, for both teams.\n\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d said Wheeler, who scored the game winner on a backhander past Mackenzie Blackwood in the fourth round. \u201cWe stayed with it and stayed together as a group, just kept fighting and one after another we just kept getting bounces go our way.\u201d\n\nDmitry Kulikov, Jack Roslovic, Mathieu Perreault and Neal Pionk scored for the Jets. Laurent Brossoit was outstanding in making 35 saves. He made three stops in the shootout, including one on a shot by Hughes.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy, I can\u2019t say I have experienced a game quite like that,\u201d Brossoit said after the Jets avoided an 0-2 start. \u201cWhen you are down by that much you are just working on things and stay focused and make sure it doesn\u2019t turn into a (bad) show.\u201d\n\nBlake Coleman had two goals for New Jersey, including a spectacular one-handed shot while falling down. Nikita Gusev also tallied in his first NHL game and Sami Vatanen added a goal for the Devils, while defenseman P.K. Subban had two assists.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any excuses in here,\u201d Subban said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn from this as a group. And It\u2019s not about pointing fingers. It wasn\u2019t one specific guy.\u201d\n\nBlackwood was in the game because starter Cory Schneider was hurt early in the Jets\u2019 three-goal third period. Coach John Hynes had no update on his condition after the game.\n\nTrailing 4-0 in the final minute of the second period, the Jets started their comeback with 11 seconds left when Kulikov beat Schneider on a shot from the point.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem like much until the Jets turned it on in the third period despite playing their second game in 24 hours.\n\nRoslovic cut the lead in half, scoring on a rebound at 2:41. Schneider was hurt either making the initial save or on the goal, and he had to come out of the game.\n\nThe Jets kept coming, while Brossoit denied several New Jersey chances.\n\nShortly after making a stop in close on Nico Hischier, Perreault cut the lead to 4-3 at 7:17on a shot from between the circles.\n\nPionk tied the game with 7:25 left in regulation on a shot that eluded a screened Blackwood.\n\nFor the first 39 minutes, the sellout crowd had nothing but cheers for their new-look Devils, whose lineup included newcomers Wayne Simmonds, Subban and Gusev.\n\nThe highlight was Coleman\u2019s one-hand shot with the butt of his stick that went over the glove of a stunned Brossoit.\n\nGusev gave the Devils a 1-0 lead in the first period and Coleman sandwiched goals around one by Vatanen to seemingly put them in control.\n\nNOTES: For the second straight game the Devils were called for a too many men on the ice penalty. \u2026 Subban had a big hit early, knocking down Connor in center ice. \u2026 Hughes had a great scoring chance on his only shot. He played 18 shifts and 15:12. \u2026\u201dIt was an OK start,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt was a pretty good first period, trailed off a little in the second and obviously in the third wasn\u2019t my best. But luckily we have the opportunity to play tomorrow.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJets: Continue four-game road trip to open season at Islanders on Sunday night.\n\nDevils: At Buffalo on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Winnipeg Jets extended their winning streak over the New Jersey Devils to seven games in a way coach Paul Maurice can't recall in 25 years of coaching.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/jets_devils_hockey_21993_c0-221-4205-2672_s1770x1032.jpg?85f3d85a516662b32300570494b79e8fba694d3f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
