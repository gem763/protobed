It found that violence and foul language have crept into family programming without any resistance from advertisers or regulators.\n\n\u201cTV is more dangerous for families today than when the system was devised,\u201d said Peggy Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, who spoke Tuesday to reporters about the results.\n\nParents Television Council President Tim Winter said the \u201ccontent creep\u201d falls squarely on the shoulders of a failed governmental experiment to allow the television networks to regulate themselves for age-appropriate content via the industry-supported TV Parental Guidelines Oversight Monitoring Board.\n\nMr. Winter pointed to a study in May by the Federal Communications Commission that found numerous flaws with the monitoring board and noted that the rating system has not changed in more than 20 years.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it has not but content has,\u201d Mr. Winter said.\n\nIn its report, the watchdog group reserved its strongest criticism for The CW network\u2019s TV-PG sitcom \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d noting its frequent references to sex.\n\nAn episode that first aired on Feb. 9, 2018, features a character saying: \u201cI let go in bed. I like to submit. To be dominated. That\u2019s why Rafael and I got along so well.\u201d\n\nThe report also flagged a Nov. 19, 2017, TV-PG episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d on Fox.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tolerate having to hear Esteban have sex with my unborn child,\u201d a character says.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s having sex with your unborn child\u2019s mother,\u201d a second character replies.\n\nAccording to the Parents Television Council, depictions of violence increased 28% between 2007-2008 and 2017-2018, with shows reporting 1.89 to 2.42 instances of violence per TV-PG episode.\n\nBut profanity notched the biggest gains, from an average of 3.81 instances of foul language on TV-PG episodes in 2007-2008 to 5.46 instances per episode in 2017-2018 \u2014 a 43% increase.\n\nThe report noted a Nov. 14, 2017, episode of the now-canceled ABC series \u201cKevin (Probably) Saves the World\u201d that included \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201clittle bitch\u201d in an exchange between two characters discussing vandalizing a lawn by burning anatomical shapes into it.\n\nThe study calls for reforming the monitoring board system \u201cto serve the needs of parents and families.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue here is not censorship. What we\u2019re trying to avoid is bad surprises,\u201d said Nell Minnow, who blogs as the Movie Mom and agrees with the study\u2019s recommendation to break the industry\u2019s control over its ratings system. \u201cYou cannot be the pitcher and the umpire.\u201d\n\nIn May, the FCC reported to Congress a litany of inadequacies with the TV Parental Guidelines Oversight Monitoring Board, including the absence of a working phone number and lack of transparency about its oversight.\n\nThe industry created monitoring board as a response to threats from Congress to create stricter regulatory control over Hollywood.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
