In exchange, the public got access to their financial records and the opportunity to invest.\n\nToday, more companies are staying private longer and going public after multiple rounds of private funding that drive up valuations. With more than enough money from private investors or big companies that can acquire them, these companies can hold out on going public until they are billion-dollar behemoths.\n\nThe number of public companies in the U.S. has fallen by 50% over the last 20 years.\n\nThe big picture: As more disruptive companies eschew IPOs, a smaller and smaller subset of wealthy investors are yielding more of the gains from U.S. industry and innovation, leaving scraps for everyone else.\n\n\"We have to do something about that,\" said the SEC's Clayton.\n\nGo deeper: Automating food from farm to front door", "description": "Very few of the companies driving the change are public.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/zOxr0mK9nIkh4AYnL2zTTmPEVCY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/22/1563796109855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-22"}
