But the commercial reality of that fine? It's not that big.\"", "description": "Some of Supercars' biggest names have slammed DJR Team Penske, with Craig Lowndes saying the Ford outfit's safety car controversy will forever overshadow the...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
