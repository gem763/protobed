He and his family collected \u00a36million in June from share sales just ahead of the balloon bursting.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's founders and biggest investors, Peter Hargreaves (pictured) and Stephen Lansdown, were nowhere to be seen at the firm's Bristol annual general meeting\n\nAll the noise at the AGM came from disgruntled Hargreaves private investors, with the big institutional holders such as Blackrock nowhere to be seen.\n\nBig battalion investors should have recognised that for all the hand-wringing by HL chief executive Chris Hill, the firm has delivered a huge wound to Britain's savings culture.\n\nThere is no escaping the fact that while Lansdown and Dampier have enriched themselves through share sales, the quarter of HL's investors exposed in one way or another to Woodford funds have been disastrously let down.\n\nThat a further 35,000 investors have signed up to HL since the imbroglio emerged is tragic.\n\nThey should be aware that the analysis behind its Wealth 50 Report is pathetically weak and that they are often directed to the kind of momentum funds which could be smashed in a prolonged downturn. Moreover, choice is decided as much by fee discounts as forensic analysis.\n\nThe only people getting really rich by following HL recommendations are the company grandees, thanks to its fantastical profit margins in the financial sector in which low interest rates have damaged earnings elsewhere.\n\nMany of those rendered vulnerable by HL's faulty research and analysis are people who trusted the group with pension fund savings after then chancellor George Osborne removed the obligation to buy an annuity.\n\nThey have gone from the frying plan into the fire. The anger and frustration over the way in which Woodford has collected \u00a38million in fees while gating their life savings is palpable.\n\nHL did suspend its own management fees for handling Woodford funds.\n\nThat is the very least it could have done. It has hurt savers of all ages, and behaved as if it were guiltless in the most perturbing episode in modern fund management.\n\nRetail therapy\n\nConventional wisdom that retail is dead needs challenging.\n\nIt is doubtless the case that the toxic combination of business rates, upward-only rent reviews and digital spending is reshaping shopping.\n\nBut a High Street presence on the right terms, and offering a good experience, still has value.\n\nWhen I was in Washington DC in the summer, it was uncomfortable to see that adjacent to where a defunct Barnes & Noble bookstore once stood there is now an attractive Amazon store with books on current affairs, politics and biography \u2013 as you might expect in the US capital.\n\nHere in Britain HMV, now Canadian owned, is showing the same faith in Birmingham with a sizeable new store offering vinyl, CDs and a gig experience.\n\nPrivately-owned Sunderland-based Hays Travel is seeking to prove the High Street travel agent is not dead by buying 555 of Thomas Cook's stores. BT is planning to rebadge some of its EE mobile stores to offer better fixed-line and broadband service.\n\nAs one set of tenants moves out, new occupants eventually move in.\n\nIn fashionable Fulham, west London, what was until recently M&S has become Pure Gym, which is also moving into a former Topps Tiles outlet a few miles away in Richmond.\n\nFashionable fitness-wear brand Lululemon has engaged a leading UK commercial property agent to colonise Britain.\n\nIt has already opened several locations in central London and is in the prowl for more across the country. Knightsbridge department store firm Harvey Nicks is doing fine in elegant locations in Leeds and Manchester.\n\nSwish bakery chain Gail's is expanding like billy-o. So, for that matter, is Newcastle-based mass market baker Greggs.\n\nWith creative thinking and better experiences, it is possible to resist a negative narrative.\n\nSilver screen\n\nAmid the gloom about the direction of the economy, film is a shimmering star. Latest growth data shows that over the last two years movie production soared by 27.4 per cent.\n\nIt was the main factor behind a services recovery in the last three months.\n\nMay the force be with you.", "description": "Hargreaves Lansdown's founders and biggest investors, Peter Hargreaves (pictured) and Stephen Lansdown, were nowhere to be seen at the firm's Bristol annual general meeting.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
