The NIC system did work. He applied to get a gun. He was denied a gun,\" Wester said at a news conference on Monday, but declined to say why Ator was rejected.\n\nSources later told ABC News that Ator was rejected because he was mentally ill.\n\nAtor was terminated from his job at the Journey Oilfield Service in Odessa on Saturday morning, just hours before he allegedly went on a killing spree and minutes before he contacted law enforcement to complain about his employer, Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said at the news conference.\n\n\"Right after that firing, he called Odessa Police Department's 911, and so did his employer,\" Gerke said. \"And basically they were complaining on each other because they had a disagreement over the firing.\"\n\nDuring the calls to the 911 center and a subsequent call to the FBI National Tip Line, Ator never made any threats of violence, Gerke said.\n\nCity of Odessa/FBI via AP\n\nChristopher Combs, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in San Antonio, described the calls Ator made to law enforcement as the \"rambling and incoherent\" gibberish of someone in \"great mental distress.\" He said Ator complained that the employer who fired him was holding him against his will.\n\n\"Frankly, the dispatchers, the call takers, couldn't figure out what he was talking about,\" said Combs who added that the FBI tip line gets 800,000 calls a year.\n\nCombs said investigators do not believe being dismissed from his job prompted Ator to allegedly commit the massacre.\n\n\"He showed up to work in a very distressed mental state. So it's not because he got fired,\" Combs said. \"This did not happen because he was fired. When he showed up to work he was already enraged.\n\n\"He was on a long spiral of going down,\" Combs said. \"He didn't wake up Saturday morning and walk into his company and then it happened. He went into that company in trouble. He's probably been in trouble for a while.\"\n\nThe shootings unfolded at 3:15 p.m. local time on Saturday, about 15 minutes after Ator called the FBI's National Tip Line, Combs said.\n\nThe first victim in the rampage was a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper who pulled the suspect over for failing to signal before making a turn, Gerke said. As the trooper approached the car, Ator allegedly opened fire with an AR-type assault rifle, wounding the trooper, he said.\n\nGerke said the trooper had no prior knowledge of the phone calls Ator made to law enforcement before pulling the suspect over.\n\nAtor then allegedly drove around in his vehicle randomly firing at victims in 20 different locations, including a car dealership and outside a movie theater, police said.\n\nThe victims killed ranged in age from 15 to 57.\n\nOne of the victims was Mary Granado, a 29-year-old U.S. Postal Service worker, who Ator allegedly shot to death during a carjacking, Gerke said.\n\nThe suspect allegedly ditched his car and stole Granado's postal service van after killing her, Gerke said. He continued driving around the Odessa area, firing at people at random, the chief said.\n\nThe alleged killer then sped toward the Cinergy center, a local entertainment complex that includes a cineplex and a laser-tag range.\n\nGerke said the carnage could have been much worse had the police not killed Ator before he got inside a crowded movie theater.\n\nA cellphone video taken by a witness showed the suspect speeding toward a police roadblock outside the theater before a police officer in a marked SUV rammed the stolen postal van on the driver's side, causing it to spin out and stop. Within seconds, police opened fire on the van, killing the driver inside, Gerke said.\n\nGerke said the motive for the shooting may never be known because Ator is no longer alive to answer questions.", "description": "Seven people were killed and more than 20 injured in the mass shooting.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/texas-shooting-06-ap-jc-190831_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
