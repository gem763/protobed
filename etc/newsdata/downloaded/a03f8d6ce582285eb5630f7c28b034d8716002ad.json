Their economies will be fully exposed to the foibles of global financial markets. This will be \u201cdisruption\u201d with a vengeance.\n\nLibra's benefits superfluous\n\nLibra\u2019s rollout will require the approval of regulators. Its promoters, claiming significant social benefits, argue that it deserves to be approved. Libra will lower the cost of cross-border payments. It will reduce the expense of remittances. It will provide financial services to the unbanked masses.\n\nWhile these arguments for Libra are not false, they are superfluous. The cost of cross-border payments is already falling. Ripple, a San Francisco-based company, uses distributed-ledger technology and a proprietary cryptocurrency to facilitate transfers between commercial banks at a small fraction of their earlier cost.\n\nBecause Ripple cooperates with commercial banks subject to know-your-customer rules and other regulatory requirements, its payments technology doesn\u2019t pose the same problems as Libra. Banks like Santander already use this technology to connect Europe with the United States. They are now poised to connect the US with Latin America.\n\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), through which interbank transfers are traditionally made, is not taking this challenge lying down. It has tested a system, \u201cSWIFT gpi Instant,\u201d for transferring funds between banks in North America, Europe, and Asia, settling payments in as little as 13 seconds. SWIFT gpi Instant piggybacks on newly installed nonstop instant payment systems such as Singapore\u2019s Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) and the European Central Bank\u2019s TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS). Once the Federal Reserve implements a round-the-clock real-time payment and settlement system in 2023 or 2024, this network will be further enhanced.\n\nWhile SWIFT\u2019s pilot doesn\u2019t rely on distributed-ledger technology, which verifies transactions by recording their details in multiple places at the same time, other initiatives do. For example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been exploring use of this technology in domestic and cross-border payments in their \u201cProject Stella\u201d (not to be confused with the video game of the same name).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, there is already considerable progress in solving the problem of serving the unbanked courtesy of telecom-based services like M-Pesa, which originated in Kenya but is now used from Afghanistan to Albania. Users need only a cellphone and a contract with their telecom-services provider, not even a bank account. They can then top up their balance at the corner store, protect it with a PIN, and use it to make payments to anyone with an account.\n\nDisruptive effect\n\nPlatforms like M-Pesa are being used not just for payments but also to provide other financial services, such as micro-loans. In other words, they already trump Libra when it comes to banking the unbanked.\n\nCriticisms of such services focus on their cost. In countries where the dominant telecom company faces little competition, it can insist on high margins. Here, it would seem, is where Libra could have disruptive, pro-competitive effects.\n\nBut this is wishful thinking. The reality is that the same telecoms that successfully lobby against entry into their own industry will lobby against regulatory authorisation for Libra.\n\nWhere the problem for economies and financial services is lack of competition, residents of developing countries need to look to their own regulators and politicians. The remedy for their woes is not going to come from Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBarry Eichengreen is an author and professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.", "description": "The world is waking up to the dangers Mark Zuckerberg's new digital currency would pose to economic and financial stability.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4898%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_483%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/38b4d710084f7e94e93ffa4d2d1810c01011a3c5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
