Fecal transplantation is the transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a patient. It is most commonly used to treat recurring C. difficile infection - spread by bacterial spores found within feces. It can also be used to treat gastrointestinal infections such as colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Antibiotics often kill off too many 'good' bacteria in the digestive tract. Fecal transplants can help replenish bacterial balance. The stool contains roughly 1,000 different species of bacteria that act as probiotics. The transfer is completed via: Enema (fluid injected into the lower bowel through the rectum)\n\nOrogastric tube (a tube inserted through the mouth, past the the throat, and down into the stomach)\n\nA pill containing freeze-dried material\n\nThey were then randomly assigned to receive either a placebo, which was 30 grams of a solution containing their own feces, or solution from a so-called 'super-donor' at either 30 grams or 60 grams.\n\n'We had a carefully selected donor from several candidates who had traits known to affect intestinal microbiota positively,' lead author Dr Magdy El-Salhy, a professor in the department of clinical medicine at the University of Bergen, told NBC News.\n\n'Overall, the donor was healthy, had been breast fed, consumed a nutritious diet, took no regular medications, was a nonsmoker and had taken antibiotics only a few times.'\n\nPatients were given the doses through a tube that was into the mouth and down the throat to the small intestine.\n\nResearchers asked the patients three months later about their symptoms. After treatment, 23.6 percent of those who had the placebo reported an improvement in symptoms.\n\nIn the super-donor group, 76.9 percent that received 30 grams felt an improvement as did 89.1 percent of those who received 60 grams.\n\nThey also found that, in some cases, symptoms went away entirely for 35.2 percent of the 30 gram super-donor group and 47.3 percent of the 60 gram group.\n\nMeanwhile, just 5.5 percent of those who received placebos reported that they had no more symptoms.\n\nDr El-Salhy told NBC News that the effects are still noticeable one year later.\n\n'The preliminary results [suggest] most, 90 to 95 percent, of the responded patients are still well and about 50 percent are still \"cured\",' he said.", "description": "A new study from the University of Bergen in Norway found that 47% of IBS patients who received two fecal transplants from a 'super donor' said their symptoms completely disappeared.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/22/20008690-0-image-a-63_1571693535881.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
