The Ukrainian press quickly dubbed him \u201cMonica Zelenskiy.\u201d\n\nThings went from bad to worse when Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, abruptly resigned soon after. Following on the heels of the removal of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled for not being loyal enough to Trump, it looked like Ukraine had few allies left in Washington.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for the embattled country. There are several potential silver linings for Kyiv to the political crisis playing out in Washington.\n\nThe drama unfolding in the U.S. could offer Zelenskiy a window of opportunity to seek out alternative solutions to ending the conflict.\n\nFirst off, with all eyes on Ukraine, Trump is unlikely to attempt to strong-arm Zelenskiy into doing him any more favors. Congress \u2014 which unequivocally supports Ukraine over Russia \u2014 will be the one determining future policy, not the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d obsessed White House, and the legislative branch is likely to be more sympathetic to requests for military aid and other assistance needed to fight back against Moscow\u2019s aggression.\n\nIf the backlash against Trump is strong enough and a Democratic nominee goes on to win the 2020 presidential election, the new administration is also likely to take a much more muscular approach to Russia and step up American support for Ukraine.\n\nSecondly, the current turmoil may remind Ukraine it doesn\u2019t need to compromise its principles for American support.\n\nAmerican help, after all, is more illusory than real. Ukraine\u2019s dreams of NATO membership are still unlikely within the next 10 years. The Javelin anti-tank missiles the U.S. State Department recently approved for sale to Ukraine are purely defensive in nature, as Ukraine is barred from using them on the front lines in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDuring his campaign for the presidency, Zelenskiy had pushed back against his hawkish predecessor\u2019s purely military solution to the conflict with Russia and famously went down on his knees during a heated campaign debate to humbly apologize to the \u201cmothers of those who had been killed in the conflict.\u201d\n\nLike most Ukrainians, he realizes that the answer to ending the war is more political than military. He has resumed paying pensions to those living in the \u201coccupied regions\u201d and has also pushed for Ukrainian media active in the region to broadcast in Russian to win back \u201chearts and minds.\u201d\n\nThe drama unfolding in the U.S. could offer Zelenskiy a window of opportunity to seek out alternative solutions to ending the conflict. Zelenskiy may find he has more leeway to push to de-escalate the situation directly with the Kremlin, instead of giving in to pressure from nationalists who like to pretend that Ukraine can win against a full-scale military assault by Russia.\n\nThe recent prisoner swap with Russia, as well as Ukraine\u2019s decision to move its troops back from the line of contact, has created fresh hope that scheduled peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Paris, under French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s aegis, might bear fruit later this month. A muscular peace deal that finally ends the brutal fighting is finally within sight.\n\nIt\u2019s even possible that with Trump facing impeachment and gearing up for a major election race, the U.S. president could decide to throw his weight behind a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. It would be an opportunity to show the American public that his friendship with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin can reap political dividends. That\u2019s a big \u201cif,\u201d but not impossible in this present climate.\n\nThe third bright spot for Ukraine is that Zelenskiy could make a strong case for rewiring Kyiv\u2019s allegiances to decrease its dependence on Washington and open up to an increasingly multipolar world.\n\nIt will give some Ukrainians a dark pleasure to be responsible for playing a role in the potential impeachment.\n\nMost Ukrainians still treat Americans as \u201cwhite gods\u201d \u2014 throwing money and influence at well-connected Yanks like Paul Manafort and Hunter Biden \u2014 while condescending to the rest of the world. Seeing that America also has \u201cfeet of clay\u201d and is an unreliable partner might encourage Ukrainians to take India, China, South America and those from the \"non-white world\" more seriously. At the very least, it might force them to forge alliances further afield, as its nemesis Russia has done.\n\nThere\u2019s also chance that worldwide attention on Ukraine could provide a boost to its burgeoning tourist industry and, in turn, its struggling economy. Ryanair and other budget airlines are already flying to a number of Ukrainian cities, and people are increasingly paying attention to the country. Hollywood icon Tom Cruise was in Ukraine last week and met Zelenskiy while scouting locations for a new film.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the embattled nation, which has struggled to present an appealing image to potential visitors. Increased Hollywood interest in Ukraine (think HBO\u2019s lauded \u201cChernobyl\u201d documentary series) will raise the country\u2019s profile worldwide. Kyiv could well become the next Prague or Budapest.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that Ukraine has all the prerequisites for becoming one of the top tourist destinations in the world,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Tourism Minister Volodymyr Borodiansky wrote on Facebook as his country dominated the news cycle.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the famous Ukrainian sense of irony. It will give some Ukrainians a dark pleasure to be responsible for playing a role in the potential impeachment of a president their enemies in Moscow may have helped to elect.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens in the history of the United States, Ukraine will remain the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. President.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s former Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin joked on Twitter. \u201cNot a very fun prospect. But now everyone knows what we are capable of.\u201d\n\nVijai Maheshwari is a writer and entrepreneur based in Moscow.
