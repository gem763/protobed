Highs: 78 to 82.\n\nTonight: Mostly clear. Lows: 53 to 61.\n\nTomorrow: Mostly sunny. Highs: 80 to 84.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nHigh pressure builds in for the next few days, and while temperatures will still be warmer than average, our humidity will stay low enough to keep things comfortable. Yes, we still need rain, and any showers that eventually do come Sunday won\u2019t put much of a dent in our precipitation deficit, but at least the weather will give us a more gentle transition into autumn.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Light winds blow mainly from the west. Confidence: High\n\nTomorrow night: Mostly clear again, with lows ranging mainly through the 60s. Confidence: High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nThursday is another mostly sunny day, but temperatures lean a bit toward the hotter side as highs reach the mid- to upper 80s to about 90 degrees. Like Monday, humidity remains quite low, so the heat will be quite tolerable. Thursday night is mostly clear again, with lows in the low 50s to low 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFriday should continue the mostly sunny streak with temperatures knocked back a bit, into the upper 70s to low 80s for highs along with low humidity once more. Mostly clear Friday night, with lows in the upper 50s to 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nThe heat builds once again for the weekend, with partly sunny skies and highs in the upper 80s to low 90s on Saturday and potentially the low 90s on Sunday, with a chance to break some records. Humidity will still be tolerable, however. Lows on Saturday night dip into the 60s to about 70 under a few clouds. Some scattered showers are possible Sunday afternoon and evening, but confidence is low given this dry pattern. We need something bigger to break us out of it.
