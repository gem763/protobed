We look forward to safely and sustainably returning our nation to the surface of the Moon by 2024.\u2019", "description": "Billionaire's rocket scientists will design a craft to land a spacewoman on the lunar surface.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SEC_66654091_1571763334.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
