You won't need an A-lister budget to visit. Day passes start from FJ$169, approximately \u00a361. It's not the cheapest day out but considering it's a luxury private island, we're impressed.\n\n(Image: Malamala Beach Club)\n\nNot bad if you want to live out that A-lister lifestyle.\n\nEven luxury extras won't have you breaking the bank; you can hire day beds from FJ$50 (approx \u00a318) for two people, or if you want to treat yourself to a cabana with private butler services, you're looking at rates of FJ$85 per day for two people (approx \u00a330).\n\n(Image: Malamala Beach Club)\n\nThe day pass also includes complimentary Wi-Fi, towel service and non-motorised sports equipment. Food and drink however isn't included.\n\nHowever, even with food and drink on top, it's easily possible to enjoy the full day out, activities and all, for less than \u00a3100 each if there are two of you heading on an adventure.\n\n(Image: Malamala Beach Club)\n\nUnfortunately, actually getting there won't be a budget-friendly break for Brits. That's because the beach club is located just off the coast of Fiji, which isn't exactly next door.\n\nStill, if you are planning a trip and want a day of total relaxation, it could be worth leaving a space on the itinerary.\n\n(Image: Malamala Beach Club)\n\nYou can find return flights to Fiji from around \u00a3958pp on Skyscanner, but you won't find any direct flights; most include a stopover in the USA, normally at Los Angeles.\n\nThe total journey time from London takes about 24 hours, but if you're flying from Manchester it can take 26 hours, or from Birmingham it can take 27 hours.

TripAdvisor has a handy round-up of cheap hotels near Port Denarau with prices from \u00a362 per night.\n\n(Image: Malamala Beach Club)\n\nIt takes about 25 minutes to reach the island on a high-speed catamaran from Port Denarau (and there are coach pick-ups available from the various resorts nearby).\n\nIt's worth noting that Malamala Beach Club isn't available for overnight stays; it's very much a day trip destination.\n\nEver since it first opened its doors two years ago, the island has proven a hit with visitors - it boasts some pretty great TripAdvisor reviews - and in the last 12 months alone it's welcomed over 34,000 visitors.\n\nYou can find out more on the Malamala Beach Club website.", "description": "Malamala Beach Club is total luxury with infinity pools and butlers but you don't need a big budget to visit", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Malamala Beach Club"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559154.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Malamala-Beach-Club.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
