Here\u2019s why we like to watch.", "language": "en", "text": "Nachos, popcorn, sandwiches, dumplings, peanut butter, a possibly poisoned pot roast and rat blood.\n\nThese are things that Brad Pitt has ingested on screen over the course of his three-plus-decade career. They are things among many things because it seems that while Brad Pitt might not chew the scenery in his films \u2014 he\u2019s often praised for restraint \u2014 it seems that he\u2019s always eating.\n\nOn YouTube, you can find videos showing clips of Pitt, in various roles, shoveling, tossing and otherwise cramming various foods into his mouth. There are lengthy versions, like one simply titled \u201c15 Minutes of Brad Pitt Eating,\u201d as well as a snappier three-minute compilation (together, these two videos have been viewed almost 1 million times).\n\nThere are supercuts chronicling the food the actor eats in individual movies, including \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven\u201d and \u201cMoneyball.\u201d Some viewers even saw a scene in the recent Quentin Tarantino movie \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d in which Pitt\u2019s character whips up and then devours a box of neon-hued mac and cheese, as a sly meta-style wink to Pitt\u2019s reputation for cinematic noshing. (Tarantino\u2019s ode to the end of Tinseltown\u2019s golden era is littered with so many self-referential touches that such a read seems plausible.)\n\nMaybe Brad Pitt doesn\u2019t eat any more than any other actor out there. That\u2019s possible, says Fabio Parasecoli, a professor of food studies for New York University at Steinhardt who has studied food on film (and even wrote a dissertation on men eating in blockbuster movies). With the exception of food-focused films, such as \u201cChef\u201d or \u201cBig Night,\u201d he notes, most eating that goes on in movies is overlooked.\n\n\u201cFood is so embedded in scenes of everyday life, so you don\u2019t notice it \u2014 but it\u2019s there,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen you hyper-focus on the eating that\u2019s going on your screen, he says, you might find there\u2019s more than you\u2019d think. In other words, if you go looking for a particular actor eating, you will likely find examples of it. And Pitt\u2019s oeuvre is relatively vast, spanning some 60 movies \u2014 and a lot of chewing.\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate, though, that Pitt does eat more than your average actor. In which case, maybe it\u2019s just time to face it: We just like watching Brad Pitt eat.\n\nBut why?\n\nCaroline Liem, a casting director and professor at Pace Performing Arts, says one reason might be that Pitt is just really, really good at on-screen eating. \u201cHe\u2019s the Laurence Olivier of eating!\u201d she says.\n\nEven talented actors sometimes screw up what seems like a simple task, she says. They might take bites that are too big. Or tiny bites \u2014 a dead giveaway that they\u2019re dealing with multiple takes. But Pitt? \u201cHe makes it look like an actual human being eating, and you don\u2019t get that a lot,\u201d Liem says. \u201cHe\u2019s just one with food.\u201d\n\nSome of Pitt\u2019s eating is central to a scene. Think of him in \u201cInterview With the Vampire,\u201d in which his brooding undead Louis is trying to kick the habit of human blood and instead chomps into rats. Or in \u201cMeet Joe Black,\u201d when his titular character \u2014 who is death itself inhabiting a human body \u2014 eats peanut butter for the first time.\n\nOther times, eating has been a way to subtly express something about his character. As Rusty Ryan in the Ocean\u2019s franchise, he\u2019s forever snacking. Pitt has described in interviews why that was \u2014 Rusty\u2019s a con man and always on the move, he said, so he figured he wouldn\u2019t have time for a proper sit-down meal. And in 2011, he told NPR\u2019s Terry Gross that his \u201cMoneyball\u201d character\u2019s snacking was a way of showing his intensity and \u201cneed to accomplish something.\u201d\n\nLiem says actors can use food to develop their characters in ways that might not even be called for in a script. \u201cAs a casting director, I know that an actor knows the character inside and out \u2014 better than anyone else on set \u2014 and so if the actor says the character needs a sandwich, he needs a sandwich,\u201d she says.\n\nAsked in a recent interview about the mash-up video of his chomping, Pitt described it as just that: part of his craft. \u201cI like to busy myself,\u201d he said.\n\nParasecoli sees the fixation on his eating as an overlap of our collective obsession with food and celebrities.\n\n\u201cFood is at the forefront of culture,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, depending on where we shop, whether we\u2019re vegan or paleo or shop at Walmart \u2014 it\u2019s all a sort of performance of our identity.\u201d At the same time, Parasecoli says, we like to see famous people doing normal human things (which might explain why tabloids are filled with pics of grocery-shopping stars). Pitt\u2019s \u201chumanity is more visible if he\u2019s doing something we all do,\u201d he says.\n\nUltimately, perhaps we can simply blame our brains\u2019 ancient hard-wiring for this not-so-guilty pleasure. After all, millions of people watch mukbang, the genre of videos depicting people eating gut-busting quantities of food. And others tune in to videos meant to trigger ASMR, or \u201cautonomous sensory meridian response,\u201d a pleasurable sensation that can be brought on by watching people do mundane things like drumming their fingers, brushing their hair \u2014 and eating.\n\nCraig Richard, a professor at Shenandoah University and the founder of ASMR University, says the experience of watching Pitt eat is different from either of those categories, though it can trigger the same response. \u201cWith mukbang and ASMR videos, they are meant to relax you \u2014 so the intent isn\u2019t there, but the effect might be,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason watching someone eat can be pleasurable, he says. Millions of years ago, when our ancestors might have encountered someone who looked friendly eating in front of them, the cues were clear: Here is a nonthreatening person in possession of food that is demonstrably edible. \u201cWhen you see that, that is reason to switch your brain from fight-or-flight to a calm state,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s just that we \u2026 you know, like to watch hot people do stuff? Blame science for that, too. Richard described experiments where even infants trained their gaze longer on certain people: \u201cWe do seem to be hard-wired to prefer to stare at people determined, through whatever cultural definition, to be attractive.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nFood plays a starring role in the \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 movie\n\nIn Ali Wong\u2019s new Netflix rom-com, food is the butt of jokes \u2014 and her true love\n\nMerriam-Webster toasts an expanding food and drink vocabulary with a \u2018tallboy\u2019 and \u2018matcha\u2019", "description": "Blame his talent \u2014 and our brains' hard-wiring.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Food Reporter", "September At Pm", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
