Several made provocative accusations that President Donald Trump inspired the deadly shooting in El Paso, Texas, last month.\n\nOn the policy front, Bernie Sanders claimed his approach to health care has a stamp of approval from everyone who studies such matters, which is not the case. Joe Biden misrepresented recent history when he said the administration he served as vice president didn\u2019t put migrant kids in \u201ccages.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the assertions in the third round of Democratic primary debates, the first to have all qualifying contenders square off in one night:\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE, former U.S. representative from Texas, on last month\u2019s mass shooting in El Paso: \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve learned about resilience, I\u2019ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas, in the face of this act of terror, that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States. It killed 22 people, and injured many more, we were not defeated by that. Nor were we defined by that.\u201d\n\nJULIAN CASTRO, former U.S. housing secretary: \u201cLook, a few weeks ago a shooter drove 10 hours inspired by this president to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Nobody has claimed that Trump \u201cdirected\u201d the shooting, as O\u2019Rourke suggested.\n\nEarlier in the debate, O\u2019Rourke had said the shooter was \u201cinspired to kill by our president,\u201d an accusation also made by Castro.\n\nIt is hard to know for sure what led the gunman to open fire inside a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people. The suspect posted a manifesto online before the shooting that echoed Trump\u2019s comments on immigration. Yet he said his own views \u201cpredate Trump and his campaign for president.\u201d\n\nThe screed spoke of what the suspect called a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas,\u201d railed against immigrants and warned of an imminent attack. Nearly all of the victims had Latino last names.\n\n___\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: \u201cWe have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: This oft-repeated line by the Vermont senator is an exaggeration.\n\nThere are nearly 200 countries in the world, many with people mired in extreme poverty that most Americans would struggle to fathom. Poverty is also a relative measure in which someone who is poor in one nation might look rather prosperous in another.\n\nBut the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development updated its child poverty report in 2018. The United States had an above average level of child poverty, but it was not at the bottom of the 42 nations listed in the report. The United States still fared better than Russia, Chile, Spain, India, Turkey, Israel, Costa Rica, Brazil, South Africa and China.\n\n___\n\nJOE BIDEN: \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: His comment about cages is wrong.\n\nThe \u201ccages\u201d - chain-link enclosures inside border facilities where migrants have been temporarily housed, separated by sex and age - were built and used by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has been using the same facilities as the Obama administration.\n\nDemocrats routinely accuse Trump of using cages for children without acknowledging the same enclosures were employed when Biden was vice president.\n\nThe Obama administration also separated migrant children from families under certain limited circumstances, like when the child\u2019s safety appeared at risk or when the parent had a serious criminal history.\n\nBut family separations as a matter of routine came about because of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d enforcement policy last year. More than 2,500 children were separated from their parents at the border and a government watchdog has said it\u2019s possible thousands more were separated. Obama had no such policy.\n\n___\n\nSANDERS: \u201cEvery study done shows that \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman and child in this country.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Not exactly.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this year that total spending under a single-payer system, such as the one proposed by Sanders, \u201cmight be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system.\u201d\n\nThose features involve details about payment rates for hospitals and doctors, which are not fully spelled out by Sanders, as well as the estimated cost of generous benefits that include long-term care services and no copays and deductibles for comprehensive medical care.\n\nA report this year by the nonprofit Rand think tank estimated that \u201cMedicare for All\u201d would modestly raise national health spending, the opposite of what Sanders intends.\n\nRand modeled a hypothetical scenario in which a plan similar to legislation by the Vermont senator had taken effect this year. It found that total U.S. health care spending would be about $3.9 trillion under \u201cMedicare for All\u201d in 2019, compared with about $3.8 trillion under the status quo.\n\nPart of the reason is that \u201cMedicare for All\u201d would offer generous benefits with no copays and deductibles, except limited cost-sharing for certain medications. Virtually free comprehensive medical care would lead to big increases in the demand for services.\n\n___\n\nKAMALA HARRIS, on Trump: \u201cThe only reason he has not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: We don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the only reason. Former special counsel Robert Mueller didn\u2019t go that far in his report on Russian intervention in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice.\n\nHarris, a California senator, is referring to a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents are immune from indictment. Mueller has said his investigators were restrained by that rule, but he also said that they never reached a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.\n\nIn Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony in July, he said his team never started the process of evaluating whether to charge Trump.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Colleen Long, Michael Balsamo, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Mary Clare Jalonick and Amanda Seitz contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ten Democrats seeking the presidency tripped over some details Thursday night as they sparred in a debate thick with policy and personal stories.
