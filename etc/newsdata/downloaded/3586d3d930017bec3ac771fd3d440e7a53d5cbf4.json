But the actress best known for her role as Aria Montgomery in Pretty Little Liars refuses to use her busy schedule as an excuse to not speak out about important issues.\n\nIn fact, the 30-year-old, who has been acting for half of her life, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that using her platform to bring awareness to causes and conversations that she cares about is vital.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Woah people are watching,\u2019\u201d Hale says of her realization that she had a significant platform once PLL aired in 2010. \u201cIt was right when Instagram was getting big too and I was like, \u2018Well people are really watching everything we\u2019re doing and saying.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe actress quickly adopted the mantra \u201ca lot is given, a lot is expected,\u201d recognizing her passion for entertaining while having to acknowledge the power of her voice. Ultimately, she decided to act on that power, although voicing her opinion to her over 31 million combined social media followers isn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\u201cPeople are taking notice and I want to make a mark in a world that\u2019s bigger than just myself,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the double-edged sword with social media, right?\u201d\n\nIn the past couple of years, Hale has used her social media to voice the need for gun control in America, shed light on issues with immigration and even speak out against anti-LGBTQ bills in her home state of Tennessee. Most recently, she\u2019s urging women to become more knowledgable about their reproductive rights and how they can take control of them by learning about different options of birth control. She\u2019s even opened up about her decision to use an intrauterine device (IUD) called Kyleena while teaming up with Bayer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a supporter of women and our bodies. But especially right now when we\u2019re almost going backwards for women and it\u2019s a scary time,\u201d Hale says of being outspoken on the topic of women\u2019s health care. \u201cI think that the more people are having these conversations and the more women are standing up for themselves, I think that that\u2019s how we stand our ground and that\u2019s how we keep moving forward as a society.\u201d\n\nHale has long been exposed to these health-related conversations because her mother is a labor and delivery nurse. But even beyond that, Hale says she feels \u201clucky\u201d for being able to take part in conversations about politics and policies since she was young, and for being encouraged to have her own opinion.\n\n\u201cI always felt very grateful and blessed that no matter what my mom or dad thought, I was Lucy and I could make my own decisions and I could vote for whoever I want to, etc.,\u201d she explains. \u201cI know that that\u2019s not always the case but that\u2019s the world we live in. Everyone\u2019s got an option, that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to arm yourself with all the information that\u2019s available and then we still have that right as a human being to make these decisions for ourselves. And I think that that\u2019s really empowering and amazing.\u201d\n\nNow, Hale hopes that the fans who have grown and evolved with her over the years will do what it takes to obtain the knowledge that makes them feel most empowered. And if they don\u2019t agree with her, she\u2019s fine with that too.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make everyone happy. I\u2019ve learned that, especially in the world of social media, people will nitpick you apart until you\u2019re left with nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I just have to be able to sleep at night and if I feel like I\u2019m doing what feels right for me and what feels authentic for me, then, like, the rest will follow.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Lucy Hale says that it's a \"scary time,\" but that won't stop her from speaking out about what's important to her, including women's health.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k9ImPq9e0m2DYCTcFsMSuA--~B/aD01NDc3O3c9MzY1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b4620360-d989-11e9-b717-a8d056709358", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
