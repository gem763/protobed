The new meme is as old as women\u2019s rage itself", "language": "en", "text": "This week, the social video platform TikTok unleashed a new meme: young women filming themselves dancing \u2013 interpretively \u2013 to a soundtrack of angry, abusive, emotionally manipulative or threatening voicemails left by their ex-boyfriends.\n\nThe images of girls throwing gentle shapes through recorded monologues of hostile condemnation have understandably gone viral. If someone hasn\u2019t dubbed them \u201cscornstars\u201d yet, they probably should.\n\nThis iteration is fresh and digital \u2013 but the genre of women\u2019s artistic responses to men\u2019s bad behaviour is ancient. History and literature heave with examples of what could properly be studied as performance art in the medium of hating your ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe old story of Medea sending a poisoned dress to her former lover\u2019s new bride before murdering their shared children sets, definitively, a dark standard best not emulated. Violent revenge is never acceptable; the creativity of a symbolic gesture of disdain is, perhaps, far more potent for the moral empathy its performance evokes from others.\n\nIt was a 1991 book called Love Gone Wrong, edited by Wendy Harmer, that introduced me to the real-life genre of women\u2019s post-relationship scorn.\n\nI assume it was a gift from my prescient mother to my 16-year-old self, encouraging some passive learning around what lay beyond the romance narrative pop culture fed to my age group with some aggression. The story that stuck with me was the cheated-upon woman who collected her absent lover\u2019s beautiful tailored suits, piled them on their bed and sprayed them with water. She then scattered them with live chia seeds and turned the apartment heating up to full, with the the satisfaction of knowing that when he returned from a trip it would be to a bed filled with sprouting chia pets in precisely his measurements and size.\n\nAfter Coleen Rooney v Rebekah Vardy, how do we know who our friends are in the social media age? Read more\n\nIt was a matter of legend when I was at university that a popular local newsreader had thrown a party for her unfaithful boyfriend, presenting him with a huge cake iced with the words \u201cGet fucked, Darren\u201d, as she regaled the crowd with the details of his many infidelities.\n\nMy response to a lover who\u2019d unwisely sent me a letter penned in his blood, addressed to \u201cDevil Bitch Whore\u201d, was to scribble \u201cHalf a page? Lame.\u201d in biro, and mail it back to him.\n\nThe act only barely compares with the chutzpah of a Birmingham radio DJ\u2019s wife, who \u2013 after her partner propositioned a model live on air \u2013 auctioned his luxury sports car on eBay for an asking price of 50p; or the wife who took out an ad in the local paper congratulating her lying husband for impregnating someone else; or the wife who, according to reports, sent several sacks of manure to the office where her husband worked. It was his lover, the receptionist, who had to sign for them on delivery.\n\nToo far? That\u2019s for the audience to decide, but it\u2019s also what makes the interpretative dance of the TikTok girls so perfectly judged.\n\nThese are not the bold brushstrokes of expressionist madness, but more of a shared quilting project in which, patch by patch, their bastard boyfriends stitch themselves. The one consolation of technology\u2019s invasion of our most intimate spaces is that it\u2019s recording accounts of love gone wrong \u2013 accounts which, lacking primary evidence, used to be reduced to she-said/he-said accounts, unreliable narrators, legend, hearsay.\n\nThe significant evolution of the Disdain Dance is that, like #MeToo, individual admissions of suffering are flowering into a collective experience of solidarity. It\u2019s a powerful resistance to the ugliness of the voice messages, which themselves blur into an indistinguishable chorus of unearned entitlement.\n\nWe in the audience can listen to these boys whining, screaming, abusing, and know how richly the disdainful dances by their exes are deserved.\n\nFor the girls, surely, some comfort and great liberation result from swaying their defiance in front of a camera lens, with the internet\u2019s reminder that they don\u2019t dance alone.", "description": "Filming themselves brushing off threatening voicemails from their exes, these young women are telling each other that they aren\u2019t alone", "authors": ["Van Badham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/527962e37349fbc99765be8da1a1ab3b5639abbf/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1fa0446a0df5527a6b77258feca3869d", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
