Nasa has already begun using 3D printers in space by creating small objects for use in the International Space Station. The device was created by California-based company Made in Space, who were contracted by Nasa to design it for the ISS. Called the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration, it aims to show the 'additive manufacturing' technique can make 3D printed parts and tools in space. The printer was installed on the station by astronaut Butch Wilmore, in the station's Microgravity Science Glovebox, which is used for conducting science and technology experiments. The printer works by heating a relatively low-temperature plastic filament to build parts layer by later in designs supplied to the machine. The first object it created was a plastic faceplate with the words 'Made In Space' written on it.\n\nThe printer stands 15-feet tall and uses three long arms to assemble rocket parts with molten aluminium.\n\nThe company is training an AI to be able to oversee the printing process, something they hope will lead to final goal of being able to 3-D print rockets on Mars and other off-world locations.\n\n'To print stuff on Mars you need a system that can adapt to very uncertain conditions,' Relativity\u2019s co-founder Tim Ellis told Wired.\n\n'So we're building an algorithm framework that we think will actually be transferable to printing on other planets.'\n\nTo date, most 3-D printing applications have focused on rocket parts, but not building an entire rocket from 3-D printed material.\n\nNASA\u2019s RS-25 engine, which the agency believes could take humans to Mars at some point in the 2030s, is partially made from 3-D printed parts.\n\nEarlier this year, a Scottish company named Orbex announced a rocket system to deliver small satellites into orbit around Earth using an entirely 3-D printed engine.", "description": "These days, there's nothing robots can't do, even rocket science.
