It is thought it is due in the next few days.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"We will shortly be making an announcement about fracking in this country in view of the very considerable anxieties that are legitimately being raised about the earthquakes that have followed various fracking attempts in the UK.\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\n\"We will certainly be following up on those findings... They will be of concern to members.\"\n\nThe government has signalled support for the shale gas industry and is keen to cut the country's reliance on imports of natural gas, used to heat around 80% of Britain's homes.\n\nHowever fracking, which involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure, is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who say it is at odds with Britain's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA Public First spokesman told The Guardian: \"Public First has partners and staff who are members of all three major political parties and of none.\n\n\"Rachel is assisting the Conservative party with their manifesto based on her long experience of working on Conservative policy.\n\n\"Her political work is wholly separate from any commercial arrangements our firm has.\"", "description": "The Prime Minister dodged questions about Rachel Wolf's role - but did reveal an announcement on fracking policy will be made \"shortly\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Daily Post Wales", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757807.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prime-Minister-Theresa-May-launches-the-Conservative-Party-Welsh-Manifesto-at-Gresford-Memorial-Hall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
