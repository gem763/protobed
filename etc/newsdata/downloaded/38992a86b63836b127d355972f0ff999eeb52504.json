Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) and veterans, kicks off D.C. Statehood Week along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, on Sept. 16, 2019. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nTuesday\u2019s evening commute will again be interrupted by a protest, as hundreds of demonstrators are expected to take to the streets of downtown D.C. to demand a new labor contract and fair wages for thousands of janitors in Maryland, Virginia and the District.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and Council Chairman Phil Mendelson are expected to join hundreds of janitors at a rally in McPherson Square, where several of the workers will share their stories of struggle and survival.\n\nThe labor contract that covers more than 10,000 cleaners in the D.C. area with the Service Employees International Union is set to expire on Oct. 15. Laborers have threatened to strike if an agreement cannot be reached.\n\nIn Loudoun County, Va., janitors are bargaining for their first labor contract.\n\nNegotiations with the Washington Service Contractors Association began Sept. 15 and are ongoing.\n\nOrganizers said that having Bowser and Mendelson address the crowd at Tuesday\u2019s rally in McPherson Square sends a message to the workers \u2014 and employers \u2014 that the District values these workers and stands behind their pursuit of strong labor protections and wages of $15 an hour or more.\n\n\u201cIt shows workers that they have the support of the city,\u201d SEIU spokeswoman Julie Karant said. \u201cIt shows the property owners that this is an issue important to everybody, and it shows cleaners that they\u2019re not alone in this and they have powerful people on their side.\u201d\n\nJanitors are often affected by hot-button issues plaguing both the District and the nation as a whole, organizers said.\n\nThey are low-wage workers struggling to make ends meet in a high-cost city with the highest rate of gentrification in the country. Many are also immigrants, allowed to live and work in the United States as recipients of the Temporary Protected Status program, which is set to expire in 2020.\n\nMany in the D.C. area also work more than one job to \u201ckeep up with the rising cost of living in D.C.,\u201d SEIU officials wrote in a news release.\n\nNationwide, the union has been pushing for a $15 an hour minimum wage for its workers.\n\nIn the D.C. area, those who work part-time make 12.10 an hour, while those who work full-time earn an hourly rate of $16.10, according to the SEIU.\n\n\u201cI strongly support the thousands of janitors that work hard to keep nearly all of the city\u2019s office buildings clean and ready for business each day. And I fully support your efforts to get a good contract before the current one expires,\u201d Mendelson wrote in a statement Monday. \u201cIt is fundamental that workers have basic rights that should be recognized, including the right to organize and to bargain for good wages and benefits.\u201d\n\nThe demonstration \u2014 the third in about two weeks to converge on D.C. streets during rush hour \u2014 was planned during the evening commute because most janitors cannot afford to take time out of their work days to demonstrate, organizers said.\n\nThe demonstration will begin with speeches in McPherson Square, on 15th and K Streets NW, about 4:15 p.m. After several people address the crowd, the protest will begin to wind its way through rush-hour traffic.\n\nD.C. police, who will close off streets to accommodate the demonstration, have issued a permit for the march.\n\nThe group will continue down K Street to Connecticut Avenue NW before making a loop back to McPherson Square via I Street NW.\n\nBullhorns and homemade maracas will be in abundance.\n\nOrganizers hope the demonstration will put pressure on employers to come to an agreement with workers.\n\n\u201cThe economic development around the commercial real estate boom means there is more than enough wealth to ensure these workers are provided their fair share of the profits they help create,\u201d Jaime Contreras, vice president of SEIU Local 32BJ, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cThis contract will prove whether the region\u2019s prosperity will ever trickle down to move low-wage workers into the middle class.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The union workers have threatened to strike if a new labor contract is not reached before Oct. 15.", "authors": ["Marissa J.
