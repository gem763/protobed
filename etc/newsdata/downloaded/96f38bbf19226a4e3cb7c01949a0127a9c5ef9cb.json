And his aides are building an operation with a rigorous campaign schedule that lets the president lean into his strengths with more rallies, more attacks on Democrats and more promises for what Trump could accomplish with four more years.\n\nThe Trump campaign is positioning its candidate to capture the attention of voters outside his core base in the waning months of 2019, as Democrats attack each other before the field shrinks. Part of the plan includes deploying Trump and field staff to states he lost in 2016 by close margins, or where they claim to have spotted trends that could be politically advantageous to the incumbent Republican.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The president\u2019s reelection operation already has boots on the ground in some of those states, and expects to be in all of them by the end of the year.\n\nOn the stump, campaign officials say Trump will paint a rosy picture of the U.S. economy and America\u2019s global standing \u2014 linking both to his nationalist, populist agenda \u2014 while chalking up unfulfilled promises and messy policy debates to Democratic obstruction. He will stick to his normal highlight reel of accomplishments \u2014 think judicial appointments, tax cuts, criminal justice reform and his administration\u2019s effort to end China\u2019s trade abuses \u2014 but he may also unveil new policy proposals on tech, guns, immigration and health care out on the trail, according to two Republicans close to the White House.\n\nDelivering new policy ideas will keep the president \u201cfresh in voter\u2019s minds,\u201d a GOP strategist said, against the onslaught of trillion-dollar climate change proposals, immigration reform plans and health care changes outlined by Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\n\u201cFor all the snark the president and his team face on these issues, there is a method to the madness and I think you\u2019re going to see small coalitions built out around certain issues that Democrats have always just expected to own,\u201d said Alex Schriver, executive vice president at the GOP-linked marketing firm Targeted Victory.\n\nPart of the reason for the expansion is the sheer amount of data and earned media the Trump campaign gleans whenever the president hits the trail. \u201cIt\u2019s like gold for us when he drops into a state,\u201d another campaign official said.\n\nTo maximize the value of Trump\u2019s rallies \u2014 which voters can attend only after submitting their contact information to the campaign in exchange for tickets \u2014 aides say they plan to build out events immediately before and after the president\u2019s rallies. The campaign pilot-tested the idea in late August, when Trump\u2019s 2020 spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany hosted an economic roundtable in the Manchester suburbs 48 hours before he arrived for a rally in New Hampshire.\n\nVoter registration and volunteer training efforts have also been initiated in these states and will be expanded throughout the fall as more resources are deployed.\n\nAttendees at Trump rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nIn Minnesota, which last voted for a Republican for president in 1972, one campaign official said aides were surprised to learn that the field staff beat every other state in voter registration over a recent two-week period. Trump came within 1.5 percentage points of winning the deep blue Midwestern state in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe have the great luxury of being able to pursue and absolutely fully fund everything that we need to run the original campaign plan, but the resources we have will allow us to consider playing in states a lot of campaigns wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to do,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign.\n\nFinancially, the Trump campaign enters the fall in a comfortable place, with around $100 million in cash on hand between itself and the Republican National Committee, and a robust fundraising schedule in the weeks ahead. Trump will attend three donor events in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas during a two-day swing through California later this month, and has a stop planned in San Diego as well. Invitations to all four fundraisers obtained by POLITICO show tickets ranging from $1,000 to $250,000.\n\nWith its unprecedented war chest, the campaign has installed dozens of staffers in target states and continues to build out its core team at its headquarters in Virginia.\n\nIt has also benefited GOP candidates who face special elections this fall.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign announced that it had contributed the maximum amount of $2,000 to Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy in a show of \u201cunwavering support\u201d for the two men, who are vying for congressional seats in North Carolina. Trump is set to travel to Fayetteville, N.C., for a rally next Tuesday on the eve of both elections, one of which \u2014 in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District \u2014 has become a nail-biter for the Republican Party at large.\n\n\u201cAt this point in a special election people have already made up their minds. He may get a few low-propensity voters who normally turn out only in presidential years, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d said a GOP official in the state.\n\nSome Trump advisers have privately acknowledged their fear that if North Carolina\u2019s 9th District goes Democratic, so goes the presidency next November. They say both nightmare scenarios would largely be the president\u2019s fault, and point squarely to the controversies Trump stirred this summer \u2014 including his Twitter attack against four minority progressive congresswomen, his criticism of Baltimore as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d and unsubstantiated corruption charges against its Democratic representative, Rep. Elijah Cummings, and his conflicting statements during the G-7 summit in France.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t hang on to NC-9, [Trump] might as well tell his campaign staff in Georgia, Florida and elsewhere to pack up and move on,\u201d said a person close to the campaign.\n\nTwo polls released last month have spelled trouble for the president as Congress reemerges from its August recess and he heads into the fall with few legislative victories on the horizon.\n\nAmong them, a Fox News survey underscored one of the greatest challenges Trump faces: convincing voters who support his policies, but dislike his Twitter outbursts and unorthodox approach to politics, that they can stomach four more years. Forty-three percent of respondents in the poll approved of Trump\u2019s job performance, but he received only 38 to 39 percent support in matchup polls against Democratic opponents. The second poll, by Quinnipiac University, found an increase in voters who think the economy \u2014 a defining part of the president\u2019s reelection message \u2014 is getting worse.\n\nThe Trump campaign has dismissed concerns about an economic downturn as a crisis manufactured by the president\u2019s critics. And despite troubling polls and the myriad campaign promises that remain incomplete, Murtaugh said he is confident their message will resonate more and more as the Democratic primary drags on.\n\n\u201cThere is still more to be done,\u201d Murtaugh said, \u201cbut with the clear message that if you turn things over to the other guys, you know what they\u2019re going to do and that\u2019s exactly nothing.\u201d", "description": "The president is transitioning to his happy place: in front of thousands of adoring fans on the campaign trail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/56/ad/6325f5424298af8981506ae34015/190904-trumprally-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
