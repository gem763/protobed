This isn\u2019t me, but it could be. Photo: Courtesy the retailer\n\n\u2018Sleep when the baby sleeps!\u2019 Everyone tells you this when you have a newborn, and it probably sounds like good advice to them. Except it\u2019s impossible. And not just because the baby sleeping is the only time you can do the six loads of waiting laundry, or wash your dishes, or eat something, or shower for the first time in three days \u2014 it\u2019s also impossible because when you have a new baby, you can\u2019t just relax.\n\nBelieve me: No matter how tired I am, I\u2019ve been having trouble falling asleep since my daughter was born more than five months ago. Chalk it up to a racing mind or parental adrenaline, but I\u2019ve tried everything I can think of: wine, reading a book, put-you-to-sleep podcasts, deep-breathing techniques, wine again. Nothing helped until I was sent the Sleep Well aromatherapy stick (full disclosure: My job as a health writer has its perks). I rubbed the mix of lavender, ylang-ylang, and palmarosa on my wrists and neck like the tube suggested. The smell was addictive at first waft \u2014 calming and just a little sweet. I wanted more. I started reading in bed, and held my book in one hand and the stick in the other, taking deep breaths of the blend while concentrating on the text. I read for maybe five minutes before falling asleep. I did the same thing the next night, and it knocked me out again. This is good stuff.\n\nThe blend is now a crucial part of my nighttime routine. Every night I hit my pulse points and hold it under my nose while I read. I\u2019ve even started spreading it on the bottom of my eye mask so the scent stays with me as long as possible. I now take it with me when I travel. I probably should order a case. (There\u2019s a chamomile version for stress relief and rosemary for focusing, too.) I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but: It\u2019s better than wine.\n\nMore Strat-approved aromatherapy\n\nTata Harper Aromatic Stress Treatment Strategist editor Alexis Swerdloff takes a whiff of her Tata Harper stress treatment when she\u2019s feeling frazzled: \u2018When I\u2019m sitting at my desk on deadline, furiously responding to emails, toggling through the 29 tabs open on my browser, and balancing a takeaway salad in the crook of my elbow, I dab a little bit of it onto my wrists, or onto my neck (it has a roll-on applicator), and take a deep breath. Suddenly, I\u2019m someone in an Architectural Digest spread wearing a long camel-colored cashmere cardigan, white pants, a pair of Tod\u2019s loafers, walking through the atrium of my beachfront estate to adjust a flower arrangement.\u2019 \u00a357 at Skin City Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
