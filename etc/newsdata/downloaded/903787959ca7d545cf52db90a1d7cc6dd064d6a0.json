ESA/D. Ducros\n\nAt any given moment, thousands of satellites swarm over our heads at altitudes ranging between a few hundred miles and tens of thousands of miles.\n\nBut, of the manmade items in space that are larger than your fist, orbiting satellites are a minority. About 95% of what's out there is space junk: out-of-control space stations, used rocket parts, dead satellites, lost astronaut tools and more. This dangerous orbital garbage is moving roughly 10 times faster than a speeding bullet and takes a long time to crash back to earth.\n\n\"This debris can stay up there for hundreds of years,\" Bill Ailor, an aerospace engineer and atmospheric reentry specialist, told Business Insider, later clarifying that objects in higher orbits (e.g. geosynchronous satellites) can stay aloft for thousands of years.\n\nAnd it gets worse.\n\nJust one collision in space can create thousands of new high-speed, out-of-control pieces and threaten other spacecraft. Meanwhile, perhaps 170 million pieces of debris larger than 1 millimeter \u2014 such as flecks of paint and bits of explosive bolts \u2014 move around Earth at tens of thousands of miles per hour, according to the European Space Agency.\n\n\"Countries have learned over the years that when they create debris, it presents a risk to their own systems just as it does for everybody else,\" said Ailor, who works for the nonprofit Aerospace Corporation.\n\nThe chart below, which Business Insider created using data from Space-Track.org (registration required), shows the top 10 entities with the most trackable objects around Earth as of October 2017.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff in space that shouldn't be there anymore. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider\n\nThe chart shows Russia has the most objects currently in space, numbering more than 6,500 objects. However, it's not the biggest contributor to space junk, shown in red.\n\nThe US owns the title of dirtiest country in space for now, and just by a hair. Russia has 3,961 pieces of detectable space debris compared to the 3,999 pieces of trackable space trash in orbit created by American activity.\n\nChina has only recently ramped up its space program, yet it's in a close third with 3,475 hunks of space junk. This is because the nation in 2007 destroyed one of its own satellites in an anti-satellite weapons test.\n\nThis highly controversial move instantly created more than 2,300 trackable pieces of junk, more than 35,000 pieces larger than a thumbnail, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of pieces too small to track.\n\nHow to clean up outer space\n\nGetting old spacecraft out of orbit is a key to preventing the formation of space junk, and many space agencies and corporations now build spacecraft with systems to de-orbit them.\n\nBut Ailor and others are eager to push the development of new technologies and methods that can lasso, bag, tug, and otherwise remove the old, uncontrolled stuff that's already up there and continues to pose a threat.\n\n\"I've proposed something like a XPRIZE or a Grand Challenge, where would you identify three spacecraft and give a prize to an entity to remove those things,\" he said.\n\nAn illustration of space junk. Satellites and debris are not to scale. ESA The ultimate goal is to prevent alarming scenario known as Kessler Syndrome: when so much stuff is in space, one collision leads to several others, and those crashes lead to even more \u2014 littering space with so much debris that it becomes incredibly risky to leave Earth.\n\nThe biggest hurdle in defeating space debris, however, is likely human.\n\n\"It's not just a technical issue. This idea of ownership gets to be a real player here,\" Ailor said. \"No other nation has permission to touch a US satellite, for instance. And if we went after a satellite ... it could even be deemed an act of war.\"\n\nAilor said someone needs to get nations together to agree on a treaty that spells out laws-of-the-sea-like salvage rights to dead or uncontrollable objects in space.\n\n\"There needs to be something where nations and commercial authorities have some authority to go after something,\" he said.", "description": "Satellites represent only about 5% of trackable objects in space.
