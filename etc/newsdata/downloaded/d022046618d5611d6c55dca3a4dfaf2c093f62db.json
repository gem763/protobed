Victory means the visitors are custodians of the urn for another couple of years.\n\nIt didn\u2019t come without a scrap, mind you. In the end, Overton and batting partner Jack Leach combined for a scrappy fourteen overs, giving the home crowd fleeting hope in a Ben Stokes-esque comeback.\n\nEven a draw would have done for the home squad, and England looked set to battle it out through the day to set up a decisive test at London\u2019s The Oval. Nevertheless, their target of 383, and a starting point of 18-2, meant it was gonna be a hard slog.\n\nAustralia\u2019s bowling attack made sure of that, with Pat Cummins walking away with an impressive 4-43.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Australian batsman Steve Smith said what anyone watching could have told you: the fella was absolutely on fire, providing batting power to match Australia\u2019s ruthless bowling attack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have ever played better,\u201d Smith told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI have come back fresh from a year out, but relaxed and chilled out. I want to be the one in the middle doing my job for the team as I don\u2019t particularly enjoy watching cricket!\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem like England will enjoy watching the fifth test, but whatever. Australia retains the Ashes, baby.
