But their ice cream's base ingredients - which include oat fibre, cane sugar, glucose, canola oil, cassava starch and potato protein - are less important than the process used to create it, they say.\n\nTinkering with the steps - how to incorporate the ingredients, and the precise heating, pressurising and blending - was the key. \"It enables the functionality that makes it indistinguishable from its animal counterpart,\" says Thomas, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints as a Michelin-starred chef and director of product development at Just, which makes a plant-based egg substitute that had a similar debut at Equinox.\n\nThomas Bowman, founder of Eclipse; Brandi Edinger, executive pastry chef at Equinox Restaurant; and Todd Gray, chef at Equinox, create desserts with Eclipse\u2019s plant-based ice cream. The Washington Post\n\nOther vegan ice creams have claimed to do the same. For example, Perfect Day ice cream has re-created dairy protein by adding a cow DNA \"blueprint\" to yeast, which ferments and produces milk proteins. That kind of tinkering isn't cheap: A pint of Perfect Day cost $US20 ($29.70) when it was available this year in a limited run.\n\nBowman and Steinhart say their processing does not rely on such expensive biotech and employs the same pasteurisation, homogenisation and storage that regular dairy products do. \"We're not reinventing the wheel,\" Thomas says. \"We're just re-creating milk - without the cow.\"\n\nKeeping costs down, they say, is key to making vegan dairy products eventually go mainstream - along with making sure they are actually, you know, delicious. (Less important to them is making a low-calorie product: \"We're not trying to be the healthiest kid on the block,\" says Steinhart, a former tech executive.)\n\nGray, for one, is more than willing to vouch for the product's taste. He described first getting the ice cream bases (in plain, vanilla and chocolate flavours) into his kitchen and immediately launching into mad-scientist mode, throwing in rhubarb-strawberry jam left over from a brunch service along with some graham crackers. He was so delighted with the result that he immediately drove the concoction across town to the Museum of the Bible, where he operates the restaurants, to show it to pastry chef Brandi Edinger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I said, 'You have to taste this stuff - you won't believe it,' \" he recalls.\n\nAt last week's tasting, Gray and Edinger used the Eclipse base to whip up tahini-espresso and Black Forest flavours, the latter of which incorporated chunks of vegan brownies and Morello cherries. Both tasted decidedly dairy-esque: creamy and melty, with no off-notes suggesting there was a lab coat involved in production.\n\nThe chefs also demonstrated just how high-end the base could go, using it to make a domed semifreddo - a half-frozen dessert with a mousse-like consistency - spiked with flavours of Sicilian orange and raspberry. That dish, which will be on the restaurant's menu starting next week, also incorporated aquafaba, the slightly viscous water in cans of chickpeas, which is sometimes used as an egg white substitute. The elegant dessert is as velvety as Jason Momoa's pink Oscars tuxedo.\n\nGray declared the introduction of the ice cream (as well as the soft-serve versions he doled out at the restaurant's plant-based Sunday brunch) to be a success, even among his diners who are merely \"curious\" about plant-based eating.\n\nAppealing to the masses, not just the small percentage of people who define themselves as vegan, is exactly the point, says Steinhart. \"We have to win them over if we want to create a food system that actually works for the planet and for our future.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "A Michelin-starred chef is helping create a new vegan ice cream are using technological wizardry. \"We're just re-creating milk - without the cow.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7138%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b7071363d20c1720f582936e7248aad08ce80e7", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
