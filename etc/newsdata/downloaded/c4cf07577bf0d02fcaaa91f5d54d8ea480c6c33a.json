'If you play in Barcelona, you have a dream, and the dream is to become a first-team player. If young players are playing in [the La Masia] system, they want to be in the first team at Barcelona.'\n\nThe manager of the La Masia residence is Juanjo Luque, who for the past two-and-a-half years has dedicated himself to the development of the club's young players.\n\nWhen asked what values they look for in their players, he reels them off: 'Humility, respect, teamwork, ambition, and effort. We view humility as a priority.'\n\nThe brand new, state-of-the-art facilities opened in 2011, updating the original base which spans back to 1979, and more than 80 sportspeople live there.\n\nPatrick Kluivert, himself a Barcelona legend, is currently the director of youth football\n\nThe current crop of Barcelona youth players are put through their paces at La Masia\n\nAnsu Fati is the latest superstar coming through as Barcelona search for their next Messi\n\nNot only do they cater for young footballers, but also basketball, hockey, futsal and handball players who are coming from outside the city to join Barcelona's different academies.\n\nSome of the most talented youngsters pushing through from La Masia to the Barcelona first team are the likes of Carles Perez, Carles Alena, Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati.\n\nThe latter burst onto the scene at the start of the season and became Barcelona's youngest ever goalscorer when he netted against Osasuna.\n\nFati went on to score at the Nou Camp in his next match, and has already played six times for the first team this season, including in the Champions League.\n\nThe players are taught to eat right from a young age, as an important part of their learning\n\nThe manager of the La Masia residence is Juanjo Luque, who dedicates himself to the players\n\nMessi trains during his youth days at La Masia, years before he came the world's very best\n\n'It's nice to see players that have come up through the youth system making it to the first team,' Luque adds.\n\n'When we see an athlete debut in the first team, we are very proud.
