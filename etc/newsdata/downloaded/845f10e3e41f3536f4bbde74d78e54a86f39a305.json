The company said in the filing that it made the self-disclosure in May to the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. sanctions, and the self-disclosure is under review by the agency.\n\nCloudflare didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCloudflare said in the filing that it determined that its products were used by, or for the benefit of, certain individuals and entities that have been blacklisted by the U.S. A number of the parties made payments to the company in connection with their use of the platform, the company said in the filing.\n\nThe company said the parties included entities that have been designated by the U.S. as terrorists and narcotics traffickers or are affiliated with governments currently subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions, according to the filing.\n\nCloudflare said in the filing that it is working to implement additional controls and screening tools to remediate the issue.\n\nThe company also disclosed that it may have violated U.S. export control regulations and has submitted self-disclosures to the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security as well as to the Census Bureau regarding potential violations of the Foreign Trade Regulations. Cloudflare said it learned this year that it may have submitted incorrect information to the U.S. government in connection with certain hardware exports, according to the filing.\n\nCloudflare plans to sell 35 million shares at a price between $10 and $12 per share in its initial public offering. The company has been approved to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NET.\n\nThe company was also in the spotlight last month for its decision to cease providing web services to online forum 8chan, which posted an anti-immigrant manifesto purportedly from the suspect who killed 22 people in an El Paso, Texas, Walmart store.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "Cloudflare, a provider of cloud-based networking and cybersecurity services, may have violated U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations, the company disclosed in a regulatory filing.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun", "Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105937/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
