For instance, the walkways of the commercial plaza feature diamond-patterned tiles \u2013 a nod to the five-foot ways of the old buildings. A spiral staircase that links the first level to the second was also designed to emulate the old fire escape that was behind the former shophouses. Two Angsana trees were conserved from the old site, and are now part of the commercial plaza.\n\nThe developer, City Developments Ltd, also took care to maintain the scale of the development to be in line with that of the neighbouring estate. A two-tiered, high- and low-rise podium was therefore designed to match its existing neighbourhood.\n\n\n\nTwo Angsana trees were conserved from the old site, and are now part of the commercial plaza (Credit: CDL)\n\nThe mixed-use development is located on Tai Thong Crescent, off MacPherson Road. Comprising 266 residential units and 28 commercial shop lots, it draws footfall throughout the day, and sits on a fan-shaped site of 88,267 sq ft. The development has 339,840 sq ft in gross floor area and 21,528 sq ft of retail space.\n\nThe Venue Residences \u2013 which has a Platinum BCA Greenmark Award to its name \u2013 received its temporary occupation permit in 2017, and is fully sold to date. Residential unit offerings range from a one-bedder starting at 495 sq ft, to a four-bedroom unit at 1,238 sq ft. There are also eight penthouse units from 1,948 to 2,142 sq ft. The residential units are spread across four 18-storey tower blocks and a block of six duplex units overlooking a pool.\n\nDepending on their unit\u2019s orientation, residents at The Venue Residences can enjoy views of the city, or the condo\u2019s facilities, such as the pool which features an origami-inspired boat sculpture. The poolside is decked out with origami-shaped cabanas for pool loungers. Children can play in the kids\u2019 pool and a playground with a trampoline, hopscotch and a playing net. Other amenities include a meditation patio, hammock lounge and yoga deck to promote wellness activities.\n\n\n\nA block of six duplex units overlooks the pool (Credit: CDL)\n\nSky-high views were also prioritised. There are four sky terraces: a Reading Garden and a Yoga Garden are on the fifth storey, while a Meditation Garden and a Relaxation Garden are on the 12th floor.\n\nThe development is enveloped by Upper Serangoon Road, MacPherson Road and the Pan Island Expressway. To deflect noise from the roads, the units facing the main roads have balconies that were installed with acoustic ceilings.\n\nThere are also other features at The Venue to minimise noise from the roads. For instance, a buffer zone from the traffic junction was carved out on the first level, housing a public plaza for passers-by and residents. Meanwhile, double-layered laminated glass is used for the exterior. Windows for the bedrooms are also kept from being opened too wide with a constraint mechanism installed.", "description": "The mixed-use development, comprising 266 residential units and 28 commercial shop lots, draws footfall throughout the day, and sits on a fan-shaped site of 88,267 sq ft (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/ EdgeProp Singapore)The Venue Residences has been recognised for its green efforts, and has clinched two", "authors": ["Charlene.Chin Edgeprop.Sg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DDIDVAafJtPPPQEa3NbH3Q--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/theedgeproperty.com.sg/a3e7775cd1ef7127244eab1d19882a8e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
