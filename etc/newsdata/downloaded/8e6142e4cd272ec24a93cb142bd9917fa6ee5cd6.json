Meet Scott Morrison, the Neighbourhood Watch community leader for outer suburbia.\n\nNor can Labor find a lot of spare territory for a starring role in this particular morality play. Moving a \u201cclimate emergency motion\u201d in the House of Representatives is more about symbolism and papering over internal party divisions than making any real choices.\n\nBut the opposition is apparently to reverse course and support the government\u2019s \u201cbig stick\" legislation for energy companies after the bill was altered to prevent any state-owned asset being privatised if it was forcibly divested due to bad behaviour.\n\nThe chances of this occurring are virtually nil, of course, given divestment must now be approved by the Federal Court. There\u2019s still no point alarming all those LNP politicians in Queensland as well as Labor about even the notion of unpopular privatisations.\n\nKeeping the message simple\n\nThe more politically potent (if highly risky) promise contained in the bill is the leeway it gives to the federal government to force companies to supply electricity at a certain price and volume for up to three years. This won\u2019t happen either. Imagine the private sector investment strike that would follow that sort of government action!\n\nIt\u2019s more that this legislation adds to the political pressure on companies while supposedly reassuring customers. But Morrison better hope consumers don\u2019t suddenly start demanding the government take its own legislation seriously and actually take on the responsibility itself for setting prices \u2013 much lower.\n\nIn reality, an incredibly complicated energy market is already facing massive changes, many of them highly technical in nature, as the system copes with the onslaught of mass renewable solar and wind power without losing stability or flexibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s just much harder to get people excited about the detail of attempts by the regulators to manage this transition as cheaply and efficiently as possible, particularly when complicated by a recalcitrant group of state energy ministers at COAG.\n\nSuch decisions will help determine whether Australia\u2019s energy market continues on its often dysfunctional and always expensive path. But try explaining the latest proposal by the Australian Energy Market Commission, for example, to have renewables generators pay to invest in the shared transmission network or receive cheaper localised rates in less congested parts of the grid in return for greater certainty about access. Mass consumer eye-glazing would be the most common reaction.\n\nThat also applies to Angus Taylor's rationale for underwriting investment in \"firming\" power generation and reforming and standardising default market offers as recommended by the ACCC.\n\nGiven politics, more than ever, is about telling and selling simple stories, it resonates far more to spruik a vision of Snowy 2.0 and a future of cheaper prices for consumers arriving almost by political magic.\n\n'Getting under the hood'\n\nThat is a similar narrative to the government\u2019s latest sortie against the banks for not passing on to consumers the full reduction in the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg hardly want to bother voters with complex arguments over what constitutes an acceptable net interest margin, return on equity or deposit rate for any of the big four at a time of record low interest rates.\n\nIt\u2019s much more effective to promise yet another independent inquiry into the whole issue while accusing the banks of profiteering. The Treasurer calls it \u201cgetting under the hood\u201d. The banks insist they are keen to explain how their economic engine actually works.\n\nThe ACCC\u2019s Rod Sims has happily pursued power companies over their \u201cloyalty tax\u201d. Now it can be the turn of the banks to justify using bigger discounts to attract new customers than those provided to existing customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the bigger problem may prove to be the impact of low interest rates on raising house prices without doing much to stimulate the rest of the economy.\n\nRBA minutes note the \"housing market and other asset prices might be overly inflated\u201d as a result. For now, though, the government\u2019s main concern is encouraging more credit and more spending anywhere it can.\n\nCBA figures on retail spending intentions showed consumers pulled back in September after a strong August. Chief economist Michael Blythe said while there were some positive signs, the overall picture was one of continued consumer caution.\n\n\u201cOur view for some time now is that monetary policy changes do little to support household activity. While a positive \u2018wealth effect\u2019 is emerging from rising home prices, consumers interpret rate cuts from record lows as a sign of economic weakness and keep their wallets shut,\u201d he said.", "description": "The government is waving a big stick at the energy companies and big banks\u00a0with great enthusiasm \u2013\u00a0just with very limited practical effect.
