But it would add pressure to producers already strained by unseasonably low summer prices.\n\nNatural gas for October delivery closed Thursday down 3.8% at $2.538 per million British thermal units after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a bigger injection of gas into storage than expected.\n\nDespite the drop, gas prices remain up 23% from a three-year low of $2.07 reached on Aug. 5. Futures are priced roughly where they were before the attacks Saturday hobbled the world\u2019s largest oil exporter.\n\nThe market is already expecting added natural-gas supply at the start of autumn.

Analysts said that the attacks could leave oil prices elevated even after full production is restored in the kingdom, with investors anticipating the risk of future supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to probably embolden U.S. oil producers to produce more,\u201d said Ryan Kelley, who manages several stock portfolios at Hennessy Funds, including one that is focused on gas buyers such as utilities.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts warned clients this week that a sustained increase in prices for crude or natural-gas liquids such as propane\u2014produced heavily by Saudi Arabia and drillers in Appalachia\u2014might tempt U.S. companies to drill more.\n\nGoldman forecasts an average gas price of $2.50 next year, but said its estimate might prove high if oil drillers ramp up or gas producers in the Northeast chase propane prices. \u201cAppalachia producers in particular need to show restraint in order to keep the market balanced into 2020,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts said in a research note.\n\nThe market is already expecting a wave of added gas supply at the start of autumn, when prices typically recede before demand picks up in winter to fuel furnaces.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration estimated this week that the amount of natural gas extracted from shale formations in Appalachia, West Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota and on the Great Plains will next month surpass records.\n\nKinder Morgan Inc., KMI 0.10% meanwhile, is expected in the coming days to open its 500-mile Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, which stretches across Texas between drilling fields in the Permian Basin and Corpus Christi. The tube will deliver as much as two billion cubic feet of gas daily to exporters, manufacturers and households. That gas will come to market from a region where producers have been burning off roughly enough each day to fuel every home in the state because they haven\u2019t had anything else to do with it.\n\nUnlike West Texas producers that unearth gas as a byproduct of drilling for oil and aren\u2019t particularly sensitive to gas prices, those operating in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are dependent on gas and have suffered from years of low prices.\n\nShares of Pittsburgh-based EQT Corp. EQT -6.04% have lost 56% over the past year, and the company, the largest gas producer in the U.S., said last week it would lay off about a quarter of its roughly 800 employees. Over the past year shares of Range Resources Corp. RRC -6.80% and Antero Resources Corp. AR -3.06% have fared even worse, falling 73% and 81%, respectively.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSome are skeptical that these companies will be able to do much to boost output soon even if they wished to. Besides the months that it can take to plan, drill and complete a shale well, key Appalachian producers have already spent much of the money they have allocated to new wells in 2019 and have promised shareholders restraint, said Matt Hagerty, an analyst at BTU Analytics.\n\n\u201cThe most likely outcome is that producers will just take the extra cash flow from higher prices and pay down debt, buy back stock or pay a dividend,\u201d Mr. Hagerty said.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com", "description": "Natural-gas prices have recovered from their summer swoon, but analysts and investors are skeptical that the gains will last, particularly after the attacks on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Ryan Dezember", "Ryan.Dezember Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108311/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
