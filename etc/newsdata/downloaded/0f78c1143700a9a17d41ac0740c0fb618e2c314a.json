They all insisted that there was no quid pro quo.\n\nBut, last week the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, lifted the veil on that lie, confirming during a televised briefing that there was indeed a quid pro quo. As The New York Times reported, \u201cMr. Mulvaney told journalists \u2026 that the aid was withheld in part until Ukraine investigated an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016 \u2014 a theory that would show that Mr. Trump was elected without Russian help.\u201d\n\nSince making this shocking statement, Mulvaney has been struggling to clean it up, to tell the world that he didn\u2019t say what he clearly said.\n\nAnd, in the moment of making the statement, Mulvaney proudly proclaimed: \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nNo, Trump world, we are not just going to get over it, not now or ever.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy is simple: Be brazen. Conduct your corruption in plain sight. And, it follows a simple logic: If it were wrong, I would be ashamed of it and attempt to conceal it. The fact that I haven\u2019t attempted to shroud it is proof of its virtue.\n\nThat is what\u2019s maddening about the Trump presidency: how much harm has been done as America looked on, with full awareness of the damage, and Trump has yet to be held accountable for any of it.\n\nBut that time is drawing to an end.\n\nWrong is wrong, whether you parade it or put it away. In fact, it is the flaunting of wrongdoing that should carry more of a penalty, not less of one. We can\u2019t allow our numbness to make this normal. It isn\u2019t.\n\nThis impeachment inquiry is the best thing Congress has done to help the country in years. Some worry that an impeachment would tear the country apart. To the contrary, I believe that it will bring the country together. A majority of Americans will recognize and rally around a common set of facts, a common truth, and reject Trump\u2019s attempt to bend reality.\n\nA Pew Research Poll released last week found that 58 percent of Americans, including a quarter of Republicans, believe that Trump has done things that are grounds for impeachment.\n\nNo matter how much he says that the call he made to the president of Ukraine was perfect, no matter how much he attacks the whistle-blower, no matter how much he lies, most Americans see through it and are appalled by it.\n\nAnd now that Mulvaney has made the disastrous mistake of actually telling the truth, some Republicans are even signaling that they are open to at least entertaining a vote to impeach the president.\n\nThis is another step that is important to the repairing of the country. It\u2019s not that I believe that the Senate would be in any danger of actually voting to convict and remove Trump. It\u2019s that we need to know that at least some of these Republican men and women who make our laws are not totally craven and devoid of morality.\n\nAnd, Republicans and independents need to know that holding Trump accountable is not a sour grapes pursuit to relitigate 2016, or born out of maddening personal hatred of the man himself.\n\nThis is far bigger than all that. Trump is a stress test on our system and constitutional government and we dare not fail. Trump must be held accountable not only because his corruption dictates it, but also because we must demonstrate that accountability is possible.\n\nIf Americans chose to just \u201cget over it\u201d as Mulvaney demanded, the power of the president to degrade, corrupt and evade the system would be enshrined. Trumpism would mar the future.\n\nThat can\u2019t happen. Trump wrongdoing in the Ukraine case is clear. (I would argue that it\u2019s clear in other areas as well.)\n\nRepublican Congressman Francis Rooney of Florida made it clear that he\u2019s not ruling out the possibility of supporting impeachment. Sunday on CNN he told Jake Tapper that Mulvaney\u2019s attempt to walk back his admission was a farce, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see how you walk back something that\u2019s clear. I would say game, set, match on that.\u201d\n\nAnd, as The Washington Post reported:\n\n\u201cRooney told reporters Friday when asked about the political consequences of potentially impeaching Trump that he wanted \u2018to get the facts and do the right thing because I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking to anybody in this building.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEach of us will have to look at our children, to look at ourselves in the mirror and be held accountable for how we responded to the threat Trump poses.\n\nAs the late Elijah Cummings put it:\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
