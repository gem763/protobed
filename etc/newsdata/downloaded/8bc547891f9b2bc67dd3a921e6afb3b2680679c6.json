The U.S. Constitution gives the House wide latitude in how to handle impeachment.\n\nThe inquiry focuses on Trump\u2019s request in a July 25 telephone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival, Joe Biden, the former vice president who is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to face Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you that Donald Trump\u2019s done nothing wrong. I\u2019m not here to tell you anything other than that the way they\u2019re going about it is really dangerous for the country and we need to change course while we can in the House,\u201d Graham told a news conference, referring to House Democrats.\n\nTrump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress this week ratcheted up efforts to fight the investigation after Trump on Monday urged them to get tougher on the Democrats leading it.\n\nIf the House passes articles of impeachment - formal charges - the Republican-controlled Senate would then hold a trial on whether to remove Trump from office. A two-thirds majority of the Senate would be required to remove the president. Only three U.S. presidents before Trump have faced impeachment inquiries and none were removed from office via the process.\n\nThe resolution accused House Democrats of \u201cabandoning more than a century\u2019s worth of precedent and tradition in impeachment proceedings and denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American.\u201d\n\nEven if passed in the Senate, the resolution would not affect the House inquiry. However, it would place Republican senators on the record on impeachment at a time when some cracks in Trump\u2019s support within his own party have appeared, including pointed criticism from Senator Mitt Romney.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the resolution, saying the House \u201cmust adhere to the highest standards of fairness and due process,\u201d but did not say when he would bring it up for a vote.\n\nSENATOR INVOKES CLINTON IMPEACHMENT\n\nGraham, who on Tuesday agreed with the president\u2019s description of the impeachment probe as a \u201clynching,\u201d said the House process was \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\n\nGraham also lamented that the Democrats were not using the same procedures that House Republicans used two decades ago when they impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton concerning a sexual relationship with a White House intern. The Senate declined to remove Clinton from office following a trial.\n\nAs the inquiry intensifies, the White House is considering bringing on board a communications specialist to handle messaging, sources familiar with the process said.\n\nGraham, who as a House member pushed for Clinton\u2019s impeachment, urged Trump to follow the successful playbook used by Clinton, in which the president pushed back against Republicans but also focussed on his daily duties.\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton defended himself. But he never stopped being president,\u201d Graham said.\n\nRepublicans have complained about Democrats hearing from witnesses in closed sessions and not allowing lawmakers who are not members of the three committees leading the inquiry from being present for depositions. Republican members of the committees have taken part in the proceedings throughout.\n\nMore than two dozen House Republicans barged into the high-security hearing room on Wednesday and delayed for several hours the testimony of a Pentagon official.\n\nAuthorities at the U.S. Capitol conducted a \u201csweep\u201d inside the room where the standoff had occurred to check for security breaches such as listening devices after the Republican protest, two sources said on Thursday. Some of the Republican lawmakers had brought cellphones into the room, where electronic devices are prohibited for security purposes.\n\n\u201cThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History. It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!\u201d Trump said on Thursday in a Twitter post.\n\nPUBLIC HEARINGS\n\nChuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, accused Trump and his Republican congressional allies of hypocrisy for demanding that the proceedings be held in public even as the administration withholds subpoenaed documents and tries to block testimony to House investigators.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy, the self-serving nature of the president\u2019s statements and his Republican allies here in the House and Senate is glaring,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nDemocrats have said there will be public hearings in the coming weeks. They hope to complete the inquiry by the end of the year and are coalescing around two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction, lawmakers and aides have told Reuters.\n\nTrump had withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine passed by Congress to help counter Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. During the call with Trump, the Ukrainian president agreed to investigations of Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. The aid was later provided.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump waves from Air Force One as he arrives at Pittsburgh International Airport in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 23, 2019.
