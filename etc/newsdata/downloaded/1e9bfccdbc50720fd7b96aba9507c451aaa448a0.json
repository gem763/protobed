On Monday, stock exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, will be closed, so don\u2019t look for any action in individual stocks or indexes including the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.16%, S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% or Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.13%.\n\nSifma, the securities-industry trade group, has recommended the bond market be closed on Labor Day. Trading in most commodity futures on U.S. exchanges will also be halted.\n\nThe pause might offer some welcome time for reflection after a volatile August in which stocks dropped sharply before trimming their decline. Major indexes were still on track for a negative monthly performance, the first since May.\n\nThe intensifying U.S.-China trade war stoked fears of recession, which also sent gold and Treasurys soaring as investors sought havens. The rally in Treasurys dragged down yields, with the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.00% hitting an all-time low below 2% before backing up somewhat.\n\nThe 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% fell to its lowest level since 2016 and was seen within hailing distance of its all-time low. Moreover, it fell below the yield on the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00%, marking an inversion of the main measure of the yield curve \u2014 a phenomenon viewed as a mostly reliable recession warning signal, albeit with a lag. The 10-year had already been trading below the yield on the 3-month bill TMUBMUSD03M, +0.00%, seen as an even more reliable recession indicator.", "description": "U.S. financial markets will be closed for Labor Day, giving U.S. investors a three-day weekend.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ482_labord_ZG_20190830110749.jpg"}
