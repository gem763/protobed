Beyond the shrill efforts of Johnson and his advisers to pin the guilt on other parties, nothing concrete has changed. The EU position remains much as it was before.\n\nBut we have learned a few things.\n\nFirst, Johnson clearly believes that the more the objections to his plan pile up in the EU, the greater his chance of winning an imminent general election at home. It doesn\u2019t matter that the Brussels position has always been consistent: to respect the promises made by both sides on Northern Ireland to safeguard peace and the integrity of Europe\u2019s single market. Nor does it matter that any serious analysis of Johnson\u2019s \u201ctwo borders for four years\u201d proposals (with a regulatory border in the Irish Sea and a customs border on the Irish mainland) would immediately identify its impossibilities. The British response to Brussels\u2019s reasonable doubts is pure electioneering.\n\nThe No. 10 source cited in the Spectator made an explicit link between the Johnson deal being rejected and how the Conservative Party would campaign to see off the threat of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. The source boasted too that \u201cover half\u201d of the British electorate would agree the EU was at fault (although one poll suggests they would also blame Johnson).\n\nSecond, there is a recurring fantasy among pro-Brexit politicians that the way to get around Brussels is by pressuring individual countries. The assertion by Downing Street sources that Merkel, hardly known for changing EU policy on the hoof, unilaterally demanded that Northern Ireland stay inside the EU\u2019s customs union \u201cforever\u201d was unconvincing in its details. But as an indication of Merkel\u2019s unwillingness to sacrifice Dublin\u2019s interests or EU unity to avoid a no-deal Brexit, her exchange with Johnson was instructive.\n\nIt is likely that Merkel simply refused to budge on the backstop and that this is being spun by Johnson\u2019s team as aggression on her part to fire up nationalistic U.K. voters \u2014 a dangerous road to travel.\n\nThird, Johnson\u2019s willingness to try to sabotage the EU from within if he doesn\u2019t get his way is becoming more apparent. Until now, Britain has stuck by commitments not to put sand in the gears of EU process. But officials in Brussels aren\u2019t blind to the prospect of a more hostile strategy, including open alliance with anti-EU parties and politicians across the region. With Johnson\u2019s excitable adviser Dominic Cummings calling the shots in London, anything\u2019s possible.\n\nDoes all of this put paid to the chances of an agreed deal at next week\u2019s EU summit? Almost certainly, though the EU notes that technical talks are continuing.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the salient facts haven\u2019t changed: Johnson says he\u2019ll respect a law passed by Parliament that forces him to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline; many EU capitals have said they\u2019ll accept such a request if it comes with a reason such as a U.K. election; and both sides say a deal is better than Britain crashing out with no safety net. Talk is cheap, anonymous briefings are even cheaper, but the cost of a no-deal Brexit remains exceptionally high for everyone concerned.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.
