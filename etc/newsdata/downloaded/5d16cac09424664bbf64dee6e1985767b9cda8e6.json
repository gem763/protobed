The next leg of the journey involves something we\u2019ve always been interested in: the connection between our associates and our customers.\u201d\n\nThe behind-the-scenes app is called R-World and it is highly useful. First there\u2019s a section called TB Inspo, short for Thomas Burberry Inspiration, which has information about the store that the sales associates use. \u201cThe sales associates have played an important part in developing aspects of the way the app has grown,\u201d Morris says. \u201cSo, there are certain features and functionality that we have, which we just wouldn\u2019t have thought of ourselves as a central product team.\u201d\n\nSuch as?\n\n\u201cWell, certainly in TB Inspo we didn\u2019t think the daily news component was very important. And the associates told us \u2018No, you absolutely need that.\u2019 When we introduced it, associates\u2019 usage increased dramatically. And it\u2019s not that that information wasn\u2019t available elsewhere, it was, but just not in a way that was easy for them to engage with. So suddenly, with something that looks kind of like an Instagram feed, you can just look, engage for a minute each morning and learn three key things.\u201d\n\nR-World is also a stock management tool. Associates can launch a camera function in the app to scan barcodes on a scarf or a trenchcoat and instantly discover what the stock levels are, plus in which of the multiple storerooms the stock is. No longer does an associate keep a customer waiting while searching through more than a dozen distant rooms.\n\n\u201cStock management can be quite difficult as an associate, when people are asking things for you, you\u2019re hunting back of house, it\u2019s not very easy. Having a scanning functionality that works in low light conditions and has live information means you\u2019re able to spend more face time with the customer. If an associate is gone for 10 minutes, then then they\u2019ve broken the moment. Things like that make that core relationship more seamless.\u201d\n\nThe R-World app also lets associates check client details and sends a birthday email, if the customer has been happy to share their date of birth.\n\nR-Message is a messaging component, you\u2019ll be unsurprised to hear, that is going live now for customers in the Manchester store and to be rolled out to other stores. It\u2019ll appear in the regular Burberry consumer app, but only for selected customers, based partly on spend and purchase frequency. It means that sales associates will be able to send messages to the chosen clients in a personal and direct way.\n\nSo, an associate could follow up on a sale with a message asking how the purchase worked out and offering a few other options, building what Burberry calls a digital rail of images that the customer can choose from. It all appears seamlessly in the app and the customer can buy any item directly if they wish. The texting that happens is as sophisticated as in other apps, showing when the customer or associate has read the message and so on.\n\nApple worked in depth with Burberry\u2019s app development team to help create both the customer and staff-focused apps, as it does with many companies. Its experts are available to businesses of any size, who can ask for advice about mobile strategy, building apps and more. Apple also publishes two books aimed at enterprise, available without charge to help get customers started.\n\nApple\u2019s work with Burberry was also free of charge. Sure, it doesn\u2019t hurt that Burberry has bought a large number of iPhones from Apple \u2013 every sales associate has one to use, for instance \u2013 but it remains an impressive level of help.\n\nApple works with companies such as SAP, IBM, Cisco and more to create ways of helping organisations build and distribute apps. The Burberry apps use SAP \u2013 and since more than three quarters of global transactions involve an SAP system, you can see why. SAP and Apple jointly created the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS as a way of rapidly building apps.\n\nMorris recognises, though, that for all this help, it\u2019s down to Burberry to assess just how to use the app, to make sure the associates aren\u2019t, say, getting in touch too often.\n\n\u201cGenerally, people are fondly disposed to what they see as a luxury company. The relationship is important to them. But you shouldn\u2019t be expecting people to interact with you every day.\n\nI think with tools like this, it\u2019s working out what the right frequency is to speak to people. So, I think if you start with your top tier customer, this is someone that\u2019s engaged with you, the associates here will already be talking with them on the phone and other mediums. This just gives them more ability to manage that in a seamless way. But I do think that this is about augmenting the human connection. It will be that balance of the Associate who has the relationship with this person and then has the right information we can put into their hands to help them manage those tasks.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s early days, then, and the app, and how it\u2019s used, will change with time. As Morris says, \u201cI think we\u2019ll just have to see how it develops because it\u2019s personalised and it\u2019s about that individual relationship. So, I think we\u2019ll learn what the right balance is as we develop.\u201d", "description": "Apple for enterprise is a part of the electronics giant\u2019s output that you rarely hear about.
