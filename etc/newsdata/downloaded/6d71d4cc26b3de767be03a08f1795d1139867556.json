Top Agricultural Traders Get Squeezed as U.S. Exports Falter\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The biggest agricultural-commodity traders are getting squeezed.\n\nWith U.S. grain exports expected to fall more than 20% in the 2019 crop year, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill Inc. are making less money buying and selling crops. That\u2019s according to S&P Global Ratings, which estimates trading and merchandising margins for the firms have fallen by more than 10% so far this year.\n\nThe narrowing of margins comes as the trade war between the U.S. and China cuts demand for America crops. In addition, profits from processing soybeans -- which helped boost earnings last year -- have declined due to a recovery in South American crops and a slowdown in demand for soybean meal in Asia, where a deadly disease is cutting demand for the key ingredient in pig feed.\n\n\u201cMost rated companies have a large global sourcing footprint, and higher export volumes in other regions should offset weaker U.S. exports,\u201d Chris Johnson, an analyst at the ratings company, said in a report. \u201cBut earnings will still fall short of last year given the crush-margin outlook.\u201d\n\nInvestors will soon get some clarity on how much trade disputes and lower crush margins have affected the companies. Bunge, the \u2018B\u2019 in the storied quartet of agricultural commodity traders collectively known as ABCD, reports earnings on Wednesday. Quarterly results for ADM, the \u2018A\u2019, come out on Thursday.\n\nADM\u2019s exposure to the U.S. ethanol market, which has had negative margins for much of 2019, \u201cremains a drag,\u201d while oilseed crush margins \u201cface a very difficult comparison to last year\u2019s strong earnings,\u201d according to the report. Both ADM and Bunge have negative exposure to U.S. origination and trading.\n\nBunge said it wasn\u2019t in a position to comment ahead of earnings, while ADM said the company didn\u2019t have a comment. Cargill said it doesn\u2019t publicly disclose margins.\n\nProtein Boost\n\nThe outlook for agricultural commodity traders is set to improve next year, as the spread of African swine fever means other countries will have to produce more meat to supply China. That will, in turn, boost demand for the soy meal that ADM, Bunge and closely held Cargill produce in the U.S., South America and Europe.\n\n\u201cWe believe such production should lead to higher meal demand for feed and is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s because China\u2019s domestic pork supplies have yet to fall off sharply as increased pork slaughter has built up cold storage supplies in China, providing ample supply for the prepared food industry to process in 2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy most estimates, cold storage inventories have shot up to five months of industry production capacity, suggesting much higher livestock demand in 2020 once those inventories are drawn down.\u201d\n\nMany traders have also sought to diversify their businesses in recent years. Cargill has focused on expanding its beef business, while ADM has bet on animal nutrition and ingredients. Bunge, which is in the processes of restructuring its business, has so far kept a focus on oilseeds processing.\n\nBolt-on Deals\n\nDisruptions in trade could mean more divestment ahead for the crop traders even if antitrust concerns and industry disruptions don\u2019t point to \u201ca natural consolidator,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cWe expect companies to accelerate the pace of transactions to shed or spin off under-performing assets or to partner and share resources rather than go all in on new investments,\u201d Johnson said, citing Bunge\u2019s joint venture with BP (LON: ) Plc in Brazil and ADM\u2019s plan to spin of its dry ethanol mills.\n\nMergers and acquisitions probably won\u2019t accelerate much as growth comes largely from smaller capital investments and bolt-on deals from smaller segments such as alternative proteins and new feed supplements, according to the report.\n\nADM announced it reached an agreement with Brazilian beef supplier Marfrig Global Foods SA to make oilseed-based burgers, while an investment in Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: ) Inc. boosted Bunge\u2019s earnings last quarter.\n\n(Updates with ADM, Cargill responses in seventh paragraph.)", "description": "Top Agricultural Traders Get Squeezed as U.S. Exports Falter", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1I0WV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
