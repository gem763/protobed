Oil extends gains on prospect of deeper OPEC output cuts, trade talks hopes\n\nBy Jane Chung\n\nSEOUL, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose early on Friday,\n\nbuilding on gains in the previous session, after producer club\n\nOPEC hinted at making deeper cuts in supply while optimism was\n\nrevived over talks between the United States and China to end\n\ntheir trade war.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were at\n\n$59.34 a barrel by 0034 GMT, up 24 cents, or 0.4%, from their\n\nprevious settlement. Brent settled up 1.3% at $59.10 a barrel on\n\nThursday.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 20\n\ncents, or 0.37%, from their last close to $53.74 per barrel. In\n\nthe previous session, WTI settled 1.8% higher at $53.55 a\n\nbarrel.\n\nOn Thursday Mohammad Barkindo, Secretary-General of the\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said\n\nall options were on the table, including a deeper supply cut to\n\nbalance oil markets. A decision would be taken at a December\n\nmeeting between the OPEC and its partners, he said. OPEC lowered its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to\n\n0.98 million barrels per day (bpd), while leaving its 2020\n\ndemand growth estimate unchanged at 1.08 million bpd, according\n\nto OPEC's monthly report. Beyond OPEC, trade talks between the United States and China\n\nalso remained on market radar as the world's top two economies\n\nseek to resolve a more-than-a-year-long trade row that has\n\nslowed global economic growth and curbed fuel consumption.\n\n\"The United States is the largest global consumer of oil\n\nwhile China, the biggest driver of year-on-year oil demand\n\ngrowth,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader.\n\n\"The most significant sentiment driver hinges on the outcome\n\nof the trade talks which, if (they) end on a positive note,\n\ncould go along way to begin to repair the economic damage done\n\n... these economic powerhouses would need more oil,\" said Innes.\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up the first of two\n\ndays of scheduled trade talks on Thursday, with business groups\n\nexpressing optimism that the two sides might be able to ease\n\ntensions and delay a U.S. tariff hike set for next week.", "description": "Oil extends gains on prospect of deeper OPEC output cuts, trade talks hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC9R1C2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
