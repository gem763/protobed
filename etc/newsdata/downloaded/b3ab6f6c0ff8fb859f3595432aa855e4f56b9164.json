The Tories are thought to prefer simple one-on-one debates between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in a bid to reduce the election to a simple choice between the two. Labour have adopted a similar stance amid fears they could lose pro-remain votes to the Lib Dems due to the party\u2019s pledge to revoke Brexit.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s spokesman said the Labour leader was committed to holding head to head debates with Johnson, with no mention of the Lib Dems. \u201cThere are only two possible people who can be prime minister at the end of this election campaign, and those two people should have a head-to-head debate,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in the Commons, Johnson dodged a question from Swinson when she challenged him to a three-way-debate. \u201cWhat the people of this country want is their promises kept,\u201d he said in response.\n\nHow do I register to vote in the 12 December 2019 general election?

Smaller parties, including the Scottish National party, the Greens, and the Brexit party are also likely to demand the right to take part \u2013 especially in any programme on the publicly funded BBC.\n\nWhile US presidential elections have an independent organisation to agree on debate format, in the UK it comes down to bargaining with political parties by television executives. According to individuals involved in previous negotiations, the incumbent prime minister has the most power over the format of the debate, in part because channel bosses want to ensure they have the \u201cmain attraction\u201d before ripping up the schedule and cancelling peak-time programmes that could attract higher audiences.\n\nOne major concern for political campaigns is that televised debates are seen as increasingly risky, since short video clips from a debate go viral and reach a far larger audience on social media.\n\nThe broadcasters could also struggle given the relatively short election campaign of just six weeks until 12 December, which gives political parties the ability to say they only have time for a handful of head-to-head televised events. Leadership debates have a reputation for sucking up days of campaign time as candidates have to be prepared and tested. Parties are also likely to emphasise the declining audiences for television \u2013 3.5m viewers tuned in for the 2017 BBC leadership debate - and suggest they would prefer to put their efforts into digital campaigning.\n\nThere is also the precedent set by Johnson\u2019s team during his party leadership campaign. They ignored Channel 4\u2019s leadership debate completely and let their candidate be represented by an empty chair. Instead, Johnson took part in a chaotic BBC debate involving five rivals and a single head-to-head on ITV with Jeremy Hunt, shrugging off claims he was avoiding scrutiny.\n\nEver since British broadcasters convinced the UK\u2019s major political parties to take part in live televised leadership debates for the first time in 2010, political parties have been trying to avoid them or shape the format to their advantage. Former Conservative strategist Sir Lynton Crosby blamed David Cameron\u2019s decision to take part in the debates for costing him a majority, after the then Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was briefly elevated to the top of the polls.\n\nIn 2015 the Conservatives spent months wrangling with broadcasters over whether minor parties such as the Greens and Plaid Cymru should be included on stage, while in the 2017 general election the Tories decided to keep Theresa May out of the televised debates altogether \u2013 only for her to be widely mocked for her absence, in a symbolic representation of her collapsing campaign.\n\nThe often farcical debates reached a new high at the end of last year, during a lengthy back-and-forth involving May and Corbyn and an attempt to hold a public debate over Brexit. This saw both BBC and ITV pledge to hold their own head-to-head programme featuring the two leaders in the same Sunday evening time slot, despite the physical impossibility of both politicians being in two television studios at the same time. In the end neither event went ahead.", "description": "Labour and Tories prefer one-on-one format, which would mean no place for Jo Swinson\u2019s party", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5a1e82c0b5c5801be846d20bb51b31a5382b2cd/0_206_7005_4203/master/7005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a17c136a9307af66a9887787c4ca9a4e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
