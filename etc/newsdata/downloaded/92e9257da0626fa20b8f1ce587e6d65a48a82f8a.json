Proudly showing off his graduation tie, he reminisces about his desire as a young recruit to serve society and help the disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cI abide by what the force has taught me,\u201d he says, showing a list of values and mission he signed up for. Among them is \u201cupholding the rule of law\u201d, \u201cimpartiality and compassion\u201d and \u201crespect for the rights of members of the public.\u201d\n\nBut the recent political crisis in Hong Kong, which has seen police using violent tactics to crack down on increasingly radical protests, has tested his loyalty to the force.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A demonstrator is detained by police officers during a protest in Hong Kong in August.

Three days later, a 14-year-old was shot in the thigh. In the past four months over 2,000 arrests have been made.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police fire tear gas to clear pro-democracy protesters during a demonstration in Hong Kong.

Masked activists have thrown bricks and petrol bombs at police, trashed metro stations and shops seen as pro-Beijing. They have lit street fires and even attacked police or people suspected of being undercover officers or just being pro-government. Last Sunday, a home-made bomb exploded and a policeman was slashed in the neck by a protester.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police remove barricades outside the police headquarters in Hong Kong in June.

Widely circulated stories about physical and sexual abuse in a remote police detention centre have led to an unprecedented level of anger and resentment against officers.\n\nYeung disapproves of his colleagues\u2019 behaviour, something that has driven a wedge between them.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in the academy, we were taught to use only the minimum amount of force. It\u2019s not for us to deliver punishment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now, the majority of the police think the \u2018rioters\u2019 need to be punished \u2026 they attack people indiscriminately, even non-protesters.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hong Kong police chase down a couple wearing facemasks in the Central district in October.

Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Lucifer effect\u2019\u2013 power drives people crazy. They\u2019re angry and they need an outlet. But this is sacrificing the reputation of the police force.\u201d\n\nYeung says officers are no longer required to be accountable for their acts. While dealing with protests, riot police officers now wear black masks and do not show their warrant cards and their police numbers on their uniforms. Internal rules require police to write a report every time they use batons, pistols and pepper spray, but many simply don\u2019t bother anymore, he says.\n\nYeung has tried to make his colleagues see things from another perspective, but this has led to him being labelled a traitor.\n\n\u201cI tried to explain to them what civil disobedience is about. Like, if your boss refused to grant you your entitled holidays, then you take sick leave. It\u2019s about fighting against the system through legal means,\u201d he says.\n\nThe government has repeatedly refused to establish an independent commission to investigate police brutality, and this is sparking more even more public anger as it is one of several demands that protesters insist must be fulfilled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A police officer argues with a woman after clashes with anti-government protesters in the Kwai Fong district of Hong Kong. Photograph: Isaac Lawrence/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYeung believes the authorities\u2019 endorsement of harsh crackdown is actually fuelling protests.\n\nLast month, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper reported that China\u2019s public security minister had become a deputy head at the Communist party\u2019s Hong Kong Macau liaison committee \u2013 an unprecedented move analysts say has bolstered the control of the city\u2019s police force by China, which sees crackdown as a natural response to unrest\n\n\u201cI think they want to push terror to an extreme. Beat them and arrest as many as you can, and people will be too scared to come out again,\u201d he says of his bosses\u2019 attitudes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman holds a cross in front of the Mongkok Police Station as riot police holding shields stand guard during a standoff with protesters after an anti-government rally in September. Photograph: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nYeung sympathises with the protesters: \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a policeman I\u2019d be out on the streets like them.\u201d\n\nEven though Yeung thinks differently from many of his colleagues, in the eyes of protesters, he is still a \u201cblack cop\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne time, a group of young people yelled at me when I was inside a police van. I held up my arm as if to say it has nothing to do with me. But how can I not be one of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not come out to correct my colleagues\u2019 faults \u2013 that is complicity.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had thought about resigning, Yeung, in his 40s, says he has a young family and that makes it difficult. \u201cI won\u2019t rule out that possibility,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A sign condemning the shooting of Tsang Chi-kin, 18, who was shot in the chest by police during violent pro-democracy protests that coincided with China\u2019s National Day on 1 October. Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYeung, a Christian, insisted that his mission was to help the weak and to speak up about inequality. He maintains he can only support a government that serves the people.\n\n\u201cIf the country is built with flesh and blood, if people\u2019s freedoms and lives have to be sacrificed for \u2018development\u2019, I\u2019d rather not have that,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe very least I can do is to refrain from doing evil myself and to remind my colleagues not to get excessive. But they often ask: \u2018So, which side are you on?\u2019\u201d\n\n*name has been changed to protect identity", "description": "The battle with protesters is splitting the police force between those seeking power and others protecting freedoms", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d70a50e2b1d6eef0665c261e6006e6bab5bd4406/0_0_5859_3516/master/5859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d6163dc9cfb60e81a68f88a735de3b56", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
