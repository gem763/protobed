Look at independents. It\u2019s brutal. That\u2019s got to be a fire bell in the night.\u201d\n\nThe podcast launched on Saturday and is catching on in Trump World.\n\nFormer Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller is on board, as is Raheem Kassam, who was Nigel Farage\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d adviser.\n\nThe hourlong episodes air on a radio show anchored by John Fredericks, an influential conservative talker with a big audience in Virginia.\n\nFredericks, a 2020 Trump campaign advisory board member, has helped produce the show from the \u201cBreitbart Embassy,\u201d which is curated in Bannon\u2019s unique style.\n\nA framed Breitbart \u201choney badger\u201d poster hangs across from a cartoon rendering of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOcasio-Cortez reelection campaign refunds ,000 in donations from pro-Trump former Facebook exec Hillary Clinton celebrates Central Park's first statues honoring women Booker: 'Democrats don't need more candidates to enter' MORE buying jewelry from an African militant beneath the words, \u201cWarlord Economics.\u201d\n\nA glass trophy from a group called \u201cThe Remembrance Society\u201d honoring Bannon\u2019s \"tireless pursuit of freedom\u201d sits on a shelf below a yellow \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d rattlesnake print.\n\nThere are a handful of aides and family members passing through or working makeshift stations where podcast episodes are uploaded online.\n\nThe right-wing website \u201cGateway Pundit\u201d has been airing the episodes live, and Miller said they\u2019re in talks with other outlets, including One America News Network, to air clips of the show.\n\nBannon says he plans to clear out the living room in the basement to launch his own war room, complete with a rapid response team, a media booker and a polling outlet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going all in now, I\u2019ve got to,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe\u2019re riding to the sound of guns.\u201d\n\nBannon says he\u2019s been inundated with calls from allies eager to contribute.\n\n\u201cWar Room: Impeachment\u201d already has the attention of some of Trump\u2019s highest profile defenders on Capitol Hill, including Rep.

I\u2019m a math guy. I see the polls. This is not working\u2026in less than four weeks they\u2019re voting to impeach. Can someone start working 24 hours a day around here?\u201d\n\nThere are still a few bugs to work out.\n\nThe show ended about 30 seconds early after an ad failed to load and Bannon didn\u2019t realize a hot mic picked up some loose remarks.\n\n\u201cWe gotta get this f***ing thing synced,\u201d Bannon fumed. \u201cI gotta have a clock that f***ing works!\u201d\n\nBut mostly, Bannon seems thrilled to be back in the middle of a political fight that he views as a defining moment in American politics.\n\nSeveral times over the course of the interview with Meadows, he raised his arms in triumphant victory.\n\n\u201cBoom!,\u201d he shouted during a commercial break, pounding his fist into the table. \u201cThis is great!\u201d", "description": "Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon has returned from exile to defend President Trump, believing the presidency is imperiled and that Trump is in urgent need of a more robust defense against the House impea", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bannonsteve_032519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
