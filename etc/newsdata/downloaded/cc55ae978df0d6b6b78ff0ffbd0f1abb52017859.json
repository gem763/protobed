But the North paid back only $2.4 million in kind, including zinc, in December 2007 and January 2008. That is a mere 0.25 percent.\n\nThe total unpaid principal balance plus interest was $981 million as of the end of September.\n\n", "description": "N.Korea Failed to Repay Huge Debts from Seoul", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
