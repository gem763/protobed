On Friday, at least 70 people were killed when a mosque in Nangarhar province was bombed.\n\nDelayed election results\n\nWhen asked how the EU, which has only a limited footprint in Afghanistan, could leverage a truce, Kobia suggested that the Taliban might return to power in \u201cone form or another\u201d within months and so would entertain a truce to help normalise future relations with the European bloc.\n\n\u201cA ceasefire would be a token, a guarantee of goodwill and good preparation for the normalisation of these relationships,\u201d Kobia said.\n\nThe Taliban have steadfastly ruled out an immediate ceasefire, but last year downed weapons for a three-day truce.\n\nAfghanistan is currently in an uneasy waiting period following the first round of presidential elections on September 28.\n\nResults were supposed to be released Saturday but have been indefinitely delayed due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d, the Independent Election Commission said.\n\nPierre Mayaudon, head of the EU delegation in Afghanistan, said a delay of a few days to finalise results was legitimate to ensure votes were fairly counted.\n\n\u201cBut not many more days that again will go into weeks and will possibly raise the perception that something is happening,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/252035_9108475_updates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
