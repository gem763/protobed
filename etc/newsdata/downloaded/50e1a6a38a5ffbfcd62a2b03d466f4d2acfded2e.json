As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.\u2014 The Arrowhead crowd still looked red and gold, but \u201cGo Pack go\u201d cheers boomed across the stadium.\n\nWherever Packers fans were, they liked what they saw from Aaron Rodgers, even as no one knew what the quarterback himself saw on the play. One minute into the fourth quarter, Rodgers had already taken five sacks, the most he\u2019d endured since Week 1, and 11 hits. Not one but two Chiefs pass rushers closed in. But Rodgers heaved a pass toward the right sideline as he fell to the ground. His ball soared over tight end Jimmy Graham near the sideline in the end zone. But Packers running back Jamaal Williams was positioned just perfectly in the end zone corner behind Graham. Williams grabbed the ball, stepped in and maintained control even as he, too, toppled.\n\nThe score sealed the Packers\u2019 win, improving their record to 7-1 this season. The Chiefs fell to 5-3, and 1-3 at home.\n\nAaron Rodgers doing Aaron Rodgers things.

The Packers' running backs stepped up\n\nThe Packers\u2019 top receiver Davante Adams missed a fourth straight game with turf toe. But each week, Rodgers and the Packers unflinchingly find weapons to use to eke out wins. Against the Chiefs, it was a night for running backs. Aaron Jones, who broke out against the Cowboys in Week 5 with four touchdowns, added two more via passes from Rodgers to take the NFL lead with 11 scores this season. Jones had a career-high 226 yards from scrimmage, including 159 receiving on seven catches. Williams rushed for another score early in addition to his corner catch. On a night when the Chiefs generated relentless pressure, capitalizing on his running backs was a key for Rodgers\u2019 production.\n\n2. The Chiefs offense works without Patrick Mahomes\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the script from the Saints, Colts, Panthers and Jaguars already this season. They lost, respectively, quarterbacks Drew Brees, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton and Nick Foles. Backup passers stepped in, and the teams continued to win. Moore didn\u2019t win this contest, but the veteran whom Kansas City signed two months ago to the day\u2014he wasn\u2019t on an NFL roster in 2018 and was coaching high school football in California in August\u2014did far more than just manage the offense as he connected with the Chiefs\u2019 talented offensive pieces.\n\nCoach Andy Reid schemed a creative game for Moore to spread the ball around to Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, LeSean McCoy, Mecole Hardman and Sammy Watkins. Moore executed that plan with poise as the Chiefs scored on a lob, a shovel pass and a handoff. But like they did on Moore\u2019s third-and-2 pass on Kansas City's first drive, the Chiefs came up short on the night overall.\n\n3. Kansas City\u2019s defensive performance against the Broncos wasn\u2019t a fluke\n\nThe Chiefs sacked Joe Flacco nine times in their last matchup, the Oct. 17 Thursday Night Football game in which Mahomes dislocated his right knee cap. Again, against the Packers, the defense was solid, though it allowed too many big plays. If the blitz can continue to be this effective, and Moore can continue to connect with Chiefs pieces as he did against the Packers, Mahomes' already-shortened recovery timeline will seem even shorter.\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
