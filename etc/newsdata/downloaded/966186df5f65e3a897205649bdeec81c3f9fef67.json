Modern Slavery in the UK 1/13 NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation. Entitled \u2018Invisible People\u2019, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency\u2019s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking. National Crime Agency 2/13 Child trafficking Child trafficking for sexual exploitation Traffickers use grooming techniques to gain the trust of a child, family or community. The children are recruited, transported and then sold for sex, often returning to their homes immediately afterwards, only to be picked up by the same people again. This is happening here in the UK, to migrant and British-born children. Spot the signs of child trafficking: Often, children won\u2019t be sure which country, city or town they\u2019re in. They may be orphaned or living apart from their family, in unregulated private foster care, or in substandard accommodation. They may possess unaccounted-for money or goods or repeatedly have new, unexplained injuries. National Crime Agency 3/13 Agriculture Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK. Victims of this crime in the agricultural sector are often Eastern European men and women, who were promised a job by traffickers, or they could be individuals on the fringes of society, homeless or destitute. Through threats, violence, coercion or forced drug and alcohol dependency, they\u2019re enslaved, working for little or no money, living in squalid conditions having had their identity documents taken from them. Spot the signs of exploitative labour in agriculture: Agricultural slaves often have their wages paid into the same bank account, meaning an illegal gangmaster is likely collecting all their wages. Exploited agriculture workers often don\u2019t have suitable protective equipment, working instead in cheap sports clothing and trainers, and don\u2019t have a different change of clothes from day-to-day. National Crime Agency 4/13 Food processing Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names \u2013 but refuse to handover access to the accounts or bank cards. Hours are long and the work is gruelling and dangerous. Workers are abused and are controlled by threats of harm to their families at home. Spot the signs: Those exploited wear inappropriate clothes and often no safety gear \u2013 despite working with dangerous and life-threatening equipment. They may often have untreated injuries and be refused medical attention, and will live and work in agricultural outhouses. National Crime Agency 5/13 Construction Labour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation. Spot the signs of exploitative labour in construction: Exploited workers are often not provided with protective clothing or equipment, and may show signs of abuse or carry old untreated injuries. Slave workers are also likely to work extremely long work hours for six or seven days a week without any leave. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cI wanted this image to communicate that despite being forced to live, eat, wash and sleep \u2013 where they\u2019re working, in cramped and unhygienic conditions, that there is a human instinct to domesticate. I wanted to show how there is still hope and dignity in the most squalid and difficult of circumstances.\u201d National Crime Agency 6/13 Maritime In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation. Unable to read, they are offered a job, given papers to sign and begin working on a trial-basis, only to be told they have failed and owe money, and have to work more to settle the debt. They may be forced to work for long hours in intense, hazardous and difficult conditions. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cIn the 80s, Chris Killip published a series of images called In Flagrante, and these images were at the forefront of my mind while composing this shot. I wanted to show the utter desperation of these men - how passed their limit they are. The broken floats and the entire decaying environment around him, I saw as a metaphor for his existence.\u201d Rory Carnegie/National Crime Agency 7/13 Forced prostitution Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous individuals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cWhat I really wanted for this image, was to depict how women are used as commodities, the complete control slavery has over them \u2013 the helplessness of having to sit and wait for man after man, until no more men arrive. I wanted the image to show how lonely and eventually numbing that experience is, and for that ugliness to be contrasted against the bright blue of the wig \u2013 a fancy dress item that we would usually associate with a fun event \u2013 but here is used as a disguise, perhaps of her own identity to herself - to further emphasise how unjust the situation is.\u201d NCA 8/13 Cannabis farming The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won\u2019t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don\u2019t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential. Spot the signs: Aside from the strong and prolonged smell of cannabis, have you noticed a house that looks unusual? Are the windows covered or usual entry points blocked? Buildings might be over-heated \u2013 in very cold weather is the roof without frost, because the house is being kept warm to grow plants National Crime Agency 9/13 Agriculture Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.

Poor English language skills could indicate exploitation because it suggests someone else must be arranging the work. A brothel is likely to be an average house on a normal looking street, but may have curtains which are usually closed and many different men coming and going frequently. National Crime Agency 11/13 Maritime Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector: Victims might appear withdrawn or frightened, often unable to answer questions directed at them or speak for themselves,. They might be afraid of authorities like police, immigration or the tax office, and may perceive themselves to be in debt to someone else. They may not have been given proper protective equipment so can suffer illness or injury. Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cThroughout the series of images, I wanted to juxtapose the harshness of the lives of slaves against bright primary colours \u2013 colours we traditionally associate with happiness or a feeling of wellbeing \u2013 to provoke a reaction. The image, as rich as it is, communicates how completely uncomfortable this person is. I wanted to show how his body is not his own, and how he has no right to avoid hardship, avoid the ice, or wear better shoes, he is utterly controlled.\u201d Rory Carnegie/National Crime Agency 12/13 Food processing Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: \u201cThis image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is. He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn\u2019t care about whether he\u2019s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.\u201d National Crime Agency 13/13 The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.

National Crime Agency\n\nAs America marks the 400th anniversary of the day 20 African slaves were brought ashore at Jamestown, Virginia, the first of around 380,000 shipped directly to the US amid an estimated transatlantic abduction of more than 12 million people, the ceremony at Eden Cemetery in Philadelphia\u2019s western suburbs offers a powerful insight into the nation\u2019s struggle to confront its darkest history.\n\nAttended by both white and black descendants of Burr, the group was able to acknowledge the vicious, inhumane nature of slavery, a system of chattel that enabled America to win its independence and build its power, and a place where, in 1776, Thomas Jefferson, himself a slave owner who fathered children with an African woman, Sally Hemings, could declare \u201call men are created equal\u201d, even though they very obviously were not treated as such.\n\n\u201cIt does not take a brain surgeon to realise the system of slavery was a terrible, vicious system,\u201d says Stuart Johnson, who is white and is president of the Aaron Burr Association and who took part in the unveiling. \u201cAnd it took the Civil War \u2013 a bloody, terrible thing \u2013 to end it.\u201d\n\nFew seem ready for such a clear headed reckoning. When Kamala Harris, an African American senator from California who is seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination, cautiously voiced support for studying whether there ought to be reparations for slavery \u2013 \u201cWe had more than 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalised discrimination, segregation. We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing\u201d \u2013 she faced a major backlash.\n\nThese conversations come at a fraught time for the nation. Donald Trump may or may not be more racist than some of those who preceded him in the Oval Office, but he is more prepared to use racist language openly. The imprimatur of those words as commander-in-chief, allied to the massive power of social media, has emboldened many who share his views, but who may not previously have voiced then aloud.\n\n\u201cIn the past we had coded language. Now it is more direct,\u201d says Cassandra Newby-Alexander, professor of history at Norfolk State University, located 50 miles from Jamestown, where the English warship White Lion unloaded its human cargo. \u201cThere is a step-by-step process to embolden this racism, but I think it may only work for one-third of people. There are more white people unhappy with this level of hate speech.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Two hundred years of slavery was followed by the Civil War, an event that somehow inspired twisted racists such as the Charleston church killer Dylann Roof; the intentional failure of reform during Reconstruction, and then the system of Jim Crow, in which black people were returned to being second-class citizens, lynched, murdered, refused the right to live in certain areas and even to vote.\n\nToday, efforts to suppress the voting rights of minorities persist with vigour in states such as Georgia, while the criminal justice system is utterly discriminatory against people of colour. Three years ago, when the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) announced plans to establish a museum to lynching victims, it estimated at least 4,000 African Americans were summarily murdered \u2013 their killings frequently watched by large crowds \u2013 between between 1877 and 1950.\n\n\u201cIt is hard history, and it\u2019s particularly hard for Americans because it runs counter to the narrative we tell about ourselves \u2013 you know, freedom and justice for all,\u201d says Swarns, whose work includes American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White, and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.\n\n\u201cI think it is much easier to think about slavery as something that is very disconnected from us \u2013 long time ago, history book-slow, nothing to do with me today. We\u2019re often known for not being big at looking in the rear view mirror.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cComing to an understanding that slavery was as foundational as it was for a country that expounds these ideals is profoundly difficult. That is on a macro level. At a personal level, I think it is just difficult for people.\u201d\n\nAmong Swarns\u2019 revelations was that the founders of Georgetown University in Washington DC, which was established by Jesuits, owned slaves. Her 2017 report triggered reflection by a number of US universities where slavery had contributed to their wealth, as well as half-a-dozen in Britain, among them the universities of Oxford, Glasgow, Bristol and East London.\n\nEarlier this year, students at Georgetown voted to pay additional tuition fees to help establish a fund to benefit the descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold in 1838 to pay off the institution\u2019s debts.\n\nSwarns, a contributing writer for the New York Times and associate professor of journalism at New York University, says such gestures give her hope, just as incidents such as the 2017 neo-Nazi march at Charlottesville, make her despair. She says this dichotomy, the shifting back and forth of progress, is also part of America\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cThe truth is we\u2019re all of that. That is what we are,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things you\u2019re talking about \u2013 both the things that are heartening and the terrifying \u2013 play out for us in real time. But I have to be hopeful. And I believe the conversation is happening more. You had the House of Representatives talking about where there should be a study into reparations, you have candidates for president talking about it. At the same time you have the guy in El Paso [charged with murdering more than 20 people after allegedly opening fire in Walmart last month] and the guy in Pittsburgh [who allegedly opened fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in October 2018 and killed 11 people.] All of this complexity, is all us right now.\u201d\n\nCarol Anderson, professor of African American Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, has written about the backlash triggered among some white Americans following the election of Barack Obama, the country\u2019s first and only African American president. The reemergence of Tea Party activists, and congressional obstruction, was part a pattern dating to the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment that officially ended slavery.\n\nEach time African Americans have made advances, she says in her book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, white reaction has resulted in a deliberate roll back. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Jim Crow era, the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v Board of Education decision resulted in the shutting down of schools in the South, while the bloody opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to a new, coded response \u2013 the so-called Southern Strategy and the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, that took the vote from millions of black people, while helping project Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into the White House.\n\nAnderson tells The Independent the US is currently divided between those states wanting to expand access to the ballot box and make the electorate more inclusive, and those seeking to restrict access, in order to reduce the number of minority voters.\n\n\u201cA big problem [with America not acknowledging its past] is that a lot of people do not think they did anything wrong,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSome people choose not to know. When you need to keep maintaining this idea of a \u2018shining city on the hill\u2019, then the years of buying, breeding and branding of slaves does not fit well with that narrative.\u201d\n\nSome Americans believe the events of 1619 should not be memorialised at all. When the New York Times magazine announced it was dedicating an issue to mark the arrival of the the first enslaved Africans and what that presaged, a number accused the newspaper of stoking racial tensions.\n\nNewt Gringrich, a former Republican speaker of the House and a close ally of Trump, tweeted: \u201cThe New York Times 1619 Project should make its slogan \u2018All the propaganda we want to brainwash you with\u2019.\u201d\n\nBurr, the writer and academic from New Mexico who discovered her link to America\u2019s third vice president, says the opposite. In her words, Americans cannot talk enough what happened, both then and now.\n\n\u201cThe reason people don\u2019t want to talk about slavery is that they don\u2019t want to dig up the past. They don\u2019t want to take responsibility,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAll aspects of what happened to those original Africans, and what happened afterwards, should be discovered and analysed. Not enough people can be told about the 400th anniversary, not enough speeches can happen.\u201d", "description": "Sherri Burr recently learned she is almost certainly related to a notorious Broadway villain.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/22/slavery-george-washington-estate-house-slave-owner-chains.jpg"}
