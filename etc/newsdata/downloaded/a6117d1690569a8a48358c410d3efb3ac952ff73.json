His strict security made it impossible to communicate with supporters, aside from him sporadic and brief audio messages.\n\nNor, by all accounts, was he involved in any of the group's day-to-day operations. The loss of Isil\u2019s territory in March stripped him of the last of the trappings of his self-appointed role of caliph and made him little more than a fugitive in the desert.", "description": "The death of Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi came as a shock to his followers on Sunday, but not a surprise.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor", "Benedict Spence", "Michael Gove", "Nick Timothy", "Matthew Lesh"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214322032_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqUBIxVrslV3VDNZhXbh9Dr2Z8Qxj2mbySrADHD946rg0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
