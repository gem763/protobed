Yet after exploring all manner of internet wine education, I\u2019m not ready to declare it the ideal forum\u2014at least not yet.\n\nMany self-styled \u201cwine educators\u201d online claim to be certified sommeliers, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have worked in a restaurant. Others are winemakers, adjunct professors or simply oenophiles with a pedagogical bent. Whether via video or podcast, the education they offer tends to fall into two categories: basic (grape names, how to hold a glass) or wonky (the role of tannins, grapevine blights).\n\nThe educational content actual wine professionals produce mostly falls into the latter camp, and podcasts appear to be the preferred format. The decidedly wonky \u201cGuild of Sommeliers Podcast\u201d(guildpodcast.com) features sommeliers such as Geoff Kruth and Kelli White interviewing top talent. In an episode last fall, Mr. Kruth and Virginia Wilcox, winemaker at Vasse Felix in Western Australia, discussed tannins in a surprisingly lively chat. \u201cI think you can make or break a wine by getting the tannins wrong,\u201d Ms. Wilcox said. She enumerated various categories of tannin, including \u201castringent,\u201d \u201csqueaky,\u201d \u201ctoothy,\u201d \u201ctongue\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014the ones that \u201cpush to the back of your throat.\u201d I learned a lot and plan to invoke the term \u201csqueaky tannins\u201d very soon.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Would you do an online wine course? Why or why not?\n\nAnother sommelier turned podcast host, Levi Dalton, records conversations with wine professionals in his professedly \u201ctiny living room\u201d in New York. His show, \u201cI\u2019ll Drink to That!\u201d(illdrinktothatpod.com), features conversations on topics nonprofessionals might find abstruse. A conversation between Mr. Dalton and Benjamin Leroux, a young Burgundy vigneron, was a far-ranging, rather baggy discourse on topics including root stock and pruning.\n\nThe audience for these wonky podcasts is clearly presumed to be more knowledgeable than the one targeted by Philadelphia-based sommelier Marnie Old with her video series \u201cWine Simplified\u201d on YouTube. Her style is crisp and engaging, and though her videos were produced several years ago, the topics, such as \u201cHow to Taste Wine Like a Pro,\u201d are evergreen.\n\nI liked the videos of a few other sommeliers, including Steven Grubbs, whose smart, breezy series, \u201cWine\u2019s Cool\u201d was created to educate the staff of Empire State South and Five & Ten restaurants, in Atlanta and Athens, Ga. \u201cWe decided to make a series of short, unintimidating videos that would (hopefully) take people quickly from square zero to having a little working background,\u201d he wrote in an email. After Mr. Grubbs uploaded them to YouTube, Mr. Grubbs discovered that other restaurateurs were using them. \u201cIf anyone else learned from them, great,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the above offerings are available for free, some online courses can be rather pricey. For instance, Napa Valley Wine Academy conducts courses that cost hundreds of dollars, including a \u201cNapa Valley Wine Expert\u201d certification for $395. Since that was more than my last round-trip ticket from New York to San Francisco, I enrolled instead in \u201cGet Wine-Smart\u201d (udemy.com), taught by John Boyer, a geography professor at Virginia Tech. The course, from online-learning platform Udemy, cost me a mere $12.\n\nMr. Boyer\u2019s energy is equaled only by his flamboyant, invariably plaid wardrobe, and his pedagogical style is informational with an emphasis on fun. His videos cover all the basics\u2014from grape varieties to buying, storing and serving wine\u2014as Mr. Boyer tastes and riffs along with sidekick Randall Horst of Vintage Cellar wine shop in Blacksburg, Va., where some of the series is filmed.\n\nLess fun but more famous, wine critic James Suckling has joined top chefs ( Gordon Ramsay ) and movie directors ( Martin Scorsese ) at MasterClass, among the most hyped online courses. \u201cJames Suckling Teaches Wine Appreciation\u201d(masterclass.com) cost me $90 ($180 buys an all-class yearlong pass).\n\n\u201cThis class is going to be like staying with me for the week,\u201d Mr. Suckling promised early on in the series of videos, and he was right\u2014the day I devoted to his 11-lesson course felt like a week. The series alternated between picturesque scenery and shots of Mr. Suckling tasting wine after wine, rating his satisfaction numerically.\n\nAn Italian Sauvignon Blanc was \u201csuper steely, fresh, layered\u201d according to Mr. Suckling. \u201cI\u2019m 94 on that,\u201d he pronounced\u2014meaning he awarded the wine a 94-point score. In Lesson Four, he tasted the Super Tuscan Tignanello with Albiera Antinori, president of the wine company Marchesi Antinori. When they got to the 2015, he let her know he\u2019d rated the wine 98 points. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been published yet so keep it to yourself,\u201d he admonished.\n\nMy online education yielded plenty of information, some of it useful, some not so much. I remain in search of the ideal combination of content and delivery. And I won\u2019t be adopting the phrase \u201cI\u2019m 94 on that\u201d anytime soon.\n\nEmail Lettie: wine@wsj.com", "description": "Our wine columnist found copious information just a click away\u2014but the pedagogy wasn\u2019t always A+.", "authors": ["Lettie Teague", "Lettie.Teague Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX659_WINE09_SOC_20190909125030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
