The projects were financed with nearly $2 billion in loans from Credit Suisse Group AG and Russian lender VTB .\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Moeser told jurors that Boustani paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to Mozambican officials and Credit Suisse bankers to secure the contracts and loans.\n\nCredit Suisse went on to sell parts of those loans to investors, including some in the United States, who were falsely told that all the money was being used for the legitimate government projects, Moeser said. While Privinvest did deliver ships and equipment to Mozambique, she said, their value was grossly inflated.\n\nEventually, she said, the loans defaulted and investors lost their money.\n\nSchachter did not dispute that Boustani, a Lebanese citizen, paid officials, which he called the \"cost of doing business\" in Mozambique. But he said that did not violate any U.S. laws.\n\nIn fact, Schachter said, Boustani had no role in selling the loans to investors and never communicated with anyone in the United States.\n\n\"He's not a banker,\" Schachter said. \"He's a boat salesman.\"\n\nThree Credit Suisse bankers previously pleaded guilty in the case. One of them, Andrew Pearse, is the prosecutors' first witness in the trial.\n\nFormer Mozambique Finance Minister Manuel Chang was also charged in the case. Prosecutors said Chang, who is fighting extradition in South Africa, secretly had the country's government guarantee the loans in exchange for bribes.\n\nWhen the loan guarantees became public in 2016, foreign donors to cut off support and Mozambique defaulted on its sovereign debt. It remains among the world's most indebted countries.
