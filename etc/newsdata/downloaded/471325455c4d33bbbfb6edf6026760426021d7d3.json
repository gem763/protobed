Duffy has said that Trump is legitimate in suggesting that Ukraine was actually behind the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server, and that Ukraine-owned company CrowdStrike took those hacked servers to Ukraine.\n\nThe theory, which has been pushed by top White House figures, has been shot down and discredited by numerous national security experts, and has been debunked by the network\u2019s own reporters.\n\nAnd yet on Sunday, during his debut appearance as a paid CNN employee, Duffy almost immediately floated the conspiracy theory, which was quickly criticized by other panelists.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and the media were all about what happened in the 2016 election,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cWhat Mick Mulvaney said was Donald Trump said let\u2019s look and say let\u2019s get this server, this is the DNC server.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a disputed, absurd conspiracy theory that you\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d said fellow contributor Amanda Carpenter, a conservative pundit. \u201cWhat you are stating is completely inaccurate and factually wrong,\u201d former Obama official Jenn Psaki added. \u201cIt is a conspiracy theory on the right wing.\u201d\n\nDespite criticism from his fellow panelists, Duffy went back to the same exact playbook again on Monday\u2014and with similar success.\n\nWhen the congressman began to discuss the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory Monday morning on New Day, anchor Alisyn Camerota immediately cut him off.\n\n\u201cWhat Mick Mulvaney was talking about was actually trying to find the server that was the DNC server which was at the heart of the Russia investigation,\u201d Duffy claimed.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a conspiracy theory,\u201d Camerota shot back.\n\n\u201cNo, but wait, hold on a second. Where it's at might be\u2014is it in the Ukraine or somewhere else? That might be a conspiracy. But the fact that Mick Mulvaney is talking about advancing that investigation, the 2016 Russia investigation, we should applaud that,\u201d the ex-lawmaker replied.\n\nCNN did not respond to a request for comment about Duffy\u2019s contradiction of the network\u2019s own reporting. But the network\u2019s overtly pro-Trump pundits clashing with its reporters and anchors has been a recurring theme in recent years.\n\nThe network has acrimoniously parted ways with a number of pro-Trump commentators, including former Rep. Jack Kingston, former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore, and infamous Trump sycophant Jeffrey Lord. CNN also appeared to bench pro-Trump contributors Steve Cortes and Ben Ferguson for several months earlier this year\u2014though it was not clear whether their reduced appearances were simply the result of lack of interest from bookers or were related to the various controversies they found themselves in.\n\nTrump himself has privately fretted over the treatment of his biggest supporters on the network, reportedly talking to Cortes by phone about his CNN experience and repeatedly asking several administration officials the same question: \u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d", "description": "In two separate CNN appearances, in his first 24 hours as a paid pundit, the ex-congressman pushed the president\u2019s unfounded CrowdStrike theory.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_445,w_791,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571693840/duffy-cnn_dlvhxz", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
