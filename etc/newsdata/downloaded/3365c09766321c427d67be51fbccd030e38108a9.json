In the 21st century, society is slowly becoming more spiritual than religious, slowly retreating from the ritual of honouring the supernatural, to a more direct relationship between humanity and \u2018god\u2019. Popular culture plays a major role in influencing contemporary divinity and spiritual philosophy.\n\n\n\nStar Wars has existed as a cultural Goliath for over 40 years, enthralling generations. The concept of the \u2018Force\u2019, the life force with the power of creation and destruction, wielded by the Jedi \u2014 Light, and the Sith \u2014 Dark, and the eternal pursuit of balance, forms the ideational canopy of the universe. The stories have endured, grown and evolved as all of us see a little Jedi and Sith inside us from time to time, seeking balance in our own lives.\n\n\n\nThe pursuit of meaning is no longer rooted in texts and rituals. It is an evolving construct, framed and reframed by our world.\n\n\n\nThe simplicity of the spiritual plane and the moral code has eroded the mystique and reverence of the institutionalisation of faith, where the pursuit of God or fulfilment lies in the everyday. This is one of the key reasons why the concept of the \u2018Force\u2019 has endured and endeared generations, prompting volumes of literature and many even trying to attach religious status to it in the western world. Star Wars creator George Lucas once said, \u201cI see it as taking all the issues that religion represents and try to distil them to a modern construct and accept the fact there is a great mystery out there.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Jedi follow the philosophy of gaining greater resonance with the life force by emptying themselves, ending material ties and maintaining an emotional dominance over the self in service to others. Unlike the Sith, who believe harnessing negative emotions is the key to expand and maintain control over self and others, the Jedi see the tempestuous nature of emotions as destructive adhering to the Daoist philosophy of unlocking potential through severance, allowing emotions to flow to maintain self-control, clarity and balance.\n\n\n\nDaoism uses the metaphor of a clay bowl to emphasise the point. The value of the bowl comes from what is there, but its use to the world comes from what is not there. Only by trying to shed the chains of our existence can we delve into our true reflections, our convictions and the power they deliver to attain purpose and meaning in our limited existence. When haunted by visions of his wife\u2019s death, Anakin Skywalker seeks counsel from Master Yoda who advises him that the true path to enlightenment lies in \u2018learning to let go of everything one fears to lose\u2019. He implores him to rejoice for those who die and become one with the \u2018Force\u2019, as holding on to grief is the path to the Dark side.\n\n\n\nThis same philosophy echoes in a profound scene in Batman literature where Alfred Pennyworth comforts a lost and grieving Bruce Wayne, still grappling with the death of his parents, telling him, \u201cWhat is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018Do or do not, there is no try\u2019 is one of the iconic lines of Master Yoda. The Jedi and Sith are united by this virtue. They use the power of their will to bend the laws of physics, heal, fight and overcome daunting odds. It is a potent metaphor to shed doubt in pursuit of our aspirations by throwing out the assumptions of the impossible and the possible, making us capable to perform miracles. Our minds can be our greatest strength and greatest weakness as we toil for more than an abject existence, but it is key to unlearn many things we are conditioned to in order to unlock our powers. \u201cNot fully believing is why we fail,\u201d says Master Yoda.\n\n\n\nOne fundamental lesson of the \u2018Force\u2019 is that we are all connected. This is the salient difference between the Jedi and Sith. The Sith focus on empowering the self with a disdain for weakness, embracing disconnection by wielding power to impose fear, making them capable of genocide in the Star Wars universe. The Jedi believe the destruction of life is killing a part of the self, the ego paves the path to the Dark side, while there is nothing more powerful than channelling an idea greater than the individual.\n\n\n\nThe Jedi consistently use this philosophy of interconnectedness to invoke courage in their ranks to serve and protect the weak and innocent, for even in death one can live on in the \u2018Force\u2019. Similar to how Krishna advised Arjuna at Kurukshetra, in one of his many lessons to Luke Skywalker, Master Yoda says, \u201cEnergy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter (our bodies).\u201d The Star Wars verse maintains that this sacred power that binds all life can\u2019t be replicated, no matter how much machines advance. Our focus on grand technologies should not make us lose touch with the mysteries of nature and life that affect us all.\n\n\n\nPerform Miracles\n\n\n\nIn the Star Wars iconography, Darth Vader represents a mechanised man, more machine than human, isolated and obsessed with power and control, while his son Luke gains a greater connection with the \u2018Force\u2019 training in the wilderness of Master Yoda\u2019s planet, balancing his will to fight with his compassion for others.\n\n\n\nTahir Shah once said that \u2018stories are the communal currency of humanity\u2019. Stories give complex reality a form, as metaphors are the most effective at moving human consciousness. The philosophy of Star Wars has existed through evolving narratives over decades, with a cultural potency indistinguishable from the fables and epics of faiths, with the capacity to be a vein of modern theology in its own right. Our connections with the shades, morals, values and virtues of characters in sacred texts sustain their ideological power, and the enduring cultural power of the Star Wars universe cannot be seen as anything less. Star Wars will continue to evolve, gaining more layers as we change, offering spiritual sustenance through multiple mediums to generations who see the world differently every few years.\n\n\n\nAre you a Jedi? Are you a Sith? Or are you a balance of light and darkness? These questions have many answers and many more to come as the Star Wars universe does no less than nourish, question and reimagine our moral compass in the modern world. \u25a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/748625-1350-420-5/light-and-dark.img", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
