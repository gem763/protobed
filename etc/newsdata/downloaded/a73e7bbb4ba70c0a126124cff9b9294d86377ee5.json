As a debate rages over the deliberate use of incendiary language by the British right, it seems this moral equivalence has been imported.\n\nWe are told that British politics is being menaced by a general lack of civility that threatens to fuel violence from all sides, and that both left and right have an equal responsibility to dial down the rhetoric. But this deflects from the real threat: a violent far right that is emboldened and fuelled by mainstream politicians \u2013 including from the prime minister\u2019s office \u2013 and several media outlets.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to deny there is intemperate or aggressive language on the left, but rather to acknowledge where the threat of violence is chiefly coming from. As well as the murder of Jo Cox and other attacks, several rightwing plots have been foiled, and the police now say Britain\u2019s fastest-growing terror threat is from the far right, which is bombarding public figures with threats of violence and death on a daily basis and harassing them on the street. Hate crimes based on race have doubled, and on religion they have increased five-fold in the last six years.\n\nWe MPs know that Boris Johnson\u2019s rhetoric is dangerous and divisive | Tracy Brabin and Jack Dromey Read more\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s defenders claim that objections to his rhetoric \u2013 whether it be of a \u201csurrender bill\u201d or \u201cbetrayal\u201d \u2013 are simply hypocritical oversensitivity from political opponents who are themselves not averse to hyperbolic rhetoric. But the difference is context: the far right openly sees Johnson\u2019s language as legitimising its cause, lauding his tirades against what they describe as the \u201ctraitors in parliament\u201d. Even his own sister has described his rhetoric as \u201ctasteless\u201d, and his former colleague Amber Rudd says it \u201clegitimises violence\u201d. That\u2019s before we discuss how a rightwing press \u2013 which dominates Britain\u2019s media \u2013 has popularised terms such as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, \u201csaboteurs\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d, and whipped up bigotry towards Muslims, refugees, migrants and trans people.\n\nThe far right does not represent millions of people who voted for Brexit; but they have appointed themselves the protectors of what they see as a besieged nation. They use intimidation, harassment and violence against those they deem \u201ctraitors\u201d. And they see supposedly respectable media outlets and politicians legitimising their beliefs.\n\nThe mistake some of Johnson\u2019s critics are making is focusing on his lack of civility \u2013 see the new Civility in Politics awards to celebrate politicians who engage in \u201cthoughtful, reflective public debate\u201d \u2013 rather than how his language emboldens the far right. And this creates a false equivalence. When Labour supporters critique the political records of politicians they disagree with (for example Jo Swinson\u2019s role in the Tory-Liberal Democrat austerity government), or support the democratic deselection of Labour candidates, it is invariably treated as abusive or bullying, and placed in a \u201ccrimes against civility\u201d box along with far-right threats of violence. It is nothing of the sort.\n\nIt is true that no political faction has a monopoly on misguided inflammatory rhetoric, but when newspapers talk of MPs engaged in \u201cforeign collusion\u201d, as the Mail on Sunday did yesterday, or Nigel Farage says \u201cwe\u2019ll take the knife\u201d to the \u201coverpaid pen pushers in Whitehall\u201d (he subsequently admitted that he should have said \u201ctake the axe\u201d), they are creating an atmosphere in which the far right thrives.\n\nWe should not be debating \u201cintemperate language\u201d. Talk of \u201cboth sides\u201d deflects from the real battle, which is to take on the far right and prevent its violent extremism flourishing.\n\n\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Hate crimes and harassment are on the rise, the perpetrators emboldened by the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones", "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371c713c2b37706e926366541e482293911bb80/0_243_3984_2390/master/3984.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0f9a9951a6a5f1de35673e5eff012b1f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
