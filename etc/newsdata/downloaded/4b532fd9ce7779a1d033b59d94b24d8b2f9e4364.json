Jeff Bezos is founder, chairman and CEO of Amazon, and he owns the Washington Post.\n\n2) Schiff said Congress also needs to examine whether Trump attempted to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner as payback to CNN.\n\n\"We don't know, for example, whether the effort to hold up the merger of the parent of CNN was a concern over antitrust or whether this was an effort merely to punish CNN,\" Schiff said.\n\nBetween the lines: Schiff\u2019s warning comes amid the tensest showdowns between the presidency and the press in our lifetimes. Trump, who calls much of the media \"the enemy of the people\" and \"fake news,\" this week took the extraordinary steps of revoking the press credentials of a CNN correspondent and berating another CNN correspondent for asking \"stupid\" questions.\n\nTrump says other reporters might be banned from the White House, too.\n\nBe smart: Some senior White House officials were uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s fixation on his inaccurate belief Amazon was ripping off the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nSeveral former senior officials tried to explain to Trump that the Postal Service's billion-dollar losses had nothing to do with Amazon. But Trump simply wouldn't accept their arguments, according to two sources with direct knowledge.\n\nsenior officials tried to explain to Trump that the Postal Service's billion-dollar losses had nothing to do with Amazon. But Trump simply wouldn't accept their arguments, according to two sources with direct knowledge. Trump, in private, often vents about Bezos and the Washington Post. In an interview with \"Axios on HBO\" last week, Trump said he\u2019s considering antitrust action against Amazon, but made plain he might not pursue it.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nThe second episode of Axios on HBO airs Sunday evening at 6:30 pm ET/PT.", "description": "To see if Trump used \u201cinstruments of state power to punish the press.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/pgL-2jykB28eJVhSXozRBvfWfWs=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2018/11/11/1541934700739.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-11"}
