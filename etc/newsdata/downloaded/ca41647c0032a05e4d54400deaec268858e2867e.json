At that time, it said second-half profit was likely to be higher than the first-half, as is typically the case for the airline, based on seasonality.\n\nThe consensus estimate before Friday's update was for the airline to report a full-year profit of HK$3.2 billion, according to 11 analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\n\"We continue to see a significant shortfall in inbound bookings for the remainder of 2019 as compared to the same snapshot last year,\" Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement on Friday.\n\nInbound traffic to Hong Kong was down 38% in September, unchanged from August, with demand from the mainland Chinese market hit especially hard, the airline said.\n\nThe 7.1% fall in passenger numbers in September was better than the 11.3% drop in August, but Cathay said an increasing reliance on transit passengers had affected its yields - a measure of the average fare paid per kilometre per passenger.\n\nCathay last month said it would cut capacity for the upcoming winter season.
