He couldn\u2019t help himself.", "language": "en", "text": "Individuals like Donald Trump, who chronically betray others, are incapable of authentic relationships or genuine human connections. They view other people solely in transactional terms. For malignant narcissists, they themselves are the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Other human beings don\u2019t have inherent dignity; their worth is determined solely in terms of what they can do for the person who is the betrayer. If the answer is nothing, then others are dismissed, discarded, and abandoned. There is no empathy, no sympathy, no guilt or shame.\n\nThe Kurds were a mere afterthought to Donald Trump. Turkey\u2019s Erdo\u011fan is the type of authoritarian leader who can easily manipulate the president. Erdo\u011fan wanted something done, and Trump was willing to do it.\n\nA year ago, President Trump was praising the Kurds as \u201cgreat\u201d allies, vowing to protect them. \u201cThey fought with us. They died with us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have not forgotten.\u201d But just a few days ago, he dismissed the Kurds this way: \u201cThey didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War. They didn\u2019t help us with Normandy, as an example.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump doesn\u2019t interpret his abandonment of America\u2019s faithful and intrepid Kurdish ally as betrayal because he can\u2019t even understand why betrayal is a vice. It\u2019s like trying to explain color to a person born with no eyesight. He doesn\u2019t appear to comprehend that a relationship without trust is not a true relationship; it\u2019s merely an exchange of needs\u2014and President Trump will betray anyone who no longer serves his needs.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Wehner", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Trump-Betrayed-Kurds-Whos-Next"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
