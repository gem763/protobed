Although that triggered a knee-jerk drop at the market open, the pound recovered in London trading, with strategists arguing that any dip would prove short-lived. U.K. government bonds slid and stocks were little changed.\n\nWith the parliamentary vote likely to be decided by fine margins, sterling failed to build on gains after breaching the US$1.30 mark. The U.K. prime minister needs to garner support of 61 Members of Parliament to back his deal \u2014 he likely has 62, according to a Bloomberg analysis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all to play for and while the numbers in parliament are extremely tight, we would give the probability of success for the government at 60 per cent either today or tomorrow,\u201d strategists at MUFG, including Lee Hardman, wrote in a client note. \u201cWe would expect to see sterling into a new equilibrium range of $1.30-$1.35 if parliament approves the deal as we expect.\u201d\n\nThe pound rose as much as 0.2% to $1.3012 after a four-day run of gains last week. Gilts sank, with the 10-year yield climbing five basis points to 0.76%, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 index of stocks held two weeks of gains.\n\n\u201cThe price action today suggests that the FX investors are fairly comfortable holding on to their pound positions, notwithstanding the lingering political uncertainty in the U.K.,\u201d said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 strategy at Credit Agricole SA. \u201cThis could point at further pound resilience on the back of abating concerns about a no-deal Brexit and/or hopes for a Brexit deal.\u201d\n\nSome analysts remained cautious, given a set of potential amendments on a second referendum and a customs union is being considered.\n\n\u201cEven if there is a positive outcome for the government, then the next set of risks are the actual amendments,\u201d said Petr Krpata, chief currency strategist at ING Bank. If the customs union motion is passed \u201cthere is a risk that the whole bill will lose the support of the hard-line Conservative Brexiteers and the deal won\u2019t eventually have a majority. So still plenty of uncertainties.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Johnson will try again to get his Brexit deal passed by parliament today", "authors": ["Anooja Debnath", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brexit-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
