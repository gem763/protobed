REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers will bring a motion to censure the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, on Monday, a largely symbolic act by the minority party to express dismay about the impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican.\n\n\u201cHow many times has he (Schiff) lied to us? He should be censured,\u201d said the top Republican in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on Friday.\n\nMcCarthy said Schiff misled the public by saying he did not know the identity of the whistleblower who reported that Trump had pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to dig up information about a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThat report precipitated the investigation into whether Trump should be removed from office.
