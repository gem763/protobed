The whistleblower\u2019s confidentiality is preserved even as the government investigates the claim.\n\nAt no time during the government\u2019s investigation into a company or individuals accused of wrongdoing is the target of the investigation entitled or allowed to \u201cface\u201d the accuser. Nor is the whistleblower allowed to discuss the matter with anyone other than his or her attorney.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the government may confidentially interview the whistleblower, interview other witnesses or try to corroborate the report with other evidence. The emphasis throughout the investigation is on the credibility of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, rather than the identity of the person reporting wrongdoing.\n\nIntelligence community whistleblowers are in an especially precarious position. They have far fewer retaliation and safety protections than private sector whistleblowers. And the heightened media attention often makes them more vulnerable to threats from members of the public.", "description": "", "authors": ["Noelle Yasso", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Trump-Impeachment-Protect-Whistleblower-Identity-Safety-Column"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
