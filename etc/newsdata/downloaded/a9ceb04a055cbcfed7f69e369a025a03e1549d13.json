REUTERS/Noor Khamis\n\nThe no-frills carrier, founded by Kenya Airways five years ago, ferries 700,000 passengers a year within Kenya and to neighbouring Uganda after an aggressive expansion aimed at first time flyers who would normally take a bus.\n\nLike budget carriers in Europe and South Africa, Jambojet passengers only pay for seats. The airline charges extra for services such as baggage and meals, allowing ticket prices to compete with buses and trains.\n\n\u201cPeople like this model, they are flying this model,\u201d Allan Kilavuka, Jambojet\u2019s CEO, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe airline has grown traffic by a compounded annual rate of 25%, giving it a modest return, Kilavuka said, although he declined to give figures.\n\nExcept for Ethiopian Airlines, most bigger carriers in the region are loss-making, including Kenya Airways, which parliamentarians voted to re-nationalise in July.\n\n\u201cWe are profitable,\u201d Kilavuka said. \u201cThe margins are very thin given the costs that we have to incur, and the challenge is to maintain this profitability because the industry is volatile.\u201d\n\nJambojet operates six De Havilland Q-400 planes and plans to get two more by year\u2019s end, Kilavuka said.\n\nIt flies to five destinations in Kenya and to Entebbe in neighbouring Uganda and plans to start flights to South Sudan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Comoros.\n\nThe carrier also wants to boost daily usage of its planes from eight hours to 10 or 13 hours, he said, a move that would give it excess capacity.\n\nAir travel in Africa is growing at about 6% per year, the CEO said, but from a low base.\n\n\u201cWe need to scale up but that needs to be done responsibly so you don\u2019t overheat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt (the budget carrier model) is more manageable. It is easy for you to flex and change.\u201d", "description": "Kenya's first low-cost airline, Jambojet, plans to more than double its annual passengers to 1.5 million in the next three years by opening new routes in East Africa and flying planes more often, its chief executive said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Duncan Miriri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433794774&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1ER-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
