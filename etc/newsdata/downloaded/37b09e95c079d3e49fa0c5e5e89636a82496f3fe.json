A foreign national, believed to be a Somalian shopkeeper, was arrested with an unlicensed gun, according to sources close to the South African police.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday condemned the wave of xenophobic violence.\n\nAttacks on businesses run by \"foreign nationals is something totally unacceptable, something that we cannot allow to happen in South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in a video address diffused on Twitter.\n\n\"I want it to stop immediately,\" said Ramaphosa, adding that there was \"no justification\" for the violence.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said he went to the \u201chostels\u201d to speak to people about the attacks.\n\nThe word hostels implies to many South Africans that the people he spoke to were Zulus - who still live in impoverished ghettoes formed during South Africa's mining boom.\n\n\"This violence is now mutating and taking different forms that represent themselves in a way that we do not want to see in South Africa, where communities seem to be attacking one another. We want this to stop immediately,\" he said.\n\nWhile most illegal foreigners are from African countries, such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Burundi, there is a steady flow of illegal nationals from Pakistan who mostly enter the country from Mozambique.\n\nSouth African truckers also started a nation-wide strike on Sunday to protest against the employment of foreign drivers.\n\nThey staged road blockades and torched foreign-driven vehicles in various parts of the country on Monday.\n\nPolice say about 200 long-haul drivers were injured or killed on the 350 mile highway between Johannesburg and port city Durban last year, while more than 2000 trucks were attacked.\n\nBishop Paul Verryn, who allowed thousands of Zimbabwe refugees to live for more than five years in Johannesburg\u2019s Central Methodist Church, said he was approached by a group of foreign long-haul truck drivers last Saturday: \u201cSomehow they knew violence was coming and came to tell me of their fears.\u201d", "description": "The death toll from sweeping anti-immigrant riots in Johannesburg suburbs rose to five on Tuesday as police attempted to restore order with rubber bullets.
