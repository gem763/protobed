Companies may provide list prices, but they also negotiate discounts and after-market rebates with purchasers and their representatives such as pharmacy benefit managers, health insurers, employers, and government and state health coverage programs.\n\nICER evaluated the pricing in partnerships with SSR Health Inc, a research firm, which calculated the increases excluding discounts and after-market rebates.\n\nGilead spokesman Ryan McKeel disagreed with ICER's conclusion, saying it left out real-world and economic evidence. Biogen spokeswoman Nin Varghese said ICER's methodology was flawed and did not consider evidence it submitted such as observational studies.\n\nLilly spokesman Mark Taylor also questioned the methodology for the report and said that generic versions of Cialis were on the market for less than 90% of the retail price.\n\nPfizer spokesman Steve Danahy said the analysis did not include external factors that affect drug prices or take into account what an appropriate value-based price should be.\n\nRoche spokeswoman Emmy Wang said that in pricing drugs, the company strived for the right balance between patient access and investing for breakthroughs in medicine.\n\nAmgen and AbbVie did not have an immediate comment.\n\nICER acknowledged it was difficult to determine the actual increase in spending on the drugs, but said it was confident that the seven drugs cost a lot more.\n\nPricing drugs based on new benefits could help slow cost hikes, ICER Chief Medical Officer David Rind said.\n\n\"If manufacturers weren't raising prices if they haven't shown a new important benefit, I think that would help,\" he said.\n\nCelgene's Revlimid and Gilead's Genovya were also large contributors to spending but were excluded from the list because of their clinical advancements, ICER said.\n\nHumira's net price increase over 2017 and 2018 added $1.8 billion in spending while Rituxan added $806 million, the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Richard Chang and Bernadette Baum)", "description": "AbbVie Inc's arthritis drug Humira and Roche Holding AG's cancer drug Rituxan topped a list of seven treatments whose combined 2017 and 2018 price hikes accounted for a $5.1 billion increase in U.S. spending, a report released on Tuesday showed.
