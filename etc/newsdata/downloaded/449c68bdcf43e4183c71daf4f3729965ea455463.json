An intro that mirrors that iconic Phantom Menace trailer opening shot! The Millennium Falcon lining up for space battle! Rey jumping on stuff!\n\nOf course, the trailer is just like all the other Star Wars trailers going back to Phantom Menace, so it does a fantastic job teasing us with a bunch of tantalizing shots without actually letting us in on, uh, what even happens in this movie. Emperor Palpatine's creepy voice is back somehow, C3PO loves his friends, and Rey is about to have a final showdown on a water planet for the fate of the galaxy or whatever\u2014but how that will actually play out on screen is anybody's guess! Let's just hope Phoebe Waller-Bridge gets a cameo as the Millennium Falcon at some point.\n\nWe'll have to wait until JJ Abrams's last movie in the Skywalker Saga hits theaters December 20 to get some answers. Until then, give the trailer a watch above and buy tickets because they're on sale now.", "description": "Rey fights Kylo on some water planet, C3PO loves his friends, and more!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dae06afc35524000d715d66/lede/1571709521607-Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-95748-PM.png?crop=0.7370370370370369xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
