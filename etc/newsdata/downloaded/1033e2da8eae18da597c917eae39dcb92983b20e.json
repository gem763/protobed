She was in town because her brother, the WeWork CEO and cofounder, Adam Neumann, had just invested $30 million in Scobie's company \u2014 at an eye-watering valuation of \u00a32.75 billion, or $3.5 billion. Scobie took it as a mark of favor for him and his team.\n\n\"He repeated that she was a supermodel about 30 times,\" one staff member recalled.\n\nTo welcome her, Scobie had spent more than $5,000 on a private meal at his Edinburgh home for 10 employees and executives from his energy-tech startup, Faraday Grid. The celebrity chef Luke Thomas, who, now 26, is sometimes described as Britain's youngest head chef, was catering.\n\nIt was a last supper before everything would unravel.\n\nWithin four months, Andrew Scobie would be fired from Faraday Grid over suspected gross misconduct, as would his romantic partner Jacqui Porch, the company's chief marketing officer.\n\nFaraday Grid itself would then collapse into administration \u2014 the UK's approximate equivalent of bankruptcy \u2014 in August.\n\nAdam Neumann's $30 million cash injection and an additional $110,000 personal loan to Scobie would, with hindsight, look like a bad bet. Neumann himself would soon be wrestling with bigger problems, facing a string of lurid stories about his behavior and his firm's governance and business model. He would eventually step down as CEO of WeWork, and his main backer, SoftBank, would take control of the firm he built.\n\nFaraday Grid's rapid expansion and sudden collapse echo the situation of WeWork, which is scrambling to stay afloat after once sitting among the world's most valuable private companies. It also reflects the risks when the wider business world draws direct inspiration from WeWork and SoftBank, justifying aggressive, expensive expansion and eye-watering valuations with a noble mission to change the world.\n\nFaraday Grid was an energy tech startup that promised to change the world\n\nNamed after the 19th-century physicist Michael Faraday, Faraday Grid had been working on a system meant to help national power grids handle greater amounts of renewable energy. The tech was billed as potentially world-changing \u2014 but the firm ran out of money and imploded amid allegations of financial mismanagement and personal misconduct before even getting customer trials off the ground.\n\nInternal documents reviewed by Business Insider that were drawn up as part of an investigation by Faraday Grid's board and in-house counsel offer an unfiltered window into the divisive issues that tore the billion-dollar startup apart.\n\nThey detail how Scobie and Porch borrowed money from the company to do up their house, used company cards for personal expenses, and spent lavishly on business travel and hotels \u2014 as well as the luxurious February dinner, the spending on which was cited as having been a factor in Scobie's firing.\n\nAnd they reveal that Scobie had additionally borrowed $110,000 from Adam Neumann directly, as Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThere are also allegations within the documents concerning Scobie's personal conduct, with the documents alleging that the executive would swear at and humiliate employees \u2014 allegations repeated by former employees who spoke with Business Insider.\n\nScobie has denied wrongdoing and disputed allegations within the documents and from former staff that he spent money without board approval. He says that he hired lawyers and began proceedings for a claim of unfair dismissal but that the firm collapsed before he could bring a case. He did acknowledge that he borrowed money from Faraday Grid, that he was prone to swearing, and that he had made some personal purchases via the firm's credit cards \u2014 but he also says he repaid that money.\n\n\"For the record, there were no formal complaints about my behavior at any time,\" he told Business Insider. \"And we openly set about building a proactive culture as an open, candid, and rigorous company at all times, based on decentralized decision-making.\n\n\"But we were also in a fast-moving, pressured environment given the changes we aim to make to the world's energy systems, and everyone's perception of appropriate behavior is slightly different.\"\n\nHe acknowledged the February dinner, saying: \"Ms. Neumann spent two days in our Edinburgh office as part of the due diligence process Adam Neumann's office undertook as part of investing in the company. We understood she had dietary constraints so we asked a chef known to the company (for his healthy cooking and menus) to prepare a specific meal for her and Faraday Grid management one evening.\"\n\nPorch responded to allegations of personal expenditure on company cards, saying: \"Business development, supply-chain building, fundraising, and marketing activity in multiple global markets required much of the executive[s] to travel internationally on a regular basis. Hotels were selected based on proximity to business activity and/or access to professional services.\"\n\nPorch said that she also began proceedings on a claim of unfair dismissal but that the firm collapsed before this could go further.\n\nRepresentatives for Adam Neumann and separately for the Faraday Grid funder Atika Capital declined to comment.\n\nScobie was the CEO of Faraday Grid. Faraday Grid/YouTube\n\nRare teas and misquoted 18th-century philosophers\n\nScobie paired a messianic vision with an outspoken passion for classical philosophy.\n\n\"My plan to save the planet keeps bumping into the seen and the unseen,\" the CEO wrote in an official company blog post in 2016. It was an expression of his world-changing aspirations. In the same post, he segued into a discussion of ancient Stoic philosophers, a recurrent personal and professional interest of his.\n\nFaraday Grid's entire Edinburgh headquarters stood as a temple to the Enlightenment philosophers and scientists who Scobie deeply admired.\n\nFormer employees described seeing old editions of works by physicists and political scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Adam Smith, and Michael Faraday on their CEO's shelves. \"They were the kinds of books you would only touch with gloves,\" one ex-staffer recalled. Another added: \"These were economic and engineering texts that Andrew Scobie thought were fundamental to shaping the company's vision and tech, paying testament to those philosophers.\"\n\nScobie had hoped to follow in these great men's footsteps with a Ph.D. in economics from Melbourne's RMIT university. He never finished the qualification, according to his supervising professor, Jason Potts, putting the qualification on hold in 2014 to pursue Faraday Grid.\n\nStill, he pushed a philosophy of \"rationalism\" among his 200-strong workforce, giving lectures and instructing them on the importance of making rational decisions. To emphasize the point, decals of quotes from the various philosophers and scientists were dotted around the office walls, and rooms were named after famed thinkers.\n\nEmblazoned across Scobie's office was a quote attributed to Smith, the legendary Scottish economist: \"All money is a matter of belief.\" The quote, however, appears to be apocryphal.\n\nBusiness Insider consulted Knud Haakonssen, a professor at the University of St. Andrews who is an expert on Smith, and he was unable to find the quote in any of the economist's works.\n\nFaraday Grid's Edinburgh, Scotland, office. Reproduced with permission of David Cadzow. David Cadzow\n\nTall, well-built, and florid, Scobie liked to project a worldly air, former staff recalled. He enjoyed talking about the provenance of the rare teas he kept in his office from China and Japan, one former employee said. He could switch gears easily into talking about fine vintages or, another person said, anything about world history.\n\nHe was also prone to explosions in temper and swearing \u2014 something that would play a part in his undoing at Faraday Grid.\n\nNow in his late 50s, Scobie had been around the block. In 2001, He was declared bankrupt in his native Australia, local records show. He picked himself back up in later years and was appointed to prestigious industry positions in Australia's island state Tasmania, but he then faced accusations of conflicts of interest and questions about funding over the roles he held in 2008. A government report later cleared him of wrongdoing.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, Scobie had moved to Edinburgh and was devoted to Faraday Grid's lofty mission. Throughout 2016 and 2017, his business was working on developing a prototype of its \"flow control device,\" called the Faraday Exchanger.\n\nThe prototype was what's known as a three-phase transformer, and the goal was to develop a system that could replace traditional electricity transformers in national power grids. As the company's chief technology officer, Matthew Williams, wrote in February 2019: \"At its core, the electricity grid is no longer fit for purpose \u2014 it was never designed for this new world of distributed renewable energy.\" (To the untrained eye, the device looked like a large metal box.)\n\nAround the world, national power grids are attempting to transition away from reliance on fossil fuels, and Faraday Grid was well-placed to take advantage of this unprecedented interest in renewable-energy infrastructure. Accordingly, the initial goal was to get to grid-level testing with some early partners. But research and development is expensive, and in 2017 the company lost \u00a31.8 million, or $2.3 million in today's dollars, accounts filed with the UK's Companies House show.\n\nThat's not unusual for a capital-intensive and intellectual-property-heavy business \u2014 but it meant the firm keenly needed to seek outside funding.\n\nA prototype of the Faraday Exchanger. The Faraday Grid/YouTube\n\n'Andrew thought he was on the pathway to being a billionaire'\n\nA failed funding round in mid-2018 helped Faraday Grid hit the jackpot.\n\nAmp, a small Canadian clean-energy firm that previously invested in Faraday Grid and sat on its board, had committed to a further funding round before having to pull out, two sources said. To fill the gap, Amp's executives introduced Faraday to other potential backers \u2014 including Adam Neumann.\n\nThus far, it had been a tough year for fundraising. Scobie was shopping the firm around to prospective investors, touting his firm's smart grid system, but without success, sources said.\n\nOne investor source considered investing in Faraday Grid for a client and saw the pitch. The investor expressed skepticism. \"The conclusion [we] came up with was that the technology didn't stack up,\" the person said. \"He had a tech that sounded revolutionary, but the evidence they provided was based on a lab-based trial that couldn't be replicated. Every time we asked for details on how it worked in practice, he sent a video of the trial, but I have no idea whether that was real.\" The investor advised the client not to invest.\n\nMeanwhile, the office-sharing giant WeWork was flying high with a valuation of $47 billion and a prospective stock market float. Neumann was a paper billionaire many times over and was known to invest eclectically in businesses that interested him \u2014 as evidenced by WeWork's $13 million investment in an artificial-wave startup in late 2017.\n\nIn mid-2018, Scobie and Porch duly boarded a plane to New York, along with Paul Ezekiel, the Faraday Grid board member and Amp executive who sources said had made the intro to Neumann.\n\nThe eccentric Israeli-American real-estate entrepreneur had none of the same reservations as other prospective investors. It was, one source with knowledge of the encounter said, a \"meeting of the minds.\" (Faraday Grid seems to have appealed to Neumann's interest in environmental issues, which saw him ban meat from WeWork company events in 2018 and banish disposable cups from its locations.)\n\nFaraday Grid's executives returned to Scotland triumphant, with $30 million in hand and a sky-high \u00a32.75 billion valuation for the business.\n\n\"Andrew thought he was on the pathway to being a billionaire,\" the source said.\n\nFaraday Grid announced the investment in January, and Scobie gave employees the impression the firm could secure more capital whenever it needed.\n\nFor the next few months, Neumann's investment would be managed by a full-time WeWork employee in New York named Daragh Murphy, documents and sources indicate. It isn't clear why a WeWork employee was chosen to look after a personal investment. Neumann had separately set up a family office called 166 2nd Financial Services to manage his personal wealth, and it had been this entity that invested in Faraday Grid, according to 2018 filings.\n\nWeWork confirmed Murphy's involvement but declined to give further details. Murphy did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. A representative for Adam Neumann declined to comment.\n\n'It was kind of a joke that he bought himself a \u00a370,000 stereo'\n\nWith $30 million in the bank offering much-needed financial breathing room, Scobie turned his mind to another worry: Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nAmid political uncertainty in the UK, there was the risk that the left-wing politician's Labour Party could seize power in an election \u2014 prompting the Australian executive to launch a new office in Switzerland in a novel scheme to shield Faraday Grid from any socialist encroachment.\n\n\"It was driven by a fear that if Corbyn gets in, he nationalizes the electricity grid and then Faraday Grid is at risk from the government stealing its intellectual property,\" one source said.\n\nThe launch of this Swiss center was part of a broader spending spree by the company in the first six months of 2019.\n\nIt hired six C-suite executives, including a new chief financial officer and a new chief operating officer. It acquired three businesses in the Czech Republic from Chinese manufacturing firm Foxconn, forming a new local subsidiary. (The acquisitions cost about $3.6 million, internal documents stated.) It opened new offices and labs in the United States, in addition to Switzerland. The firm's headcount grew to 200 people.\n\nScobie told Business Insider that Faraday Grid had developed the Swiss backup plan as a response to the uncertainty around Brexit. He said: \"The board gave appropriate consideration to [Faraday Grid's] location due to the ongoing political instability in the United Kingdom. For this reason the decision was made by the board to develop a contingency to move the company's HQ to mainland Europe.\"\n\nBy this point, the firm's monthly burn rate was between $3 million and $4.4 million, two former employees said. But despite a rapidly depleting balance sheet, Scobie was bullish and pursuing additional funding.\n\n\"Andrew would keep saying, for a long time, that he'd got some really important, really rich person who would invest,\" one employee recalled. But it would fail to materialize, and, the person said, \"everyone would forget about it.\"\n\nIn the months after Neumann's funding, Scobie told employees that Goldman Sachs had valued Faraday Grid at $6.5 billion. Former employees aren't sure the valuation ever happened, though Scobie said in a statement that a \"tier one bank\" had come up with the valuation. Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the business expanded, Scobie became more extravagant with his own spending. Internal documents detail that he and Porch borrowed at least $100,000 from the company, using the cash to renovate their house in Edinburgh, ostensibly to hold board meetings and corporate events. It was here that the $5,000 dinner for Adi Neumann was held in February 2019.\n\nAdi Neumann is the sister of the WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann. Roger Kisby/Getty Images\n\nScobie told Business Insider that this loan had been approved by the board. \"Despite this fit-out being for the explicitly benefit of the company, I insisted it be treated as a loan to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest,\" he said. \"This loan was repaid in full.\"\n\nOther expenses listed include \u00a364,000 ($81,000) spent on a hi-fi and speakers and a rug costing \u00a32,625 ($3,300).\n\nScobie said all this expenditure was part of the original loan. \"This expenditure was part of the approved loan mentioned above and was used to equip the house to be used as a space for private meetings, board meetings, and overflow work from the office. All monies were repaid,\" he said, adding that the firm had appropriate governance from the start.\n\nThe pair were open about their spending and also spent lavishly using the company credit cards, according to internal documents.\n\n\"Andrew and Jacqui went everywhere together, they stayed in the finest hotels,\" one former staffer recalled, adding that one board member would observe that \"watching Andrew and Jacqui's Instagram was like watching a permanent holiday channel.\"\n\nScobie's Instagram feed featured images of meals from Michelin-starred restaurants. Instagram\n\nAnother said: \"Andrew loves living a lavish lifestyle, that's his thing. It was kind of a joke in the company that he bought himself a \u00a370,000 stereo for his office.\"\n\nScobie's Instagram account (now private) would show beautifully arranged meals at Michelin-starred restaurants in Geneva and ski trips. \"None of this was done discreetly,\" a source said.\n\nDocuments show that on the company credit cards, Scobie racked up thousands of pounds on a custom suit, a new shirt, and a $1,000 Montblanc pen. Porch took her school-age daughter on a business trip and charged the fare back to the company. Documents also listed costly philosophy books, worth some \u00a32,500 ($3,100) altogether, plus a miscellany of smaller expenses costing thousands of pounds.\n\nScobie said some of the purchases were made in error on company cards. \"I purchased a number of personal items which were misallocated to company rather than personal accounts and were repaid to the company,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHe described the collection of books as a corporate library available to all staff to create a \"culture of mutual learning discovery and discussion.\" He said the books were not antique, as some sources described, but secondhand.\n\n\"Any personal expenses over time were subject to a reconciliation process and repaid,\" Porch said. She said that she had taken her daughter on a business trip as a special case and that this had been approved by the board.\n\nAccording to documents filed by Faraday Grid's administrators in October, Scobie and Porch did indeed pay back their loans \u2014 but only after the company had already collapsed.\n\nAdam Neumann's new aide unearthed multiple issues\n\nIn June, the Neumanns appointed Ilan Stern to run their family office, 166 2nd. (His appointment was reported at the time by The Wall Street Journal.)\n\nDocuments suggest that until this point, 166 2nd's involvement with Faraday Grid was still being overseen by Murphy, the WeWork employee. But Stern was a blue-chip investor, with stints at the venture-capital firm General Catalyst and Soros Fund Management. He immediately began scrutinizing his client's investment and took a board seat at Faraday Grid.\n\nHe quizzed Faraday Grid's newly hired C-suite about its finances, and this shed light on Scobie's loans, the seemingly undisciplined spending on expansion, and business travel. Scobie had also handed himself a \u00a3200,000 salary increase, documents indicated. Scobie said this increase had been approved by the board.\n\nAt some point during the year, Adam Neumann had separately loaned Andrew Scobie $110,000. The idea was that Scobie would use the money to pay off his debts to Faraday Grid, though documents and sources state that didn't happen. Scobie confirmed the loan but declined to discuss the terms or repayment.\n\nA further, quiet investigation by the in-house counsel Nathan Fagre threw up more unpleasant surprises \u2014 credible allegations from staff that Scobie was a bully.\n\nSix incidents were listed in the documents obtained by Business Insider with accusations around Scobie's behavior. According to one entry, the CEO responded badly to criticism with: \"If you don't like how it is, you fuckers can go home \u2014 there's the door.\"\n\nFour ex-staffers also described a \"culture of fear\" to Business Insider. \"Despite the company's values of rational thinkers, being open-minded, challenging the status quo, if you didn't bring good news, you were quickly on the out,\" one former senior staffer said.\n\nAnother former employee said: \"He could switch between his moods quite easily, and my impression was he would just use this to intimidate people basically. There was this one time I heard him yelling in a different office. It was so loud I could hear him through the wall.\"\n\nIn emails to Business Insider, Scobie said the allegations were \"deliberately misinterpreted\" and said there had been a positive culture at Faraday Grid. He denied calling employees \"fuckers\" but acknowledged that he sometimes swore. He said: \"Famously I do swear at times \u2014 I wish I didn't, but I do. I am working on improving this. I have never called employees 'fuckers.'\"\n\nAsked whether he had shouted at employees, Scobie responded: \"I am a passionate person who believed (and still believes) strongly in the goal we had set ourselves to materially reduce carbon emissions and increase human prosperity \u2014 occasionally that became audible but I absolutely reject there was any pattern of swearing and temper. This is simply a gross exaggeration.\"\n\nAfter its internal investigation, Faraday Grid's board felt it had sufficient grounds to fire the pair in June. The Amp executive Ezekiel took over in the interim, and the firm scrabbled to stay afloat. But in all the months it had been hemorrhaging cash, Faraday Grid was not making any money.\n\nThe company had shown off a prototype transformer at a flashy US launch event in the spring of 2019, costing the firm some $1 million, but it wasn't close to finalizing a product. The British power-infrastructure firm UK Power Networks had agreed to trial the technology, but it hadn't committed any funds. One source said Enel, an Italian energy firm, had also shown interest in a trial.\n\nIt was time for drastic action.\n\nScobie had once boasted that the firm was aiming to employ 1,000 people by the end of 2019. But the board took immediate cost-cutting measures and halved Faraday Grid's existing staff to 100. It also closed multiple offices.\n\nInitially, the remaining staff were still optimistic that Adam Neumann might stump up a lifeline for the company after its drastic restructuring. But six weeks passed, and no funding came. Though Scobie was out, Faraday Grid's cash shortage was chronic, and there was no chance of resuscitating the business.\n\nThe firm went into administration in August, and almost all of its employees were let go. The company's intellectual property and some of its assets were then sold to the highest bidder \u2014 straight back to the excommunicated Scobie and his new company, Third Equation.\n\nAccording to the administrator's report, parts of the firm he had once valued at $6.5 billion were sold for less than \u00a3400,000, or $515,000.\n\n'The WeWork parallels are so bizarre'\n\nScobie says he just wants to get on and run his newly acquired business, now operating under the banner of Third Equation Limited.\n\nThis new enterprise is backed by James Brooks, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now the chief strategy officer at the solar-energy firm Lightsource BP. Porch is the other major shareholder. It remains to be seen whether he can make the Faraday Exchanger, or something like it, commercially viable.\n\nGrant Thornton, Faraday Grid's administrator, is investigating what happened at the firm as part of the usual administration process. The firm wrote in its administrator's report that Faraday Grid owed its creditors some \u00a38 million, including \u00a31 million to employees.\n\nGrant Thornton declined to comment, other than confirming that Scobie and Porch had agreed to pay back their loans as part of an agreement to require Faraday Grid's IP.\n\nAnd at least one investor is now mulling taking legal action.\n\nAmp CEO Dave Rogers, another Faraday Grid backer, said in a statement: \"AMP is considering its own legal remedies arising out of the Faraday situation, and therefore won't be commenting at this time, except to say that it is satisfied its nominees on the Faraday board acted prudently and appropriately at all times.\"\n\nAs is often the case when a startup implodes, those left most shell-shocked by the chaotic ride are the employees. Those who spoke with Business Insider were left stunned and angry by the past six months. Some were overseas workers dependent on Faraday Grid for their visas.\n\nFormer employees are also grimly struck by the similarities they saw with WeWork's financial troubles and its CEO's ignominious exit from the firm. Neumann was ousted from WeWork in September following intense media and investor scrutiny of his behavior and the company's finances, culminating in the derailment of the startup's planned initial public offering.\n\n\"The WeWork parallels are so bizarre,\" one former senior staffer at Faraday Grid said. \"You had lots of cash coming in, no diligence, empowering an egomaniac CEO to conquer the world and an inflated valuation. That's the SoftBank-WeWork model.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact the reporter, Shona Ghosh, at sghosh@businessinsider.com, shonaghosh@protonmail.com.
