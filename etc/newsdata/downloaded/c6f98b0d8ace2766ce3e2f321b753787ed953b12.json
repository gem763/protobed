Since their last win England have conceded 11 goals, with nine directly from or the result of poorly defended crosses. It began with the USA\u2019s two headers from Alex Morgan and Christen Press which drove the final nail into their World Cup hopes, and continued in the bronze medal play-off against Sweden.\n\nAll three goals Belgium scored against England in August came from crosses, while Frida Manuum\u2019s header for Norway last month came from a corner. So it was no surprise that both of Brazil\u2019s goals on Saturday followed the same pattern.\n\nThe first of Debinha\u2019s goals highlighted England\u2019s issues defending in the air. As she sprung up in the box to head the incoming cross goal-wards, every England defender looked on stock-still, not a single one coming close to marking her.", "description": "Phil Neville said he wanted to be \u201cjudged like any other manager\u201d after England\u2019s winless streak extended past the 100-day mark, their worst run since former manager Hope Powell was sacked after the 2013 Euros.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212064477-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqiEYSsjLjJhKdsvXqKaSPU9vEHqQvvKt8xFDfqNSLC4g.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
