Two more vice presidents will join the bunch in 2020.\n\nPG&E said the utility has already provided the factors these officials take into account in deciding. In a September 2018 document, the company said it uses national fire danger ratings, National Weather Service warnings, humidity levels, temperature, terrain and local climate to weigh shutoffs. The utility said at the time that it expected to cut service once or twice a year. So far in 2019, it has shut power at least thrice.\n\nPG&E has been taking more extreme measures to keep its lines from sparking blazes since a series of catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018 saddled the company with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and forced it into bankruptcy. Last week\u2019s blackout -- the largest one the utility has ever orchestrated -- has drawn outrage from politicians who said the outage was too extensive and that the company did a poor job of communicating it to customers.\n\n\u201cThere are crucial lessons to learn from this event, and we are committed to learning and doing a better job across the board,\u201d PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said in a letter accompanying the report.\n\nPG&E also said in the filing that the company\u2019s board of directors doesn\u2019t directly influence shutoff decisions. But it noted that a board committee oversees the company\u2019s wildfire safety plan -- which includes shutoffs.\n\n--With assistance from Mark Chediak.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lynn Doan in San Francisco at ldoan6@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Aaron Clark\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Since an unprecedented blackout plunged millions of Californians into darkness last week, residents and state officials have questioned how utility giant PG&E Corp. came to the decision to cut the lights.Now they have some answers.In a report filed with California utility regulators on", "authors": ["Lynn Doan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ICxQYQtPROjWmF0ATGRl.g--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/fb93351c79cf4594cdcd381c847a4e80", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
