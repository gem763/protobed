This list focuses primarily on high-end flagship devices, but the best flagship smartphones don\u2019t have to be the most expensive.\n\nValue plays a huge role in this list, and there\u2019s a couple mid-range device here that are well worth considering for more budget-minded buyers \u2013 one of them is ranked at No. 2!\n\nIn fact, the top three phones in this list aren\u2019t the top flagship models everyone expects from Apple or Samsung.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nIt would be easiest to rank smartphones based purely on specs and the number of features each offers, but that would mean the most expensive smartphones would always rank in the top three \u2013 and they\u2019re not the first phones I\u2019d usually recommend.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for me when ranking and recommending a phone is its value in relation to its specs and features. That typically leads me to recommend phones that may have fewer features or a less sleek design than the ultra-premium models that command four-figure price tags.\n\nIndeed, just because a phone has everything and the kitchen sink doesn\u2019t mean you have to buy it \u2013 it\u2019s just an option for those who might have a larger budget. The same logic applies to pretty much anything you can buy: Do you pick the most expensive model of everything you buy? If you don\u2019t, the top three will suit you well. If you always go with the top-of-the-line, then you probably already know the phone you want.\n\nBut if you haven\u2019t made up your mind, check out our list of the top 20 smartphones you can buy:\n\n20. LG G8\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nUnfortunately for LG, the new LG G8 at its $820 price places it pretty low on this list. It\u2019s comparable to the $750 Galaxy S10e, but without the sleek design and with little to show for the extra $70 you\u2019d spend.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a solid device that checks all the right boxes, but doesn\u2019t excel in any particular thing.\n\nYou can find the LG G8 for $700 at Best Buy and B&H Photo, which is what the LG G8 should have been priced at to begin with. I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying it for its full price tag from carriers, however.\n\nRead the LG G8 review \u00bb\n\nPrice: Above $800 from most carriers.\n\n19. Moto G7\n\nsource Motorola\n\nMotorola\u2019s Moto G series of smartphones has been our favorite mid-range option ever since they were first released back in 2013, and they\u2019ve only been getting better every generation. Last year\u2019s Moto G6 was a fantastic device that made me forget I was using a $250 phone, and not one that cost more $800.\n\nThe new $300 Moto G7 comes with updated specs, design, and even a few rare, out-of-style features that many smartphone users still value.\n\nPrice: Currently $30 off for $270\n\n18. Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are now more than 2 years old, but for $450 and $570, respectively, they\u2019re still worthy of your attention.\n\nApple phones generally offer better apps and a better user experience than their Android counterparts, and the iPhone 7 is no different. The support you get from Apple if something goes wrong is superior to what you get from Android device makers. And unlike on most Android phones, with iPhones you can always get the latest software updates straight from Apple as soon as it releases them.\n\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus offer some compelling features, including water-resistance, great cameras that perform well in low light, and powerful processors. The phones also work well with other Apple products, including the company\u2019s wireless headphones, AirPods.\n\nThe iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 dual-lens camera system takes pictures with a professional-looking \u201cbokeh\u201d effect, which blurs the background behind your subject. Additionally, the system allows you to zoom in on your subjects; its second camera offers a 2x optical zoom.\n\nUnlike the digital zoom feature found in other cameras, an optical zoom allows you to enlarge an image of your subject without sacrificing picture quality.\n\niPhone 7 price: $450\n\niPhone 7 Plus price: $570\n\nCheck out the iPhone 7 review \u00bb\n\n17. LG V40\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe LG V50 was recently announced, but there\u2019s no official release date in the US. If you\u2019re interested in the V40, you might want to wait a little to check out what the V50 has to offer.\n\nThe LG V40 was higher up on the list, but since its high price tag hasn\u2019t changed and there are great phones available for significantly less, it\u2019s dropped a few spots.\n\nThe LG V40 is a great smartphone with all the usual high-end Android phone features, and it comes with a triple-lens rear camera system that offers users the best versatility in taking photos.\n\nYou get a regular wide angle lens, LG\u2019s signature ultra-wide angle lens, and a dedicated optical zoom lens. Meanwhile, phones with dual-lens systems, even LG\u2019s G7, offer you either a zoom lens or an ultra-wide angle lens on top of the regular wide-angle lens that almost all smartphones come with.\n\nThe LG V40 is also a top choice for audio enthusiasts that appreciate good sound, as it comes with a higher-quality amplifier inside that makes music sound better through wired headphones.\n\nPrice: $950\n\nCheck out the LG V40 review \u00bb\n\n16. Razer Phone 2\n\nsource Razer\n\nThe Razer Phone 2 is marketed as a \u201cgaming\u201d phone, mostly because of its unique display. The Phone can refresh its screen 120 times a second; most phones, by comparison, only refresh their screens 60 times a second. The Phone\u2019s faster refresh rate allows it to offer super smooth gameplay.\n\nThe Razer Phone 2\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate doesn\u2019t just make games look good, it affects the entire interface. It works beautifully; everything you do on the phone is ultra smooth in a way never seen before on a smartphone. In fact, Razer may have set the standard for how all phone displays should work \u2013 not just those on gaming devices.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to the phone than just its screen. It\u2019s also got an eye-catching industrial design that stands out when compared with the sleek and svelte designs of most other Android phones. And Razer added wireless charging, water resistance, and even fancy lighting for its logo on the back for its latest model, too.\n\nThe large borders above and below the phone\u2019s screen may look out of step with the borderless designs of other recent phones. But hiding beneath those borders are the loudest and best speakers we\u2019ve heard on any smartphone.\n\nPrice: $500\n\n15. iPhone 8\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 8 comes with the now-antiquated iPhone 6-generation design. But it does have a refined glass-and-metal case, a superb camera, and strong performance. With it, Apple supports both wireless and fast charging \u2013 features that Android phones have long offered but had been missing from previous iPhones.\n\nPrice: $600\n\nCheck out the iPhone 8 review \u00bb\n\n14. Samsung Galaxy S9\n\nsource Samsung\n\nThe Galaxy S9 is a superb smartphone with almost every feature under the sun. It sports the latest specs, best display, one of the best cameras you can get on a smartphone, a gorgeous design, wireless charging, water resistance, and several other features that make the Galaxy S9 a fool-proof buy.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t it get the top spot on the list? Other smartphones, including its bigger sibling the Galaxy S9 Plus, come with dual-camera systems. On top of that, Samsung\u2019s own version of Android isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nPrice: $500 (Unlocked)\n\nCheck out the Galaxy S9 review \u00bb\n\n13. iPhone 8 Plus\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus is well-worth considering if you want the core of the iPhone experience. It might come with an antiquated design, but it comes with the same chip as the iPhone X, and a great dual-lens camera, where one of the lenses is a dedicated optical zoom lens.\n\niPhone 8 Plus Price: $700\n\nCheck out the iPhone 8 review \u00bb\n\n12. iPhone X\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nApple doesn\u2019t sell the iPhone X anymore, but it\u2019s still widely available at carrier stores for $900.\n\nThe iPhone X may run on last year\u2019s A11 chip, but many iPhone X users aren\u2019t noticing much of a difference in performance compared to the iPhone XS with the newer A12 chip. That\u2019s perhaps thanks to iOS 12 and the extra optimization it comes with.\n\nIn some respects, it\u2019s actually a better deal than the new iPhone XS, which costs $100 more for few significant upgrades. But if you\u2019re going to pay $900 for a smartphone, those who can afford to might as well spend the extra $100 to get the newer model.\n\nPrice: $900 at most carriers\n\nCheck out the iPhone X review \u00bb\n\n11. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Galaxy S9 Plus is mainly just a bigger version of the regular Galaxy S9, but it has a dual-lens camera system where the secondary lens serves as a 2x optical zoom lens. The Plus model also comes with more RAM than the regular S9, which helps with overall performance speed.\n\nThe Galaxy S9 Plus is among my top smartphone picks because it\u2019s a clear example that you don\u2019t need to spend $1,000 \u2013 the price of an iPhone XS \u2013 to get a top, premium, full-fat smartphone experience. The Galaxy S9 Plus checks off all the boxes and I\u2019d easily recommend it to anyone looking for a new smartphone.\n\nPrice: $600\n\nCheck out the Galaxy S9 review \u00bb\n\n10. iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max\n\ncaption The iPhone XS (L) and XS Max source Getty\n\nThe $1,000 iPhone XS and $1,100 iPhone XS Max deliver the best of Apple design, performance, and features. They\u2019re technically the best iPhones you can buy, but their position on this list is decided by their high price tags.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing and able to spend a minimum of $1,000 on a smartphone, then go for it. Otherwise, I think four figures for a smartphone is too much, especially when it doesn\u2019t come with things like a fast charger, or even a USB-C adapter dongle for your wired headphones.\n\nBoth phones have exactly the same features. The main difference is the screen and body size, and that\u2019s up to you whether you prefer smaller or larger phones.\n\niPhone XS Price: $1,000\n\niPhone XS Max Price: $1,100\n\n9. Samsung Galaxy Note 9\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe Galaxy Note 9 is among best Android smartphone that Samsung has released. It has a large 6.4 inch display that looks fantastic with Samsung\u2019s technology. And combined with its high-powered specs, it\u2019s a veritable productivity and multitasking machine. I\u2019ve also recently come to appreciate the S Pen stylus for taking notes at the spur of a thought and for keeping me organized, and it gives me more precision for tasks that I\u2019d usually reserve for a computer.\n\nAt $1,000, it\u2019s priced for enthusiasts and power users rather than the casual smartphone user. But if you\u2019re comparing the Galaxy Note 9 to another $1,000 smartphone \u2013 the iPhone XS \u2013 it\u2019s a better phone.\n\nPrice: $800\n\nCheck out the Galaxy Note 9 review \u00bb\n\n8. Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe $800 Pixel 3 and $900 Pixel 3 XL have the best smartphone cameras in the business, hands down.\n\nThey also run Google\u2019s vision of Android, which is clean, well-designed, and receives Android updates the moment Google releases them. That\u2019s something few Android phones can boast.\n\nThe new Pixel 3 phones also come with dual-lens selfie cameras \u2013 one of the lenses takes regular selfies, and the other takes ultra-wide angle selfies. It\u2019s one of the areas where Google\u2019s Pixel 3 phones outdo Apple\u2019s iPhone XS.\n\nThe new Google phones are a little more expensive than I\u2019d like them to be, especially now that new phones from Samsung come with newer specs and cost \u201conly\u201d $100 more while sporting an ultrawide camera lens, as well as significantly better designs.\n\nThe only differences between the two phones is the screen size and front design \u2013 the Pixel 3 has a more traditional smartphone design, while the Pixel 3 XL has a notched design. The Pixel 3 XL\u2019s notch is unfortunately the worst on this list, but as with every other notch, you get used to it and forget about it pretty quickly. It would be a shame if you ruled out the Pixel 3 XL just because of the notch.\n\nPixel 3 Price: $800\n\nPixel 3 XL Price: $900\n\nCheck out the Pixel 3 review \u00bb\n\nCheck out the Pixel 3 XL review \u00bb\n\n7. Galaxy S10\n\nThe Galaxy S10 is an overhaul in design, performance, and features, all while maintaining the Samsung smartphone formula that makes its phones great.\n\nIt\u2019s a fantastic smartphone that comes with more features that those higher up on this list, and I\u2019m especially fond of its ultra-wide camera.\n\nAs good as the Galaxy S10 is, it doesn\u2019t pose the best value compared to the Galaxy S10e and other smartphones that come higher on the list.\n\nGalaxy S10 Price: $900\n\nCheck out the Samsung Galaxy S10 review \u00bb\n\n6. Galaxy S10 Plus\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Galaxy S10 Plus is a larger version of the Galaxy S10, and it all comes down to your preference over bigger or smaller phones.\n\nGalaxy S10 Plus Price: $1,000\n\nCheck out the Samsung Galaxy S10 review \u00bb\n\n5. iPhone XR\n\nThe $750 iPhone XR is more appealing than its more expensive counterparts, the $1,000 iPhone XS and $1,100 iPhone XS Max.\n\nIn almost every respect, you\u2019re getting the same experience as the iPhone XS series, save for slightly larger bezels, and a lower-resolution LCD display compared to a superior OLED display, and a dual-lens camera. But, in my mind, all that extra stuff from the iPhone XS series isn\u2019t worth an extra $250.\n\nAt $750, the iPhone XR is a great value for an iPhone with such a large screen and latest specs. It\u2019s just a shame that there\u2019s no iPhone X-style phone under $700 for those who like smaller displays.\n\nPrice: $750\n\nCheck out 9 reasons to buy the iPhone XR over the iPhone XS or XS Max \u00bb\n\n4. Galaxy S10e\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Galaxy S10e poses the best value in the latest Android or Apple smartphones above the $700 mark, period.\n\nIt runs on the same processor as the Galaxy S10 that starts at $900, has a brilliant screen, a great camera, an ultrawide camera, a fingerprint sensor that works better than the in-display sensor on the Galaxy S10, and it\u2019s $150 cheaper than the Galaxy S10.\n\nAnyone who wants a small-screen Android phone, or simply one of the best values in smartphones, should put the Galaxy S10e high up at the top of their list.\n\nPrice: $750\n\nCheck out why you should buy the Galaxy S10e over the regular Galaxy S10 \u00bb\n\n3. OnePlus 6T\n\nsource Antonio VIllas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nA new OnePlus device is expected to be announced soon. It might be worth waiting a little while to see what OnePlus comes out with before buying the OnePlus 6T.\n\nThe OnePlus 6T doesn\u2019t come with a lot of the features that other phones in this list have, like wireless charging, official water resistance ratings, dedicated zoom or ultra-wide angle lenses, or an ultra-sharp 1440p display. And yet, it earns the top spot on this list.\n\nThat\u2019s because it does the things it does so well, like looking good, taking photos, running Android and apps, charging quickly, and lasting a long time on a single battery charge. And it does all those things for a base price tag of $550 compared to the $750+ price tags of smartphones above.\n\nI never missed any of the extra features from other, more expensive top smartphones while using the OnePlus 6T. If I were to buy a new smartphone, this would be the one for its excellent design, performance, and value.\n\nThe OnePlus 6T is also the first OnePlus phone to be sold by a US carrier \u2013 T-Mobile \u2013 and it\u2019s also the first OnePlus phone to be compatible with Verizon\u2019s network.\n\nPrice: $550\n\nPrice at T-Mobile: $550 for 8 GB RAM 128 GB model\n\nCheck out the OnePlus 6T review \u00bb\n\n2. Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nWhat is a phone with a mid-range processor and an antiquated, bezeled design doing at the No. 2 spot?\n\nIt turns out the Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 spinning the wheels in the Pixel 3a phones is no slouch, and it\u2019s more than enough for the regular smartphone user.\n\nYes, fine, the Pixel 3a doesn\u2019t have the sleekest design out there, but what you get in the Pixel 3a more than makes up for it.\n\nYou get the pure Google Android experience that gets you the latest updates the minute they\u2019re released; you also get the same outrageously good camera from the Google Pixel 3; you get an OLED display, like top flagships have.\n\nAND \u2026\n\nYou get a headphone jack.\n\nFor $400, it\u2019s hard to beat. If everyone made totally smart, reasonable buying decisions when it comes to smartphones, it\u2019s the phone that everyone should buy. But I know we all like to treat ourselves with something a little more premium when it comes to smartphones. Which brings me to our number one choice \u2026\n\nPixel 3a price: $400\n\nPixel 3a XL price: $470\n\nCheck out the Pixel 3a review \u00bb\n\n1. OnePlus 7 Pro\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThere\u2019s simply no doubt about it: If you\u2019re not going to get the Pixel 3a because you want a premium design and specs, the $700 OnePlus 7 Pro is the top phone to get so far.\n\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro gets the basics right: It\u2019s gorgeous, it doesn\u2019t have a notch or a cutout, it barely has any bezels, it has the fastest charger on the planet, it has a triple-lens camera system, it\u2019s absurdly fast, and it runs a clean version of Android.\n\nBut OnePlus went one step further than almost every other phone maker on this list. It has a super-smooth 90Hz display, and Android and apps run like butter on it.\n\nIt does everything I mentioned above for $700 \u2013 that\u2019s $200 less than the Galaxy S10 and $300 cheaper than the iPhone XS. It\u2019s even $50 cheaper than the \u201ccheaper\u201d versions of those premium flagships, the Galaxy S10e and iPhone XR. The OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s value is simply untouchable.\n\nI should note that the OnePlus 7 Pro doesn\u2019t have an official water-resistance rating. To that end, OnePlus is confident that the OnePlus 7 Pro can still hold its own against water, it just didn\u2019t get the official \u201cIP\u201d rating.\n\nAnd if you like wireless charging, the OnePlus 7 Pro might not be the phone for you. But you\u2019d have to ask yourself if wireless charging is worth the extra $50, $200, or $300 you\u2019d be paying for other phones.\n\nPrice: $700\n\nCheck out the OnePlus 7 Pro review \u00bb", "description": "Business Insider - When it comes to smartphones, giant price tags don't always mean you're getting the best phone out there..
