In one fell swoop, the expansion resets player progression, institutes a new seasonal model for live events, and adds a wealth of new content. It\u2019s going to take some time to get a grasp of the scope of things. Online, ever-changing games like this are less like cars and more like big old boats, or what I imagine boats to be like \u2014 too big to notice tiny changes in until you become deeply familiar with the bones of the thing. Massive shifts appear, to the naked eye, to not be happening at all.\n\nRight now, Destiny 2 has some bigger problems: After clogged servers kept players from logging in today, Bungie shut it all down for emergency maintenance. Once you manage to log on to Shadowkeep, there\u2019s plenty new that you\u2019ll notice immediately.\n\nA lot of it, you probably have been expecting, given Bungie\u2019s slow-burn divulging of details over the last few months. But contemplating these changes from afar and having them in your hands are two very different experiences. Consider these off-the-cuff impressions \u2014 I\u2019ve hardly scratched the surface of things and I have a lot of questions, but I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll be playing a lot of Shadowkeep.\n\nRemember when this game was hard?\n\nFor the most part, Destiny is a pretty easy game, even for a solo player. If you didn\u2019t take on its top-tier challenges \u2014 raids, Nightfall strikes, the Reckoning \u2014 it was kind of laughably easy. You had your preferred loadout for rinsing through scrubs, and when the big boys came to say hello, you had an answer ready.\n\nNow that power levels are reset? You\u2019re a scrub. You are washed. At least, on Shadowkeep\u2019s new remixed version of the Moon, you are. You will regularly stumble across areas patrolled by enemies that are roughly 100 power above you, which is the threshold where you flat-out can\u2019t damage them. It\u2019s a bucket of cold water to the face.\n\nIt\u2019s also a way to gate progress, to keep you from delving too deep into the Moon or its mysteries too soon.\n\nHope you love mysteries.\n\nIn its return to the Moon, a locale players haven\u2019t visited since the first Destiny, Shadowkeep repaints it with the layer of opaque mystery that became a trademark of some of the best Destiny destinations, like the Dreadnaught in The Taken King or The Dreaming City in Forsaken. Keep a sharp eye out and you\u2019ll see little figurines that you can\u2019t yet interact with,, bits of bone that unlock lore, or areas that are walled off by a forcefield.\n\nYou\u2019ll also stumble on things you just plain don\u2019t expect, like this ship corridor that looks straight out of an Alien film.\n\nExploring is always the best part of a new Destiny expansion.\n\nI\u2019m worried about the grind.\n\nShadowkeep is revamping the entire in-game economy, re-introducing formerly deprecated materials and making relatively useless currencies relevant again. It\u2019s going to take some time for players to run up against any pain points in the new economic landscape as they loot and upgrade their way across the solar system, but I\u2019m a little worried that things are looking a bit more grindy.\n\nThis will be hard to sort out for sure, as everyone will be levelling over the next few days, churning through whatever gear will raise their power level from 750 to the new soft cap of 900. Part of the reason I feel this way is due to the new armour system. On paper, it is very cool, allowing you to swap out mods that help spec your armour for certain builds. But it also seems like it will get expensive in the long run.\n\nMods cost energy, and each piece of armour has an energy budget from 1 to 10. When you pick up a new piece of armour, it\u2019s assigned a random energy value, which you can then upgrade using Glimmer and Legendary Shards. It\u2019s not much \u2014 upgrading my boots from 2 energy to 3 costs 500 Glimmer and 1 Legendary Shard. But imagine doing that multiple times, for multiple pieces of armour. It\u2019s a whole new, massive resource sink.\n\nIt might be offset by another new thing, though.\n\nSeasonal rewards are extremely compelling.\n\nThis is probably not a surprise, since Destiny 2\u2019s seasonal reward structure echoes Fortnite\u2019s Battle Pass, and the Battle Pass is an incredibly effective way to monetise free games. If you\u2019re not familiar with either, here\u2019s the gist:\n\nFor the current 70-day \u201cseason\u201d of Destiny 2, there are two rewards tracks: one for people who have a season pass, and one for those who do not. Everyone who plays Destiny 2 earns experience, which goes towards your Season Rank. Achieve a new Season Rank, and you\u2019ll get rewards \u2014 everyone on the \u201cfree\u201d track gets the reward, and season pass owners also get a fancy bonus reward.\n\nThe nice thing about it is that the seasonal rewards seem to include a lot of upgrade materials, which might offset the need to constantly farm what you need to keep your gear in tip-top shape. Season pass owners get lots more of this stuff, which might prove that the free tier offerings are negligible. Again, I\u2019m worried about the grind.\n\nAt the very least, Destiny 2 does an excellent job of explaining what\u2019s included in a season for those who have a pass and those who do not. There are no surprises.\n\nEverything\u2019s different now.\n\nShadowkeep\u2019s changes and tweaks are pervasive, and this makes it hard to catalogue and evaluate them. Gun performance is different across the board, the difference between base and critical damage is different, the Crucible has been reworked, and there\u2019s a new schedule of live events that might change how the rest of the game\u2019s older destinations might play out.\n\nI\u2019m still too early in the story to really say much about it other than this: It is about as amusingly portentous as anything involving Eris Morn, the game\u2019s most goth character. It also almost immediately sends you on one of Destiny\u2019s favourite kinds of time-killing quests: \u201cGo charge this artefact by doing busywork.\u201d\n\nSaid busywork is more interesting than it previously was. Instead of boring patrol beacons that trigger repeatable vanilla missions, the Moon is full of these haunted blood-ghosts that ask you to kill their nightmare, which is pretty damn metal.\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably put together by now: Moon\u2019s haunted. I\u2019m into it though, and can\u2019t wait to dive into more. As soon as these servers come back online.", "description": "Destiny 2: Shadowkeep is a lot to take in.
