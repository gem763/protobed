Macy were bookended by their grinning blonde daughters, Sophia and Georgia.\n\nSeven years later, Huffman\u2019s star came crashing down when she was caught trying to cheat Sophia\u2019s way into college as part of the nation\u2019s largest-ever higher education bribery scheme, dubbed \u201cOperation Varsity Blues\u201d by the FBI. The resulting scandal froze Huffman\u2019s award-winning career and left her relationship with her teenage daughters in tatters.\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge sentenced Huffman to 14 days in prison after she pleaded guilty in May to a charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\n\u201cTrying to be a good mother doesn\u2019t excuse this,\u201d Judge Indira Talwani said before handing down the sentence, which included a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service, and supervised release for one year. Huffman was ordered to report to prison within six weeks.\n\n\u201cI can only say that I am so sorry, Sophia,\u201d Huffman, 56 said minutes earlier, her voice cracking through tears. \u201cI was frightened. I was stupid and I was so wrong.\u201d\n\nAfter the judge left, Macy got up from a front row seat in a dark gray suit and rubbed Huffman\u2019s shoulders and kissed the top of her head as she continued to cry. She must report to prison within six weeks.\n\nHuffman admitted to paying a Harvard graduate $15,000 to correct Sophia\u2019s answers on the SAT, securing her a 400-point boost on the college-entrance exam. Prosecutors had asked that Huffman serve one month in prison, plus fines and community service.\n\nTalwani said the sentence was based on the fact that the testing services involved in the SAT score-rigging suffered no \u201cmeasurable loss\u201d or \u201cpecuniary harm,\u201d Huffman had no previous criminal history, and that she accepted responsibility and admitted guilt.\n\n\u201cThis is a starting point for me, but it\u2019s a starting point I\u2019m expected to get correct,\u201d Talwani said.\n\nProminent college coaches, business executives, and Hollywood stars such as Huffman and Full House actress Lori Loughlin were arrested in March over their alleged plans to pay their children\u2019s way into schools like Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California. FBI agents surrounded Huffman\u2019s Los Angeles home, with guns drawn, and arrested the star in the nationwide bust that snared more than 50 people.\n\nHuffman is the first of 34 parents to be sentenced in the scheme. The dozens of parents charged in the case paid up to $500,000 to get their children into elite schools, according to authorities, in some cases by labeling them as recruited athletes for sports they had never even played. Fifteen parents have pleaded guilty, and another 19 are fighting the charges, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHuffman, the most famous person charged, is best-known for her role on ABC\u2019s Desperate Housewives, for which she won an Emmy Award in 2005. The following year, Huffman was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for her role in the film Transamerica. She appeared in two Netflix specials this year, including Ava DuVernay\u2019s critically praised series about the 1989 Central Park jogger case, When They See Us.\n\n\u201c Why didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own? \u201d \u2014 Sophia Macy\n\nThe illicit payment, which Huffman admitted she also considered for her younger daughter Georgia, was at the time described as a charitable contribution to Rick Singer, now known as the ringleader of the sprawling college admissions scheme. Singer, a private college-admissions consultant, convinced many parents to take advantage of what he called a \u201cside door\u201d into elite colleges, by paying for rigged SAT scores or donating to the schools themselves. He has pleaded guilty to racketeering, fraud, money laundering, and obstruction.\n\nLast week, Huffman wrote in a letter to the court that she initially hired Singer, and that when Sophia\u2019s math scores on the practice SATs were concerningly low, he suggested hiring a proctor to alter her SAT results. Huffman said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the proposed scheme. But after six weeks of contemplating it, Huffman said she \u201chonestly began to feel that maybe I would be a bad mother if I didn\u2019t do what Mr. Singer was suggesting.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Eric Rosen, the top federal prosecutor on the case, responded in court Friday unsparingly.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the defendant, welcome to parenthood. There\u2019s no instruction manual,\u201d he said.\n\nMark Riddell, the 36-year-old Harvard graduate who corrected the SAT for Sophia and dozens of other students, has pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nHuffman\u2019s relationship with her teenage daughters \u201cexploded\u201d after her arrest, Macy wrote in a letter to the court last week.\n\nSophia, 19, who was allegedly unaware of the scheme to rig her SAT scores, still \u201chas nightmares from the FBI agents waking her that morning with guns drawn,\u201d wrote Macy, and Sophia\u2019s unnamed dream college rescinded its invitation to audition for its theater program, after she had already flown out for the meeting.\n\n\u201cShe called us from the airport in hysterics, begging us to, \u2018Do something, please, do something,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn May, after Sophia\u2019s dreams were dashed, Macy was photographed solemnly carrying balloons that read \u201cYou did it!\u201d and \u201cCongratulations, Grad!\u201d to celebrate her graduation from high school.\n\nThe actress\u2019s own letter to the judge asking for leniency described a scene in their home, when Sophia looked at her, tears streaming down her face, and begged: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no adequate answer for her,\u201d Huffman wrote. \u201cIn my blind panic, I have done the exact thing that I was desperate to avoid. I have compromised my daughter\u2019s future, the wholeness of my family, and my own integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI unequivocally take complete responsibility for my actions and will respectfully accept whatever punishment the court deems appropriate,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Macy wrote that job offers and auditions have stopped rolling in for his wife, who until recently was \u201cone of the hardest working actors in the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cFelicity\u2019s only interest now is figuring out how to make amends and help her daughters heal and move on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe hurt her daughters,\u201d Macy wrote of his wife. \u201cIt was the one thing she swore never to do, and she did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has kept all of us talking and when one of her daughters needs to scream at her, she takes it in and makes no excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cShe only loves them back.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s letter said that Sophia will take a gap year before giving college \u201canother shot.\u201d Meanwhile, he said, 17-year-old Georgia is still in high school and busy with \u201cattendant proms, boys, and college applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot,\u201d Huffman wrote.\n\n\u201cI see the irony in that statement now.\u201d", "description": "The most famous person stung by \u2018Operation Varsity Blues\u2019 paid $15,000 to inflate her daughter\u2019s SAT score.
