(Ukrainian Presidential Press Service /AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) put out a statement today commensurate with the seriousness of the whistleblower standoff, which reads in part:\n\nThe Administration\u2019s blocking of Acting DNI Joseph Maguire from providing Congress with the whistleblower complaint violates the federal statute, which unequivocally states that the DNI \u2018shall\u2019 provide Congress this information. If the President has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his Administration and our democracy. The President and Acting DNI\u2019s stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust.\n\nShe and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be crystal clear. If the president extorted a foreign government to find dirt on a political opponent, the president must be impeached. Let the Republicans explain why the president\u2019s conduct is acceptable. And because the president seems to be perfectly fine with whatever he said, the Senate trial can be expedited with a factual stipulation.\n\nThis came before a Wall Street Journal report that in a single July conversation President Trump urged the Ukrainian leader to find dirt on his opponent Joe Biden. There doesn\u2019t need to be a quid pro quo. This is \u201ccollusion\u201d writ large.\n\nWe should not forget the whistleblower, the intelligence community inspector general and the acting director of national intelligence. According to multiple whistleblower lawyers with whom I have consulted over the past two hours, any or all of them could go to the so-called intelligence Gang of Eight to transmit the information in a secure setting, thereby avoiding criminal liability. To refuse to do so because you might lose your job in the Trump administration strikes me as madness, a symptom of the Beltway fixation with keeping your post in government, no matter what, as if there are no higher obligations nor other jobs. If this is as urgent as the IG and whistleblower claim and does involve Trump\u2019s attempt to insert a foreign power into our election (again) they must step forward \u2014 as must other members of the administration or former officials with relevant knowledge.\n\nLawfare\u2019s Ben Wittes explains, \u201cIf it is true that the president used the threat of withholding congressionally authorized funds to \u2014 in the Post\u2019s words \u2014 \u2018extort\u2019 a foreign leader into investigating a domestic political opponent and his family, that would be a very big deal indeed. That allegation, if true, would unambiguously constitute an impeachable offense. . . . first, because it would involve the extortion of a foreign leader for personal and political gain; second, because it would involve the solicitation of a foreign government\u2019s involvement in a U.S. election; and third, because it would involve the solicitation of a foreign government\u2019s investigation of a political opponent in a fashion that grossly violates the civil liberties of a U.S. person, namely Biden\u2019s son.\u201d\n\nRepublicans \u2014 any member of Congress and any Cabinet member \u2014 must be asked in any media or congressional appearance whether the \u201cthreat of withholding congressionally authorized funds to \u2014 in the Post\u2019s words \u2014 \u2018extort\u2019 a foreign leader into investigating a domestic political opponent and his family\u201d is impeachable. No hedging, no filibustering. The American people have a right to know if Republicans actually think this is acceptable. They should also be asked if the president has the power to prevent a whistleblower\u2019s complaint from reaching Congress in contravention of the whistleblower statute. Until a firm answer to those two questions is obtained, the questioner should keep at it for as long as it takes to get an answer.\n\nAs for the Democrats, the reaction to suppression of a whistleblower and the potential the president engaged in impeachable, if not illegal, conduct has been spotty. On one hand, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) knocked it out of the park:\n\nAs a 2016 candidate, Donald Trump openly encouraged a foreign adversary to hack a political opponent and attack our elections.\n\n\n\nAs President, it seems he's doing it again in broad daylight and it is completely unacceptable.\n\n\n\nWe have to get this guy out of the White House. https://t.co/sC1Rnev67k \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 20, 2019\n\nIn an appearance, she had more to say, explaining the gravity of the situation:\n\n.@KamalaHarris: \"[Whistleblower] may feel a sense of concern that they're going to be attacked by this president, but the American people will stand with you...This is about a solemn duty that this person...to do everything we can to reinforce the integrity of our democracy.\" https://t.co/830GeWIJEH pic.twitter.com/JBf42bD9Ym \u2014 Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) September 20, 2019\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke put out a brief but effective statement. \u201cIn 2016, President Trump asked Russia to interfere in our elections,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn 2020, he\u2019s asking Ukraine to do the same. If no one is above the law, then we have no choice but to impeach this president. When will Congress have the courage to act?\u201d Good question.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also addressed the issue in a TV interview, correctly noting that this president has a pattern of misusing his office for personal, political gain.\n\nOthers seemed to go merrily on their way, sticking to campaign stump speeches or talking about other issues as if the whistleblower incident does not pose a grave threat to our democracy. Their obliviousness or feigned obliviousness suggests they really aren\u2019t up for the job they are running for. A candidate who avoids a national security and constitutional crisis because he\u2019d rather talk about domestic matters is not the person you want as commander in chief.\n\nThis is a stress test for Schiff and Pelosi, for Republicans in Congress and in the administration (would they rationalize even extorting a foreign power to get dirt on an enemy?), the presidential contenders and the press.\n\nIf Trump cannot be investigated for this and held accountable for his actions (even if no quid pro quo was involved), we really have given up on our constitutional system.
