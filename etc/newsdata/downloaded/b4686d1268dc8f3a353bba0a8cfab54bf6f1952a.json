He is expected to appear before a judge on Oct. 11.\n\nMcGregor was caught on tape punching a man in his 50s in the face at the Marble Arch pub on April 6. The incident allegedly started because the man would not try McGregor's whiskey, after which point the fighter heatedly exchange words with him and punched him in the face.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nReports from the Irish Mirror indicate that at least one patron taunted him earlier in the night because of his UFC lightweight title loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018, which likely riled him up.\n\nMcGregor has since apologized for the incident, when he sat down for an interview with ESPN's Ariel Helwani. He said that he had reached out and made amends with the man, although that hasn\u2019t stopped charges from being filed.\n\n\u201cI was in the wrong. I have to realize that\u2019s not the attitude or behavior of a leader, of a martial artist or a champion,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI must get my head screwed on, get back in the game and fight for redemption, retribution, respect, the things that made me the man I am. That\u2019s what I will do.\u201d\n\nWill McGregor fight again in UFC?\n\nMcGregor hasn\u2019t fought in UFC since that fateful loss to Nurmagomedov, and he tweeted in March that he was retiring from mixed martial arts. However, that sounds a lot like Antonio Brown\u2019s \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me, I quit!\u201d line.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 31-year-old did tell Helwani that he would likely never fully retire from competition, and he still is considered one of the better fighters. UFC\u2019s official website still ranks him as the No. 3 lightweight and No. 12 overall fighter pound-for-pound.\n\nA bigger question is whether UFC and Dana White will want him back. In addition to these charges, McGregor is still under investigation for sexual assault. White did not indicate that he was likely to punish McGregor if he did return, but that was also before charges were filed.\n\n\u201cWhen you deal with fighters, guys who fight for a living, there\u2019s always something,\u201d White said, via MMAFighting.com. \u201cIf you look at some of the greatest [fighters], [Mike] Tyson, what Tyson went through at his peak. Every time you take a guy who is a professional fighter and you sprinkle a ton of money on top of it, get ready.\n\n\u201cGet ready for a disaster. Literally a disaster.\u201d\n\nFormer UFC champion Conor McGregor has been charged with assault stemming from a bar fight in Dublin in April.
