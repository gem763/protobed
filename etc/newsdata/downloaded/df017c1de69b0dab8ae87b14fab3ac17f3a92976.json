However, the intelligence community inspector general disagreed with that assessment, calling the complaint a \u201cserious or flagrant problem [or] abuse\u201d amounting to a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d in an August letter to Maguire.\n\n\u201cI believe that it might be,\u201d Maguire responded when asked whether this is the first whistleblower complaint ever withheld from Congress, albeit temporarily.\n\n\u201cI wish I had the confidence of knowing that but for this hearing \u2026 that we would have been provided that complaint, but I don\u2019t know that we would have ever seen that complaint,\u201d Schiff responded.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified to Congress Thursday that the whistleblower complaint against President Trump is \"unprecedented\" and \"unique\" in that it deals with presidential transcripts, which may be protected by executive privilege.Maguire delayed", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_45fpCbWPdCgFxWJKzzrOg--~B/aD01OTg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/c00d7e5e2d85f1b4d4f201b551e7945b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
