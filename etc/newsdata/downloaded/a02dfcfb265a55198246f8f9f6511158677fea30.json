The group\u2019s name is a publicity maneuver in itself; the group was formerly known as Identity Evropa, but rebranded earlier this year after leftist media collective Unicorn Riot published the group\u2019s racist chat logs.\n\nThe newest set of leaked messages, also published by Unicorn Riot, finds AmIM members contemplating everything from name changes to career changes, without considering the change that might solve their problems for good: not being racist.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about if I had to change my name, what I would change it to, and how I would sign my new name,\u201d one AmIM member wrote in the group\u2019s specialized chat channel for members whose identities had been revealed. He opted against the name change after trying to practice his new signature.\n\nAmIM members called the chat group \u201cdox support,\u201d a reference to \u201cdoxxing,\u201d the act of revealing someone\u2019s personal information online. The tactic is popular with anti-fascists. Since their identities were revealed earlier this year, multiple AmIM members have been fired from jobs including school police officers and teachers. In March and April, the Huffington Post identified 11 service members who belonged to the group, some of whom were subsequently dismissed.\n\nActive from April until at least mid-May 2019, the channel discussed damage-control strategies for members whose identities had been revealed after their previous messages leaked. (The first set of leaks came from the group\u2019s discussion channel on the chat app Discord, which banned many members after their messages became public. The group then moved onto the coworking platform Slack, which also banned them. The current leaks come from AmIM\u2019s discussions on the chat program \u201cMatterMost.\u201d)\n\n\u201c Anyone think that learning a trade would be a good route after being doxxed? \u201d \u2014 American Identity Movement member\n\nMany of the group\u2019s posts centered on finding a job once their name was connected to AmIM. A college student who\u2019d been identified as an AmIM member said he had a job lead, but was worried about accepting it before going through a legal name change process to hide his affiliations.\n\n\u201cOkay so I got a response about an internship with a guy I know personally from networking events. Great stuff. Here is the thing. Its before the name change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat would a good excuse be for getting in front of this name change thing? If you recommend that. Given that my doxx is the first thing that comes up with my real name. I was thinking I say its a \u2018family issue\u2019 maybe something to do with religion. Like switching from Protestant to Catholic and my super Scandinavian Protestant family flipping out.\u201d\n\nThe tactic might not separate him from his Google search results, another member cautioned.\n\n\u201cYa, I\u2019m not so sure changing your name will bring you the peace of mind you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a member or former member whose undertaken a name change, and Antifa [anti-fascists] not finding it.\u201d\n\nAt least one member said he\u2019d deleted his social media and started using another name informally. Nevertheless, anti-fascists soon found his new persona, he said.\n\nAnother member suggested using tricks to manipulate search engine results, like writing blog-positive posts that featured their name prominently. The person added that he worked in the human resources field and that there was nothing illegal about applying to jobs under another name.\n\n\u201cEveryone here presumably is just trying to avoid a few blog posts being brought up in the hiring process,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re lying about who you are.\u201d\n\nBut at least one member, who Unicorn Riot reported had lost his teaching job after being revealed as an AmIM member, asked whether any other professions might be less likely to fire him.\n\n\u201cAnyone think that learning a trade would be a good route after being doxxed?\u201d he asked.\n\nMembership in AmIM could be a bad look on a job application. The group\u2019s founder, Nathan Damigo, once robbed an Arab cab driver at gunpoint and blamed the man for \u201clooking Iraqi.\u201d Damigo was later convicted for his participation in 2017\u2019s deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The group\u2019s next leader, Elliot Kline, publicly bragged about killing Muslims as a soldier before the New York Times revealed that he had fabricated his military record. The group\u2019s current leader, Patrick Casey, has attempted to give the group a more media-friendly image, although its supporters have since been convicted of crimes like vandalizing a synagogue and hijacking an Amtrak locomotive \u201cto save the train from black people.\u201d\n\nIn the leaked chats, members referenced the group\u2019s attempt to distance itself from better-known racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\u201cPeople have such a hard time reconciling you with the archetype of the \u2018racist,\u2019\u201d one member advised another. \u201cThey think of a racist as someone who wears hoods, arm bands or lives in a trailer park.\u201d\n\nPart of AmIM\u2019s publicity strategy is a policy against overtly racist comments in the chat, which could be used to tar the group\u2019s reputation. Nevertheless, the group\u2019s white nationalist stances frequently color their comments. One member, who bemoaned that anti-fascists were coming after people \u201cthat have done nothing wrong\u201d affectionately called other members of the group \u201cgoys\u201d (slang for a non-Jewish person).\n\nAnother member suggested that there was no reason to fear identification because \u201cwe are right, they are wrong. Next time you see some leftist degeneracy go up and tell them that you think they are disgusting.\u201d He added that he had recently confronted his sister\u2019s transgender colleague in public, and referenced the transgender man in the chat as \u201cit\u201d and another slur. \u201cMy sister was a little upset with me but it was worth it,\u201d he added.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s family was so forgiving after AmIM members had their identities revealed. One repeatedly sought advice on how to handle a cousin who was dating a black woman.\n\n\u201cAt a family crawfish boil right now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey've all seen my dox but no one has said anything about it yet. My uncle, who's son is dating a black girl, hasnt made eye contact and he turns his back to me every time we're in the same room. Kinda wish they would just ask me about it so I could explain. No one really wants to talk to me at all. This kinda sucks guys.\u201d\n\nRather than apologize, he said he\u2019d try to point out the family\u2019s hypocrisy, since some had allegedly used racist slurs while drunk.\n\nSympathy for the doxxed only went so far in the chat. The group discussed pressing lawsuits against a popular anti-fascist Twitter account-holder, whom the far right had also attempted to identify. One member also solicited advice on taking legal action against Unicorn Riot, the outlet that has repeatedly leaked AmIM messages.\n\nBy May 2019, AmIM leadership was worried about the Dox Support channel resulting in more doxxes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the amount of personal info in here,\u201d Casey wrote, suggesting they should purge the month of messages \u201cIs anyone else?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it is a relatively secure channel yeah?\u201d another member asked.\n\nIt was not.", "description": "American Identity Movement followers panicked about being outed, going so far as to ask about legal-name changes in leaked chat messages.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569962871/_191001-Weill-nationalist-support-group-tease.gif_a_opmo5h"}
