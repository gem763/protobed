China announced on August 23 that it would be imposing new tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, including chips. It didn\u2019t help when Trump responded by stating that U.S. companies should find manufacturing options other than China on the same day, with the escalation sending the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF down 4%.\n\nDespite the fact that China and the U.S. have agreed to a meeting set to take place at the beginning of October, trade war fears still weigh heavily on investors\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201c[The] base case for the trade war now is no deal before the 2020 US election,\u201d Citigroup said in a research note to clients.\n\nHowever, the industry received good news just a few days before on August 19 after the U.S. gave Chinese tech giant Huawei a \u201ctemporary general license\u201d extension. This means that Huawei is able to buy from American suppliers for an additional 90 days.\n\nBearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks Stock Screener to take a closer look at a few semiconductor stocks to see if analysts think they can survive a market weight down by flaring trade war tensions. This tool let us filter stocks by Market Cap, Sector and even the Analyst Consensus.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)\n\nSince the August 23 escalation, shares of AMD are up 3%.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern regarding the $39 million loss in revenue associated with the blacklisting of Huawei, the company is still a force within the semiconductor space.\n\nEven with its relatively small $33 billion market cap compared to that of its competitors, namely Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), which have market caps of $226 billion and $109 billion, respectively, AMD\u2019s products speak for themselves. This is evidenced by AMD\u2019s Q2 GPU shipments growth rate of around 10% versus NVIDIA\u2019s GPU shipments remaining flat.\n\nIts commitment to constantly improving its product offerings is expected to pay off in the long-run. Its new 7-nanometer Ryzen CPUs are expected to outperform and require less power than equivalent products from its competitors. Its new EPYC Rome server processor, which should be launched during the third quarter, has already garnered significant industry approval. Several partners are now using the platform according to CEO Lisa Su.\n\nAMD\u2019s foray into the gaming world could also drive substantial revenue growth. With new consoles slated for a 2020 release, the company is expecting to see an increase in demand for semi-custom chips.\n\nWhile some believe that these positive developments have already been factored into the share price, one five-star analyst highlights its superior PC GPU revenue growth compared to that of NVDA\u2019s as making it especially strong. As a result, Nomura\u2019s David Wong reiterated his Buy rating and $37 price target on August 23. He thinks shares could surge 21% over the next twelve months.\n\nIn general, the Street is optimistic about AMD. Its \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019 analyst and $34 average price target suggest 11% upside potential.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Amid the ongoing trade war with China, a somber picture is being painted of the semiconductor industry.
