They show Google placing its chips across the board, hoping for more hits to pair with its popular Home smart speakers.\n\nThe narrative, as offered onstage by Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh : \u201cThe devices aren\u2019t the center of the system\u2014you are.\u201d\n\nThough Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., GOOG 1.71% is a dominant force in online search and advertising, it occupies a much weaker position in hardware among its tech peers. Because of this position, Google is willing to spend big on building the business in addition to other nascent ventures. In the smartphone market, Google trails Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., both of which have dominated shipments in the U.S. and world-wide in recent years. Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc. have also ramped up spending in recent years on new consumer products. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has said disappointing sales of last year\u2019s Pixel phone helped drag overall company results. The Pixel line has 5% market share in the U.S., according to researcher Strategy Analytics, and an even smaller share abroad. The previous Pixel model earned strong reviews, if not sales, for its camera and streamlined design. This year\u2019s Pixel 4 model adds the usual photography enhancements, particularly for lowlight snapshots, and includes a bit of the company\u2019s typical whimsy. One new color is called \u201cOh So Orange.\u201d The phone starts at $799, the same as last year, and goes on sale this month. On stage, Google executives talked up technology called \u201cSoli,\u201d a motion-sensing radar addition to the front of the Pixel phone. A promotional video showed a customer silencing a call by waving her hand at the screen. A new generation of wireless earbuds next year, called the Google Pixel Buds, will be able to pair with a device as distant as the far end of a football field. While competitors have some similar features, Google pitches its ability to link devices and functionality across products including Nest, a maker of internet-connected home electronics that the company bought for $3.2 billion in 2014. The popular Google Home Mini was renamed Tuesday the Nest Mini. Such acquisitions may receive additional scrutiny in the wake of recently announced federal and state antitrust investigations into Google\u2019s business. Google overhauled its Washington lobbying operation earlier this year and has pushed the message that its products increase consumer choice. In a July securities filing, Alphabet said it continues to engage with regulators world-wide regarding competition matters.
