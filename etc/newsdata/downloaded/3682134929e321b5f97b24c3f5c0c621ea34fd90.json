Followed by the conversation, I quickly headed to the 1D chart of IndusInd Bank to check out the Price Action. This is what I found\u2026\n\nIndusInd Bank Price Action Analysis on 1D Chart\n\nIndusInd Bank Price Action Trading - Multiple Rejection Setup\n\nFrom the beginning of October, Indus Ind Bank share prices have seen a sharp increase in the Trading Volume. It means more than usual trading activity is going on in the stock. Based on my observation, when a Stock experiences a Peak Volume like this, either it signifies a reversal or indicates the activity of Big Players.\n\nAs most of you already know, I always give more emphasis to Volume, But this time my focus also went to a trading formation that\u2019s happening in Indus Ind Bank 1D chart.\n\nMultiple Rejection or simply known as MR is one of the Price Action Patterns that\u2019s widely recognized in many time frames and across all market segments such as Stocks, Futures, Commodities, Currencies, etc..\n\nMultiple Rejections are similar to False Breakouts as it often indicates Smart Money Traders buying or selling the stock at a better price by trapping uninformed traders. This pattern often occurs around Volatile Market conditions. It\u2019s possible to trade this setup just like False Breakout. One can utilize it for a long trade based on Good Risk \u2013 Reward in Indus Ind Bank.\n\nBut just like any Price Action Trading Setups, even this one has two outcomes \u2013 Either it could succeed or fail. If you look at the Price Action Contextually (Take a look at the chart), Buyers are finding it very hard to push the prices higher. So if you\u2019re trading this setup it\u2019s better to take properly calculated risk.\n\nI am pointing this out so that you\u2019ll keep in mind an important fact \u2013 \u201cTrading is all about probabilities\u201d.\n\nNo matter how appealing a particular trading setup is, there\u2019s always a chance that it could fail. To be a successful trader, you don\u2019t have to be right in your predictions. Your job is to find High probability trading opportunities with less risk and better reward.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Trading Coach covering: IndusInd Bank Ltd..
