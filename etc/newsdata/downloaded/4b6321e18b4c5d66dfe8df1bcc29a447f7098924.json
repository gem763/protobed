Petersen and another person, Lynwood Jennet, are accused of committing fraudulent schemes and artifices for organizing travel for women from the Marshall Islands, a country of volcanic islands between Hawaii and the Philippines, to give up their children for adoption in Arizona.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPetersen and Jennet claimed the pregnant women were Arizona residents so they could receive medical services from Arizona\u2019s Medicaid system, according to the indictment.\n\nJennet worked for the law office of Paul D. Petersen, according to Phoenix\u2019s KPHO-TV.\n\nIn Utah, the attorney general alleges Petersen transported more than 40 women from the Marshall Islands to have their children in the state. They were paid to give up their children for adoption, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n\nPetersen is charged with communications fraud, human smuggling and sale of a child in Utah.\n\nPetersen\u2019s failure to tell his clients seeking to adopt about his scheme led to his communications fraud charge, according to the Tribune.\n\nAD\n\nSean Reyes, Utah\u2019s attorney general, told the Tribune Petersen\u2019s alleged schemes exploited the birth mothers and families from the Marshall Islands and the adoptive parents in Utah.\n\nAD\n\nThe tiny string of islands had the highest per capita adoption rate in the world in 1999, the Honolulu Civil Beat reported last year.\n\nThe United States and the Marshall Islands entered an agreement known as the Compact of Free Association, which had a subsection that prohibited Marshall Islands citizens from traveling to the United States solely for adoption purposes. It was amended in 2003.\n\nNews conferences in Arizona and Utah are scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nPetersen was first elected to the Maricopa County Assessor\u2019s Office in 2014 and was reelected in 2016. He was the assessor\u2019s representative at the Arizona Legislature and the public information officer before taking on his role, according to his website.\n\nAD\n\nMaricopa County is the nation\u2019s fourth most populous county. Its 4.4 million residents make up more than half of Arizona\u2019s population.\n\nAD\n\nThe father of four has been working with families seeking to adopt for almost 15 years. The fifth-generation Arizonan is also an active member of the Maricopa County Republican Party and the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "An Arizona adoption lawyer and county assessor was arrested Tuesday night on charges of fraud and conspiracy related to illegal adoptions, authorities say.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5UqLt-rvv_Ix0vhSFx4v8t1bXWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GZX5U7IY3ZE4PHIJOYIMPC4XSA.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
