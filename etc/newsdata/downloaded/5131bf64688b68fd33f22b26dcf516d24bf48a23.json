Or if you accidentally flip the switch off out of habit.\n\nThat's because if they turn off the switch, power is cut from the bulb and its smart features are rendered useless. That, however, is where the new Lutron Aurora comes into play \u2014 it's a smart light switch and dimmer that helps prevent the light bulb from getting turned off in the first place, and can be controlled manually, by voice, or through the Philips Hue app.\n\nThe switch comes in at $39.95, and is installed over the top of most toggle switches. Here's our full review of how it works and why it's an important part of the Philips Hue ecosystem.\n\nRead more: The Philips Hue smart light bulbs are one of the best ways to upgrade your home \u2014 here's what they're like to use\n\nDesign\n\nPerhaps one of the first reasons you might be interested in the Lutron Aurora is the fact that it looks so sleek and stylish.\n\nThe Aurora is essentially a round button 1.5 inches in diameter that protrudes around 0.7 inches from the wall. It's a white plastic \u2014 which is exactly what makes it blend in so well with any home's vibe or surroundings \u2014 and has a ring around the circumference for dimming. Once installed, we found that it was hard to tell it wasn't the original switch, so if you're looking for something that looks natural and unobtrusive, this may be the way to go.\n\nThe switch actually comes in two parts \u2014 a base that you'll install against the wall right over your existing switch, and a button that locks onto the base and can be used to dim the lights.\n\nThe design of the Lutron Aurora really is that simple. It's elegant and will look right at home on any wall.\n\nSpecs\n\n1.54 inches x 0.75 inches\n\nWorks with Philips Hue smart lights\n\nWhite\n\nDimmable\n\nSet-up process\n\nThe Lutron Aurora looks very simple \u2014 and thankfully, it's easy to install too.\n\nTo install the device, you'll flip on your light switch and slot the base over the existing switch. Then use a small Phillips head screwdriver to tighten the base securely against the original switch. Finally, press the main button into the base so it clicks in place, and you're done \u2014 the switch has been physically set up.\n\nAfter the hardware is ready, there's also the software side of things that you'll want to consider. The Philips Hue app is pretty intuitive to use, and it's easy to set up the switch to work with your other Philips Hue products.\n\nTo do so, open up Settings in the app and then tap the \"Accessory Setup\" button. The switch should show up quickly, after which you can rename it and assign it to a room. Here, you'll be able to indicate which light bulbs to turn on or off when the button is pressed.\n\nWhat makes it stand out\n\nThe Lutron Aurora is simple and easy to use, and can look natural in a wide variety of homes.\n\nBecause it's so simple and basic, anyone should be able to figure out how it works. That's good news considering the fact that you're likely buying a switch in the first place for those that might prefer basic, manual control over lights.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Lutron Aurora was responsive and quick to act which is what you'd want from your lights. My lights turned on within milliseconds of the button being pressed.\n\nRead more: The best smart outlets you can buy\n\nCons to consider\n\nThe Lutron Aurora is one of the best smart switches to buy if you have Philips Hue devices in your home. That said, it isn't perfect \u2014 although it is pretty close.\n\nFor starters, there were times where we pressed the switch and nothing happened. These occasions were rare, but they did happen. It wasn't a huge deal, and pressing it a second time generally resulted in the lights promptly turning on.\n\nAnother small issue is that the switch can feel a little flimsy at times. It's made from plastic so it's hard to expect something that feels ultra strong, but it's still perfectly functional and you'll get used to the feel once you've been using it for a while.\n\nThe only other issue is that the switch is a little pricey if you need more than one. At $40, it can get expensive to replace all the switches in your home, so you might want to buy them for certain rooms in your space like the kitchen or living room.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Lutron Aurora is simple but well-designed, and solves a big complaint of many Philips Hue users \u2014 myself included. Seriously, this is the Philips Hue switch many users have been waiting for.\n\nBut is there a better option? Well, not really.\n\nYou could go for the $40 Philips Hue dimmer switch instead, but it uses a remote control that has four buttons and the system has a variety of extra features and timers, so it's a little more complicated for people who might want something simple and basic.\n\nIf you have the money and want something functional yet sleek, I'd recommend the Lutron Aurora for your Philips Hue set up.\n\nPros: Simple but well-designed, functional, easy to install and use, looks nice in a variety of settings\n\nCons: A little flimsy, can be pricey if you need more than one", "description": "The Lutron Aurora offers even more control over your Philips Hue smart bulbs.
