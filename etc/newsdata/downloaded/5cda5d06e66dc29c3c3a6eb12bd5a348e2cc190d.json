The success of the outcome there is not yet fully determined.\u201d\n\nTurkey launched an assault against the Kurdish YPG militia after President Donald Trump told his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a telephone call that he would pull out US troops who had served as a buffer between the two sides.\n\nUnder heavy criticism, Trump slapped sanctions on Turkey and sent Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence to Ankara, where they reached a deal Thursday under which the YPG would pull out of a \u201csafe zone\u201d within five days.\n\n\u201cWe think now we are in a better place\u201d than before the accord, Pompeo said.\n\nQuoting Trump, Pompeo said that the United States needed to demonstrate \u201csome tough love\u201d to NATO ally Turkey.\n\nTurkey has warned that it would resume its offensive if the Kurds do not withdraw within the deadline.\n\nTurkey links the YPG to banned separatists at home, but the Kurdish fighters enjoy wide support in Washington for bearing the brunt of the battle to crush the extremist Islamic State movement.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday it was too early to know if an accord to end Turkey\u2019s assault in Syria would", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/2e8db7_us-secretary-state-mike-pompeo-addresses-heritage-foundation-pompeo-too-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
