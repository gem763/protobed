I knew that would buy me a one-way ticket to hell.'\n\nMeanwhile, Marcinkus prepared a dose of cyanide for the Pope.\n\n'He measured it in the dropper, put the dropper in the Pope\u2019s mouth and squeezed. When it was done, he closed the door behind him and walked away,' Raimondi said.\n\nCardinal Paul Marcinkus (pictured) was involved in the Vatican bank and allegedly drugged the pope with Valium before killing John Paul\n\nShortly after, a papal assistant reportedly checked on the Pope and screamed that 'the Pope was dying!'\n\nAt which point, Marcinkus and two other cardinals rushed into the bedroom and pretended to be horrified by what they saw.\n\nRaimondi was asked by Marcinkus and others involved to testify before God that the Pope hadn't suffered.\n\n'They said when we die I would be their witness,' he said.\n\nA Vatican doctor would rule that John Paul suffered a heart attack, none the wiser to any alleged foul play.\n\nThe elaborate hit came to be because John Paul I allegedly threatened to expose an international fraud scam run by Vatican insiders.\n\nRaimondi said he waited outside the John Paul's room while Marcinkus (pictured) force fed the Pope with cyanide - killing him 33 days into his reign\n\nThe fraud included a forgery expert at the Vatican who lied about the church's actual holdings in American companies like IBM, Sunoco and Coca-Cola.\n\nThen, mobsters would allegedly sell phony stock certificates to innocent buyers.\n\nIf John Paul revealed the scheme, 'half the cardinals and bishops in the Vatican' would be out of the job.\n\n'They would have been thrown out and subject to the laws of the US and Italy,' Raimondi said to the Post.\n\n'They would have gone to jail.'\n\nRaimondi said if the Pope had kept his mouth shut, 'he could have had a nice long reign.'\n\nA Vatican doctor determined John Paul I (pictured) died of a heart attack and did not suspect foul play at the time\n\nNext on the list was John Paul II, who seemed set on exposing the inside job as well.\n\nRaimondi, a made man, was called back to the Vatican and told to prepare for a second murder at the behest of the fraudsters.\n\nHe reportedly told them: \u2018No way. What are you going to do? Just keep killing popes?\u2019\n\nKnowing he risked being killed by the mobsters, John Paul II allegedly chose to keep quiet about the illegal dealings.\n\nJohn Paul II would go on to serve the second longest reign in modern history before he died at age 84 in 2005.\n\nThis apparently prompted days of drunken partying for the mobsters and corrupt cardinals in Vatican City.\n\nPictured: Cardinals and the faithful mourn the death of John Paul I at his funeral (pictured) in 1978\n\nRaimondi said: 'We stayed and partied for a week with cardinals wearing civilian clothes, and lots of girls.'\n\n'If I had to live the rest of my life in Vatican City, it would have been OK with me. It was some setup. My cousins all drove Cadillacs. I am in the wrong business, I thought. I should have become a cardinal.'\n\nRaimondi dismisses those who question his story or say it closely resembles 'The Godfather III.'\n\n'It was a terrible movie. To tell you the truth I don\u2019t really remember it,' Raimondi told The Post.\n\n'What I said in the book I stand by till the day I die. If they take [the pope\u2019s body] and do any type of testing, they will still find traces of the poison in his system.'\n\nRaimondi, nicknamed 'Pluto', has left the mob life behind him and is now battling cancer.\n\nRaimondi, who began his life as a mobster, was the nephew of infamous godfather Charles 'Lucky' Luciano(pictured)\n\nHe forayed into the life of crime after he was sparred from life in prison for a murder he committed as a teen in Brooklyn and joined the Army.\n\nHe was reportedly recruited as a sniper during the Vietnam War, where his job was to assassinate North Vietnamese fighters.\n\nHe returned to America with a clean slate and chose to become a mobster.\n\nJewish mobster Meyer Lansky had a strong influence on Raimondi's methods.\n\n'[Lansky] taught me so many different ways of shaking down a guy. He also taught me so many ways to kill a guy, because Meyer was deadly. Don\u2019t let nobody fool you: Meyer killed a lot of men in his time.'\n\nStill living in Brooklyn, Raimondi implied he's past that portion of his life.\n\n'I don\u2019t need this s*** any more.'\n\n'All the old guys either went to prison or they died or went into witness protection. The new guys didn\u2019t do things the old way. I said, \"you know what, time to leave\".'", "description": "69-year-old Anthony Raimondi claims in his new book that he helped poison John Paul I with cyanide 33 days into his reign after the pop threatened to expose a billion dollar fraud scam", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/20/19935380-0-image-a-67_1571513952802.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
