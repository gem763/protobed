Erickson and Jim Ayello as they discuss the Colts upsetting the Kansas City Chiefs 19-13. Clark Wade, Clark.Wade@Indystar.com\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- After the third week, Darius Leonard was scared. For himself. For his career. But mostly for his family. After missing three weeks, the Indianapolis Colts' all-pro linebacker's concussions \"severe\" symptoms had not subsided. The headaches, in particular, had lingered much longer than he\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cThe first week, I wasn\u2019t thinking about wife and kids, that stuff,\u201d Darius Leonard said Monday at the Colts practice facility. \u201cI was like OK, \u2018I\u2019ve had a concussion before. I\u2019ll get over it.\u2019 Second week, I was like, \u2018Ahhh, you know, it\u2019s all right.\u2019 The third week, that\u2019s when I really started thinking, \u2018Wait a minute. I got a wife and kid. I\u2019ve had a headache for three weeks now. Will I ever be the same? Do I keep playing?\u2019 I mean you have those thoughts in the back of your head.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Leonard, he finally was allowed to banish those thoughts early last week when the headaches dissipated and he cleared the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol.\n\nWEEK 6: 32 things we learned\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Cowboys at a crossroads while Chiefs searching for answers\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to receive football news in your inbox\n\nLeonard spoke with members of the Indianapolis media Monday after practice for the first time in several weeks, though it wasn't the first time Colts fans and followers have heard from \"The Maniac\" during that time.\n\nHe's been hyperactive on social media, showering his teammates with love and live tweeting during Colts games. It was the only way he was allowed to show his support without being allowed inside the locker room and on the sidelines for the past two weeks.\n\nAnd that was among the things Leonard hated most about his prolonged absence -- being separated from his teammates, not being able to rebound with them after a tough loss or celebrate after a hard-fought victory.\n\nBut what most frustrated Leonard was the uncertainty that accompanies a severe head injury. Words can hardly express Leonard's frustration at not knowing how to make the pain go away. You can ice a sore ankle, Leonard said. You can massage an aching muscle. But there's nothing to be done for the brain.\n\nHe just had to wait. Day after day he woke up and wondered: Do I have a headache? How bad is that headache? Does it hurt less than yesterday? Am I making progress?\n\nWhat if I go outside? Can I go for a walk with my daughter or will the sun make my head throb?\n\nAll the unknowns are what frustrated Leonard. Same for the setbacks. There was a point early on when he thought he could return to practice and at least watch, only to learn that being outside was exacerbating his symptoms.\n\nAt that point, the team's medical staff banished him from the facility other than 30-minute intervals to undergo testing. Then he'd retreat back to his house and hope the pain would soon go away. It wasn't until the end of the second week that he was even allowed back at team meetings.\n\nCLOSE Frank Reich says his team had a great week of practice heading into the matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs. Matt Kryger, IndyStar\n\nThis is among the many inherent problems with diagnosing and recovering from concussions. They're wildly unpredictable. Symptoms can subside, then return. They can linger for months or disappear in a day. They can even come disguised as something else, which is what happened to Leonard.\n\nIndianapolis Colts outside linebacker Darius Leonard (53) and middle linebacker Anthony Walker (50) defend against Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry (22) in the first quarter of their game at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn., on Sunday, Sept. 15, 2019. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\n\nHe remembers when he suffered the concussion. It happened, he said, on either the second or third drive of the Titans game in Week 2. Not long after meeting bulldozer running back Derrick Henry in the hole, he began to feel a little ... off.\n\nThe feeling lingered, but he chalked it up to fatigue.\n\n\"I thought it was just the heat,\" Leonard said. \"It was hot that day.\"\n\nIt was 93 degrees in Nashville at kickoff, but the heat wasn't Leonard's problem. He just didn't know it yet. He didn't tell his coaches or trainers because, he said, he didn't think there was anything to tell. Conversely, they didn't notice anything wrong with him, nor did the independent certified athletic trainers (ATC spotters) who are in booths at every NFL stadium during every game.\n\nIt wasn't until after the game in the locker room that Leonard realized he still didn't feel right.\n\nHe's far from the first player that's happened to and certainly won't be the last. In fact, a couple of weeks later, safety Clayton Geathers was diagnosed with a concussion after a game.\n\n\"The concussion thing is always a concern,\" coach Frank Reich said recently. \"That\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to mess with. I guess the ones that happen and then you get later are typically the more mild ones because it\u2019s not anything that you notice right away. Then all of a sudden you develop symptoms later and then you go back and think about it \u2013 you were in the heat of the moment in the game. I just think that\u2019s what happens. Unfortunately, we have had a couple of those.\"\n\nLike Geathers, Leonard wasn't diagnosed until after the game and immediately placed in the NFL's concussion protocol.\n\nMaking the situation even more confounding for Leonard was that he'd never dealt with anything quite like this before. While he had suffered a diagnosed concussion during college, it was nothing like his most recent experience.\n\nLeonard remembers getting his bell rung, blacking out momentarily and knowing almost immediately he'd likely suffered a concussion.\n\nThis was so much different. This one didn't seem nearly as severe, so it bewildered him why he was missing so much time. He's never missed more than one game during a season in his life. He played every game in high school, missed one game in college and missed one during his rookie season last year due to an ankle injury.\n\nTo miss three games in a row was a feeling completely foreign to Leonard. He began talking to other people who had suffered concussions, including his brother, fellow linebacker Anthony Walker and backup quarterback Brian Hoyer.\n\nWhat they told him is what he already knew. Concussions can very in severity, in symptoms and in recovery time. There's no perfect indicator for any of it. And there is no cure.\n\nAll those unknowns, Leonard said, that's how the doubt start to creep into his mind. Fortunately for him and for the Colts, his fears -- for his career and his family -- were assuaged when his symptoms finally disappeared last week.\n\nBut he'll never forget how challenging the past three weeks have been. The most frustrating of his career, he called them.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely tough being away from the team, not being able to go out there and help your brothers out,\" Leonard said. \"It definitely was rough, especially when I couldn\u2019t even be on the sidelines. It was definitely a tough time for me.\u201d\n\nFollow IndyStar Colts Insider Jim Ayello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram: @jimayello.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
