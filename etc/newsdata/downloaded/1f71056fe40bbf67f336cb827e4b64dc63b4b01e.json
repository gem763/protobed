That's the sense one gets from reading a comprehensive report published on Tuesday morning by the local paper, the Chronicle-Telegram, which traced the early-morning sighting to someone wearing a blanket: \"Oberlin police Lt. Mike McCloskey said that authorities did find a pedestrian wrapped in a blanket. He said police interviewed another witness later in the day and that person also saw a female walking with a blanket.\" But no KKK garb.\n\nThe reaction to the news on Tuesday morning was immediate: mockery from conservatives. The American Conservative compared the college's reaction to \"a hillbilly Bible college [having] a collective conniption because somebody thinks they saw a devil worshiper peeing in a parking lot.\" (Author Rod Dreher added, \"It costs over $50,000 per year to attend this pants-wetting academy.\") The conservative Twitter aggregator Twitchy \u2014 founded by Oberlin alumna Michelle Malkin \u2014 dug in even further: \"Why don\u2019t they just tell students to feign fainting or to urinate when they come across dastardly wielders of assault blankets?\"", "description": "Reports on Monday that someone was walking around the campus of Oberlin College in Ku Klux Klan regalia \u2014\u00a0for which the Ohio liberal arts college cancelled an entire day's classes\u00a0\u2014 may have been a huge misunderstanding.", "authors": ["J.K.
