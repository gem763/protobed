people would have died if 'stay-put' strategy was called off", "language": "en", "text": "Get the biggest daily news stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show

Tower fire tragedy claimed.\n\nThe report also found the Grenfell Tower cladding did not comply with building regulations and was the \"principal\" reason for the fire's rapid and \"profoundly shocking\" spread, an inquiry into the fire published this morning concluded.\n\nOnce the fire had taken hold of the building's exterior, it was \"inevitable\" that it would find its way inside, head of the inquiry Sir Martin Moore-Bick said.\n\nBehailu Kebede, who lived in the flat where the Grenfell Tower fire started, has also been cleared of any blame.\n\nRetired judge Sir Martin said the resident, who lived in flat 16, was not responsible for the fire, which he found started in a faulty fridge-freezer in his home.\n\n\"I consider the cause and origin of the fire and find that it was started by an electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer in the kitchen of Flat 16, for which Behailu Kebede bears no blame,\" Sir Martin wrote.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe inquiry chairman identified 46 changes that should be made to ensure the safety of high-rise residents.\n\nThese touch on the ways the buildings are designed, constructed, approved and managed and how fire and rescue services respond.\n\nWhen deciding on the recommendations, Sir Martin said he had particularly considered their capacity for \"making a significant contribution to the safety of those who live in high-rise buildings\".\n\nThese include the production of national guidelines on how high rises should be evacuated, smoke hoods for all fire service personal entering the buildings and sounders in all high risers so the fire service can send evacuation signals.\n\nSince flames engulfed the 24-storey building on June 14, 2017, loved ones of those trapped inside have been fighting for justice.\n\nA day after fire and while the rubble was still smoldering, then Prime Minister Theresa May ordered for a full public inquiry and said the people of Grenfell in Kensington, West London, deserved answers.\n\nTwenty-seven months after she did, part one of the official inquiry into what happened has been made public for the first time.\n\nToday's release only deals with what happened on the night of the fire, with a second part focusing on the building to be published at a later date.\n\nYesterday a section of the first part of the report was leaked to the Press Association.\n\nFewer people were likely to have died in the fire had residents been evacuated while it was still possible, that part of the official document claimed.\n\nIt went on to identify \"systemic\" failures by the London Fire Brigade (LFB).\n\nThese include the brigade's \"stay-put\" strategy whereby residents were told to remain in their flats by firefighters and 999 operators for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out just before 1am.\n\nIt also accused the brigade's commissioner Dany Cotton of \"remarkable insensitivity\" after she said she would not have done anything differently on the night.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nInquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said fewer people may have died if key decisions had been made earlier.\n\nHe went on to suggest a number of recommendations following the two-year investigation into how the disaster at the west London tower block unfolded.\n\nIn the report, Sir Martin said the \"principal reason\" the flames shot up the building at such speed was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a \"source of fuel\".\n\nThe panels were added in the refurbishment of the tower before the fire.\n\nThe report also concluded the blaze, in which 72 people died, started as the result of an \"electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer\" in a fourth floor flat.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nSir Martin said Behailu Kebede, who had lived in the flat, bore no blame for the fire.\n\nSurvivors had previously urged the judge to make a point of formally exonerating the resident, who was offered police protection after false reports of his culpability circulated online.\n\nThe judge said he had not intended to investigate whether the building complied with regulations at this stage, but there was already \"compelling evidence\" the external walls did not.\n\nInstead of adequately resisting the spread of fire, they \"actively promoted it\", he said.\n\nReacting to yesterday's focus on the actions of the LFB, campaign group Justice 4 Grenfell said firefighters \"have been made scapegoats of Phase 1 while the 'big' players seem to have got off scot-free\".\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nGrenfell United, which represents some victims of the fire, said: \"Phase 2 of the inquiry must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment lies.\n\n\"The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and all companies involved must face serious questions.\n\n\"There can be no more hiding or trying to shift the blame. This is just the beginning.\n\n\"There is still a long road ahead for justice and change. For the 72 people that we lost, who are forever in our hearts, we will not stop until change comes.\"", "description": "Cladding was the main reason the Grenfell Tower fire claimed the lives of 72 people in June last year", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Getty", "Pa", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751154.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Grenfell-Tower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
