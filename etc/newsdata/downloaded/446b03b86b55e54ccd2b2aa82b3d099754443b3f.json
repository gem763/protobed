For some, the conflict does not end after they reach an agreement or a judge makes an order.\n\nIn May of this year, Justice Judy Fowler of Ontario\u2019s Superior Court of Justice dealt with one such dispute, hearing motions brought by two parents who each alleged the other failed to comply with a court order which set out parenting arrangements for their children. Both parents asked Justice Fowler to apply the big stick of litigation by finding the other parent to be in contempt of court.\n\nAt issue was a provision in the court order covering the children\u2019s residential time with each parent.\n\n\u201cTransitions on a school day shall take place at the school with the parent whose time with the children is ending delivering the children to the school and the parent with whom the children will be with picking up the children,\u201d the order read. \u201cIf not a school day, the parent who has the children will deliver the children to the other parent\u2019s residence at 8:00 a.m.\u201d\n\nIn the incident in question, the father said the mother was unable to pick up the children immediately after school for a scheduled transition. Rather than the children being in the care of a third party, the father believed the children should be in his care, and he told the mother that he would pick the children up after school and return them to the school that evening. The mother disagreed and told the father not to pick up the children. The father picked up the children anyway and the feud quickly made its way to the courtroom.\n\nJustice Fowler found the father to be in contempt. Justice Fowler correctly considered the three widely-accepted elements that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to arrive at a finding of contempt: 1) the order must clearly state what should and should not be done; 2) whether the father had knowledge of the order; and 3) whether the father intentionally committed the prohibited act. The simplicity of the facts surrounding the alleged contemptuous behaviour no doubt permitted Justice Fowler to make short shrift of the finding of contempt.\n\nThe father appealed. On Oct. 7, the Court of Appeal for Ontario released its decision. The panel of three judges agreed with the father. According to the panel, Justice Fowler erred by \u201cfailing to consider whether she should exercise her discretion to decline to make a finding of contempt\u201d notwithstanding her finding that the three elements of contempt were established.\n\nThe Court of Appeal makes it clear that a judge must engage in the \u201clast, crucial step\u201d of determining if a finding of contempt is appropriate in the circumstances. Quoting from a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, the panel of judges noted that the \u201ccontempt power is discretionary and courts have consistently discouraged its routine use to obtain compliance with court orders.\u201d Further, \u201ca judge may properly exercise his or her discretion to decline to impose a contempt finding where it would work an injustice in the circumstances of the case.\u201d\n\nNotably, the spirit of this decision is somewhat at odds with a 2015 decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in which that court confirmed Justice Robin Tremblay\u2019s decision to find a mother in contempt of a parenting order. According to the mother in that case, she had \u201cdone her best to facilitate the father\u2019s access, but the child had persistently refused to see the father.\u201d In concluding that the mother was in contempt of court, the Court of Appeal noted that the \u201chistory of this case belies the adequacy of alternate approaches\u201d since the mother had \u201ca history of trying to limit or terminate the father\u2019s access to the child.\u201d\n\nReturning to the recent case, the Court of Appeal highlighted that the children\u2019s best interests are \u201cthe paramount consideration when the issue raised in the contempt motion concerns access to children.\u201d In that context, the Court of Appeal noted that \u201cit is in the best interests of the children to encourage professional assistance as an alternative to making a finding of contempt too readily. Indeed, here, Justice Fowler encouraged the parties to continue working with a family mediator.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s focus on alternate approaches to a finding of contempt is consistent with recent changes to the federal Divorce Act that will come into effect across Canada in July 2020. Those changes include a court\u2019s ability to direct parents to participate in an alternate dispute-resolution process such as mediation.\n\nParents who find themselves snared in a dispute over the implementation of their parenting arrangements should consider an out-of-court process. One such process is the appointment of a parenting coordinator who can call balls and strikes on an as-needed, immediate basis. Such an appointment may help avoid being on the receiving end of a motion for contempt.\n\nAdam N.
