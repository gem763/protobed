Brion, who acknowledged the comments were \u201cboorish\u201d and apologized for them, later sued Muller for defamation, saying that the tweet had destroyed his reputation and livelihood.\n\nA French court agreed earlier this week, ordering Muller to pay Brion \u20ac20,000 (about $22,000), delete the offending tweet, and post a court-ordered explanation instead.\n\n#UPDATE A Paris court has ordered the woman behind France's answer to the #MeToo campaign to pay thousands of euros in damages for defaming the man she had accused of sexual harassment in a viral Twitter posthttps://t.co/omSPSvpG1A \u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) September 25, 2019\n\nMuller\u2019s original tweet came on the heels of the \u201cMe Too\u201d campaign in the US, accusing the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of a veritable train of abuses, from sexual harrassment and inappropriate comments to assault and rape. Weinstein was eventually arrested and charged in May 2018, and the case against him is still pending.\n\nSo what kind of monster was Brion, in order to be put in the same category? According to Muller, he tried to flirt with her at a cocktail party by saying \u201cYou have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.\u201d He later apologized via text message.\n\n\u201cI did make misplaced comments to Sandra Muller during a drunken cocktail party very late one night, but only once,\u201d Brion told the court. \u201cI liked her. I told her so, heavy-handedly. And only once, I must point out. I don\u2019t want to exonerate myself from my boorishness at the time. I reiterate my apologies.\u201d\n\nBrion\u2019s lawyers argued that he had the \u201cright to flirt,\u201d and that his life should not have been destroyed due to an \u201cunstoppable machine\u201d set in motion by Muller\u2019s tweets.\n\nAlso on rt.com #MeToo frenzy deprives men of \u2018indispensable freedom\u2019 to hit on women \u2013 Catherine Deneuve\n\nOver 100 prominent French women agreed, publishing an open letter in the newspaper Le Monde in January 2018 that denounced the movement as witch-hunting \u201cPuritanism\u201d helping not women, but \u201cenemies of sexual liberty \u2013 religious extremists and the worst sort of reactionaries.\u201d\n\nRape is a crime but insistent or clumsy flirting is not, nor is gallantry a macho aggression.\n\n\u201cMen have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone\u2019s knee or try to steal a kiss,\u201d read the letter. One of its signatories was the legendary Catherine Deneuve, whose admission of an illegal abortion contributed to the procedure\u2019s legalization in France back in the 1970s.\n\nHer younger colleague Laetitia Casta also chimed in a few days later, saying that \u201chostility and hatred of men won\u2019t move things forward.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Hatred of men won\u2019t help\u2019: French actress Laetitia Casta speaks out against #MeToo\n\nIt appears the French courts agreed with the sentiment, ruling in Brion\u2019s favor. Even assuming the verdict does not get overturned on appeal, however, it is at best a Pyrrhic victory for the former TV executive. If he has truly been unable to find work since, the damages are hardly equal to lost income, and chances are that prospective employers will still give him a pass out of fear of being hounded by social justice activists. Social media mobs don\u2019t usually care about facts established in court, after all.\n\nOver on the other side of the Atlantic, the notions of due process and presumption of innocence quickly found themselves tossed overboard when it came to #MeToo allegations. The most high-profile instance of this has been the attempt to torpedo the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court back in September 2018. Most recently, legendary opera tenor Placido Domingo found himself \u201cdisinvited\u201d from events in the US over #MeToo claims made in the media, not even in court.\n\nAlso on rt.com Innocent until proven guilty? Not for Placido Domingo: Americans race to condemn, Europeans hesitant\n\nThe practice of airing one\u2019s grievances in public rather than through due process has even claimed lives. A Canadian video game developer by the name of Alex Holowka committed suicide lat month, after social justice activist Zoe Quinn accused him on Twitter of rape and abuse allegedly committed years ago. Quinn\u2019s own tweets from the time period in question contradicted her narrative, but by the time someone dug them up, Holowka had already been fired from his job and had taken his own life.\n\nQuinn briefly retreated from Twitter, then returned as if nothing had happened and continued to bask in the adoration of her fans.\n\nAlso on rt.com Game creator\u2019s suicide after feminist Zoe Quinn accuses him of abuse shows peril of Twitter trials\n\nWhat may have started as a legitimate rebellion against the infamous Hollywood \u201ccasting couch\u201d has morphed into a weapon of mass destruction in the culture war, turning men and women into enemies told to fear and doubt each other\u2019s every move \u2013 wrecking, in the process, cultural and legal norms painstakingly developed over the centuries to ensure justice for all.\n\nBy Nebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT", "description": "The man whose case launched France\u2019s #MeToo movement has won damages in a defamation case, but it\u2019s a Pyrrhic victory at best, celebrated on the ruins of cultural norms and legal practices that the movement has destroyed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.09/article/5d8f914a85f5406e6466e9f3.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
