Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who is testifying before Congress about the complaint, provided a redacted version of the complaint to lawmakers for the hearing and it was released by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nIts release comes amid turbocharged calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment in Congress and a day after the White House put out a partial transcript of the July 25 call\u2014in which Trump reminded Zelensky that America does \u201ca lot\u201d for Ukraine before blatantly asking the Ukrainian leader to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d and investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe complaint confirms a number of details that have been reported over the past week. The whistleblower writes that Trump spent the call mostly pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and to locate Democratic National Committee email servers supposedly in Ukraine; he also urged Zelensky to work with his \u201cpersonal envoys,\u201d in the words of the whistleblower, attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump said to Zelensky in the call, according to a memorandum released Wednesday. \u201cWhatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also says White House officials told the whistleblower that this was not the first time that a transcript of a talk between Trump and a world leader had been placed into the White House\u2019s most secure system \u201cfor the purpose of protecting politically sensitive\u2026 information.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the complaint sheds new light on efforts that the administration took to further squeeze Zelensky\u2019s government on Trump\u2019s requests. Following the July call, U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker and EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland communicated with Ukrainian officials about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands, according to the complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower also alleges that after Zelensky took office, administration officials who traveled to Kyiv for his inauguration in May made clear that Trump would not meet with Zelensky until he saw how the new president \u201cchose to act.\u201d\n\nOne of the major question marks from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is the precise role that nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine played in the process. Trump reportedly paused the aid for months as he and his allies worked Zelensky on Biden. In early July, the whistleblower says, the Office of Management and Budget issued guidance that all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine had been suspended. Neither OMB nor National Security Council staff \u201cknew why this instruction had been issued,\u201d reads the complaint.\n\nA Justice Department memo made public this week said Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson interviewed witnesses after the complaint was filed and concluded that \u201cstatements made by the president during the call could be viewed as soliciting a foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign-finance laws.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ memo said that the whistleblower did not listen in on the July 25 call but reported hearing from White House officials that Trump \u201chad made statements that the complainant viewed as seeking to pressure that leader to take an official action to help the President\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving the complaint on Aug. 12, Atkinson conducted a \u201cpreliminary review\u201d and found \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u201d the memo said. But Atkinson concluded that the complaint\u2019s allegations \u201cnonetheless appeared credible.\u201d\n\nThe complaint was given to Maguire, just weeks into his tenure as acting intelligence chief, and he declined to issue a report on it to Congress. But Atkinson alerted the House Intelligence Committee of the complaint\u2019s existence, and it subpoenaed Maguire for it.\n\nAt that point the contents of the complaint were publicly unknown, but in the coming days it was reported first that it involved Ukraine, and then that it was triggered by the July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\nThe call also fueled calls for impeachment. While many Democrats have been calling for impeachment proceedings against Trump ever since the release of the Mueller Report, the whistleblower complaint proved to be the tipping point for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who accused Trump of a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of his oath of office when she announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Trump apparently sought to stifle Democratic criticism by releasing the transcript of his call with Zelensky, even some Republicans seemed to think that plan backfired.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) called the transcript \u201ctroubling in the extreme,\u201d while Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) told reporters \u201cthere\u2019s obviously a lot that\u2019s very troubling there\u201d after viewing the whistleblower complaint.\n\nTrump has admitted both to initially withholding aid and urging the Ukrainian president to look into Hunter Biden, who was an adviser to a Ukrainian firm, he has insisted there was no wrongdoing and no \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans were apparently concerned enough to join Democrats late Wednesday in voting 421-0 for the passage of a non-binding resolution demanding that the Trump administration release the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThose on the House Intelligence Committee who have already seen the complaint have suggested that it offers a grim outlook for Trump.\n\n\u201cI found the allegations deeply disturbing. I also found them very credible,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhat this courageous individual has done is exposed serious wrongdoing. I think it a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it was, there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee,\u201d he said, adding that the complaint \u201cprovides information for the committee to follow up with other witnesses and documents.\u201d\n\nThe complaint\u2019s release came as the man who initially refused to give it to Congress\u2014acting DNI Maguire\u2014appeared before the House Intelligence Committee to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions about it.", "description": "More is revealed about the president and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s alleged efforts to get Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to do their dirty work against Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Allison Quinn", "Congressional Reporter", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2536,w_4509,x_0,y_122/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569469431/GettyImages-1171051343_k7adyr", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
