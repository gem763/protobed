Nor do any reputable voices on the left seriously argue that racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia are not attitudes and ideologies that persist and cause harm.\n\n\u201cClass reductionism\u201d is, in other words, a myth. It is a caricature rooted in hoary folk imagery, likely as not originating in tales of late-1960s debates during the raucous disintegration of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as a clutch of nominal socialists insisted that any distinct focus on racial and gender injustice would undermine the greater political goal of working-class unity. But even at its height, this view only gained currency among a very small cohort of sectarian dogmatists. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, Communists, Socialists, labor-leftists, and Marxists of all stripes characteristically were in the forefront of struggles for racial and gender justice. And that commitment was natural, because such leftists saw those struggles as inextricable from the more general goal of social transformation along egalitarian lines; they properly understood the battles for racial and gender equity as constitutive elements of the struggle for working-class power. Class reductive leftism is a figment of the political imagination roused by those who have made their peace with neoliberalism.\n\nThe myth, moreover, obscures important contemporary and historical realities.\n\nBlack, female, and trans people tend to be disproportionately working class. So any measure to advance broad downward economic redistribution\u2014from Medicare for All to a $15 hourly minimum wage\u2014can\u2019t coherently be said to thwart the interests of women, racial minorities, or other identity groups. What\u2019s more, this brand of class denialism artificially separates race, gender, and other ascriptive identities from the basic dynamics of American capitalism. True, African Americans, Latinos, and women are disproportionately poor or working class due to a long history of racial and gender discrimination in labor and housing markets\u2014conditions that have worsened alongside the postwar deindustrialization of American cities. But this means that these populations would benefit disproportionately from initiatives geared to improve the circumstances of poor and working-class people in general.\n\nThat is why, as historian Tour\u00e9 F. Reed (who I should disclose is also my son) points out, mainstream civil rights leaders through the 1930s and 1940s \u201cargued that precisely because most blacks were working class, racial equality could only be achieved through a combination of anti-discrimination policies and social-democratic economic policies.\u201d The rise of Cold War anti-communism", "description": "The fight for racial and gender justice has always been about economic inequality, too.", "authors": ["Adolph Reed Jr."], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/854b6ec8844b754fe3cb71a497600b16b985f990.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
