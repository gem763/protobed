How can somebody like that be released back into the public for two hours a week?\u2019\n\nHowever Muguti, from Clayton, wont be allowed to visit the Stoke-on-Trent area.\n\nThe retired police officer is now living in fear (Picture: BPM Media)\n\nMs Flynn added: \u2018My dad was a serving police officer and this is how he\u2019s being repaid.\n\n\u2018We wanted him to go to jail but now when he does leave hospital he won\u2019t even have a criminal record.\u2019\n\nThe family received a letter from the Ministry of Justice on September 9 informing them of the decision.\n\nIt came just 11 months after Muguti carried out the attack on October 14 last year.\n\nStafford Crown Court heard how Mr Clowes\u2019 wife Jennifer Clowes, 74, was woken at 3.40am and saw a man carrying a hammer.\n\nShe ran into a room to take cover and closed a door before armed police arrived and found Muguti standing in darkness in a room at the end of a corridor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce he was finally handcuffed officers found Mr Clowes in his bed covered in blood with a severed left ear, permanent scars, head injuries and a black eye.\n\nMs Flynn says someone could have died if her 13-year-old daughter who was in the house hadn\u2019t rang 999.\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m always convinced that he is going to come back. He lived five minutes away from my nana and granddad and he targeted a housing complex which he knew would be full of vulnerable people.\n\n\u2018My two children sleep with hammers under their beds because they\u2019re so scared.\u2019\n\nMrs Clowes, who has since moved house with her husband, says the night of the attack was like a \u2018horror film\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019m absolutely fuming. It\u2019s only five and half months since the trial and I feel as if we\u2019ve been left down.\n\nTheir neighbour Barbara Morris, 58, who was also targeted by the same man, is \u2018gutted\u2019 by the latest news.\n\nShe said: \u2018Even though it is just two hours a week I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable walking around the streets with him there.\n\n\u2018He was so strong when he was banging the hammer on our door and I am worried that he will be on the streets with just two staff members.\n\n\u2018At the trial they said he could be dismissed from attending the proceedings because they believed if he heard what had happened it would cause him to react, so how can somebody who was like that five months ago now be allowed in public?\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
