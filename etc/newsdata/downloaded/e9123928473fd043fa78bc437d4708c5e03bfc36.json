AFR\n\nIn Vietnam, solar farms are constrained 50-60 per cent of the time. These are in many cases worse than the level of grid constraints suffered by new wind and solar projects in parts of Australia's National Electricity Market.\n\n\"What's interesting to us is all the policy and regulatory work going on in those countries [where] big global utilities are running into these huge problems,\" Mr Green said.\n\nThat has got them focused on'' working out how to \"construct a project that genuinely provides stable energy so it doesn't get booted off\".\n\nChina Huadian has a similar memorandum of understanding (MOU) with JERA \u2013 a joint venture of top Japanese utilities TEPCO and Chubu that ranks as the world's largest gas buyer. Lyon struck a parallel MOU with JERA in December 2018.\n\nLyon's MOU with China Huadian doesn't include financial commitments but Mr Green said it is a step towards getting Lyon's stalled Australian projects developed and an introduction for Lyon to the vast Chinese market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chinese government wants utilities such as China Huadian to help it build hundreds of gigawatts of solar power capacity. The MOU covers Lyon's Australian projects, retrofits of batteries to existing generation, including solar and even coal plant, and the addition of batteries to new solar and renewable projects in China and Asia.\n\nMr Green said Lyon had ovecome technical obstacles to connecting its large solar and battery projects planned for South Australia, Victoria and North Queensland to the grid and was close to resolving a dispute with a US investor, Magnetar Capital, that had also delayed the projects.\n\n\u201cChina Huadian has big plans for solar and wind development but the significant curtailment and grid disturbance they have experienced to date shows that the volume of renewables they want to build will deliver greater benefit, both technically and commercially, with integrated storage.\"", "description": "A clean energy developer contrasted the rancorous debate on wind and solar energy in Australia with the pragmatic approach in Asia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5df9e802d9af8068464a885eedd5ac88305fd2f0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
