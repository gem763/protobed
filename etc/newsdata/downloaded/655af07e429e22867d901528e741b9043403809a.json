As companies launch, go public, and tackle turmoil, executives go gray, lose weight, and forget to buy eye cream.\n\nTech execs like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos were once fresh faces on the scene. Now, they\u2019ve crafted themselves into multibillionaires while growing their businesses into worldwide success stories.\n\nTake a look at how dramatically these tech execs have changed since they\u2019ve started the job.\n\nAny time Mark Zuckerberg mentions Facebook, he often brings up how he started it in his dorm room at Harvard when he was just 20 years old. Early photos of Zuckerberg show him in a plain t-shirt, sweats, and Adidas sandals lounging on the steps of his would-be alma mater.\n\nAnd although Zuckerberg\u2019s wardrobe hasn\u2019t changed much (albeit the slides and sweats), the company he founded has.\n\nToday, Facebook has more than 2.3 billion users and has fought to keep its reputability as privacy scandals continue to plague the social network and Zuckerberg himself.\n\nTake a look at how dramatically other world-famous CEOs changed over the course of their job:\n\nJeff Bezos founded Amazon when he was 30 in 1994. Like other famed tech execs, he started the company in his garage in Seattle.\n\nBefore Amazon, Bezos was a senior vice president at D. E. Shaw, a hedge fund, until 1993 when he decided to begin selling books on the internet.\n\nIn the first month of its launch, Amazon sold books to people in all 50 states and in 45 different countries. And it continued to grow. Amazon went public on May 15, 1997.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nFast forward to 2019, and Bezos, 55, is the wealthiest person in modern history, with a net worth of $150 billion. In September, Amazon briefly became the second US company to achieve a valuation of more than $1 trillion.\n\ncaption Bezos in 2018. source Leonard Ortiz/Digital First Media/Orange County Register via Getty Images\n\nMuch of Bezos\u2019 wealth comes not from his salary but from the Amazon shares he owns. Bezos currently holds 78,893,033 shares in Amazon, accounting for a 16.3% ownership stake.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nMark Zuckerberg founded \u201cThe Facebook\u201d when he was 20 years old in 2004 while studying at Harvard University.\n\ncaption Founder of Facebook.com Mark Zuckerberg, right, and Dustin Moscovitz, co-founder, left, in 2004. source Justine Hunt/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nHe then dropped out of school after his sophomore year to focus on the social network full-time. Facebook raised its $12.7 million Series A round of funding while he was barely of legal drinking age. Time magazine named him \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d just six years later, while Facebook\u2019s initial public offering in 2012 was the biggest-ever technology IPO at the time.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nZuckerberg, now 34, has a net worth of over $64.1 billion.

It\u2019s been called out on multiple occasions for the way it handles user data. Zuckerberg testified for 10 hours in front of Congress last April over the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal. Facebook has also been the center of debates regarding how to regulate when tech companies that have too much power.\n\nSource: Business Insider, Business Insider, Bloomberg\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple Computer Company in 1976 in Jobs\u2019 garage.
