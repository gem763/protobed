My feeling is she wants to. She feels entitled to do it. She feels compelled to do it. She feels that God put her on the Earth to do it. But she\u2019s hesitant because she realizes the timing is bad,\u201d Morris told host John Catsimatidis, noting her history with silencing sexual harassment victims and how she is \u201cscared to death\u201d of the #MeToo movement.\n\nHe went on to say Clinton will likely only join the race if former Vice President Joe Biden drops out.\n\n\u201cIf [Biden] goes away, there\u2019s an opening for her because at that point all the Democrats are going to say, \u2018Oh my God. Are we going to nominate Elizabeth Warren and be left with only a left-wing, crazy, George McGovern-like candidate to represent us in the election? We\u2019re going to get clobbered! We need a moderate to come out,'\u201d Morris stated.\n\nHe added, \u201c[M]ake no mistake. She wants it. She\u2019s planning on it. She\u2019ll do everything she can to achieve it.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Sunday during\u00a0\"The Cats Roundtable\" on\u00a0New York AM 970 radio,\u00a0political commentator and former Bill Clinton adviser Dick Morris discussed the upcoming | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/dick-morris-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
