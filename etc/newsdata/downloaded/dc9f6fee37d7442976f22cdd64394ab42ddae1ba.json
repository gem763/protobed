Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.1% advance.\n\nThe increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months was also unchanged at 1.7%.\n\nThe low rate of inflation, reflected in the CPI and other price barometers, may allow the Fed more leeway to trim rates if growth in the economy continues to slow. Wall Street puts a high chance the central bank will reduce rates again at the end of the month.\n\nSeparately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that Social Security recipients would get a 1.6% cost-of-living increase in 2020. COLA adjustments are based on the CPI report.\n\nWhat happened: The cost of gasoline RB1, +0.00% and natural gas NG1, +0.00% fell in September, accentuating a downtrend in energy prices.\n\nThe cost of food rose slightly, mostly for takeout and other meals prepared outside the home.\n\nAnother closely watched measure of prices that strips out food and energy costs inched up 0.1% in September, the smallest increase in four months.\n\nThe yearly increase in the so-called core rate was unchanged at 2.4%.\n\nPrices rose for rent, medical care and airline fees, but they fell sharply for used vehicles and clothing. Increases in the cost of used cars and apparel had driven up overall consumer prices during the summer.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, hourly wages were flat last month. They\u2019ve increased a modest 1.2% in the past year.\n\nThe survey of consumer prices tends to run hotter than the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation barometer known as the price index for personal-consumption expenditures. The PCE is up just 1.4% over the past year \u2014 well below the Fed\u2019s 2% annual inflation target.\n\nBig picture: Some parts of the economy are experiencing more inflation than others, but by and large price pressures are barely causing a ripple. Slowing U.S. growth and sluggish global trade have also reduced the cost of many raw materials or partly finished goods.\n\nWith inflation largely under wraps, the Fed has said it would be prepared to cut interest rates again if the outlook for the U.S. economy worsens. The central bank is worried the U.S. trade war with China will damage a record expansion now in its 11th year.\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cThe trend in consumer inflation remains relatively soft with lower energy costs pulling down the CPI in September,\u201d Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote to clients.\u201dThe odds of a rate cut in October are moving up with domestic economic data turning softer in recent months.\u201d\n\nRead: U.S. adds 136,000 jobs in September, unemployment rate hits 50-year low\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.94% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.95% rose in Thursday trades on hopes of easing U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +3.80% jumped to 1.65%.", "description": "Consumer inflation in the U.S. was held in check in September by falling prices of gasoline and used vehicles, offsetting increases in rent and prepared...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH109_gasoli_ZG_20180410125602.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
