The league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement allows teams to reclaim a portion of a player\u2019s signing bonus for failing to play.\n\nThe Redskins, according to Schefter, have no plans to waive the fines should Williams return. The 31-year-old was set to make nearly $11 million in 2019 and with every missed game, the tackle misses out on a paycheck of more than $650,000.\n\nDespite rumors of his holdout ending this week, Williams did not report to the Redskins\u2019 facility and will miss his second straight game. Williams is upset with the team\u2019s medical staff over the handling of a benign tumor and wants either to be traded or get a new contract.\n\nThe Redskins kick off against the Dallas Cowboys at 1 p.m.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
