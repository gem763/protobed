Because I asked them at half-time to get hungrier doesn\u2019t mean to say they didn\u2019t up for the game. There\u2019s a big difference and if you want to spend some time outside I\u2019ll give you a rugby education on that one.\n\n\u2018But to turn up and say an All Blacks team comes to a semi-final of the Rugby World Cup with the amount of ability and the history that it\u2019s had behind it \u2014 to say that\u2019s not hunger. That\u2019s a pretty average question, I reckon.\u2019\n\nWith Hansen going, the All Blacks now face a tough decision appointing his successor. Assistant coach Ian Foster was next in line but New Zealand\u2019s performance on Saturday will not help his case for an internal appointment.\n\nHansen admitted his side were outmuscled but claimed the hurt will act as a fuel for the future.\n\nAssistant coach Ian Foster remains in contention to take over from Hansen\n\nNew Zealand saw their 12 year unbeaten run in the World Cup come to an end on Saturday\n\n\u2018They had guys who were prepared to throw their bodies at our boys,\u2019 added Hansen (right). \u2018They created the go-forward in the game. We struggled to dominate at breakdown time. When you are going forward you get all the 50-50 decisions. That is not an excuse but it just happens. I think that the detail of the match didn\u2019t go our way but our workrate and how much we really wanted it was there. You could see it even in that first half when we conceded, we came back and hung in there.\n\n\u2018Tonight is pretty gutting. When it doesn\u2019t go your way it\u2019s a hard thing to take.\n\n\u2018They are a good team and there is no shame being beat but there is a lot of hurt. That adversity will feed a lot more All Blacks teams in the future so we\u2019ll find one positive out of it.\u2019", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKOHAMA: The double World Cup-winning coach, who is stepping down at the end of the tournament, was furious when asked if his players turned up with the wrong attitude.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20227722-0-image-a-62_1572128908086.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
