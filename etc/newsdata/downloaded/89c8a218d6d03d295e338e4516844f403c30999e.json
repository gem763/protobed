GLOBAL MARKETS-European markets roar approval at new Brexit deal\n\n* Sterling jump 1% as UK and EU agree new Brexit deal\n\n* Lack of support from Northern Irish partners a snag\n\n* Dollar weak after U.S. retail sales fall for first time in\n\nseven\n\nmonths\n\n* Turkish markets in focus before talks with U.S. over Syria\n\nBy Marc Jones\n\nLONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Confirmation of a new Brexit deal\n\nlit a fire under Europe's financial markets on Thursday, sending\n\nsterling to a five-month high, European stocks to a\n\nyear-and-a-half peak and causing safe-haven assets to plummet.\n\nIt wasn't a completely clear Brexit road ahead. Familiar\n\nIrish border snags remained a spoiler for Northern Ireland's\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party but after three years of\n\ntortuous uncertainty any deal was a deal to cheer.\n\n\"We have a great new Brexit deal,\" British Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson said and \"Where there is a will, there is a deal -\n\nwe have one!\" echoed European Commission President Jean-Claude\n\nJuncker as the news broke from Brussels.\n\nSterling, which has been the key gauge of Brexit sentiment\n\nall along, jumped more than a percent against the dollar, taking\n\nits gains over the last six days to 6% and which if it holds,\n\nwill be a more than 30-year record. It ran as far as $1.2988 to the highest against the\n\neuro since May at 0.86 pence. The euro also jumped to a near-\n\ntwo-month high against the dollar of $1.1139 in its sixth\n\nday of gains in the past seven.\n\n\"The deal has been announced, but the key hurdle of being\n\nvoted into the UK Parliament remains,\" said ING's chief EMEA FX\n\nand interest rate strategist Petr Krpata.\n\nLondon's heavyweight FTSE and the pan-European STOXX 600\n\nboth jumped 0.6%, having been flat beforehand. UK Gilts\n\n, German Bunds , the Swiss franc, gold and\n\nmost other safe havens began selling off. .EU\n\nBarclays Capital European equities strategist Emmanuel Cau\n\nsaid tha deal \"should provide legs to the rotation from UK\n\nexporters to domestic plays\" as it should help rebuild\n\nconfidence.\n\nTALKING TURKEY\n\nWall Street was expected to reopen higher and\n\nemerging-market stocks gained for a sixth day -- their\n\nlongest winning streak since early April -- after U.S. Treasury\n\nSecretary Steven Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators\n\nwere nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents\n\nto sign next month.\n\nBut U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven\n\nmonths, suggesting manufacturing-led weakness was spreading to\n\nthe broader economy. U.S. consumption has been one\n\nof few bright spots in the global economy, so the data fanned\n\nworries the trade war would ultimately tip the world into\n\nrecession.\n\n\"While the U.S. suspended a hike in tariffs, it hasn't gone\n\nas far as scrapping the tariffs altogether, so it is hard to\n\nexpect a quick pick-up in the economy,\" said Yoshinori Shigemi,\n\nglobal market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nThe dollar index =USD was last at 97.692, having reached\n\nits lowest level since Aug. 27. The dollar was flat at 108.75\n\nafter peaking at 108.90 to the Japanese yen and down\n\nagainst the euro at $1.11 .\n\nIn commodities, oil prices slipped after industry data\n\nshowed a larger-than-expected build-up in U.S. crude stockpiles,\n\nadding to concerns that global demand for oil may weaken amid\n\nfurther signs of an economic slowdown. Brent crude futures fell 0.25% to $59.27 a barrel.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 0.5% to $53.01.\n\nTurkey's fragile markets remained in focus after the\n\ncountry's military advance in Syria created tensions with United\n\nStates and Europe and incurred mild sanctions. Turkish President\n\nTayyip Erdogan is to meet with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nand Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later.\n\nAlthough the U.S. pulled its troops out of the area to allow\n\nTurkey's push, Pence and Pompeo are expected to urge Erdogan to\n\ndeclare a ceasefire, something Erdogan says will \"never\" happen.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump warned of \"devastating\" sanctions if\n\ndiscussions did not go well.\n\nTurkish stocks were down 1.8% and the lira weakened to\n\n5.8877 to the dollar . It has lost nearly 5% this month,\n\nmaking it the world's worst performer for October.\n\nTurkey's lira worst performing currency over the last month https://tmsnrt.rs/2OLepRJ\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-European markets roar approval at new Brexit deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB9M0BY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
