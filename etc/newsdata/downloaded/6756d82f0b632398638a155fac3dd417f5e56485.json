Dietrich von Choltitz, to level the city. Hitler said the city must not be given to the Free French except laying in rubble. When the Germans finally abandoned the city, Choltitz surrendered 17,000 men to the Free French and left Paris the way it was. Hitler was furious.\n\nDuring the German occupation, the Luxembourg Palace was the headquarters building for the Luftwaffe, the German air force. After the Germans left, the palace was turned into the home of the French Senate, where the legislative body has been ever since \u2014 and ever since, the rumors of the Nazi leader's bust have persisted but never been proven.\n\nThe Luxembourg Palace garden fa\u00e7ade, in Paris, France, on August 27, 2010. Marcin Bia\u0142ek/Wikimedia Commons\n\nUntil September 5, 2019.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Monde and reporter Olivier Faye conducted a serious investigation into the persistent rumor, finding not only the bust of Hitler, but a 10 x 6.5-foot long Nazi flag along with various other documents left over from 75 years ago.\n\nThe only thing is, besides the palace's history of headquartering the Nazi Air Force general staff, no one really knows how the Nazi memorabilia came to be in the basement of the French Senate.\n\nIn the waning days of the Nazi occupation, Luftwaffe personnel made a fast break for the exit, leaving the Luxembourg Palace in a state of disrepair and outright chaos.\n\nThe Free French forces looted everything they could from the Nazi occupiers, and Nazi memorabilia became very valuable on the black market. (It still is today.) It's believed these particular pieces of Nazi culture were hidden away by someone intent on selling them, hiding the pieces in the basement until a buyer could be found. That clearly never happened.\n\nNone of the Senators interviewed by Le Monde knew of the Nazi bust or flag in the basement \u2014 and no one knows what to do with them now.", "description": "Paris' lavish Luxembourg Palace is now home to France's Senate and some Nazi paraphernalia, though it's not totally clear how the latter got there.", "authors": ["Blake Stilwell", "We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/55832a9e6da811cf180aa3b1-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
