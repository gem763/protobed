The pop star had published a lengthy Tumblr post in June after news of the sale broke, blasting Braun for his \u201cmanipulative bullying\u201d and involvement in conflicts she\u2019s had with Justin Bieber, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.\n\nCrow, who recently signed to Big Machine herself, said in a Wednesday appearance on \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d that she hadn\u2019t followed the Swift/Braun drama closely. Still, she suggested that Swift might need to, well, calm down a bit regarding the sale.\n\n\u201cI signed with a record label 30 years ago, and within five years it became owned by Interscope,\u201d the nine-time Grammy winner said, as seen in the clip below. \u201cThen Interscope got bought by Universal \u2026 these things, that\u2019s just the way the business goes. It\u2019s totally not unusual for your masters to change hands like 9,000 times.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what the big stink was,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m out of the loop. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s accusations have divided the music industry. Many of Braun\u2019s clients, including Bieber and Demi Lovato, came to his defense. Others, like singers Kelly Clarkson and Halsey, have sympathized with Swift, who has since signed a new record deal with Republic Records and Universal Music Group.\n\nCrow, meanwhile, has lately been outspoken about the shifting way music is distributed. In August, she released her 11th album, \u201cThreads,\u201d featuring collaborations with Brandi Carlile, Stevie Nicks and Chris Stapleton, among others.\n\nThough Crow has no plans to retire, she has said \u201cThreads\u201d will be her final full-length album. Looking ahead, she plans to focus on releasing individual singles and touring instead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the generation of people who actually bought albums,\u201d she told Vanity Fair last month. \u201cIt just feels like a nice, neat, and tidy way to wrap up a 30-year-career of the tradition of making full artistic statements, which is basically what I grew up with.\u201d", "description": "The nine-time Grammy winner says the change in ownership of Swift's recordings is \"just the way business goes.\"", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7aab922400002e2a78c278.jpeg?cache=kmvdb5m2kf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
