His opponents have called on him to do so.\n\nWhat is Netanyahu\u2019s connection to the case?\n\nThe 67-year-old has been questioned under caution by police in two cases.\n\nOne deals with gifts given to him and his family by businessmen, another relates to conversations he held with an Israeli publisher.\n\nA court injunction said the cases involved suspicion of the commission of the felonies of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. However, it does not specify who might be charged for the crimes.\n\nIs this likely to impact Netanyahu\u2019s popularity?\n\nAnalysts think it is unlikely.\n\nThey say Netanyahu has weathered several scandals and police inquiries while in office.\n\nHis approval ratings are generally solid, putting him ahead of potential challengers.\n\nWhat they are saying\n\n\u201cI would like to tell you, citizens of Israel, that I do not heed background noises. I continue to work for you.\u201d \u2013 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "description": "Demonstrators are urging Avichai Mandelblit to bring indictments in two corruption investigations involving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.", "authors": ["Catherine Hardy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/381826/1000x563_381826.jpg", "published_at": "2017-08-06"}
