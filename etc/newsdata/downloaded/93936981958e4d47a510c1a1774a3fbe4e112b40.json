It steals all their best ideas.\"\n\nThe less active people are the better their results, the more active they are the worse their results. \u2014 ETFS chairman, Graham Tuckwell\n\nInnovation in the ETF market has largely stalled, confined to a race to the bottom on fees, Mr Tuckwell said, citing the much-hyped moves by ETF behemoths Vanguard and Blackrock to undercut market pricing in Australia and the US.\n\nInstead, the SMSF Leaders Fund provides a new approach to passive investing that Mr Tuckwell said allows the philosophy he has spent much of his career advocating for to pursue the battle of ideas on a new front.\n\nRobo-advice as messenger\n\nThe imminent ETF launch, which will bear SelfWealth's brand name, is not Mr Tuckwell's first collaboration with an automated investment provider or robo-adviser.\n\nIn 2017 he led a $3 million investment in Stockspot, an Australian robo-adviser founded by former UBS portfolio manager Chris Brycki and a key competitor to SelfWealth.\n\nAnd, in that same year, he sold the European arm of ETF Securities to New York-based fund manager Wisdom Tree, which has invested in a number of robo-advice operations including AdvisorEngine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, according to Mr Tuckwell, the power of robo-advice lies not in the technology it uses or even the entrepreneurs he has financially backed, but in its ability to educate investors about the dangers of traditional active investment management.\n\n\u201cIt is about education,\" he said. \"The less active people are the better their results, the more active they are the worse their results. There is a wide body of academic research that supports this.\"\n\nWhile bullish on the ability of ETF-based robo-advice platforms like Stockspot and SelfWealth to claw market share from unlisted managed funds, he made clear that it is the peer-to-peer philosophy underlying the new fund that has enticed ETF Securities into the partnership.\n\n\u201cIt is not SelfWealth we are tying ourselves to, it is the data we are tying ourselves to,\" he said.\n\n'Australia is prime for it'\n\nAs a greater number of investors become clued up to what he perceives as the myth of active outperformance, unlisted fund managers are adopting the language of passive ETFs without the underlying structure, Mr Tuckwell warned.\n\nFinancial advisers and product issuers have a responsibility to ensure \"accurate information\" is put forward to investors, as well as robo-advice platforms, Mr Tuckwell said.\n\nHe predicted that Australia, which he said has an investment culture still \"way, way behind\" the rest of the world, is at a tipping point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHow did Uber start? Some guy in San Francisco late at night was frustrated that he couldn\u2019t get a cab. It is the frustration that will lead the revolution.\n\n\u201cAustralia is prime for it \u2014 at long last. If I\u2019d stuck around here the past 15 years I would have starved to death.\"", "description": "The true value of robo-advice lies in its ability to counter misinformation from traditional fund managers, says rich lister Graham Tuckwell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3159%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1367%2C$y_143/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e958c99595d1cfd2671f7750098ad458ff0e0a4b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
