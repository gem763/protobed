In the interview I spoke about how people view refugees and peoples attitude to color in general. With the article they published a large photo saying it was me. But it was of another black girl,\" she wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nThe model said that the error was \"unacceptable and inexcusable under any circumstances,\" and that she felt that her \"entire race has been disrespected.\"\n\n\"It goes to show that people are very ignorant and narrowminded that they think every black girl or African people looks the same,\" she said. \"I feel as though this would've not happened to a white model.\"\n\nModel Adut Akech presents a creation during the Alberta Ferretti women's Fall/Winter 2019/2020 collection fashion show, on February 20, 2019 in Milan.

Born in South Sudan, she's a former child refugee who spent the first eight years of her life in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp before migrating to Australia. She has been a guest editor of CNN Style, commissioning stories around the theme of family.\n\nAdut Akech: 'The word family has evolved'\n\nToday, Akech is one of the most in-demand models in fashion, regularly walking for brands including Chanel, Valentino and Givenchy and starring on the covers of a number of high profile magazines, including the Italian, Korean and British editions of Vogue.\n\nAustralian supermodel Adut Akech poses for photos at the Melbourne City Baths after it was announced Akech would be the Melbourne Fashion Week 2019 ambassador.

We are extremely disappointed that a photo of one of our campaign models, Flavia Lazarus, was mistakenly printed instead of a photo of Adut.\"\n\n\"Both Adut and Flavia have expressed their disappointment and we support them. This error is unacceptable, and both Who Magazine and our public relations agency, opr, have apologized,\" the post read.", "description": "Who Magazine, an Australian weekly entertainment publication, has mistakenly published the image of a different black model, Flavia Lazarus, in its Adut Akech article.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190211182938-adut-akech-headshot-3-super-tease.jpg"}
