At least ex-wife Linda has forgiven him\n\nRichard Thompson is drinking mint tea in a Hampstead coffee shop \u2013 he doesn\u2019t touch coffee or alcohol \u2013 and between Islam and cricket, he\u2019s discussing the remarkable guest list for his upcoming 70th birthday celebration at the Royal Albert Hall in London. \u201cI don\u2019t like being the centre of attention, strange as it sounds,\u201d he insists. \u201cI just want to have a few friends over.\u201d\n\nThe man the LA Times once hailed as \u201cthe finest rock songwriter after Dylan\u201d and \u201cthe best electric guitarist since Hendrix\u201d will switch between electric and acoustic guitars, and hopes that \u201cmost guests will have time to do a couple of songs\u201d. The 15 guests will include Pink Floyd hero David Gilmour, who has featured alongside Richard in a Rolling Stone magazine best ever guitarist list, and who, as a soloist, covered Richard\u2019s 1975 song Dimming of the Day. \u201cHe\u2019ll do that,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd then do something of his \u2026 or Floyd\u2019s. He has always been a nice guy and we share a love of all things Fender.\u201d\n\nThe cast will also include old and new British folk heroes, from Martin and Eliza Carthy to Olivia Chaney. And then there will be Harry Shearer, the American actor and comedian, reviving his role as Derek Smalls from Spinal Tap, along with his wife Judith Owen who joined Richard in 2006 for the 1,000 Years of Popular Music project, in which they reworked anything from Sumer Is Icumen In to Britney Spears.\n\nRichard Thompson may be a virtuoso guitarist, but he insists that it\u2019s the songs that are most important to him. \u201cMost of what I do revolves around the song. If I play guitar, I\u2019m not interested in playing instrumentals. I like playing guitar to accompany a voice, or if there is a solo, then extending the narrative of the song.\u201d So are his thrilling, spontaneous-sounding acoustic or electric guitar solos inspired by the song? \u201cYes, it\u2019s that way round. Absolutely.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Remarkable output \u2026 Richard Thompson. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nFor more than 50 years, his songwriting output has been remarkable, from the gently bleak and lyrical ballads that are performed regularly in folk clubs (where some listeners probably think they are traditional) through to equally bleak, upbeat favourites like Tear-Stained Letter or the pounding, edgy and emotional stories of foreboding on his latest electric album, 13 Rivers.\n\nIt\u2019s a set filled with religious imagery, \u201cbecause I love the King James Bible, a beautiful piece of poetry, and you have to speak to people in a language that\u2019s familiar\u201d. And it was written, he says, \u201cin a difficult personal time\u201d. Last year, after the ending of his second marriage, to Nancy Covey, he quit California to move to New Jersey, home of his new partner, singer-songwriter and author Zara Phillips. But he insists that the album is not autobiographical. \u201cI have no perspective on what I am doing. I write a song and think, \u2018Where does this come from?\u2019 Me? I wrote this? I write fiction \u2026 I\u2019m just enjoying myself, throwing lines together. I think it always reflects your own experience and feelings, but it isn\u2019t always in a way that\u2019s clear. If you find something honest enough in yourself then it will be universal.\u201d\n\nBut The Storm Won\u2019t Come \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s a smell of death where I lay my head\u2026\u201d \u2013 is surely about his divorce? \u201cBut you\u2019ve also got Trump in the White House, so maybe there\u2019s a little bit of that in there as well.\u201d And Her Love Was Meant For Me, isn\u2019t that straightforward? \u201cIt\u2019s a song I find very confusing, actually.\u201d\n\nRichard insists that the Albert Hall show won\u2019t be a retrospective, but it will certainly be nostalgic. Another guest will be Hugh Cornwell, of Stranglers fame, who played with Richard in his first band, Emil & the Detectives, when they were both 14 and pupils at William Ellis school near Hampstead Heath. Then there will Simon Nicol and Ashley Hutchings, who along with Richard were the core trio in different teenage bands who evolved into the first Fairport Convention. They will be joined by Dave Mattacks, the drummer who joined Fairport a little later, alongside the late Sandy Denny, to record Liege and Lief, the classic album released 50 years ago that kickstarted British folk-rock. \u201cWe might dip our toe into that repertoire,\u201d says Richard. \u201cAnd someone is going to do a bit of Sandy.\u201d\n\nSo how did he feel about that era now? \u201cWe thought that if we are in the charts and it\u2019s taken seriously, it could change peoples\u2019 attitudes to British music and you might have people stopping using American accents when singing. It was totally revolutionary at the time. Rock music with an element of British traditional music in it was pretty much our innovation, and I\u2019m very proud of that. And when people in other countries saw we did, it was possible for them to contemporise their own cultures.\u201d\n\nAfter the Fairports, Richard recorded a serious of glorious, mostly bleak albums with his first wife Linda Thompson, a powerful, evocative singer whose career has been marred by dysphonia, a larynx disorder that makes it increasingly difficult for her to sing. She\u2019ll also be there, along with their musical children, singer-songwriter and producer Teddy Thompson and Kami Thompson, who works with her husband, the Pretenders guitarist James Walbourne, in the Rails. And to complete the family line-up there will Richard\u2019s new partner Zara Phillips.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The band that kickstarted folk-rock \u2026 Fairport Convention, with Richard Thompson in the box.

And I like Zara. And Richard has changed has a lot. He is much nicer and he\u2019s happy \u2013 so that\u2019s great\u201d.\n\nIt was during his marriage to Linda that Richard discovered Islam. The son of a Scottish policeman, he was brought up as a Presbyterian \u201cwhich I was not interested in. I became a Muslim when I was 23 and have been one ever since.\u201d He discovered Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, after visiting \u201ca very old esoteric bookshop, Watkins in Covent Garden, and started reading about it\u201d. On the cover of their 1975 album Pour Down Like Silver, he and Linda are dressed in turban and headscarf, and for the next three years the couple disappeared from the music scene to spend much of their time in Islamic communities in London and then Norfolk. \u201cAnd it was a community, not a commune,\u201d said Richard. \u201cCommune implies sharing out the carrots!\u201d\n\nLinda hated it. \u201cSufism had appealed to me, but the guy who ran it was bit of a tyrant. There was lots of praying and guilt, and women were so subservient.\u201d Richard, who was attracted to Sufism by \u201cthe nobility of being \u2026 it seemed like the way human being should be,\u201d agreed that it wasn\u2019t ideal. \u201cIt was full of human foibles. People are lustful, jealous, God knows what. But then we visited a sheikh in Morocco and saw the other side of it. And it was all wonderful.\u201d\n\nBy 1982 the marriage was at an end, but the deserved success of the Shoot Out the Lights album led to an infamous US tour. \u201cI was living on booze and antidepressants,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI was so angry I was kicking and hitting Richard on stage. I trashed a dressing room, stole a car and got arrested. But it was good for my voice. I guess because I was so heartbroken it freed me up. The dysphonia wasn\u2019t too bad in those days. At the end of the tour Richard rang and said: \u2018Bruce Springsteen is male singer of the year and you are female singer of the year.\u2019 Was it in Time or Rolling Stone? I think both. Like everything, good comes out of bad.\u201d\n\nSo has she forgiven him? \u201cI have. It was a bad time but \u2013 Jesus Christ \u2013 it was 40 years ago. Forget it!\u201d But she is \u201ckind of dreading the Albert Hall\u201d because \u201cas a performer you\u2019d love to get up and wow the crowd, but I never know what will come out of my mouth. But I\u2019ll do something. It\u2019s going to be good.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Richard and Linda Thompson in 1975. Photograph: Rex\n\nAfter the split, Richard moved to California, remarried, and relaunched his career. \u201cAt aged 33, when I started singing solo, they treated me as a new artist and put me on college radio. So my audience in the States was 10 years younger than me, and it still is. And very, very slowly I did well. It was word of mouth. I toured America relentlessly, and I still do, and it\u2019s still growing, which is amazing. Without having a hit record, more people come to shows now than they ever did.\u201d As for the move to the east coast, \u201cI was ready for a change. But being a performing musician I do 100 shows a year, and I\u2019m away 150 days, so where you are based is less important.\u201d\n\nDoes he have problems as a Muslim living in the States in the Trump era? \u201cTrump has ramped up bigotry considerably. If you are not a white Christian, the implication is that you\u2019re not a real American. It\u2019s incredibly destructive, divisive, and harmful. We\u2019ll see how it plays out \u2013 but the fact is that you still have more religious freedom in America or Britain than you do in a whole lot of Middle Eastern countries.\u201d\n\nThompson is a cricket enthusiast \u2013 he cheerfully recalls his appearance on Test Match Special five years ago, singing 1952 Vincent Black Lightning \u2013 and he insists he \u201cnever wanted to be culturally absorbed by America. I can contribute more having a culturally British point of view.\u201d Even in the midwest, he can still knock them for six.\n\n\u2022 Richard Thompson: 70th Birthday Celebration is at Royal Albert Hall, London, Monday 30 September.", "description": "The master of British folk music has weathered a second divorce and lives in the US where \u2018Trump has ramped up bigotry considerably\u2019.
