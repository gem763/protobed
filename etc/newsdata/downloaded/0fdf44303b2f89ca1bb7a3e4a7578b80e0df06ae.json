Times. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how dependent you are on power.\u201d\n\nPG&E was able to restore power to much of Northern California after workers inspected power lines to make sure they were safe and weren\u2019t likely to spark fires. The utility said it found 30 instances of weather-related damage to its equipment during the shutdown.\n\nBy Friday evening, PG&E said it had restored power to 97 percent of the 738,000 homes and businesses affected by the deliberate blackout that began Wednesday. Those sites represented about 2 million power-using people, it said.\n\nAbout 21,000 customers remained without power. Safety inspections of utility lines and other equipment were expected to resume Saturday morning, the company said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a little thing. You don\u2019t realize how dependent you are on power.\u201d \u2014 Crystal Markytan, director of social services, Lake County, Calif.\n\nSome people in the largely rural Butte, Plumas and Yuba counties and in Northern California's wine country counties were in their third day without electricity.\n\nButte County is where a fire started by PG&E equipment last year decimated the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. It\u2019s also home to the highest percentage of medically vulnerable utility customers in the state, the Desert Sun of Palm Springs reported.\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES RAGE ON, KILLING 2 AND SPARKING WIDESPREAD EVACUATIONS OF 100,000 RESIDENTS\n\nShelby Boston, director of employment and social services for Butte County, praised the county\u2019s preparation work for the outages, telling the newspaper only two people had called in recent days for assistance with finding an alternative power supply or a need to relocate.\n\nDialysis patients posed a special concern in many areas. In one PG&E service area, three DaVita KidneyCare centers had closed and three others were running on generators because of the power shutoffs, according to the Desert Sun \u2013 meaning many patients needed to make alternative plans.\n\n\u201cEven just going to a different place than you\u2019re used to, or not having the supplies or climate control you\u2019d like in your home can be very stressful for patients,\u201d Wendy Aranda, a renal dietitian for DaVita based in Thousand Oaks, told the newspaper.\n\n\u201cEven just going to a different place than you\u2019re used to, or not having the supplies or climate control you\u2019d like in your home can be very stressful for patients.\u201d \u2014 Wendy Aranda, renal dietitian, Thousand Oaks, Calif.\n\nPG&E faced hostility and second-guessing over the shut-offs, which prompted runs on supplies like coolers and generators and forced institutions to shut down.\n\nRyan Fisher, a partner in consumer goods and retail practice at global consultancy A.T. Kearney, estimated $100 million in $200 million in fresh food was likely lost because of the outages along with $30 million a day in consumer spending.\n\nPG&E cast the blackouts as a matter of public safety to prevent the kind of blazes that have killed scores of people over the past couple of years, destroyed thousands of homes, and ran up tens of billions of dollars in claims that drove the company into bankruptcy.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe utility suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77 mph (122 kph) raked some hilltops where wildfire risk was extremely high.\n\nUtility CEO Bill Johnson promised if future wind events require similar shut-offs, the utility will \"do better\" at communicating with customers. It's unacceptable that its website crashed, maps were inconsistent and call centers were overloaded, Johnson said.\n\n\"We were not adequately prepared,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "In many communities hit by California's fire and electricity crises, vulnerable residents were grappling with issues such as disrupted health-related routines or the loss of costly perishable foods.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio", "Tara Drolma", "California Resident Using A Wheelchair", "Heart Monitor", "Crystal Markytan", "Director Of Social Services", "Lake County", "Wendy Aranda", "Renal Dietitian", "Thousand Oaks"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19284415208013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
