Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) have proposed new legislation to move 90 percent of federal agency jobs out of Washington, D.C. The \u201cHIRE\u201d bill aims to move jobs into the heartland and economically-distressed regions throughout the country.\n\nJust one day prior to the bill\u2019s release, Hawley received backlash from mainstream media outlets for defending the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s decision to move two sub-agencies to Kansas City, Missouri. Hawley was berated from insults ranging from \u201cphony\u201d to anti-Semitic.\n\nThe Washington Post penned an article titled, \u201cThe White House didn\u2019t like my agency\u2019s research. So it sent us to Missouri.\u201d Hawley tweeted disdain for the article, which described moving to Missouri as a \u201cpunishment.\u201d Now, Hawley wants to \u201cpunish\u201d more federal agencies by proposing the HIRE bill.\n\nThe legislation aims to move the following agencies to the following states:\n\nDepartment of Agriculture \u2013 Missouri Department of Education \u2013 Tennessee Department of Commerce \u2013 Pennsylvania Department of Energy \u2013 Kentucky Health and Human Services \u2013 Indiana Housing and Urban Development \u2013 Ohio Department of the Interior \u2013 New Mexico Department of Labor \u2013 West Virginia Department of Transportation \u2013 Michigan Veterans Affairs \u2013 South Carolina\n\n\u201cMoving agencies outside of Washington, D.C. both boosts local economies and lowers costs \u2014 that\u2019s a winning combination. This legislation would enable Americans across the country to have greater access to good jobs,\u201d said Blackburn.\n\nThe goal to save money long-term and increase the longevity of federal employees go hand-in-hand. The HIRE bill claims that when cost of living is low and federal salaries are high relative to the region, employees will stay longer, but to achieve that goal, agencies must leave the high-priced Washington, D.C. area.\n\nHawley also wants to create better access for non-coastal Americans to high-paying federal jobs through the HIRE bill. He says moving agencies to \u201ceconomically distressed\u201d areas would benefit Americans at-large as they have more opportunities to enter high-paying jobs in more than one location.\n\nResearch shows that federal employees earn 17 percent more than their private-sector counterparts on average, plus much better job protections such that it\u2019s almost impossible to fire a federal employee. These senators\u2019 solution might be to spread overpaid, underaccountable employees around the country, but a better one for taxpayers would be to stop overpaying federal workers and make them accountable for their work just like everyone else.", "description": "Sen.
