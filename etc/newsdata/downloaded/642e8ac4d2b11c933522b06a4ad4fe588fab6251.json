He was released by the Raiders on Saturday and agreed to a one-year deal with the Patriots that same day.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown practiced with New England for the first time.", "description": "The  New England Patriots  are reportedly expecting to have  Antonio Brown  on the field Sunday against the  Miami Dolphins ...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/955/hi-res-8c070443a92f2e3ba939b851f270370a_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
