Some of it, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cActually it was more than racism. I thought it was personal \u2013 attacking someone you don\u2019t know, attacking her.\u201d\n\nEnninful\u2019s appointment came after British Vogue faced scrutiny for not being diverse enough. After it was announced that he would be taking over from Alexandra Shulman, who had been editor of the publication for 25 years, Naomi Campbell posted a photograph of Shulman\u2019s editorial team on Instagram and pointed out that there were no black people in the picture.\n\n\u201cThis is the staff photo of @britishvogue under the previous editor #AlexandraSchulman\u201d, the supermodel wrote. \u201cLooking forward to an inclusive and diverse staff now that @edward_enninful is the editor\u2026 let\u2019s hear your thoughts?\u201d.\n\nIn the Guardian interview, Enninful explained how greater representation drives his vision for British Vogue, whose recent cover stars include Rihanna, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Halima Aden, who was the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of the title.\n\nRead more\n\nMeghan Markle reveals one caveat about guest-editing Vogue\n\n\u201cMy work always involves documenting what\u2019s around me, and to keep normalising the marginalised,\u201d Enninful said.\n\n\u201cEvery month I can put my hand on my heart and say it\u2019s all there: the black woman, the curvy woman, the Asian woman. We don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about previous criticisms about Vogue\u2019s lack of diversity, Enninful said it \u201creally bothered\u201d him that the publication was seen in this way.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t [Vogue] be for everyone?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t a woman who is black, or Muslim, or gay, or a refugee, or plus-size, see themselves reflected in what we do? Our job is simple: to keep moving the needle.\u201d", "description": "Edward Enninful has spoken out about the criticism aimed at the Duchess of Sussex following the publication of the September issue of British Vogue, which she guest edited.In August, it was revealed the two had collaborated on the special edition of the magazine, which featured a grid of 15 women selected", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pc4pptbi7XlS7026qQSfCQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/15a31cef992f6dab007d78ef4587066b", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
