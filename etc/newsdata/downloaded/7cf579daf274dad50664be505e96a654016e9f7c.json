When I was young, my great-aunt Ethel told frightful tales of Hurricane Hazel\u2019s 1954 destruction of the Carolina coast. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo upended my life by destroying my home in Surfside Beach, north of Charleston. Two years ago, I gasped as the tides from Hurricane Irma casually carried a foot of marsh into my house while sweeping tons of my yard out to sea. And last year, while covering Hurricane Florence for The New York Times, I spent many tense hours among people who were in the process of losing everything.\n\nSo why do I choose to live in this slowly drowning port city? Why endure the annual stress of possibly losing everything? Why constantly check computer models before frantically hauling everything inside, boarding up, driving for safety and then waiting for interminable hours while glued to The Weather Channel?\n\nBecause the ocean is my family\u2019s life and my livelihood. My wife grew up in Dana Point, Calif., with the Pacific in her backyard and saltwater in her veins. I grew up in Atlanta but had the great fortune of spending my summers along this Carolina coast \u2014 sailing, fishing and, eventually, having my life taken over by surfing.\n\nIt sounds clich\u00e9, but when your entire life comes to revolve around the ocean, it becomes almost impossible to imagine living any other way. You come to define life not by the hours on the clock, but by the ebb and flow of the tides and the rhythm of the winds and swells. You become deeply enmeshed in a culture of shrimpers, crabbers, divers and surfers. You watch your kids come to revere the ocean and respect its moods and its power. You manage to make a living writing about the ocean. You catch a perfect wave from a hurricane-spawned groundswell at your local break.", "description": "Florida largely escaped the Category 3 storm unscathed, but now storm surge warnings have been extended as far north as Virginia.", "authors": ["Richard Fausset"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/us/05dorian-updates01/05dorian-updates01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
