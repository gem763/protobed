The poll was conducted between the 23 and 25 of October.\n\n(Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party holds a 16-point lead over the opposition Labour Party ahead of a parliamentary vote on Monday on whether to hold a snap general election, according to an Opinium poll.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
