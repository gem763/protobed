China denied making that request.\n\n\"I saw that in the news and I specifically checked that with the competent authority. The answer is, the Chinese government has never raised such demands,\" Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry, said Friday according to a transcript posted on the ministry website.\n\n\"Silver is making every effort to portray himself as a defender of free speech and is using so-called 'freedom of speech' to cover for Morey, who voiced support for violent elements in Hong Kong,\" CCTV said, in a translation by CNBC.\n\nAn NBA spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe exchange is the latest in continued fallout over Morey's tweet. While the NBA is extremely popular in China, the tweet has sparked a deluge of criticism as well as steep financial consequences for the league in the world's second-largest economy. CCTV's comments come after it previously suspended broadcast arrangements for the NBA's preseason games in China.\n\nSilver said at the Time 100 Summit event in New York last Thursday the NBA has already suffered \"substantial\" losses as Chinese businesses distance themselves from the league.\n\n\"I don't know where we go from here,\" Silver said at the summit. \"The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nThe controversy underscores the difficulty American companies face when they want to do business within China's massive economy, but can't run the risk of saying anything that will upset the country's government.\n\nIn an Oct. 8 statement, Silver defended Morey's right to free speech, adding \"values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so.\"\n\nCNBC's Jabari Young, Saheli Roy Choudhury and Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.", "description": "\"To cater to the taste of certain American politicians,\" CCTV alleges Silver has \"fabricated lies out of thin air\" and attempted to portray China as unforgiving.", "authors": ["Huileng Tan", "Jabari Young"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174259-1570708084024nba.jpg?v=1571619944", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
