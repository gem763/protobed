Upon further investigation, Vulture discovered Gillis has a long history of using such language in his podcast and stand-up routines, and Gillis proceeded to offer an apology \u201cto anyone actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d Now, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang \u2014 whom Gillis referred to as a racial slur on his podcast earlier this year \u2014 is personally reaching out to Gillis in the hopes of discussing his comedic material.\n\n\u201cShane, I prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn\u2019t take cheap shots. But I\u2019m happy to sit down and talk with you if you\u2019d like,\u201d Yang wrote. \u201cFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human.\u201d\n\nShane - I prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn\u2019t take cheap shots.

I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you\u2019re going to find a lot of bad misses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d SNL has yet to comment on whether Gillis\u2019s past remarks will affect his employment.", "description": "Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is showing support for Shane Gillis after his controversial SNL hire.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/24/14-shane.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
