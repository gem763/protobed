Today, it was also blocked by a federal judge \u2013 a month before it was scheduled to take effect.\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday blocked Alabama\u2019s near-total abortion ban that would have made it illegal for a doctor to perform or attempt an abortion during any stage of pregnancy. [\u2026] The near-total abortion ban bill was designed to challenge more than 40 years of federal abortion protections under Roe v. Wade. The law, which would have called for a sentence of 10 years to life in prison for the abortion provider with no exceptions for rape or incest, was the strictest of several anti-abortion measures enacted this year.\n\nOne of the things that makes Alabama\u2019s measure extraordinary is its radical simplicity: it simply bans all abortions, at every stage of pregnancy. Women who can prove that a pregnancy puts their lives at risk can get an abortion, but no one else will be legally eligible.\n\nAs Rachel noted on the show in the spring, \u201cRape victims and incest victims \u2013 even juveniles \u2013 as of this bill just passed by the Alabama legislature tonight, they will be forced to give birth against their will, along with any other woman in the state who ends up pregnant by any other means.\u201d\n\nPretty much everyone involved in the fight expected today\u2019s outcome for the simple reason that Roe v. Wade is still the existing legal precedent. That said, after Donald Trump and Senate Republicans put Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Supreme Court, and the balance of power shifted even further to the right, conservative lawmakers, including those in Alabama, believed it was time to start pushing the legal envelope.\n\nIndeed, one of the Alabama lawmakers who helped sponsor the state\u2019s radical law told NBC News several months ago, \u201cThis bill\u2019s purpose is to hopefully get to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nOf course, the strategy is not without risk.\n\nEven radical TV preacher Pat Robertson said several months ago he believes Alabama had \u201cgone too far\u201d by approving \u201can extreme law.\u201d\n\nIn context, Robertson, a longtime opponent of abortion rights, seemed to be making a tactical argument. \u201cThey want to challenge Roe v. Wade, but my humble view is that this is not the case that we want to bring to the Supreme Court because I think this will lose,\u201d he added.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s White House has nevertheless celebrated Alabama\u2019s measure, issuing a statement earlier this year cheering the abortion ban and insisting that Democrats support \u201callowing a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments after birth.\u201d (Perhaps realizing that this doesn\u2019t make physiological sense, the statement was amended to say, \u201cripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments from birth.\u201d)\n\nThis is, incidentally, the same Alabama policy crafted by a Republican state senator who argued \u2013 in all seriousness \u2013 that rape victims could still get abortions under his policy, just so long as they don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant.\n\nI don\u2019t imagine the lawyers defending the law will take this bewildering defense to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is where this case is now headed.", "description": "Alabama's abortion law effectively bans all abortions, at every stage of pregnancy.
