LAZY ASS UNORIGINAL,\u201d Oh tweeted.\n\nAn \u201cSNL\u201d spokesperson said Monday, four days after Gillis was announced as a new cast member, that he would not be joining the show when its new season premieres later this month.\n\nThe decision followed freelance comedy writer Seth Simons\u2019 tweets on Thursday featuring clips from a 2018 podcast co-hosted by Gillis. Gillis used racist slurs, including calling people of Chinese descent \u201cfucking chinks,\u201d and mocked Asian accents on the show.\n\nOther reporters later pointed out more examples of problematic remarks by Gillis, who also referred to comedians who have spoken openly about mental health as \u201cwhite faggot comics,\u201d and ranked comedians using their race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nOh, in a subsequent tweet, questioned \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d vetting process, wondering how Gillis was hired in the first place.\n\nShe went on to congratulate other new cast members, Chloe Fineman and \u201cSNL\u201d writer Bowen Yang. Yang played North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a sketch with Oh when she hosted \u201cSNL\u201d earlier this year, which inadvertently highlighted the show\u2019s dearth of Asian performers.\n\nNBC via Getty Images SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- \"Sandra Oh\" Episode 1762 -- Pictured: (l-r) Host Sandra Oh as a North Korean Interpreter and Beck Bennett as Vladimir Putin during the \"Kremlin Meeting\" sketch on Saturday, March 30, 2019 -- (Photo by: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nYang\u2019s promotion makes him the show\u2019s first Chinese American cast member, and one of only a handful of Asian and LGBTQ comedians to join \u201cSNL,\u201d which has run for more than four decades.\n\nOh was only the third Asian woman ever to host the show when she appeared in March. \u201cSNL\u201d has long been criticized for a lack of diversity and inclusion.", "description": "The \"Killing Eve\" star and former \"SNL\" host said she was \"glad to see\" the show's new hire dismissed for his racist and homophobic slurs.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80f6a32300005805562664.jpeg?cache=nm2zkhzuc1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
