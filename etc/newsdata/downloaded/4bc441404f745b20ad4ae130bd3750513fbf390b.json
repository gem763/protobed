(We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.)\u201d\n\nSo they corroborated the fact that Stier made the allegation to the FBI, but the authors give no indication that they have corroborated any details of the alleged incident.\n\nThe book isn\u2019t released until Tuesday, but Mollie Hemingway got a copy, and she writes on Twitter: \u201cThe book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event.\u201d Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory.\n\nIf you take this confusing accusation in the essay at face value, it doesn\u2019t even appear to be an allegation of assault against Kavanaugh.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Nationalreview.Com The-New-York-Times-Anti-Kavanaugh-Bombshell-Is-Actually-A-Dud"], "top_image": ""}
