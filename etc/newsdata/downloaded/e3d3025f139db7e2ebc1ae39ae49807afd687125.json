Casual Friday togs have taken over neighboring weekdays. Ties are turning tail.\n\nThe armed forces were among the holdouts, but the last lines of defense are crumbling. Never mind beards. The U.K. army now allows tattoos on hands and the backs of necks, a street fashion that can still raise eyebrows in some offices.\n\nArmed forces, traditional bastions of male virility, have wrestled with how much they need to reflect societies they protect, such as whether to allow gay enlistees or women in combat roles. Western militaries of late have been pressed to allow facial hair on religious grounds, which the RAF already permitted.\n\nEdward Birch Reynardson, a British army officer during the Crimean War in 1855.

It\u2019s no free-for-all: The beards must be uniform\u2014no longer than 25 mm, about an inch. Airmen can only have full beards with mustache; no goatee, Vandyke or mutton chops. And a commanding officer must grant permission to grow.\n\nThe beard ban end has drawn volleys of derision on internet chat sites used by service members. \u201cMan buns next?\u201d one conversation was titled.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Should the Goat Major be allowed a goatee? Join the conversation below.\n\nTraditionalists say shaving is as much a part of the military as saluting and marching. Anyone who can\u2019t suffer a bit of personal sacrifice probably doesn\u2019t belong in uniform, one military officer said.\n\nHirsute supporters counter with British military history. Soldiers returned victorious in 1856 from the Crimean War with long, bushy beards grown to protect against the cold and wind. Beards became de rigueur, \u201csymbols of the heroic male,\u201d according to Alun Withey, senior lecturer at the U.K.\u2019s University of Exeter and an expert on the history of facial hair.\n\nA mustache requirement was eventually written into the King\u2019s Regulations for the army, leaving a bare upper lip grounds for a court-martial.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the fashion pendulum swung. Lt. Gen. Nevil Macready, a senior British army officer, recalled in his memoirs how an officer complained that a mustache would hinder his postwar career in acting.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, after their wedding last year in Windsor, England.

Macready got a shave. \u201cI was only too glad to be rid of the unsightly bristles to which I had for years been condemned by obedience to regulations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFashion has again tipped in the bearded back and forth. A 2017 survey by U.K. pollster YouGov found that 61% of men ages 18 to 39 had some facial hair, compared with 43% in 2011.\n\nThomas Coney, a 27-year-old former British army engineer, said he quit in 2017, in part, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to wear a beard. \u201cI was taking back my own freedom,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Coney, who now sports a long beard and runs an online bookstore, said rules on tattoos were overlooked, but \u201cbeards have been persecuted.\u201d\n\nCanada last year welcomed beards in its armed forces, saying \u201cgreater control over personal appearance enhances organizational morale.\u201d\n\nA German court this year fired back at the trend of relaxing appearance standards. It rejected a complaint from a Goth soldier over rules that permit only women to wear their hair long. The trooper had argued the practice discriminated against men.\n\nWhile forbidding beards, the Royal Marines and RAF have long allowed mustaches, a style liberty that caused a dust-up with allies in Afghanistan.\n\nPrince Charles stands with the Goat Major and Shenkin the goat, regimental mascot of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Wales in 1998.

American airmen aren\u2019t allowed facial hair stretching below the top lip, the Brit successfully argued that he was subject only to the Queen\u2019s Regulations. [The King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s regulations are identical, and the name used depends only on who is monarch.]\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Royal Navy allows beards, in the tradition of legendary seafarers. Still, it keeps a strict code. \u201cDesigner stubble,\u201d less than 25 mm, and \u201chipster beards\u201d are out. If there is any doubt, according to the Queen\u2019s Regulations, commanders \u201cdefine an acceptable appearance of a beard, as much depends on the features of the individual.\u201d\n\nThe British army appears disinclined to change, though there are exceptions beyond religious and health reasons. Prince Harry, a former army officer no longer in the service, wore both a beard and his old uniform at his wedding.\n\nThe British army allows beards for handful of ranks that carry ceremonial roles, including pioneer sergeants. Historically, they performed ironwork and were allowed a beard to protect their faces from the heat of forges. They still parade in bushy beards, toting axes.\n\nThe same privilege is afforded Goat Majors, who are assigned to tend a regimental mascot. Nature cut short one serviceman\u2019s tenure, Mr. Hill recalled. The major couldn\u2019t grow a decent beard.\n\nWrite to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com", "description": "British airmen can begin growing full beards, but fastidious objectors believe a clean face says. \u2018I am now shaved, and I am ready for war.\u2019", "authors": ["James Marson"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106281/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
