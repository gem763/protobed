I'm not,\" self-described democratic socialist Mr Sanders told ABC on Sunday.\n\nBoth Mr Sanders and Ms Warren favour an NHS-style free healthcare for Americans.\n\nBut unlike Mr Sanders, Ms Warren has repeatedly avoided saying whether her proposal would raise taxes on working Americans families.\n\nMs Warren has recently been under attack from Republicans about whether she was actually forced from her teaching job because of pregnancy half a century ago.\n\nCritics have claimed there are inconsistencies in her story.\n\nMs Warren has previously apologised for a widely ridiculed claim of Native American heritage.\n\nWho will take on Trump in 2020?\n\nElection day is still more than a year away but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr Trump is already well under way.\n\nJoe Biden and Bernie Sanders have thrown their hats into the ring, but most of the other candidates are relatively unknown outside the Washington DC bubble.\n\nFind out more about the contenders.", "description": "Joe Biden is under siege, Bernie Sanders is recovering from a heart attack, and Elizabeth Warren may face new scrutiny.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0D05/production/_109233330_dems_976getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
