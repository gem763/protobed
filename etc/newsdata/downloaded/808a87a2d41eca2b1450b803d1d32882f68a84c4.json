Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer said earlier this month that it would be a priority for U.S. Senate Democrats in their new session, which started on Monday.\n\nHong Kong returned to China from British rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina has accused foreign powers, especially the United States and Britain, of fueling the unrest.\n\nThe latest protests, often involving violent clashes with police, have roiled Hong Kong for more than three months. Millions of people have taken to the city's streets, even shutting down its airport for two days. Demonstrators' demands include an independent inquiry into what they describe as police brutality and universal suffrage.\n\nChina is eager to quell the protests before the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The nation has not involved its military in efforts to quash the protests.\n\nWong said the Hong Kong people would keep fighting for their cause through the anniversary.\n\n\"We will continue our protest with our course on free elections,\" he said. \"I see no reason for us to give up and it's time for the world to stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Gabriella Borter; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said on Saturday he was seeking the support of U.S. lawmakers for the demands of his fellow protesters who have led months of streets demonstrations, including a call for free elections.
