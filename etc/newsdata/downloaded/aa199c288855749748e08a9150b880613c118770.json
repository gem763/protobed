In the middle of the prime minister\u2019s opening speech to Parliament, a Tory MP walked across the room to join the Liberal Democrats, wiping out the Conservatives\u2019 one-seat coalition majority.\n\nThis is the moment Boris Johnson lost his working majority in UK Parliament.

The election that Johnson wants, most likely, but \u2026\n\nBoris Johnson has lost his majority in the Commons after the Tory MP Dr Phillip Lee crossed the floor to sit with the Liberal Democrats. It came after the leading Tory rebel Philip Hammond confirmed he would vote for legislation designed to block a no-deal Brexit and claimed \u201cthere will be enough people for us to get this over the line today\u201d. No 10 officials have indicated Boris Johnson will call a general election for 14 October if he loses today\u2019s crunch vote. Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cLabour wants to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and to have a general election\u201d.\n\nLee\u2019s defection makes the passage of a bill forcing a three-month delay in a no-deal Brexit more likely. Johnson warned earlier, though, that any such bill would be viewed by his government as a confidence vote. Johnson told the press that he\u2019d call elections before \u201ccutting the legs out from under\u201d his negotiators, whom he claimed were making progress in getting the EU to cut a deal:\n\nThe UK could be heading for an election as the high-stakes political chess over #Brexit seemingly enters its endgame.

After reforms passed several years ago, snap elections require parliamentary supermajorities. It\u2019s possible that Johnson\u2019s opposition could organize to deprive him of a majority and attempt to form their own government instead. That\u2019s not a likely scenario, but perhaps still a possible strategy:\n\nIn the eye of the Brexit maelstrom, it was unclear if opposition parties would support a move to call an election \u2013 which requires the support of two-thirds of the 650-seat House of Commons. \u2026 As Johnson played Brexit chess with lawmakers, opponents cast his tactics as undemocratic, including an order to suspend parliament for more than a month beginning next week. That has been followed by his threat to kick rebels out of the ruling party, including ministers who left the cabinet just weeks ago. \u201cI think we will have the numbers,\u201d one of the rebels, Conservative former finance minister Philip Hammond, said. \u201cPrime Minister Johnson has always intended that there will be an election.\u201d The rebel alliance will put forward an emergency motion for a vote on Tuesday allowing its members to seize control of the parliamentary agenda the following day to try to pass legislation that would force Johnson to seek a three-month delay to Britain\u2019s EU exit. Johnson raised the stakes, however, effectively turning it into a confidence vote by making clear that if the government were defeated, it would hold a vote on Wednesday to approve an early election, most likely to be held on Oct. 14.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that an anti-Boris coalition could form that excludes Jeremy Corbyn from leadership, but only if Corbyn himself assures people that he won\u2019t claim the PM job. It would still be a miserable affair, with many Leavers justifiably angry over a last-minute parliamentary block to their project and others divided between Theresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement or rejecting Brexit altogether. That kind of Frankenstein-monster coalition would be dead before it ever got moving. It would only accelerate the need for elections and might make Johnson even more popular in comparison.\n\nIn the meantime, Johnson now has a new problem \u2014 running a minority government. That will impact his ability to negotiate with the EU too, as they may decide to wait out an election before making any concessions that may not later be necessary. Perhaps sensing this, Johnson finally RSVP\u2019d back to Dublin today to answer an invitation extended by Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar some time ago:\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin next Monday, Independent.ie understands. Sources in Dublin said they are \u201cvery happy\u201d that Mr Johnson has finally taken up an invitation issued by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The Prime Minister confirmed his intention to discuss Brexit with face-to-face with the Taoiseach during a rowdy debate in the House of Commons.\n\nIf Johnson\u2019s going to pull an Irish-border solution rabbit out of his hat, this is the time to do it. If he takes the Tories into an election without a comprehensive solution to that issue, that elephant trap might work out differently than he plans.", "description": "Elephant trap?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/johnson-majority-cnn.png"}
