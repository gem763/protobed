The five-part \u201cstory time\u201d account was certainly unflattering: Regalbuto made it clear to her viewers that she felt duped and used by Riff Raff.\n\nBut the comments that streamed in revealed that many of those watching had zeroed in on a more disturbing aspect of the relationship: Regalbuto was just 17 and still in high school when she says that she first hooked up with the hip-hop star, who was almost twice her age.\n\nIt was not the first time the 37-year-old EDM, trap and hip-hop star had been accused of pursuing girls under the age of 18. At least one other woman has accused Riff Raff of making unwanted advances on her as a teenager, and two others have accused him of rape. But Regalbuto\u2019s videos brought the issue to the surface once again.\n\n\u201cI mainly posted my one video just to get things off my chest\u2026 but it blew up overnight,\u201d Regalbuto told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear other girls saying the same story, it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s also relieving, because it\u2019s good to feel that you\u2019re not alone in a situation like this,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a statement, Riff Raff\u2019s lawyer said he \u201ccategorically denies these baseless allegations of a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old.\u201d The artist, whose real name is Horst Simco, has previously denied all other allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nRegalbuto says she barely knew who Riff Raff was the day he approached her at the Warped Tour in 2015. In fact, she says, she was trying to sneak a peek of her favorite band, Sleeping with Sirens, when she noticed the rapper sizing her up. He eventually sent her his number through Twitter, and the two wound up spending the rest of the day on his bus.\n\nHer friend, Alex Accorsi, told The Daily Beast she recalled Regalbuto messaging with the artist that day at the Warped Tour, and remembered dropping her off at his tour bus. She says it was hours later that Regalbuto returned to the group and reported that she and Riff Raff had just hung out.\n\nRegalbuto says she told Riff Raff she was a teenager, though her fake ID listed her as 23.\n\n\u201cIt was on my Instagram bio, it was on my Twitter bio\u2014it was very obvious that I was 17,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I was literally in high school still!\u201d\n\nAccording to her account, the rapper told her it didn\u2019t matter. He wanted to see her again.\n\nThat\u2019s how the Philadelphia native found herself in New Jersey later that summer, meeting Riff Raff at another Warped Tour appearance. Weeks after that, she says, he offered to fly her out to Las Vegas. Excited and more than a little surprised by the attention, she agreed. She told her parents she was going to the Jersey Shore for the weekend, and hopped on a plane.\n\nAccorsi told The Daily Beast she remembers Regalbuto talking about the New Jersey tour stop and the trip to Las Vegas. Another friend, Rachel Hess, said she got a FaceTime call from Regalbuto and Riff Raff the day she arrived in Nevada.\n\n\u201cI remember at first I was like, \u2018That\u2019s so cool.\u2019 But after a while I was like, \u2018Well he\u2019s this old and she\u2019s this old\u2026 That\u2019s not normal,\u2019\u201d Hess said.\n\n\u201cI got really worried after a while; I would text her all the time like, \u2018Let me know if you\u2019re OK,\u2019\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nIt was at the New Jersey tour stop that Regalbuto says she and Riff Raff first had sex. (The age of consent in New Jersey and Nevada is 16, and Regalbuto is not accusing Riff Raff of criminal misconduct.) She says she didn\u2019t have much sexual experience at the time, but was swayed by his compliments and promises that she was the only woman in his life\u2014statements she now refers to as a \u201cconstant manipulation.\u201d Both Accorsi and Hess remember her discussing the sexual encounter when she came back.\n\n\u201cIt was really creepy,\u201d Regalbuto said. \u201cIt was consensual, but when I look back on it, I wish I didn\u2019t consent to it, because I was more groomed into thinking it was OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know better,\u201d she added. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking that way. It\u2019s easy to groom someone at a young age. And then especially when you have that kind of platform on you\u2014it\u2019s foolproof, to do it to a young woman.\"\n\nLast year, a second woman accused Riff Raff of making unwanted sexual advances on her at the same 2015 Warped Tour, less than a month after Regabulto says she met the rapper. That woman, Milwaukee native Kelsey Doucette, was also 17 at the time.\n\nDoucette told Jezebel that Riff Raff approached her at a meet-and-greet and offered her his number. Later, she says, a member of his crew invited her into the tour bus, where Riff Raff took her into a back room and began to kiss her and grope her, despite her protestations.\n\n\u201cI was really freaked out at the time,\u201d Doucette told Jezebel at the time. \u201cWhen I was 17 I never really heard stories about rape or whatever but I would always hear stories of like, oh my god, this girl got with this DJ or this girl got with this famous artist or whatever and that was so cool. And I thought oh god, this is not cool right now, this is very weird. This is something I don\u2019t want to be in, I don\u2019t know why people talk about these things being so great. I was genuinely scared.\u201d\n\nDoucette\u2019s allegations followed accusations from a woman in Australia, who claimed the rapper had drugged and raped her after a concert in 2013.\n\nEliza Stafford, who was 19 at the time, said in a Facebook post that she was invited backstage during one of Riff Raff\u2019s shows. When she arrived, she says, someone in the rapper\u2019s entourage offered her a shot that caused her to black out. She claims that she awoke to Riff Raff \u201cpulling out of me and getting into the shower.\u201d\n\nRiff Raff denied these allegations in clips from a short film he called \u201cTrial by Media,\u201d in which he appears in aviator sunglasses and a cowboy hat and brags about his sexual exploits, while denying all allegations of impropriety.\n\n\u201cNever once have I forced a girl to have sex,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cNever once have I forced a girl to do any type of drugs. I don't wanna have a girl drunk and sleepy.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, another woman claimed the rapper sexually assaulted her. The woman\u2014referred to in court documents as \u201cJane Doe\u201d\u2014claims Riff Raff confiscated money she\u2019d earned working at the Bunny Ranch brothel and refused to give it back unless she slept with him, according to court filings obtained by Pitchfork.\n\nLocal police ultimately closed their criminal investigation into the woman\u2019s complaints without bringing charges, citing a lack of evidence, conflicting witness testimony, and the accuser\u2019s \u201cunbelievable and ever-changing accounts.\u201d The civil suit she filed in Nevada district court, however, is still pending.\n\nIn court filings, Riff Raff\u2019s legal team said the artist was \u201cbeing targeted because [Jane Doe] believes him to be a wealthy public figure.\u201d In a statement to The Daily Beast, his attorney pointed to a police interview with a witness who denied anything untoward happened that night.\n\n\u201cMr. Simco and his representatives take allegations of sexual misconduct very seriously,\u201d the attorney, Rob Garson, said. \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s false allegations in this case are unfortunate and unfairly diminish the ability of true victims to report crimes and pursue meritorious claims against actual assailants.\u201d\n\nUnlike the other accusers, Regalbuto stayed close with Riff Raff long after their initial encounter. She says she met up with him regularly on his \u201cPeach Panther\u201d album tour around the East Coast in 2016, attending his concerts in Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. She provided The Daily Beast with text messages and screenshots of her conversations with the rapper dating back to 2016.\n\nFor four years, she says, Riff Raff enticed her with promises of romantic dates and everlasting love, even while parading around with other women or ignoring her at shows. Looking back, she thinks her young age contributed to how easily she bought the lies.\n\n\u201cWhen I was rewatching my videos I was thinking to myself, \u2018It was so obvious that I was not the only one,\u2019\u201d said said. \u201cBut from the beginning, I never forgot about what he said to me at those Warped Tours [in 2015].\u201d\n\nNow a senior in college hoping to pursue a career in international law, Regalbuto says she understands that the relationship suffered from a severe imbalance of power. She says she last spoke to the rapper two months ago, when she was in Florida and he offered to Uber her to his house. She turned him down.\n\nRegalbuto says she spoke out on Tik Tok in order to help other women avoid making her same mistakes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that I was able to move on from it and be better from it and grow from it,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are in these kind of situations and they\u2019re stuck in it and it\u2019s hard for them to get out. I just don\u2019t want it to happen to anyone else.\u201d", "description": "The hip-hop star denies allegations lodged by a woman in a Tik Tok video this week.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568434618/190913-shugerman-riff-raff-tease_upew3p", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
