(Photo by Steven Branscombe/Getty Images)\n\nA former Michigan State staffer suing the university, Spartans coach Mark Dantonio and others for wrongful termination said in a deposition filed Thursday that an assistant coach once told Dantonio that he wouldn\u2019t want his daughter on the same campus as Auston Robertson during Robertson\u2019s recruitment.\n\nRobertson was sentenced to up to 10 years in jail in December after he agreed to aplea deal after raping a woman in April 2017 at an off campus apartment. He signed with Michigan State after he entered a diversionary program for inappropriately touching a female classmate in high school. He was also accused of rape while in high school.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDantonio released a statement when Robertson signed with the school ahead of the 2016 season that Robertson\u2019s acceptance into the school\u2019s recruiting class was \u201cevaluated over the last three months while utilizing all resources available to us to thoroughly review his situation.\u201d\n\nPer Curtis Blackwell, the team\u2019s former recruiting director, one of the people against signing Robertson was defensive tackles coach Ron Burton.\n\n\u201cAnd, well, so the way that I really knew that it was sexual, when Ron Burton looked at me,\u201d Blackwell said in a deposition about high school accusations against Robertson. \u201cI mean, what he said to Coach Dantonio and Dave, like, I have a daughter on that campus and I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with Auston Robertson being on campus with my daughter. And so that\u2019s when I knew, you know, like man, it was fairly serious.\u201d\n\nHe added that the fact that Burton would be Robertson\u2019s position coach made the input carry more weight.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI knew it was very serious if he didn\u2019t want, because that\u2019s his coach. And he\u2019s a d-lineman and he would be coaching him, so and Auston Robertson was a special athlete that Dantonio wanted. So for Ron Burton to say that it was that bad that he didn\u2019t want his daughter around him, I knew he had some real serious sexual issues.\u201d\n\nA Michigan State spokesperson told ESPN that the school didn\u2019t have any comment regarding Blackwell\u2019s deposition. Blackwell said that Dantonio and Robertson had weekly meetings together while Robertson was a member of the football team. He was dismissed after the charges against him were filed.\n\nDantonio responds Friday\n\nDantonio said the day after Blackwell\u2019s deposition was filed that Robertson had nothing to do with Blackwell\u2019s contract not being renewed at the school.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Mr. Blackwell\u2019s contract was not renewed has nothing to do with Auston Robertson,\u201d a statement from Dantonio Friday afternoon said. \u201cTwo years ago, I spoke at length about Auston Robertson when he was dismissed from the team in 2017. Rather than engage in a public argument with a former staffer, I refer you to those previous statements. Further, there have been multiple investigations into the program\u2019s handling of sexual assaults, including Jones Day in 2017 and the NCAA in 2018, and they concluded that the program and myself committed no violations. With regard to Mr. Blackwell\u2019s lawsuit, because the litigation is ongoing, I have no further comment on this matter and refer all questions to my counsel.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Dantonio\u2019s statement in full from 2017 after Robertson was dismissed from the team.\n\nMark Dantonio\u2019s April 21, 2017 statement dismissing Auston Robertson from the MSU football program. https://t.co/EGpSw7Bg0P \u2014 Chris Solari (@chrissolari) September 20, 2019\n\nBlackwell was suspended in February 2017\n\nBlackwell was suspended over two years ago after the school said he interfered with a sexual assault investigation into multiple players. The school then said in May of 2017 that his contract wouldn\u2019t be renewed. Then-Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis told Blackwell in a letter that his contract wasn\u2019t being renewed because of \u201cseveral allegations.\u201d\n\nAn external investigation determined that Blackwell didn\u2019t comply with school regulations regarding sexual misconduct. Not long after the investigation\u2019s findings were released, third-degree criminal sexual conduct charges were filed against Donnie Corley, Josh King and Demetric Vance.\n\nThe external investigation cleared Dantonio of wrongdoing and said Dantonio followed school protocol and reported an allegation to the Title IX office as soon as he found out about it. According to Blackwell\u2019s testimony, he said Dantonio reported an allegation when informed by Robertson. He added that he didn\u2019t feel he had to \u201cre-report\u201d what he believed Dantonio reported.\n\nBlackwell also said that he felt like he had become a scapegoat in the aftermath of the players\u2019 sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cI got blamed,\u201d Blackwell said in his deposition. \u201cIt became Curtis Blackwell\u2019s decision to bring Auston Robertson on campus, when we all know the head coach made the decision to bring him on. He overrode everyone else in order to bring him on campus.\u201d\n\nBlackwell\u2019s attorneys filed the motion Thursday in an attempt to compel Dantonio to testify. In the filing, his attorneys say they want Dantonio to be deposed before depositions for Hollis and former Michigan State president Lou Anna K. Simon are done.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Robertson, dismissed from the team in April 2017, was sentenced to up to 10 years in jail on rape charges in December.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pISA0gMGWKozr43o7nQaXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QeTwkjwO7oYiTgFch.naiQ--~B/aD0xOTk3O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/43fd1680-db2a-11e9-af3c-b0df4a9ca255", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
