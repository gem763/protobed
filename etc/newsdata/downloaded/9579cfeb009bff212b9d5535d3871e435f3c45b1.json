Their aim was to reach the home of Moise, who has been implicated in allegations of corruption and embezzlement of public funds.\n\nThe embattled president has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSome of the protesters burned tires in the streets while others chanted \"Out with Jovenel\" in creole. Sound trucks blasted music with anti-government lyrics.\n\n\"We are in misery and we are starving,\" said one protester, Claude Jean. \"We cannot stand it anymore.\"\n\n\"We ask (Moise) to resign so that we have a new Haiti ... because we suffer too much in this country.\"\n\nMoise this week announced the formation of a commission to find a way of lifting the poorest country in the Americas out of its current crisis, but government critics said it was too late for dialogue and he must resign.", "description": "Journalist's killing fuels ire of Haiti protesters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/wires/05/29/08/86/1000x563_journalists-killing-fuels-ire-of-haiti-protesters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
