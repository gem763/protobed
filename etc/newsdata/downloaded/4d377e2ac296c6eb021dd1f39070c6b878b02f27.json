It's been an absolute blast, an eye-opener not just for the estimated half-million traveling fans from 19 other competing countries but also for the Japanese people who have been such courteous and polite hosts.\n\nThere was the scene of 15,000 people turning up to watch Wales' first practice session of the tournament. Some arrived three hours before practice, lining up for more than a kilometer outside Kitakyushu Stadium.\n\nHow about Oita, the land of hot springs in the most southwestern of Japan's main islands and a place that could never be described as a rugby hotbed, welcoming fans of France, England, Wales and Australia for one memorable quarterfinal weekend? Locals, merely passing by pubs and bars, joined in the revelry, some being lifted up like they were second-row forwards in a lineout.\n\nFrom Fukuroi to Fukuoka, from Kamaishi to Kumamoto, lasting memories have been made in this 6\u00bd-week tournament that has been 10 years in the planning but will draw to a close Saturday when England plays South Africa in the final.\n\nSo when the World Cup circus leaves town, what will be left behind? How does Japan sustain the rugby fever?\n\n\"I have a little worry, yes,\" former Japan rugby captain Toshiaki Hirose told The Associated Press. \"Four years ago, we beat South Africa in the World Cup and a lot of Japanese people watched it. Now, I think Japanese people understand rugby as well, and respect the passion.\n\n\"I think there is an environment where kids want to start playing rugby but we should have this environment more, not just in the cities but also in the countryside.\"\n\nRugby lags behind baseball, soccer and others in the list of the most popular sports here. There are 92,000 registered rugby players \u2014 a 10th of the number in soccer \u2014 and there is a participation rate among teenagers of 1.5%, according to the most recent white paper on sport in Japan . Rugby tied ninth among the most popular spectator sports in Japan and didn't feature in the top 10 of most popular sports watched on TV.\n\nThe country has a 16-team domestic league which is a corporate and mostly amateur competition featuring a growing number of well-paid foreign stars and Japan internationals. Only five Top League games in the entirety of last season attracted a crowd of more than 5,000 spectators.\n\nJapan has had a team, the Tokyo-based Sunwolves, playing in the leading southern-hemisphere provincial competition \u2014 Super Rugby \u2014 since 2015 against rivals from New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina. But they are about to be disbanded, leading to much uncertainty about their future.\n\nMeanwhile, at grassroots level, Hirose says most kids can only choose one sport in which to specialize at school \u2014 and invariably that's baseball or soccer. There is also a shortage of age-group facilities, top-class coaches and even grass fields, says Musgrave.\n\n\"You have to be careful,\" says Andrew Fielder, a 41-year-old IT worker who is a friend of Musgrave and also an expat in Tokyo. \"Children need to have quality instructors otherwise they could hurt themselves. I would be worried. You'd want to be sure they have the right level of instruction, certification.\"\n\nMusgrave and his 6-year-old son, Hugo, went along with Fielder and his 5-year-old son, Theon, to a Rugby Introduction Day staged by the Japan Rugby Football Union and World Cup sponsor Land Rover to encourage a younger generation to play the game in the wake of Japan's unprecedented run to the quarterfinals.\n\nAmong the superstar ex-players running the event were England World Cup winners Jonny Wilkinson and Lawrence Dallaglio, who have gone around Japan during the World Cup in their role as TV pundits and ambassadors and seen first-hand the fanatical support for the Brave Blossoms.\n\n\"It was only a couple of World Cups ago that they were losing by large scores,\" Dallaglio said, likely recalling the 83-7 loss to New Zealand in 2011, which came after the 91-3 defeat to Australia in 2007. \"What they've done in the last eight years is phenomenal, so if they can continue that development ... the next generation hopefully will have been inspired by their heroes that they've witnessed out on the field.\"\n\nJapan, a so-called Tier Two rugby nation, rarely gets to play the sport's top teams like the All Blacks and England outside of World Cups. Wilkinson says it is \"imperative\" that changes, with Dallaglio suggesting they could even enter the major southern or northern hemisphere international competitions.\n\n\"They need to continue to introduce them to quality opposition,\" Wilkinson said in a message to rugby's powerbrokers, \"... and come to understand when you play against quality opposition, it gives an insight into where you need to be but also what you are already capable of.\"\n\nOther issues facing Japan is the possibility of its head coach, New Zealander Jamie Joseph, leaving and stalwart players like captain Michael Leitch and Luke Thompson potentially having played in their last World Cup. A new generation of players needs to come through, without that carrot of a World Cup on home soil that has inspired the current crop.\n\nHirose doesn't want this past six weeks to go to waste. He has been around Japan, teaching kids the national anthems of the competing teams because it is a \"good opportunity for us to understand other countries' cultures.\" He has seen the Japanese people take the Brave Blossoms to their hearts \u2014 \"they like their courage and discipline\" \u2014 and enjoy mixing with foreigners before and after games, \"drinking, chatting, singing.\"\n\nThey've witnessed visiting fans paint the Japanese flag \u2014 the \"Hinomaru\" \u2014 on their faces, and wear bandanas decked with the red-and-white colors of Japan.\n\nWorld Rugby, the sport's governing body, says its legacy programs have introduced 1.8 million people in Asia to the sport, a million of them from Japan. They have to keep that going to sustain a genuine Asian presence in the sport.\n\n\"One of the reasons we came to Asia,\" World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont says, \"was to actually leave a legacy. What we have to do is carry on working with them so when you come back in two years' time, the people are talking about (Brave) Blossoms and not about baseball.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
