Climate Action Summit a Failure", "language": "en", "text": "Greta Thunberg joined a large crowd of young people skipping school in Iowa City, Iowa for a climate change protest on Friday, where she declared the recent United Nation\u2019s action summit on climate change a flop.\n\nThe summit, which ran in conjunction with the U.N.\u2019s annual General Assembly meeting, featured Thunberg and other youth speakers.\n\n\u201cWe told world leaders to act on the science,\u201d Thunberg, 16, said at the protest inspired by the Fridays for Future school walkout she started a little over a year ago in her homeland Sweden. \u201cAnd we demanded a safe future for us and for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they didn\u2019t listen,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cAs we all know, the U.N. climate action summit was a failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was, unfortunately, what we had expected,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nThunberg said world leaders are \u201cuncomfortable\u201d standing behind the \u201cscience.\u201d\n\nThunberg opened her remarks at the event, where one speaker said that ending climate change would require \u201centire societal upheaval,\u201d by stating that the protest was taking place on \u201cindigenous Iowa land.\u201d\n\nShe said that some seven million people in 180 countries joined the recent \u201cglobal climate strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is something that you can\u2019t continue to ignore,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nShe told the crowd that giving up on their fight \u201cis simply not an option\u201d and chided world leaders for \u201cacting like children.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone needs to be the adult in the room,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nShe said the protests will probably continue for \u201cyears,\u201d despite the fact that Thunberg and other climate change activists, including many in the United States Congress, have said only 11 years remain before irreversible catastrophe.\n\nThunberg gained international attention in August when she traveled from Europe to New York City on a racing yacht to avoid making a \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d by flying across the Atlantic.\n\nCritics pointed out that the boat\u2019s crew flying back and forth made an even larger carbon footprint and that the boat itself was made from fossil fuel-based products.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Thunberg, who is taking months off from school to protest climate change in North and South America, got to Iowa. It is known that, after the failed U.N. event, she traveled to Canada for a protest in an electric vehicle owned by former actor and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThunberg told the crowd that if adults didn\u2019t do something to end climate change, young people would.\n\n\u201cChange is coming whether they like it or not,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC", "description": "Greta Thunberg joined an Iowa City, Iowa climate change protest, declaring the recent United Nation\u2019s action summit on climate change a flop.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Greta-Thunberg-Walks-Off-Stage-Summit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
