And that is exactly what he did,' she wrote.\n\n'He was not physically violent, and without the physical evidence of his abuse, I had nothing I could prove during our family law \u00adproceedings. He was intelligent and well spoken, presented well \u2026 I felt pressured to give in. He simply used the family law system as part of his control and manipulation of me.\n\n'That my daughter Eeva is not here today is a direct result of the failings of the system \u2026 These are failings which impact on families like mine every day.'\n\nMichelle Dorendahl (pictured) has opened up about how she was emotionally abused by her partner in the years before their separation\n\nHutchings had custody of Eeva for Christmas break in 2013 and the two had spent the holidays with his mother in Pottsville\n\nMs Dorendahl has joined representative's form the Women's Legal Services Queensland calling for the Federal Circuit Court to operate as a lower level of the Family Court and hear cases involving domestic violence and such threats.\n\nHer letter will be included as evidence in the proposal, which will be presented this week.\n\nThe couple had separated in 2011, when Eeva was two years old, and had entered into a parenting plan in which Hutchings would have his daughter once a week and extra days depending.\n\nHutchings had custody of Eeva for Christmas break in 2013 and the two had spent the holidays with his mother in Pottsville.\n\nAn inquest has revealed Eeva Dorendahl died 'as a result of her father's actions'\n\nMs Dorendahl was expected to pick up her daughter on January 9 and had been communicating with her estranged partner in the days leading up to their disappearance.\n\nThe coronial inquest report described the messages between the parents as 'polite' and giving 'no indication that [Hutchings] was an immediate danger to Eeva or himself.'\n\nThree days before Eeva was to be handed over, Ms Dorendahl, who was pregnant at the time, had emailed her estranged partner asking about the handover arrangements.\n\n'Hi Greg, Please advise me what time you will be arriving at Nambour station with Eeva. Thanks, Michelle,' the email read.\n\nTIMELINE OF EEVA AND GREG'S DEATHS December 23, 2013 Eeva Dorendahl's mother Michelle leaves her with her father Greg Hutchings at Nambour rain Station for Christmas break January 8, 2014 Michelle emails Greg asking about pick up arrangements for Eeva January 9-10, 2014 Greg sends Michelle a string of 'polite' text messages explaining he is sick and will be unable to hand over Eeva. He stresses their daughter is 'fine and happy' January 11, 2014 Michelle arranges to pick up Eeva at Greg's house but he tells her they will be at a nearby river next to a park. Police begin searching for Eeva after her concerned mother reports her missing when neither are there January 28, 2014 Police find Eeva and Hutchings' bodies badly decomposed in sand dunes north of Pottsville March 26, 2019 Coronial inquest finds Greg likely killed daughter Eeva before taking his own life in an apparent murder-suicide\n\nHutchings replied the following day saying he had been up sick and could not do nine hours of public transport so offered Ms Dorendahl to pick her up.\n\nThe next day, Hutchings sent a follow up email explaining he was still sick, but offered Ms Dorendahl the chance to pick up her daughter a day early.\n\nMs Dorendahl Skyped with her daughter that day. She had no idea it would be the final time she saw her alive.\n\nWhen the day of the handover finally came, Hutchings informed Ms Dorendahl that he was still feeling unwell but told her she could pick up Eeva any time.\n\nMs Dorendahl replied that morning saying she would arrive to collect her at around 1.30pm, but later received a text message from Hutchings during her journey over that he would be taking Eeva to the park.\n\n'Taken Eeva to the river mouth next to the park at Postville (sic). Call when you get here if you don't see us,' he said.\n\nMs Dorendahl arrived at Pottsville around 1.45pm and called Hutchings but received no answer.\n\nShe waited and searched the area for about an hour before going to Hutchings' house where his mum told her neither he nor Eeva were home.\n\nDorendahl went to Kingscliff Police station to report a 'custody issue' and explained her daughter's father had failed to return Eeva.\n\nPolice did not immediately consider it a missing person case but began to search for the pair that day.\n\nWhen they interviewed Hutchings' mum Diana, she told officers that her son suffered from depression and was taking medication.\n\nShe later disclosed that he had suffered a 'mental breakdown over a relationship' about five to six years earlier.\n\nFurther investigation revealed Hutchings' long history with depression as well as the fact that he had attempted suicide on three separate occasions.\n\nEvidence also showed the tumultuous relationship between Hutchings and Ms Dorendahl.\n\nHe had reportedly been concerned over her plans to take Eeva to Finland, where she grew up, and tried to prevent them from travelling by taking his daughter's passport weeks before the trip in 2011.\n\nEeva's mother, Michelle Dorendahl was expected to pick up her daughter (pictured) on January 11 and had been communicating with her estranged partner in the days leading up to their disappearance\n\nDuring an interview with police, Hutchings' sister Sheri Hutchings said she had spoken to her brother weeks earlier and he had told her 'that he did not want to give Eeva back.'\n\nMs Dorendahl later told police that it was possible Hutchings might want to kill his Eeva because he knew it 'would destroy' her.\n\nHutchings' and Eeva's bodies were found on January 28, 2014, approximately 1.1 km from where Hutchings lived.\n\nPolice said Eeva's body did not show any 'obvious signs of wounds or injuries,' but suspected she could've been smothered or poisoned, since Hutchings' medication was found at the scene.\n\n'This might have taken the form of deliberate smothering, manual strangulation or drug toxicity from an unknown substance. Blunt or sharp force injury such as from stabbing or bludgeoning causing death could be excluded based on an absence of...other evidence in clothing,' the report states.\n\nAn autopsy listed Hutchings' cause of death as a 'presumed drug overdose.'\n\nLifeline - 13 11 14", "description": "Greg Hutchings, 35, and daughter Eeva Dorendahl were reported missing on January 11, 2014 after the father failed to return the girl to her mother earlier that day.
