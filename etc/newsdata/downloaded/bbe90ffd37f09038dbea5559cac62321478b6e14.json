The officers didn\u2019t find the gun they were looking for, but they arrested Napier for fare evasion, charging him with theft of services for hopping over a turnstile.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how an arrest in NYC goes down. The guy has made absolutely no indication that he would flee or fight and wasn\u2019t trying to hide.\n\n\n\nIf you can\u2019t see, the reason everyone moved was because all the police had taken out their guns and aimed at him. pic.twitter.com/dAstrtMntz \u2014 Elad Nehorai (@PopChassid) October 25, 2019\n\nThe tense encounter was caught on film by another passenger on the 4 train, who posted the video on Twitter where it has been viewed more than 3 million times since Friday evening.\n\n\u201cAfter that one policeman took his gun out, two or three more took them out,\u201d Elad Nehorai, 35, who shared the video, told The Washington Post early Monday. \u201cFor a moment, they were kind of pointing guns at everyone who was in that vicinity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFormer housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, a Democratic presidential hopeful, criticized the officers for responding with guns to a man who was ultimately charged with stealing a one-stop ride on public transportation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOfficers should be working to deescalate \u2014 not putting dozens of lives at risk over $2.75,\u201d Castro said on Twitter.\n\nThis man didn\u2019t pay his subway fare\u2014but is tackled by at least ten officers in a crowded station.\n\n\n\nOfficers should be working to deescalate\u2014not putting dozens of lives at risk over $2.75.\n\npic.twitter.com/JCbY4L5AIi \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 27, 2019\n\nThe New York Police Department said in a statement shared with The Post early Monday that a witness near Atlantic and Flatbush avenues in Brooklyn told officers that Napier had a gun around 4:40 p.m. Friday. Officers first tried to approach the 19-year-old a short time later, NYPD said, but he fled into the Pacific Street subway station. Napier allegedly slipped past the turnstile and boarded a southbound train. At least 10 officers were waiting at the Franklin Avenue station when the train pulled in.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOfficers at the Franklin Avenue station located and identified the individual inside of the train and took him into custody without incident,\u201d NYPD said in a statement. \u201cThe individual was arrested for not paying the fare and was charged with Theft of Service.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNYPD did not immediately return a request for information about its training or protocols for making arrests inside subway trains.\n\nThe NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates allegations of police misconduct, contacted Nehorai on Sunday and told him how to file a complaint against the NYPD officers.\n\n\u201cThe CCRB takes allegations of police misconduct seriously,\u201d the independent oversight agency said in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nOther passengers on the train were visibly shaken by the arrest. Several people shouted warnings about the officers\u2019 guns. Others flinched at the sight of the barrels. Within a minute of stopping in the station, everyone else had moved from the center of the car to the edges, leaving the 19-year-old alone in the line of fire.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of feeling incredibly concerned for [Napier] and also being aware that we were in danger,\u201d Nehorai told The Post. \u201cIf anything small went wrong, someone could have been hurt.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNehorai, a Crown Heights marketer who organizes a liberal activist group for Orthodox Jews, said he was more afraid of the police than the suspect, even though he initially thought the young man was being arrested for a serious crime.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSomeone mentioned they thought [Napier] was the one who kept us the safest because he didn\u2019t do anything and he was very careful,\u201d Nehorai said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t try to hide, he didn\u2019t try to run.\u201d\n\nOne woman said on Twitter her young sons were riding the train when police pointed their service weapons into the subway car. Yolanda Sangweni said her 10-year-old came home \u201cinconsolable\u201d after seeing the arrest.\n\n\u201cHow do we, as parents, even begin to speak to them about this kind of violence?\u201d she said. \u201cYou see the trauma we\u2019re exposed to at a young age.\u201d\n\nMy sons were in this train car. My 10-year-old came home inconsolable. How do we, as parents, even begin to speak to them about this kind of violence? You see the trauma we\u2019re exposed to at a young age https://t.co/QYWnqRZqXX \u2014 Yolanda Sangweni (@YoliZama) October 26, 2019\n\nPolice critics latched onto the video to slam the plan to hire more fare enforcement-focused police officers and condemned police for escalating the situation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c2 minutes 20 seconds. Of terror,\u201d Scott Hechinger, director of policy at Brooklyn Defender Services, said in a tweet. \u201cAll to arrest a young man sitting down, his hands in the air, doing nothing. This is a militarized police out of control. And they hired 500 more for the subway.\u201d\n\nNew York police were rebuked again by some observers for a violent incident this weekend that was also filmed and posted on social media. NYPD officers appear to brawl with several people after responding to a call about two groups of people fighting on a subway platform. Officers exchanged blows, striking people in the face and tackling them to the ground.\n\n\u201cOfficers responded to a fight between two large groups, during which individuals began to interfere with police action and the situation escalated,\u201d NYPD said in a statement shared with The Post. \u201cPublicly available video does not show the entirety of the incident, and the department is conducting a review.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics argued that the aggressive police actions could have escalated both incidents. There have been 11 fatal shootings by NYPD officers so far this year, including six in the last month.\n\n\u201cIf this is how things go \u2018well\u2019 \u2014 when someone is not killed or hurt \u2014 it\u2019s not a far leap to understand why so many people do get killed, who are innocent or at least not doing anything they should be killed for,\u201d Nehorai said.\n\nAD", "description": "New York pointed their weapons into a crowded subway car, searching for a suspect with a gun.
