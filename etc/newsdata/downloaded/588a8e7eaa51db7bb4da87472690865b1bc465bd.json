In the moving message, he promised his late nan that he would look after his mum.\n\nEastEnders coilleagues such as Max Bowden and Emma Barton \u2013 as well as Dean\u2019s fans \u2013 have been sharing messages of love and support. Along with a picture of Nanny Nancy, Dean wrote: \u2018Normally I wouldn\u2019t divulge information like this on social media, however we celebrate births and marriages but never talk about death. RIP nanny Nancy.. I promise you I will look after mum, love you with all my heart, RIP\u2019 (sic).\n\nThe actor was recently confirmed to have been written out of the soap, with a source citing \u2018a string of bad personal decisions\u2019 as the reason. Dean has recently been sharing his journey in a wellness retreat to help his mental health.\n\nSpeaking from the centre in Spain, 41-year-old Dean explained: \u2018I\u2019m not that guy who goes to the gym all the time so I had to find another way of giving myself a goal, and this retreat was what I like to call \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My health is important. I need to always be aware of that, not just physically but mentally.\u2019\n\nDean\u2019s final EastEnders scenes have already been aired in the show as Robbie was seen receiving the news that his son Sami had been injured so he was forced to rush abroad to visit him. It was after these scenes were on screen that it was confirmed Dean\u2019s contract was not being renewed and he wouldn\u2019t be making further appearances during this stint.\n\nHowever, given that Robbie hasn\u2019t been killed off, the door seems to have been left open for the future.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The actor played Robbie Jackson.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEI_71029049-e1561370352473_1571231309.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
