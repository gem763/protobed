Solis went before a U.S. Magistrate Judge who ordered he be held without bond, pending further hearings and eventual extradition to Indiana.\n\nAccording to the criminal indictment, Solis is described as working for Hugo Hernandez who in turn \u201ccoordinated with individuals in Mexico to distribute drugs in Indianapolis.\u201d A complaint filed after Hernandez\u2019s September arrest revealed the criminal organization not only distributed large quantities of methamphetamines in Indiana, but also in Chicago and other parts of Illinois. Available court documents do not reveal which cartel supplied Hernandez with the narcotics, however, Chicago and Indiana have historically been supplied by the Sinaloa Cartel. New developments indicate an increased presence by Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, Chicago DEA Chief Bob Bell recently told a local TV station.\n\nThe cartel cell would deal primarily in methamphetamine and fake Oxycodone pills laced with Fentanyl and distribute them to various customers throughout their area of operation, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents revealed in their criminal complaint.\n\nIn September, agents arrested Hernandez and another one of his associates, however, Solis managed to avoid capture. It remains unclear how he made his way to South Texas. Court documents revealed that deputy U.S. Marshals arrested him on Monday in McAllen.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
