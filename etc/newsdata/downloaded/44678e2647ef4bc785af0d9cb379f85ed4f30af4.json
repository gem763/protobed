Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 20th September.\n\n1. Fed to Fix the Plumbing?\n\nThe Federal Reserve will conduct another daily repo operation to ease ongoing tension in U.S. funding markets, as Wall Street frets increasingly loudly about a structural lack of liquidity.\n\nNew York Fed President is due to speak at 8:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), and may add more detail to Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s rather vague comments on Wednesday, when the central bank appeared still to be hoping that the problem would resolve itself in a couple of days.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials have already agreed to include on the agenda for next month\u2019s policy meeting a discussion on expanding the Fed\u2019s balance sheet again. It\u2019s still unclear what shape this might take. Elsewhere, , one of the two dissenting hawks at this week's meeting, will also speak at 11:20 AM.\n\n2. Climate Protests Sweep the World\n\nA globally organized day of climate change protests is taking place ahead of the UN General Assembly next week, drawing large crowds in Australia, India, Thailand and elsewhere.\n\nA number of companies and governments have scheduled policy initiatives to coincide with the protests, notably Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), which late Thursday unveiled plans to address its carbon footprint with an order for 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from the startup Rivian. The company had led a $700 million funding round for Rivian earlier this year.\n\nElsewhere, Germany\u2019s federal government is expected to unveil a package of climate-related measures which some are styling as a disguised fiscal stimulus package. It may seem odd to be disguising a fiscal stimulus package, especially when the European Central Bank, OECD and IMF are all calling for one, but the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel still can\u2019t bring itself to abandon a commitment to balanced budgets that has helped it win the last three elections.\n\n3. Wall Street set to open higher\n\nU.S. stock markets are set for another run at new record highs against a backdrop of rising hopes for benign outcomes in the U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\nBy 6 AM ET, were up 70 points or 0.3%, while were also up 0.3% - less than 1% away from their all-time high. were up in line with the industrial bellwethers.\n\nHowever, the bond market is still acting as a brake, with the yield curve flattening again due to the ongoing tightness in funding markets. The Treasury yield is now only 2 basis points above that of the , while both remain firmly below the T-bill rate.\n\n4. Mixed news on trade\n\nTrade talks between mid-level officials from the U.S. and China are reportedly inching forward, aimed at preparing the ground for higher-level negotiations to resume early next month.\n\nThe U.S. administration said Chinese delegates will stay in the U.S. next week to visit farming areas, adding some incremental detail to positive mood music. Even so, the bottom line remains Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s comments Thursday that \u201cit\u2019s more complicated than just buying a few more soybeans.\u201d\n\n5. Sterling surges on Brexit hopes\n\nThe hit a two-month high against the dollar and a four-month high against the euro amid hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided after outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told Sky News that a deal between the EU and the UK is possible.\n\nHowever, here too, there remain some suspicions that hopes are running ahead of reality. The U.K. isn\u2019t likely to present any legally binding proposals to break the deadlock until after the Conservative Party conference at the end of September.\n\nThe U.K. Supreme Court is expected to rule next week on the lawfulness of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament, a move that makes it harder for lawmakers to stop a No-Deal Brexit happening by default.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7J0YN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
