It's so therapeutic and helps me stay positive, grounded and happy.\"\n\nShe won't be quitting anytime soon either, enthusiastically saying: \"I needed to create and focus on myself and I am the best when I'm doing things I enjoy.\"", "description": "The 55 year-old rocked a glitzy gold Stella McCartney gown as she headed into London with daughter Rita to an exclusive Cartier event", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Redferns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712208.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vera.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
