We should eliminate fossil fuels? Fossil fuel is what drove the Industrial Revolution,\" Levin said. \"Fossil fuel is what created assembly lines and a massive middle class and blue-collar workforce, and steel and aluminum, copper, nickel and electricity and lights at night and automobiles and trucks, refrigeration, heat in the winter, air conditioning in the summer, and on and on and on.\"\n\nMARK LEVIN: MAINSTREAM MEDIA DOESN'T 'FOLLOW' THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY 'LEAD' IT\n\n\"These people want to push us to the pre-industrial age. That's what they're arguing for.\"\n\nLevin, who also hosts Fox News' \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" added that liberal Democrats are not the climate experts they often claim to be.\n\n\"They had no information whatsoever about the climate -- none,\" Levin claimed about the Democrats who appeared on CNN. \"They know nothing about the climate.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLevin added that no CNN anchor or journalist on the dais Wednesday was an expert on climate change either.\n\n\"This was a sham, this was a scam, this was a spectacle,\" he said of the network's seven-hour town hall event.\n\nHe concluded: \"This is what you have to look forward to, should the Democrats take the White House and the rest of the government: Deindustrialization, de-growth, economic contraction, unemployment lines, food lines, gasoline lines.\n\n\"This is what they're good at,\" Levin said. \"This is what they know.
