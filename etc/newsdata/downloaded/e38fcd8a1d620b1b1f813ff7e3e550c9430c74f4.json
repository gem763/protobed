These were particulate matter known as PM 10 , which comes from sources including vehicles and waste incineration, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) , and sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), which is released through burning of fossil fuels in power stations and refineries as well as metal extraction.\n\nFor each pollutant the team compared the death rate for babies in the worst fifth of polluted areas with those in the best fifth.\n\nOnce factors such as maternal age, deprivation level for the area and birthweight were taken into account, the team said that babies aged up to one year had a greater chance of dying living in areas with the worst air pollution compared with areas with the cleanest air.\n\nThe results held across all three pollutants, with the odds of death 7% worse for NO 2 , 4% worse for PM 10 and 19% worse for SO 2 . Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO 2 was associated with deaths within a baby\u2019s first 28 days.\n\nThe study was unable to prove whether high levels of air pollution were to blame for the increased risk of death in those areas. It also did not take into account levels of indoor air pollution.\n\nProf Mireille Toledano, an expert in population child health at Imperial College London, said the study confirmed that air pollution is a major public health hazard, adding that current standards are failing to protect people.\n\nShe said the latest study had a number of limitations. It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance \u2013 meaning the babies\u2019 true exposure was not captured.\n\nThe study also did not take into account fluctuations in air pollution with the weather or over seasons, and did not take into account where the mother spent her pregnancy or factors such as maternal smoking. Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for.\n\nUK parents 'worryingly unaware' of damage from air pollution Read more\n\n\u201cIt is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis,\u201d said Toledano.\n\nDr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution \u2013 including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.\n\n\u201cThe evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr Kotecha\u2019s study, which suggests babies born in the UK\u2019s most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government,\u201d she said.\n\nA second study found that exposure to PM 10 from traffic during pregnancy and children\u2019s early life was linked to a slightly lower lung function of the children at eight years old \u2013 although the effect was no longer seen by the time the children were 15.\n\nWood said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs.\n\n\u201cBoth these studies concentrate on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society \u2013 the very young,\u201d she said.", "description": "Infant mortality rate higher in babies exposed to pollutants such as sulphur dioxide", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66552e60f8696ba4aa8b5a856196993728581f8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4d49a73a92f26d8983700d1fe907870", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
