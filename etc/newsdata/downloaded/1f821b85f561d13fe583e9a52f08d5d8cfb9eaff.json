Kamala Harris takes the stage for a campaign stop at Keene State College in Keene, N.H., April 23, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nMost of the field seems to think that Twitter likes and retweets will count as primary votes, and that there\u2019s an appetite for left-wing radicalism.\n\nIn the 1920 presidential election, Warren Harding won in a landslide by promising a \u201cReturn to Normalcy.\u201d Today\u2019s Democrats would be wise to make that same pledge for 2020. They probably won\u2019t, however, which is why President Trump might get re-elected.\n\nHarding\u2019s concept of normalcy has been ridiculed and reviled by progressives and liberal historians for 100 years. Some falsely claim it was merely a call for a return to the isolationism of the prewar years. But Harding wasn\u2019t just tapping into the unpopularity of the First World War; he also spoke to Americans\u2019 worries about the widespread domestic turmoil and tumult of the Progressive Era. Race riots, labor violence, anarchist terror bombings, the Red Scare, Prohibition, widespread censorship, political oppression, and mass arrests were also on voters\u2019 minds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven important and necessary progressive advances \u2014 such as women\u2019s suffrage \u2014 caused disruption. Harding offered voters a breather from the rapid social change.\n\nNothing in the last two years \u2014 or two decades \u2014 approaches the turmoil of the Woodrow Wilson administration, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that a lot of Americans feel like they\u2019ve been through the wringer. That feeling has defined our politics for a long time \u2014 from the Clinton scandals to the Iraq War to the financial crisis and the fights over Obamacare \u2014 bringing us one \u201cchange election\u201d after another. But politicians often seem to miss that the change many voters are looking for is a reversion from the abnormal to the normal.\n\nGiven the roaring economy, with near full employment and rising wages, a normal president would lie back and avoid fueling the unease that has kept Trump from breaking through the 50 percent approval ceiling. But he is clearly incapable of doing that, which creates an opportunity for Democrats to win, despite a healthy economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats seized such an opportunity in the 2018 midterms. The president\u2019s constant trolling of the political and media establishment is music to the ears of his biggest supporters, but it is an unsettling and deafening din to the most important constituency in American politics: the vast, mostly moderate middle.\n\nWhile activist firebrand freshmen (freshpersons?) such as Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) get all the attention from both the liberal and conservative press, most of the Democrats elected in the 2018 landslide were moderates from purplish districts that will decide the 2020 election. They ran on health care and other issues, but also on the promise to be a check on Trump\u2019s \u201cabnormalcy.\u201d Promising to turn down the political temperature, reducing not just the drama of Washington but the centrality of it in our lives and conversations, would still leave lots of room for a Democrat to advance his or her agenda.\n\nRight now, Joe Biden is the only major Democratic presidential contender who seems both interested in and capable of pursuing such a strategy. The rest of the field seems to think that Twitter likes and retweets will count as primary votes, and that there\u2019s an appetite in the country for left-wing radicalism on par with what they see as Trump\u2019s right-wing radicalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than vow to keep the economic boom going while returning Washington to normalcy and enacting reasonable reforms with bipartisan support, they talk about socializing medicine, making slavery reparations, forgiving student loans, banning guns through executive orders, and implementing a Green New Deal. And the media obsess over impeachment.\n\nAll that stuff is super popular with young, college-educated activists and journalists, all of whom are wildly overrepresented on social media.\n\nBut most Democrats belong to what CNN\u2019s Harry Enten calls the \u201chidden Democratic Party.\u201d Enten notes that a majority of Democrats are over the age of 50, at least half call themselves moderate or conservative, and a majority don\u2019t have college degrees. Biden\u2019s lead in the polls is explained almost entirely by his support from older Democrats.\n\nMoreover, many blacks and Latinos \u2014 crucial to the Democratic coalition \u2014 aren\u2019t nearly as \u201cwoke\u201d as progressives often assume they are. They often have a more pragmatic and transactional view of politics, for a slew of reasons. Even Ocasio-Cortez underperformed with blacks and Latinos, defeating the incumbent Democrat by running up tallies from richer and whiter precincts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe college-educated barista socialist constituency dominates in states that the Democrats will win no matter what. But the battleground will be in states that narrowly went for Trump. Biden, a logorrheic and gaffe-prone 76-year-old with a terrible track record in presidential contests, is best positioned to beat Trump, but first he has to survive the death by a thousand tweets that the vocal minority has in store for him.\n\n(C) 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY, LLC", "description": "Most of the field seems to think that Twitter likes and retweets will count as primary votes, and that there\u2019s an appetite for left-wing radicalism.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
