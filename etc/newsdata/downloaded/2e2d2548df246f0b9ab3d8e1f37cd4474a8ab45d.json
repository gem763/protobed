First she has to get the mammoth Go Bubba Go pram ready, which takes 20 minutes. To do this she has to put the stroller up and attach the four individual seats to the front and back of the stroller. She then has to dress each child in their snow suits. Once they are wrapped up she puts each child in the seat and fastens them in.\n\nIt then takes her a further 20 minutes to get the babies into their snow suits and fastened into the stroller before they can leave their home.\n\nBut despite the chore of getting the babies ready, she claimed she 'wouldn't swap them for the world'.\n\nNot only does she had to navigate the weight of the children, but the pushchair also weighs 15kg, a handful for any parent.\n\nShe added:'I only wanted one child and was blessed with four. It's a miracle. They're lovely bundles of joy.'\n\nLast year the babies defied the odds after they had to be delivered by Caesarean section, nine weeks premature.\n\nThey were born at London's University College Hospital, on October 26 last year.\n\nGeorge, identical twins Fredrica and Francesca and Grace now take up around 12 bottles a day.\n\nMrs Britten also has to provide 12 spoon-fed meals and around 28 nappy changed per day while caring for them.", "description": "Tracey Britten has to spend 40 minutes preparing the stroller for outings with the four babies.
