(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons had high hopes for their defense, with several key players were coming back from injuries and head coach Dan Quinn taking over as coordinator.\n\nThose hopes were quickly dashed.\n\nSix games into what is turning into a dismal season, the Falcons (1-5) have one of the NFL\u2019s worst defensive units in virtually every category.\n\nPoints. Total yards. Pass-completion percentage. Third-down conversions. All of it, disappointing.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be where we are,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut this is where we are.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons rank next-to-last in points allowed, surrendering an average of 31 per game. Only the hapless Miami Dolphins are lower at 36 a game.\n\nNo one is less successful when it comes to getting opposing offenses off the field. Atlanta is giving up a staggering 56% conversion rate on third down.\n\nAnd on it goes:\n\n- 30th in opponent completion percentage: 71.4.\n\n- 29th in first downs per game: 23.7.\n\n- 27th in average passing yards: 271.2\n\n- 27th in yards per play: 6.2\n\n- 26th in yards per game: 388.8.\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t playing the best right now,\u201d linebacker De\u2019Vondre Campbell said Thursday, sounding a bit testy. \u201cThe only people who can change it are us.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons had a top 10 defense in 2017, relying heavily on a young, aggressive unit to capture a wild-card spot and reach the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThe defense took a tumble last season, but that could be blamed in part on a devastating rash of injuries that took out three key players up the middle: linebacker Deion Jones and safeties Ricardo Allen and Keanu Neal.\n\nQuinn decided to shake up his coaching staff by appointing three new coordinators - including himself to run the defense. It was a reprise of the role he held at Seattle, where he guided one of the top defenses in NFL history.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t come close to duplicating the success he had with the Seahawks.\n\nWhile Neal went down with another season-ending blow in Week 3, the Falcons can\u2019t really blame injuries for their problems this season.\n\nThis is mostly self-inflicted.\n\nThe issues run the gamut, from a line that rarely makes things uncomfortable for opposing quarterbacks to a secondary that struggles to stay in the same area code with receivers to some truly baffling calls and formations.\n\nThe Falcons have only five sacks - tied with Miami for fewest in the league and a far cry from Carolina\u2019s NFL-leading 27. The two guys who are supposed to provide the bulk of the pressure from the outside, Vic Beasley and Takk McKinley, have combined for just two.\n\nBeasley\u2019s performance is especially troubling. The No. 8 overall pick in 2015 out of Clemson, he was the NFL leader with 15.5 sacks in Year 2, an All-Pro who contributed mightily in Atlanta\u2019s run to the Super Bowl. In 36 games since then, he has managed just 11.5 sacks.\n\nBut Atlanta\u2019s problems can\u2019t be traced to one or two players.\n\nThis is a team effort.\n\nThe secondary has been burned over and over again by quick passes, often within a couple of seconds, before anyone could reasonably expect the pass rushers to make an impact.\n\n\u201cTo be really good on defense, you need to have the whole thing going together,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cIt usually comes down to a combination of things,\u201d\n\nHe called 17 blitzes last week against the Arizona Cardinals in hopes of getting more pressure, but it didn\u2019t have any impact. Rookie quarterback Kyler Murray wasn\u2019t sacked - shoot, he wasn\u2019t even hit. Not surprisingly, he carved up the Falcons for 340 yards and three touchdowns in a 34-33 victory.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t affect the quarterback, the game is really hard,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Falcons face another stiff challenge when the reigning NFC champion Los Angeles Rams (3-3) visit Mercedes-Benz Stadium. While the Jared Goff-led offense has yet to show its full potential, this seems a good week for the Rams to break loose.\n\nFor Atlanta, it\u2019s a chance to finally start living up to those high hopes.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can do,\u201d Campbell said, \u201cis get better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons had high hopes for their defense, with several key players were coming back from injuries and head coach Dan Quinn taking over as coordinator.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/falcons_cardinals_football_18767_c0-125-2997-1873_s1200x700.jpg?cda205ac9bc62309606503f6aa089a998f2cd71a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
