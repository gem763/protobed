(AP) \u2014 The Legislature\u2019s chief economist says Louisiana\u2019s $500 million budget surplus stems mainly from federal tax changes, not a booming economy.\n\nGreg Albrecht told Louisiana\u2019s income forecasting panel Wednesday the better-than-expected tax collections come from personal income and corporate tax collections.\n\nAlbrecht says he\u2019s attributing that excess cash \u201calmost entirely\u201d to the federal tax code rewrite enacted by Congress and championed by President Donald Trump.\n\nLouisiana has tied some of its tax deductions to federal income taxes. A drop in federal tax liabilities under the congressional tax changes means Louisiana taxpayers and businesses owe more to the state.\n\nAlbrecht says tweaking of business tax laws since 2015 also drove a portion of the increased tax collections.\n\nGov.
