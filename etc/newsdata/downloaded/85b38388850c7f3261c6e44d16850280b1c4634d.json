Republican critics and others said he was sacrificing a U.S. ally, the Syrian Kurds, and undermining American credibility.\n\nFahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency\u2019s communications director, called on the international community in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday \u201cto rally\u201d behind Ankara, which he said would also take over the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey aimed to \u201cneutralize\u201d Syrian Kurdish militants in northeast Syria and to \u201cliberate the local population from the yoke of the armed thugs,\u201d Altun wrote.\n\nIn its call for mobilization, the local Kurdish authority known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, also urged the international community to live up to its responsibilities as \u201ca humanitarian catastrophe might befall our people\u201d in the region.\n\n\u201cWe call upon our people, of all ethnic groups, to move toward areas close to the border with Turkey to carry out acts of resistance during this sensitive historical time,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement said the mobilization would last for three days.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, IS militants targeted a post of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, which was once the de facto IS capital at the height of the militants\u2019 power in the region.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF, which is holding thousands of IS fighters in several detention facilities in northeastern Syria, has warned that a Turkish incursion might lead to the resurgence of the extremists. The U.S. allied Kurdish-led force captured the last IS area controlled by the militants in eastern Syria in March.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s attack, IS launched three suicide bombings against Kurdish positions in Raqqa. There was no immediate word on casualties. Raqqa is being Silently Slaughtered, an activist collective that covers news in the northern city, reported an exchange of fire and a blast.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, said the Raqqa attack involved two IS fighters who engaged in a shootout before blowing themselves up.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.", "description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Kurdish-led civilian administration in northeastern Syria issued a \"general mobilization\" call along the Syrian border with Turkey on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/3affbb_turkey-us-syria-58736-in-photo-turkish-border-turkey-syria-in-akcakale-sanliurfa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
