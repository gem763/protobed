I gave a shoutout to those players, who were great in an era without the benefit of groundskeepers, trainers, medical staffs, personal chefs or, in many cases, anything resembling equipment that would provide much more protection than the average jersey.\u201d\n\nBless you, Jeff.\n\nActually, it is amazing how much deference and recognition he has given to so many players who are little more than a fading memory on grainy film. His list includes so many players from bygone eras \u2014 especially the 1970s \u2014 that it raises an intriguing question.\n\nWhere have all the great players gone?\n\nTom Brady, with his six Super Bowl rings and 520 career touchdowns, does top the list at quarterback, and even though he is 42, he is still slinging it for New England. He and kicker Adam Vinatieri are the only two active players who make the list.\n\nLegwold acknowledges debate with a section after each pick that says, \u201cStart the argument with \u2026\u201d Counterpoints to Brady, he writes, might include Johnny Unitas and John Elway.\n\nIn other cases, there is no debate.\n\nWhich brings us to wide receiver Jerry Rice, who led the league in receiving yards six times and receiving touchdowns six times. \u201cStart the argument with no one,\u201d says Legwold.\n\nThe other receiver? Green Bay Packers great Don Hutson, who held 18 NFL records when he retired and had 200 more receptions than his nearest competitor. Hutson\u2019s record of 99 career touchdown receptions stood for almost 40 years after his last game.\n\nThat was in 1945.\n\nRunning back starts and ends with the great Jim Brown, a three-time league MVP who averaged 5.2 yards per carry. He hasn\u2019t played since 1965.\n\nWalter Payton is the other back, and you can start the argument with Barry Sanders and Emmitt Smith, Legwold writes. Payton hasn\u2019t played since 1987.\n\nOn the offensive line, once you get past Cincinnati\u2019s Anthony Munoz at left tackle, who retired in 1992, the rest of the line consists of players who haven\u2019t seen action since 1985 \u2014 New England\u2019s John Hannah (1985) at guard, Raiders center Jim Otto (1974), Baltimore Colts great Jim Parker (1967) at right tackle and Packers seven-time All-Pro Forrest Gregg (1971).\n\nWe get back in the 21st century at tight end with Tony Gonzalez, who retired in 2013 and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame last month. Legwold wrote that you start the argument with John Mackey, who retired in 1972. Personally, I would flip this. Mackey defined the tight end position and averaged a remarkable 15.8 yards per catch in his career.\n\nOn defense, after Reggie White, who stopped playing in 2000, the rest are mostly golden oldies \u2014 Deacon Jones (1974) at the other end, Rams teammate Merlin Olsen (1976) at tackle and next to him is Mean Joe Greene (1981).\n\nThe linebacking crew consists of Lawrence Taylor (1993) and middle linebacker Dick Butkus (1973). The other corner linebacker is something special \u2014 former Kansas City Chiefs great Bobby Bell. I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with players from that era, and they speak about Bell in reverential tones, some insisting he was the greatest athlete they\u2019ve ever seen on a football field. He still holds the NFL record for linebacker touchdown interceptions with six. He is a forgotten man.\n\nNot here.\n\nAll-time cornerbacks are a nod to a more recent era, with Deion Sanders (2005) and Rod Woodson (2003) getting recognition. For safeties, he reverts back to a different time, with Redskins great Ken Houston, who stopped playing in 1980, and Ronnie Lott, who retired in 1994.\n\nSpecial teamers include Vinatieri as the kicker and Oakland\u2019s Ray Guy, who stopped playing in 1986, as the punter. Gale Sayers, the great Bears running back whose career was cut short in 1971 because of a knee injury is the returner. He averaged more than 31 yards per kickoff return in each of his first three years in the league, and in five seasons topped 14 yards per punt return three times.\n\nThe coach? New England\u2019s Bill Belichick, of course. But the argument does include Redskins\u2019 three-time Super Bowl-winning coach Joe Gibbs.\n\nSo according to this list, 17 of the 24 greatest players in league history haven\u2019t worn an NFL uniform in at least 25 years, many longer. The largest group of players is from the 1970s, with six greats ranked as the best to ever play their positions.\n\nMaybe the best of the NFL is in the rearview mirror.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
