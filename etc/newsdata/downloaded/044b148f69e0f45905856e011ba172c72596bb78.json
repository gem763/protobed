We look forward to working together towards delivering India\u2019s vision for clean and green energy,\u201d said Gautam Adani, founder of the mining-to-logistics conglomerate.\n\nThe Indian group has faced fierce criticism over the environmental impact of a huge coal mine scheduled for construction in Australia, with conservationists saying it will increase global warming, threaten local vulnerable species, and damage the Great Barrier Reef.", "description": "Mumbai (AFP) \u2013 Total has agreed to buy a 37.4-percent stake in India\u2019s Adani Gas, the two firms said Monday, with the French giant spending", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/b40be8_total-an-open-offer-adani-gas-shareholders-purchase-up-25-percent-in-equity-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
