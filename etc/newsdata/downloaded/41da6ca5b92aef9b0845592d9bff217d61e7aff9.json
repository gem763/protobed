Sepsis is caused by the immune system overreacting to an infection.\n\nSurgery patients are at higher risk of the life-threatening condition because they are more likely to contact infections after an operation.\n\nThe payroll assistant - whose immune system was already weak because of cancer - was placed into a coma for three days as medics desperately tried to save her life.\n\nMs Gooch - who hasn't been told the breast implants were to blame directly - has since decided to have them removed and instead uses prosthetic breasts.\n\nLiz Gooch, 41, was left fighting for her life when she developed sepsis after a boob job\n\nThe payroll assistant from Pontypridd, south Wales, pictured with her fianc\u00e9, Wayne, was having a breast augmentation after having a double mastectomy due to breast cancer\n\nMs Gooch, who also went through chemotherapy for cancer, said: 'Having sepsis was honestly worse than my cancer diagnosis.\n\n'At least with my cancer diagnosis I felt more prepared and knew what treatment I needed.\n\n'With sepsis it all happened so fast and it was really terrifying. It was really touch and go and my parents were told I only had 24 hours to live.'\n\nMs Gooch was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer three years ago, after finding a lump in her breast.\n\nFollowing chemotherapy at Velindre Cancer Hospital in Cardiff, Ms Gooch had both breasts removed.\n\nAfter going under the knife, Ms Gooch had been really pleased with her new breasts, and said: 'Surgeons said it was one of the best [implant operations] they had ever seen.'\n\nJust one month later, Ms Gooch spent a night shivering and vomiting. Her mother suggested she went to Royal Glamorgan Hospital.\n\nShe had the tell-tale signs of sepsis, a killer illness that also causes rapid breathing, an abnormally high or low temperature, mottled skin and feeling dizzy or faint.\n\nMs Gooch said: 'I had sepsis, E. coli, a chest infection and a bowel infection.' It is not clear where she contracted any of the bugs.\n\nE. coli is most commonly contracted by eating contaminated food, and people who have weakened immune systems are more likely to become ill.\n\nThese people are also at a higher risk of complications from the infection, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.\n\nWithout prompt antibiotic treatment, which should be given within an hour of being diagnosed, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\n\nMs Gooch said sepsis was worse than what she went through for cancer\n\nMs Gooch said she had a chest and bowel infection, believed to have caused sepsis\n\nDoctors said Ms Gooch may only have 24 hours to live, she claims\n\nThere are around 250,000 cases of sepsis every year in the UK, and an estimated 52,000 deaths, according to the UK Sepsis Trust.\n\nMs Gooch said: 'The last thing I can remember is someone saying I needed to be taken into surgery.'\n\nSurgery may be needed to remove sources of infection which are triggering sepsis, such as collections of pus, infected tissues or gangrene, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nMs Gooch said: 'I was in hospital for two weeks and then it took me a further three or four months before I made a full recovery and could go back to work.\n\n'I was very, very lucky.'\n\nAfter making a full recovery, Ms Gooch is now looking forward to marrying to her fianc\u00e9, Wayne, in May next year.\n\nShe is also taking part in Cancer Research UK's 10k night-time walk in Cardiff - and has been chosen as the event's VIP.\n\nMore than 1,200 people have already signed up to the event which will raise money for lifesaving research.\n\nMs Gooch said: 'It's an honour to be sending participants over the start line at Cardiff's Shine event as well as taking part myself.\n\n'I know just how vital research is and how much we need better, kinder treatments for the disease, so I hope people sign up and join me at Shine to support this brilliant cause.'", "description": "Liz Gooch, 41, of Pontypridd, south Wales, felt unwell a month after having the boob job.
