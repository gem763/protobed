It\u2019s been a tough year-and-a-half and we thought it was quite a basic conclusion.\u2019\n\nDuring the final day of the inquest, South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedic James Lyle revealed that numbers of emergency call handlers were \u2018grossly under the required level\u2019 at the time of Mia\u2019s death.\n\nMr Lyle has repeatedly recommended improvements since, but said it was tricky to retain call handlers because of the \u2018high levels of stress.\u2019\n\nConcluding the inquest at Archbishop\u2019s Palace on Monday, Coroner Roger Hatch said that giving the two-year-old a small sausage was \u2018unwise\u2019 and noted there had been a delay in reaching a call handler.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also said the endotracheal tube was found in the wrong place, but added Mia\u2019s chance of survival from choking was \u2018extremely slim\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
