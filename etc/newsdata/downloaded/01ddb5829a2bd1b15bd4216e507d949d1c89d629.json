Better yet, you can alternate between English and Spanish commands on the fly \u2013 no need to switch languages in a menu. \u00a1Que ch\u00e9vere!\n\nThe feature is a long time coming. It\u2019s been available in Mexico and Spain for some time, but US users have been waiting for some time. According to some metrics, the US has more Spanish speakers than anywhere else in the world outside of Mexico.\n\nWith Spanish support also comes Multi-lingual mode. Once activated, you\u2019ll be able to speak to Alexa in either English or Spanish without having to manually switch the language every time. The feature will also allow you to switch between Indian English and Hindi in India and Canadian English and French in Canada.\n\nI can see this being particularly useful in first-generation immigrant families, where parents may be more comfortable speaking in Spanish, while kids would be fine speaking English. Or bilingual folks can just have fun switching between languages.\n\nSpanish support is rolling out to Alexa users in the US today.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F09%2FAmazon-Echo-products-lineup-2018.jpg&signature=8c5a0db8d7e69c80f31d2d7d15f11c41", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
