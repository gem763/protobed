It seems to be a case of female infanticide,\" he said, adding that the baby was about five days old.\n\nThe baby was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she is recovering, he said. Police are looking for the parents.\n\n150629090758927\n\nIndia has seen a dwindling number of girls, according to a government survey released in July, suggesting that illegal abortions of female fetuses continue despite a ban and government efforts to save girl children.\n\nIt showed that India's gender ratio, or the number of females per 1,000 males, was 896 in the period of 2015-17, down from 898 in 2014-16 and 900 in 2013-15.\n\nThe number was 943 in the last census of 2011.\n\nIndian laws ban doctors and health workers from sharing an unborn child's sex with the parents, or carrying out tests to determine the child's gender. Only registered medical practitioners are allowed to perform abortions.\n\nYet female feticide is common in parts of India. Daughters are often seen as a burden, with families having to pay dowries when they marry, while sons are prized as breadwinners who can inherit property and continue the family name.\n\nIn 2017, police found nearly 20 aborted fetuses dumped in plastic bags in the western state of Maharashtra.", "description": "Laws have been introduced to prevent female infanticide in India, where daughters can be seen as a financial burden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/6058aaaae01540a7879fcd31ec2460d0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
