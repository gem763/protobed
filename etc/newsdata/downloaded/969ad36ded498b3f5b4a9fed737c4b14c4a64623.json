If not, they might say: 'We don't want to go to somebody else's land,'\" said Unal.\n\nErdogan has said the zone should extend to the eastern Deir Ezzor region and Raqa, but Balanche said neither area was ready.\n\nRaqa still needs reconstruction after the Kurds led a bitter battle to recapture the city from IS in 2017.\n\nAccording to Unal, the best way to repatriate Syrians would be in co-operation with the Syrian government following a normalisation of relations between Ankara and Damascus.\n\n\"As far as international law is concerned, you can't force them to move.\"", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hopes a new \"safe zone\" in northern Syria will kill two birds with one stone - easing the refugee burden and pushing Kurdish militants away from his southern border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7639/21950ec1a9f44a6c86cd82caea2e1afe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
