After bringing complaints to his agents at CAA, which also represents Phillips, Leto reportedly attempted to kill the film in its infancy by asking his music manager, Irving Azoff, to reach out to one of Warner Bros.\u2032 parent companies.\n\nThe Oscar winner has denied the allegations that he interfered with the film\u2019s development, while Azoff has yet to comment, as the two are no longer working together. HuffPost has reached out to Leto\u2019s representatives.\n\nLeto had planned to play the Joker for years to come with the hopes of starring in his own standalone film and reportedly felt \u201calienated and upset by the move,\u201d according to a separate Hollywood Reporter article.\n\nIn a 2017 interview, the actor addressed his murky future with the character, admitting that he was a \u201clittle confused\u201d when the new film was announced.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of things happening in the DC world,\u201d he said of the studio\u2019s upcoming slate. \u201cIt\u2019s a big universe and, you know, when you play the Joker, there\u2019s no ownership there. You know you just have the honor of holding the baton for a little while and then passing it off. But there are other films in development and I\u2019m excited to see what comes from them.\u201d\n\nAs recently as June 2018, reports circulated that Leto was indeed set to star in his own film, expanding the \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d universe. But plans for Leto to reprise the role now seem to be on hold indefinitely, while his one-time co-star Margot Robbie will appear in her own \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d spinoff, \u201cBirds of Prey,\u201d which comes out in February.\n\n\u201cThe Joker,\u201d which was released earlier this month, has been a massive success at the box office with a worldwide gross of $735 million, generating serious Oscar buzz for Phoenix.\n\nThe film, which cost only $55 million to make, could becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, unseating \u201cDeadpool 2,\u201d if it continues to build on its momentum.", "description": "The actor, who starred as the supervillain in \"Suicide Squad,\" felt \"alienated and upset\" by the standalone film.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daca4d2200000d21950639b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
