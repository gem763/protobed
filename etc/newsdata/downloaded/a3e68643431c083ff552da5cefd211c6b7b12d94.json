The sprawling Spanish-style estate has come up for sale asking $75 million, a spokeswoman from listing agency Hilton & Hyland confirmed.\n\n\n\nMore: Striking a Chord With Stripes\n\nFrontiere, one of the most prominent female team owners in NFL history, sold the Bel Air property for less than $9 million in 2005, just a few years before her death at the age of 80, according to property records.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s changed hands four more times since then and undergone successive updates and renovations with each new owner, building permits show. The most recent work includes a major redesign by local construction firm JRC Group and architect Don Ziebell of Arizona-based OZ Architects, Inc, according to The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the new listing.\n\n\n\nThe house on Bellagio Road marks at least the third to hit the market on the city\u2019s posh Westside with a price tag of $75 million or more in the past 10 days.\n\n\n\nThe home was designed in the 1930s by Paul Williams, a prolific architect during Hollywood\u2019s Golden age who crafted residences for the likes of Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball.\n\n\n\nAn official listing has yet to go public, but new photos provide a glimpse into the megamansion\u2019s latest design overhaul. Expanded casement windows have brightened the interiors, as have white marble and lighter wood finishes. Contemporary updates also include a massive walk-in closet with its own fireplace and a reimagined wine cellar.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Worldwise: Luxury Designer Sophie Ashby\u2019s Favorite Things\n\nThe house spans roughly 17,700 square feet, enough interior space to host six and a half tennis courts, and stands on nearly two acres of land, according to property records.\n\n\n\nThe seller, an entity called California Hillside Pueblo, bought the estate in 2015 for $38 million, property records. The owner could not be reached for comment.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-115464?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
