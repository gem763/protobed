(AP) - Gerald Everett and Samson Ebukam were the most improbable heroes to emerge from the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 epic 54-51 victory over Kansas City last season.\n\nThe Rams are expecting more big performances from two backups who are back in the spotlight.\n\nEverett, then a seldom-used tight end, caught two touchdown passes in the final 10 minutes of that crazy Monday night victory over the Chiefs.\n\nEbukam, an unsung linebacker and pass rusher, scored the first two touchdowns of his NFL career on a fumble return and an interception return, and he caused another interception in the fourth quarter with a hit on Patrick Mahomes.\n\nNearly a year later, Everett and Ebukam are in prominent positions again for the Rams (3-2), who could use big contributions when they face the San Francisco 49ers (4-0) at the Coliseum on Sunday.\n\nEverett is getting an increasingly important role in the Rams\u2019 offense, while Ebukam is a starter again after Clay Matthews broke his jaw last week.\n\n\u201cOf course, we want to be on the field as much as we can,\u201d Everett said. \u201cI think we all have a lot to contribute.\u201d\n\nEverett has evolved slowly since the Rams chose him in 2017 with the 44th overall pick - the highest draft selection they\u2019ve made in the past three years. He had only 49 receptions in his first two seasons combined, but the big tight end already has 18 catches for 223 yards this season, highlighted by his career-best seven receptions for 136 yards last week at Seattle.\n\nEverett\u2019s increasing role is linked to coach Sean McVay\u2019s increased use of \u201c12 personnel,\u201d the shorthand for any offensive set with one running back and two tight ends on the field. Tyler Higbee is the Rams\u2019 starting tight end, but Everett got plenty of action due to McVay\u2019s use of two tight ends on 36% of their offensive snaps against the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to be on the field, but now when I have the ball I\u2019m trying to seize the opportunity to the full extent,\u201d Everett said. \u201cI think I\u2019m able to play football more now than just trying to learn the offense. Now that I\u2019ve got it down, it\u2019s more about just playing.\u201d\n\nEverett didn\u2019t think he was even the primary target on any of the plays leading up to his seven catches, although McVay said that\u2019s not strictly true. Jared Goff has forged a confidence in Everett after three straight seasons together, and Everett has developed a knack for finding open spots when plays don\u2019t work out perfectly.\n\n\u201cHe made a bunch of plays (at Seattle), and really that\u2019s what he\u2019s done when he\u2019s gotten his opportunities,\u201d McVay said.\n\nEbukam was a starter for the Rams last year in 14 regular season games and two playoff contests, including the Super Bowl. He has been a backup this season behind pass-rushing specialists Dante Fowler and Matthews, who joined the Rams as a free agent and made six sacks in five games before getting hurt.\n\nThe Rams need Ebukam to step confidently into the shoes of their six-time Pro Bowl newcomer when they face Jimmy Garoppolo and the Niners\u2019 powerful offense.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to take it like it is,\u201d Ebukam said of losing his starting spot. \u201cThat\u2019s a future Hall of Famer that they put in front of you, so I\u2019m not going to sit here and question it, because he\u2019s been eating on the field. I just want to do that whenever I get the chance.\u201d\n\nEbukam credits Matthews with an influence on his game, encouraging him to play more aggressively and freely instead of being scheme-bound. Matthews\u2019 instinctual play has rubbed off on him, Ebukam said.\n\n\u201cHe goes against a lot of the rules, because he just already knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Ebukam said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to make sure I\u2019m able to do the same thing and have an impact just like he did.\u201d\n\nNOTES: CB Aqib Talib has been ruled out for Sunday\u2019s game due to bruised ribs, McVay said. Troy Hill is expected to start in place of the five-time Pro Bowl selection. \u2026 RB Todd Gurley is doubtful, but not definitively ruled out after missing another practice with a thigh bruise. Malcolm Brown and rookie Darrell Henderson would fill in for him. \u2026 Gurley, Ebukam and safety John Johnson were evacuated from their homes as a precaution because of the fires on the outskirts of the Los Angeles metroplex.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gerald Everett and Samson Ebukam were the most improbable heroes to emerge from the Los Angeles Rams' epic 54-51 victory over Kansas City last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/rams_seahawks_football_24558_c0-122-2930-1831_s1200x700.jpg?7c8190b2b8d33680b86611e51a8b05075c33602b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
