So they well understand the challenges presented by that scenario, even if Texas A&M; struggled offensively in a 24-10 loss at Clemson on Sept. 7.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in that environment once, now you get to do it at home,\u201d Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll learn from those situations and learn that those No. 1 teams are No. 1 for one reason. They play very well. At the end of the day, they play well, and that\u2019s what you have to do. We have to go and play well. You can\u2019t get caught up in what we\u2019re trying to do and the emotion in the game.\u201d\n\nBoth teams are coming off open dates, giving them an extra week to heal up and prepare. Texas A&M; is one of five schools to face the No. 1 team twice in a season since the poll began in 1936, having also done it in 1970.\n\nEven as 16 \u00bd-point underdogs, the Aggies are trying to become the first team to challenge the Tide this season. Nobody else has come closer than 24 points or even slowed down quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and the Tide offense.\n\n\u201cAll in all, this is a really good team from top to bottom,\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said of Texas A&M.;\n\nThe Aggies\u2019 challenge is to contain an Alabama offense that is averaging 51.8 points per game, or try to keep up with the Tide offensively. In his first true road game of the season, Tagovailoa passed for 444 yards and five touchdowns against South Carolina .\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to create big plays,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to score points because they\u2019re going to get points. I mean, they\u2019re going to get points.\u201d\n\nTexas A&M; does go against a freshman-laden Tide defense . Quarterback Kellen Mond could find some room to run considering Mississippi freshman quarterback John Rhys Plumlee ran for 109 yards against Alabama two weeks ago.\n\nHOT TUA\n\nTagovailoa has been on a huge roll lately. He has thrown for 16 touchdowns in the last three games, including a school-record six against Mississippi before the open date. He hasn\u2019t thrown an interception in 148 attempts and is coming off a 418-yard, six-touchdown passing performance against Mississippi . He also ran for a seventh score.\n\nTURNOVER MARGIN\n\nTurnovers have been a big difference with these two teams. Alabama leads the SEC with a plus-8 turnover margin while Texas A&M; and South Carolina are tied for last at minus-2.\n\nOWENS\u2019 STATUS\n\nAlabama center Chris Owens is \u201cvery questionable\u201d for what Saban described as \u201ca little knee problem.\u201d If he can\u2019t play, Landon Dickerson can move over from right guard as he did against New Mexico State.\n\nKICKERS\n\nIf Texas A&M; has a clear edge, it\u2019s probably with the kickers and punters. The Aggies\u2019 Seth Small has made 8 of 10 field goal attempts this season and has three 50-plus yarders in his career. Punter Braden Mann has a career average of 50.2 yards and has been even better against SEC and ranked teams. Alabama freshman placekicker Will Reichard has also handled punting duties at times in place of a struggling Skyler DeLong. Reichard has only made 4 of 7 field goals, though, and is trying to return from a hip injury.\n\n\u201cI feel like our special teams is just as good as (theirs),\u201d Fisher said.\n\nSABAN VS ASSISTANTS\n\nFisher is trying to become the first former Saban assistant to beat their ex-boss as a head coach, even if he, Georgia\u2019s Kirby Smart and South Carolina\u2019s Will Muschamp and others get tired of hearing about it. They are collectively 0-17 against Saban and most of them haven\u2019t been close, with an average margin of 41.6-14.2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Texas A&M gets a do-over in taking on the nation's No. 1 team.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/mississippi_alabama_football_65735_c0-185-4434-2771_s1200x700.jpg?ffb67f40fa87ac4eb3d793002f2875aac5aed9b6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
