By contrast the Trump Administration\u2019s guidance empowers States with flexibility to work around some of Obamacare\u2019s most glaring failures and to give Americans more options to get health coverage that better meets their needs.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s statement pointed out that 13 states have taken advantage of the Trump administration\u2019s guidance. Of those states, the Trump administration said, the statewide average individual market premiums dropped in a range from down 6% in Rhode Island to down 30% in Maryland.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer is leading the Democratic push to undo the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to curb Obamacare, and Democrats have said they intend to take action via a vote as soon as Wednesday.\n\nMr. Schumer has previously taken similar action in an attempt to undermine other Trump administration policy priorities, including on tax reform. Democrats tried and failed last week to reverse the 2017 tax reform legislation that put a cap on deductions for state and local taxes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
