After all, that July 25 request of Volodymyr Zelenskiy to knee-cap former Vice President Joe Biden led to a whistleblower\u2019s complaint and, of course, the impeachment inquiry that\u2019s engulfed Trump and imperiled his presidency.Not satisfied with that bit of artofthedealmaking, Trump took to the south lawn of the White House on Thursday and told reporters on live television that he wanted Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son for corruption. \u201cWhat happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d he advised, slinging another glop of unsubstantiated tar at the Bidens.Mud-slinging aside, Trump was yet again confirming \u2013 in an openly recorded setting \u2013 that he likes to solicit foreign powers to interfere in U.S. elections. That, as he must have learned during the two years Mueller investigated him, is a crime.When he first began addressing reporters, Trump responded to a question on trade negotiations with China by pointing out his belief that he has plenty of leverage over the country. \u201cI have a lot of options on China, but if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power,\u201d he said.Trump also upped the ante, suggesting without evidence that China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, forged a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d on trade with the U.S. because of the Bidens \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t want a bribery investigation to tarnish him or his country. \u201cI\u2019m sure President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country,\u201d by Biden\u2019s son, Trump threatened. \u201cYou know what they call that, they call that a payoff.\u201dGiven how thorny the Mueller probe was, one might have expected Trump not to go there with China. Given that one of the key elements of the impeachment inquiry revolves around whether Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless Zelenskiy did his bidding, one might have expected Trump not to use such similar and muscular language with China. Given all of this, one might expect the president of the United States not to keep saying the quiet things out loud. But he wouldn\u2019t be Donald Trump if he paid attention to any of those things.Trump\u2019s statements on Thursday prompted quick responses from lots of informed observers. Joyce White Vance, a lawyer and the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, pointed this out on Twitter: \u201cTrump just committed a felony violation of law by soliciting something of value in connection with a US election from a foreign gov\u2019t on national TV. 52 U.S. Code \u00a7 30121. Violating the law isn\u2019t necessary for Impeachment but it certainly warrants it\u2026.After the Mueller investigation, there\u2019s no way Trump was unaware this violates the law.\u201d\n\nEllen Weintraub, the chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, reposted a tweet from June that included a \u201cStatement Regarding Illegal Contributions From Foreign Governments.\u201d Her statement noted that it \u201cis illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\u201d The statement points out that this concept is not \u201cnovel\u201d and is deeply rooted in the Constitution. \u201cAnyone who solicits or accepts foreign assistance risks being on the wrong end of a federal investigation.\u201dLaurence Tribe, a professor at the Harvard Law School and a leading constitutional scholar, told me that he sees some method in Trump\u2019s madness on the White House lawn. \u201cHe obviously believes that if he commits his felonies in broad daylight and out in the open that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong -- and that no one would think he\u2019s stupid enough to commit an impeachable offense in front of everyone,\u201d he said.If Trump is muddying the waters by giving Democrats too many impeachable acts to track, Tribe suggests that they focus solely on building their case around two articles of impeachment that involve his Ukraine and Russia dealings: betrayal of country and stonewalling Congress. Trump\u2019s comments Thursday about China can inform those charges, Tribe says, but he thinks it would be a strategic mistake for it to be turned into a standalone article of impeachment.The president is undoubtedly under stress, as his recent, somnambulant speech at the United Nations and a pair of unhinged press briefings on Wednesday demonstrated. So perhaps his recklessness is dialed up a notch because he\u2019s fighting for his political survival. But as I noted in a recent column, Trump openly flaunted lawlessness long before he became president \u2013 even going back to his earliest days as a casino operator in Atlantic City.The difference now is that the stakes are much higher, the world is watching, and the president apparently can\u2019t stop himself.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On July 25, just a day after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress and essentially concluded his investigation of President Donald Trump\u2019s various intersections with Russia, Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s leader to find dirt on a political opponent \u2013 indulging", "authors": ["Timothy L.
