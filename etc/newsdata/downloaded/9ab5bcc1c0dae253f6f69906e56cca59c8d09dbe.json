ABC later reported the exchange as if Todd was supporting the plan, when, in fact, he is against it.\n\n\"I went to hear Beto speak and if I got the opportunity to ask him where he drew the line as far as his gun confiscation plans -- and I wanted to phrase it in a way that allowed him to speak his mind and he did, Todd said. \"He really is open to... banning and confiscating nearly all firearms.\"\n\nHe claimed members of the media turned cold when they found out he didn't support O'Rourke's plan and accused them of embracing a far-left agenda.\n\nBETO CALLS FOR RED FLAG LAWS, MANDATORY GUN BUYBACK AND NATIONAL REGISTRY ALL IN THE SAME SPEECH\n\n\"The media, by and large, is biased and in some cases complicit with pushing the extremists' far-left agenda,\" Todd said. \"There were many that were very interested in talking to me afterward. But, when they found out my true stance, they suddenly were less interested. So it's been crickets since they found out where I truly stood on the issue.\"\n\nTodd was injured in 1999 when two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 13 people and injuring 24. Harris and Klebold eventually killed themselves with gunshot wounds to the head following the massacre that left 12 students and one teacher dead.\n\nTodd also said during his \"Fox & Friends\" interview that the idea of confiscating firearms from private citizens is a personal affront and will leave millions defenseless while creating more problems than it would solve.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's insulting and dangerous,\" he said earlier in the interview. \"You're removing the means of protection for millions and millions of law-abiding Americans. I think his ban is misplaced.\n\n\"It goes after the wrong people and it goes after the wrong issues,\" Todd continued. \"The law-abiding citizens in this country aren't the problem. There's an element that is a problem. And I think we need to address the realities of mental health and other issues. And the reality is that there's evil in this world.\"", "description": "Evan Todd, who was shot during the Columbine school massacre, appeared on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday to set the record straight, after he says he was\u00a0misrepresented by the media, with regard to his views on 2020 Presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke's gun ban.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
