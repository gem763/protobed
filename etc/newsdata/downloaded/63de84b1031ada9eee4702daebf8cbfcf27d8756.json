REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nU.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September while a report from the U.S. Federal Reserve described the economy\u2019s progress in cautious terms.\n\n\u201cThis is a report which gives reasons to worry about the U.S. outlook, but does not give a reason to panic,\u201d said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nAgainst a basket of its rivals .DXY, the dollar was just a whisker above a one-month low hit overnight. It weakened 0.3% to a one-week low against the Swiss franc CHF=.\n\nThe dollar only managed to eke out some gains against the struggling pound, which gyrated to the progress of last-minute Brexit deal negotiations.\n\nThe leadership of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party said it did not support proposed solutions to handling Irish border checks, a major sticking point in negotiations over the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nSterling slid as much as 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2748 GBP=D3, and shed 0.5% versus the euro to as low as 86.81 pence EURGBP=D3, before steadying and recouping some losses.\n\nThe pound has surged some 5% since last week as the negotiations between Britain and the European Union made progress, hitting a five-month high in volatile trade.\n\nElsewhere, the Norwegian crown weakened to an all-time low of 10.1800 against the euro EURNOK=D3. Some analysts blamed the crown\u2019s recent weakness on global trade jitters, while others said the speed and magnitude of the drop were hard to explain.\n\nThe Australian dollar AUD=D3 held near the day's highs, up 0.3% against the dollar after jobs data showed buoyant hiring, lowering chances of monetary easing in November.\n\n(GRAPHIC: USD valuations - here)", "description": "The dollar held near a one-month low against its rivals on Thursday as weak data cast a shadow on the outlook for the U.S. economy in the short term with the British pound the only noticeable loser against the greenback on Brexit nerves.", "authors": ["Saikat Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441693331&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0BV", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
