Javid declared the \u201cend of austerity\u201d as he revealed that no government department will be cut in 2020-2021, announcing an overall increase in spending of \u00a313.8 billion compared to the current year.\n\nAnd he dropped a clear hint that the fiscal rules which were imposed to keep the spending taps tightened are set to be changed in the coming months.\n\nAs Johnson watched on and heckled the opposition, Javid laid out an unusual single-year spending round, saying he was \u201cclearing the decks\u201d for departments ahead of the October 31 Brexit date.\n\nBut the Tories clearly had another thing on their minds: How to fight Labour at the general election Britain is racing toward.\n\nJavid was even told off twice by Commons Speaker John Bercow for \u201cveering into matters ... unrelated to the spending round\u201d by attacking Labour.\n\nWhen he finally moved onto the detail, the chancellor said he was delivering the \u201cfastest increase in day to day spending in 15 years\u201d at 4.1 percent across government offices, plus an extra \u00a32 billion to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cI can announce today that no department will be cut next year,\u201d he told the Commons. \u201cEvery single government department has had its budget for day-to-day spending increased at least in line with inflation. That\u2019s what I mean by the end of austerity. Britain\u2019s hard work paying off.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office was handed a 6.7 percent real-terms increase in spending, including \u00a3750 million to fund the recruitment of police officers next year.\n\nHe announced a 6.2 percent increase for the NHS and an extra \u00a31.5 billion for councils to cope with social care.\n\nAnd the Department for Education will get \u00a37.1 billion more by 2022-2023 compared with this year, Javid said, with each secondary school getting an extra \u00a35,000 for every pupil.\n\nJavid also announced he would review the \u201cfiscal framework\u201d \u2014 a set of rules imposed by former Chancellor George Osborne and updated by his successor Philip Hammond to keep spending tight \u2014 ahead of a budget next year.\n\nThe rules require the government to balance the books by the mid-2020s and to ensure debt is falling as a share of GDP by the end of the current parliament.\n\nJavid's spending review keeps within those restrictions, the Treasury insisted, because they are set against national forecasts published in March. But his plan to loosen the rules shows a clear desire to turn the spending taps on soon.\n\nPaul Johnson, the boss of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, pointed out that thanks to updated growth figures, Javid would probably not be keeping to the rules.\n\nJohnson added that despite the new announcements, spending in most departments will remain well below 2010 levels. And he warned that a no-deal Brexit and economic slowdown would probably mean \u201canother dose of austerity to deal with renewed deficit.\u201d\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell told Javid to send a message to top Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings: \u201cDo not insult the intelligence of the British people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people will see today\u2019s statement as the grubby electioneering stunt that it is. This is not a spending review as we know it. It is straight out of the [election strategist] Lynton Crosby handbook,\" McDonnell said, dubbing it \"opinion poll politics.\"", "description": "The chancellor announced a \u00a313.8 billion increase in day-to-day spending across government.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Annabelle Dickson", "Miriam Webber"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165932005-1200x628.jpg"}
