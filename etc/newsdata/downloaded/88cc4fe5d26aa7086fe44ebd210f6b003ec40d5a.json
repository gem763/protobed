That question might get lost in the acute issues surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to a subpoena for his tax records. Jazz wrote about Donald Trump\u2019s loss earlier today and what it means for his legal situation, but Judge Victor Marrero\u2019s order raises serious questions about accountability as well as defense against prosecutorial abuse for political gain, even if this isn\u2019t an environment suitable for resolving them.\n\nMarrero\u2019s order starts off badly for Trump and only goes downhill from there. Marrero frames Trump\u2019s conception of his office as essentially immune from any investigation, even for acts that might have taken place prior to being elected to it:\n\nTo buy this argument, Marrero decides, is not just to say that a president cannot be prosecuted while in office. It\u2019s to say that he can\u2019t even be effectively investigated, except by the House of Representatives. The latter is likely what the founders had in mind for acts while in office, but nothing in the Constitution sets up that kind of immunity for potential criminal acts that took place outside of it. That would mean that any accomplices would get off scot-free too, Marrero points out:\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling argument, but that doesn\u2019t mean Trump\u2019s is entirely without merit either. Yes, one can easily see how this broad claim of immunity can be abused, but then again, one can see how the prosecutorial processes of states and localities can be abused to unfairly besmirch presidents and other executive officers. One only needs to remember what happened to Rick Perry with the Travis County indictment over a veto threat to grasp that prosecutorial authority can a two-sided blade when it comes to political abuse. (And perhaps to an extent what happened to Sarah Palin too, although Alaska\u2019s obtuse laws created part of that issue as well.)\n\nMarrero argues that he has taken that into consideration in dismissing Trump\u2019s challenge to the subpoena for his tax records. The potential for presidential incapacitation over legal issues does not attend fully at \u201cevery stage of every criminal proceeding.\u201d In this case, the risk is limited, Marrero concludes, as Vance\u2019s investigation is focusing on \u201cconduct and transactions relating to third persons that occurred at least in part prior to the President assuming office, that may or may not have involved the president, but that at this phase of the proceedings demand review of the records the President possesses or controls.\u201d\n\nEither way, Marrero concludes, he\u2019s not going to endorse absolute immunity for a president, which he calls \u201crepugnant\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s tough to disagree in principle with Marrero, or even in practice, given the lack of support in the Constitution for Trump\u2019s claims here. The issue is complicated enough that a future Congress should work out precisely what executive immunity means, perhaps with an amendment to the Constitution to ensure courts at all levels abide by it. We don\u2019t want a president to be above the law, but we also don\u2019t want a president beset by politically ambitious local prosecutors who abuse their office to pry into the private or commercial lives of those who run for the office, either.\n\nThat will have to come from a future Congress during another presidency, however. This Congress and this presidency do not provide a suitable environment for the serious and non-partisan consideration these questions require, to say the least.", "description": "\"This Court cannot endorse such a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0b400ea6-8f79-4d36-a1a2-10fe8cb4f2c8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
