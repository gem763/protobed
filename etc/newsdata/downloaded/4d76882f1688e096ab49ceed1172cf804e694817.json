Most of the people on board the test flights will be Qantas employees, so seats won't be available for purchase.\n\nResearchers from Sydney University's Charles Perkins Centre, Monash University and the Alertness Safety and Productivity Cooperative Research Centre -- a scientific program backed by the Australian government -- will examine the impact of the long flight on those on board.\n\nRelated content What it's like to fly nonstop from Australia to the UK\n\nSingapore Airlines has redesigned its premium economy seats to prepare for its new 19-hour flight route between Singapore and New York.\n\nPassengers in the main cabin will wear monitoring devices, and experts from the Charles Perkins Centre will study how their \"health, wellbeing and body clock\" are impacted by a set of variables that include lighting, food and drink, movement, sleep patterns and inflight entertainment.\n\nMonash University scientists will focus on the flight crew, recording their melatonin levels before, during and after the flights, as well as studying brain wave data from electroencephalogram devices worn by the pilots.\n\nThis information will then be shared with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority \"to help inform regulatory requirements associated with ultra-long haul flights,\" Qantas said in a press release\n\nAlan Joyce, Qantas Group CEO, said in the press release: \"Ultra-long haul flying presents a lot of common sense questions about the comfort and wellbeing of passengers and crew. These flights are going to provide invaluable data to help answer them.\"\n\n\"For customers, the key will be minimizing jet lag and creating an environment where they are looking forward to a restful, enjoyable flight. For crew, it's about using scientific research to determine the best opportunities to promote alertness when they are on duty and maximize rest during their down time on these flights,\" Joyce continued.\n\nFor some, the prospect of a 19-hour nonstop flight might sound unbearable. \"It was very much doubted in the previous generations of aircraft that this was something you'd want to do and that could be economically beneficial for airlines to do,\" Fehrm tells CNN.\n\nIf the flight comes to be, it's unlikely to significantly change the aviation industry, he says, pointing to the existing 17-hour flights between Singapore to New York operated by Singapore Airlines. \"In the world, we have 20,000 aircraft flying every day, and there are nine aircraft doing this kind of flight,\" he explains.", "description": "Australian airline Qantas has announced three test flights, with 40 people traveling directly from London or New York to Sydney, to see how the human body copes with 19 solid hours of air travel.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190822134633-qantas-dreamliner-file-super-tease.jpg"}
