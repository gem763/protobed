Bush, and Barack Obama during a journalism career that included stints as Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press and editor-in-chief of the National Journal, said the motorcade was \"obscene.\"\n\n\"It's both the existence and size,\" said Fournier, now president of the Michigan public relations firm Truscott Rossman. \"No security expert would claim it's necessary.\"\n\nFor Phil Anderson of Winona, Minn., who was cycling on the island Saturday, it was no big deal.\n\nMore: Pence's rare Mackinac Island request wouldn't be first time rules were bent\n\nMore: Vice President Mike Pence may break century-old Mackinac Island tradition\n\n\"It's not an issue at all,\" Anderson said. \"The wonderful president and the wonderful vice president have to get out and meet people and they can't walk from the airport.\" Anderson said \"a lot of things have changed\" since the Ford visit, and \"time is money.\"\n\nAmong the things that have changed since Ford's visit are the attempt to assassinate him by Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme later that year, the 1981 attempt by John Hinckley Jr. to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, and the 9-11 terror attacks.\n\nMotorized vehicles have been prohibited on #Mackinac (poo. ~500) since 1898, except for snowmobiles during the winter, emergency vehicles and service vehicles. https://t.co/CsbCPQhER8 \u2014 Steve Herman (@W7VOA) September 21, 2019\n\n\"It's the nature of the security these days,\" said state Sen. Wayne Schmidt, whose district includes Mackinac Island and who said he stood by the road to wait for the motorcade mostly because a vehicle on the island is such a rare sight.\n\n\"Any time we can get a high-ranking official, of any political stripe, up here, I welcome him,\" Schmidt said.\n\nBut the views on social media were weighted heavily against Pence, with \"snowflake\" being among the kinder labels used by his critics. Many said that if he could not go to Mackinac without a motorcade, he should have stayed. home.\n\nEven former Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren, the host of the syndicated TV program Full Court Press, weighed in.\n\nA motorcade on Mackinac Island????????!!!!!!
