Studies by legal aid groups, such as the Urban Justice Center, have shown that most asylum seekers show up for their hearings, however.\n\nMore than 51,000 people, mainly from Central America, have been sent to Mexico since the MPP programme started in January, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBut reports of kidnapping and extortion have increased since the programme was expanded to Matamoros and nearby Nuevo Laredo in crime-wracked Tamaulipas state.\n\nA Central American migrant child walks past tents in an encampment in Matamoros, Mexico [Henry Romero/Reuters]\n\nHuman Rights First, a US-based rights group, in August, documented 110 publicly reported cases of rape, kidnapping, sexual exploitation and other violence against MPP returnees.\n\nIn Matamoros, violence and abuse targeting migrants mean many in the MPP programme refuse to move to a shelter in the city during their long waits for a US court hearing.\n\nSince July, Matamoros has received more than 12,000 asylum seekers under MPP, said Enrique Maciel of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency.\n\nMatamoros Mayor Mario Lopez described the city as calmer than neighbouring towns, because of a truce between two rival drug cartels. Elsewhere in the state, gangs regularly fight pitched battles for turf.\n\nReuters news agency spoke to six asylum seekers at Osorto's camp who said they had been kidnapped or extorted, and several more who had brushes with suspected criminals near the border or elsewhere within Mexico.\n\nOscar Ramirez, a 30-year-old Honduran waiting for a US court date on December 2, said three Mexican men surrounded him around midnight last month and began interrogating him on his plans and his paperwork, he said.\n\n\"I was terrified,\" said Ramirez, who said he ran away from the men when a crowd of people arrived. \"The rumours circulating are that at any moment unknown people will kidnap you.\"\n\nReuters was unable to independently corroborate the migrants' stories. Osorto said he did not report the attack on him to police.\n\nKristin Clarens, a US attorney who advises asylum-seekers at the border, said she had come across five cases of migrants in Matamoros awaiting MPP hearings who were kidnapped briefly. They were taken to an ATM to clear out their accounts or forced to phone relatives to send cash transfers to a nearby convenience store.\n\nA spokesman for Mexico's National Institute for Migration said it had no data on such complaints. Mexico's national rights ombudsman said it was checking for data.\n\nThe Tamaulipas state Attorney General's Office and the federal Attorney General's Office declined to comment. The US Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about the dangers in Tamaulipas.\n\nToo afraid to go to a shelter\n\nIn Osorto's camp, asylum seekers use water from the Rio Grande to wash, despite outbreaks of rashes. Women pay a small fee to use a nearby toilet. For food, tents, and the occasional yoga mat to lie on they depend on volunteers from across the border.\n\nAt night, couples take turns keeping watch over their children, fearful criminals will snatch them if they both sleep.\n\nEarly last month, a Honduran mother and daughter seeking asylum drowned in the river near the camp, in what the Honduran foreign ministry said was an act of desperation after three months' wait in Mexico.\n\nGlady Canas, director of Matamoros-based migrant-aid nonprofit Helping Them to Triumph, said she has tried in vain to convince families to move into the city's lone migrant shelter and its neat dormitories.\n\n'Attacking our minds'\n\nA US Supreme Court decision last month allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its plans to reject asylum for anyone who passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and did not apply for asylum there. The court said the rule could be implemented while challenges made their way through the courts.\n\nTrump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico unless it stopped more migrants, and the US neighbour has since used its military police to contain migration northwards.\n\nClarens, the US lawyer, said Trump's policies were effectively blocking most routes to asylum.\n\n\"It's like a complicated chess game and this is like checkmate,\" she said.\n\nIn the Matamoros camp, asylum seekers fret on a shared WhatsApp group, or aloud, while trying to discern the US policy.\n\n\"They are attacking our minds,\" 27-year-old Oscar Borjas, said of shifting US policy, shuffling a deck of cards late one night in an alleyway between tents.\n\nOsorto, who fled violence in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, said fear and a feeling of being powerless were inescapable.\n\n\"We don't go downtown because they say it's more dangerous,\" he said. But wincing as he glanced out over the tents, he added: \"There's nothing to do here.\"", "description": "About 1,000 migrants live in Mexico border camp, waiting for US immigration hearings as part of Remain in Mexico policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/aa8a0479abb648b1a2c62a2a0dcb69f9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
