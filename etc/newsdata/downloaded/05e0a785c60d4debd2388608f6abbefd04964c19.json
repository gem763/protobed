And most claim the price reductions are to help drivers - not just to keep them competitive in the market\n\nHowever, despite these statements, the AA has found evidence that the cuts sometimes don't last for long - especially if they start eating into supermarkets' profits.\n\nFor example, the previous price war preceding this week's occurred on Friday 13 September.\n\nAsda was again the first to offer 'up to' 3p-a-litre off fuel, reflecting oil's $8-a-barrel tumble and subsequent fall in wholesale costs for retailers at the time.\n\nJust a day later, drone strikes were carried out on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nThis pushed wholesale costs for suppliers higher, and pump prices followed with forecourt prices hiked by Thursday, meaning motorists had access to lower prices for less than a week.\n\nIn fact, the AA's Fuel Price Report found that average pump costs have remained between 129.2p to 127.8p a litre for 17 weeks, suggesting that headline-grabbing cuts tend to be followed by days of rising prices that go under the radar.\n\nThe AA said current difference in average price between supermarket brands looks closer than it is on the ground in many communities across the country\n\nAnd the margins - once fuel duty and wholesale costs are deduced - for retailers appear to have remained consistently high as suppliers pocket profits from drivers.\n\nLast week, margins for retailers averaged 9.5p a litre, the AA calculated.\n\nThis compares with 7.2p in the first week of October last year and 7.8p the year before that, as the motoring group called for suppliers to adjust their pump prices.\n\nThe report also found that many motorists will also struggle to benefit from fuel price wars if they don't have the right supermarkets competing locally - and it can cost them \u00a32 extra each time they fill up within a matter of miles.\n\nIt said: 'When uncompetitive superstores allow neighbouring oil company-branded sites to charge more (and often the same price as towns without any supermarket presence at all), customers and communities lose out significantly.'\n\nAA data shows that on Tuesday along the M4 Berkshire/Hampshire corridor supermarket prices differed by as much as 5p a litre (from left to right: Reading, Basingstoke, Newbury)\n\nTesco in Stirling was charging 3p a litre more fuel petrol than in Alloa, despite the towns being just 20 minutes apart\n\nLuke Bosdet, the AA fuel price spokesman, added: 'When you drive out into the country, through small market towns without supermarket fuel, and see pump prices little different from those in towns with a supermarket forecourt, you know something is broken with road fuel pricing in the UK.\n\n'There appears to be a cosy understanding between supermarkets and their rivals that, where there isn't a competitive supermarket or the occasional maverick independent retailer, the oil company-branded sites will ramp up their prices.\n\n'A neighbouring supermarket will then charge the same or a penny less a litre and claim to be value for money \u2013 even though it's getting \u00a32 or so more per tank of fuel than at other locations.\n\n'The sad thing is that customers seem to be buying it, as official statistics confirm.'\n\nAn Asda spokesperson told This is Money: 'When we cut fuel prices, we always announce what our national price cap is, meaning drivers know exactly the maximum amount they are paying regardless of where they live.\n\n'No other retailer does this, meaning they are free to charge as much as they like when they have no competition close by such as an Asda. This is what the AA are referring to below.'\n\nThey added: 'On the rare occasion when a lower price is available within a local area, our aim is to match that price locally so customers can rest assured they\u2019re always getting the best value when filling up their tanks with Asda.'\n\nWe've also contacted Morrisons and Sainsbury's for comment.", "description": "A new report by the AA revealed that headline-grabbing 'fuel price wars' sometimes don't last for long, with supermarkets quietly increasing pump costs shortly after the cuts are announced.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
