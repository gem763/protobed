The movie\u2019s trailer and posters were removed from advertising screens in theaters.\n\nThe film was also met with criticism from Vietnamese movie fans.\n\n\u201cIt is an insult to Vietnam,\u201d said student Minh Hieu, who was looking for a movie to watch on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAnother student, Nguyen Mai Huong, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t watch it even if it still showed in the cinema. The (nine-dash) map is straight-up wrong. And I am absolutely not going to support it.\u201d", "description": "Vietnam has pulled the Hollywood animation movie \u201cAbominable\u201d from theaters for featuring a scene with a map containing the controversial South China Sea nine-dash line, state media reported.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Abominablebanned1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
