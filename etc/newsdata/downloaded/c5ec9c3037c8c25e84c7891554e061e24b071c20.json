There is a niche market for that,\u201d said Jeon Young-sun, a research professor at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University. \u201cSimply speaking, some people are curious about what beer North Koreans drink and what cookies they eat.\u201d\n\nJang uses his Samsung smartphone to film himself at his small Seoul apartment, and sometimes invites fellow North Korean refugees as guests and has friends shoot him when he ventures out. He often appears with his trademark dark fedora, but sometimes with a colorful wig, a false mustache or even a Kim Jong Un mask.\n\nVideo clips uploaded on Jang\u2019s 2-year-old channel showed him saying that ordinary North Koreans usually raise dogs, rabbits, pigs and chickens, but to either eat or sell to markets. He said that calling someone \u201ca baby born by a young female slave\u201d is considered a profanity in North Korea, and that people there say \u201cDo you want to have the order of your ribs revolutionarily reorganized?\u201d when trying to intimidate others.\n\nHe also said he never heard about the existence of transgender people in North Korea, though he heard about gays in the country.\n\nJang, who has about 7,000 subscribers to his channel, said he does manual labor and delivers fried chicken as a means of living because his YouTube-related income is too small. But he feels it\u2019s worth it to keep his YouTube career going because some subscribers have left messages saying his broadcasts helped resolve their misunderstandings of North Korea.\n\n\u201cThey cheer me up and make me be positive. They are the reasons why I shoot YouTube videos today and tomorrow,\u201d Jang said, petting his Maltese.\n\nHe said the term \u201cTango\u201d in his channel\u2019s title is an abbreviation of Korean words meaning \u201ca plump cat,\u201d a reference to his friends joking that the round-faced Jang has a cat-looking face. Although he knew that tango in English is a type of dance, he decided to go ahead with that word because the liveliness of the dance matches what he seeks from his channel.\n\nOther North Korea-born YouTubers talk about why they left their homeland and the experiences they\u2019ve had in South Korea. Some also broadcast themselves putting on North Korean-style makeup or eating foods from the country.\n\nThe young YouTubers are mostly stylish, contrary to the stereotype of North Korean refugees as being rough and unsophisticated. About 32,000 North Koreans have fled to the South over the past two decades to avoid poverty and political repression.\n\nKang Na-ra, a North Korean escapee who regularly appears on two YouTube channels and two TV programs, is called \u201cPrincess Na-ra\u201d by her fans. The 22-year-old with long, brown-dyed hair said she has a 200-member fan club that has sent her a cake topped with a mini-Kang doll on her birthday for the past three years.\n\nWhen Kang, dressed in a North Korean military uniform, showed how to put on North Korean-style makeup on her YouTube channel, her subscribers wrote, \u201cYou are so pretty even without makeup\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re such a beauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like communicating with people by posting responses to the messages that they put on my channel,\u201d said Kang, wearing two rings on each of her hands. \u201cI want to let the people know about North Korean culture and show more about how I am living in South Korea.\u201d\n\nThe YouTubers, however, also have anti-fans who often vent their anger at them when North Korea does something provocative like conduct a weapons test.\n\nKang said she feels a \u201clittle sad\u201d when she reads malicious messages from people such as \u201cGo back to your country\u201d and \u201cWhy does a Red live here?\u201d\n\nJang said some messages have been left for him wishing for him to be assassinated with a poisoned needle or banished to a North Korean coal mine.\n\nWhile there have been some TV programs in the South featuring North Korean refugees, some experts say they don\u2019t fully carry the escapees\u2019 voices because they were directed, filmed and edited by South Koreans.\n\n\u201cOn YouTube, defectors can speak whatever they want without being filtered and edited. \u2026 Given that, I would say their programs provide content that the TV shows can\u2019t provide,\u201d said Lee Kwang Baek, the South Korean head of a YouTube channel on North Korea.\n\nTheir YouTube programs are also believed to help address the widespread misinformation about North Korea in the South. Jang said a middle school student once asked him if North Koreans eat dirt when they\u2019re hungry, while another escapee-turned-YouTuber, Lee Pyung, said he was asked whether North Koreans give potatoes instead of money to a driver when they take a bus.\n\nThe YouTubers\u2019 most popular content is stories of their dangerous escapes to South Korea.\n\nKang\u2019s escape story, posted on someone else\u2019s YouTube channel last year, has received about 1.7 million views. She said she thought she was going to die when she was carried away by water while crossing the Tumen River to go to China before coming to South Korea in December 2014.\n\nKang said she ran away from her home in North Korea after fighting with her stepmother. Then her biological mother, who had already resettled in South Korea, hired brokers who helped her come to the South about two weeks later.\n\nBesides her longing for her mother, Kang said her wishes to wear jeans, dye her hair and date handsome South Korean men also pushed her to make a perilous journey to the South.\n\nJang hasn\u2019t posted his escape story yet because he said he wants to fill his channel with more amusing content.\n\nHe said his family left North Korea in 1998 to escape a famine that killed hundreds of thousands of people, including his first love and school desk mate in the northeastern city of Onsong.\n\nJang said he had a big crush on the 11-year-old girl with fair skin and big eyes, who lived with her grandmother. He recalled how the two would hold hands when he walked her to her house.\n\nAfter the girl didn\u2019t come to school for two to three weeks, their teacher asked Jang to go and check on her. When he arrived at her home, he found the girl, then all skin and bones, lying dead with her eyes and mouth open, while her grandmother had disappeared.\n\nTerrified, Jang immediately bolted out of the house and reported the girl\u2019s death to neighbors before crying all day.\n\nA few months later, he fled North Korea with his parents and younger brother.\n\nBefore his family walked across the frozen Tumen River, his father told him to turn back and look at the country they wouldn\u2019t likely return to.\n\n\u201cWhile looking at my hometown for about five minutes, I thought about that girl,\u201d Jang said.\n\n\u201cI thought that her only fault was being born in the wrong country,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf she had come to South Korea, she wouldn\u2019t have starved to death \u2026 and could have become a YouTuber like me.\u201d\n\n__\n\nJang\u2019s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGZ5SatfaQ2pE_w349obwAw\n\nKang\u2019s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDL6b9TfuQ6V4QlSP79gxlQ\n\n__\n\nFollow Hyung-jin Kim at www.twitter.com/hyungjin1972\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wearing a fedora, Jang Myung-jin shouts \"Hello, comrades!\" as he starts his YouTube broadcast, titled \"A North Korean man, Tango.\" Then, he talks about whether North Koreans raise pet dogs, what type of profanity they use and whether there are any transgender people in the country.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hyung-Jin Kim"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/north_korea_refugees_youtubers_41807_c0-167-4000-2499_s1770x1032.jpg?0ff70703b128ca503aced402a7d61935364c4e5a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
