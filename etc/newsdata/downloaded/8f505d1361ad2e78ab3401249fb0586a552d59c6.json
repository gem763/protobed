They\u2019re not alone. Two former Fed officials said Thursday that the central bank might need to do $250 billion of outright Treasury purchases to prevent further pain in U.S. money markets.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing consensus that the central bank\u2019s daily efforts to restore order in the short-term funding market are falling short of what\u2019s needed: a much larger effort to build up a substantial buffer of bank reserves. Expectations are growing that the Federal Open Market Committee will announce large-scale Treasury purchases at its Oct. 29-30 meeting in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe daily operations are more like a Band-Aid that address the symptoms of reserve scarcity rather than the cause,\u201d TD senior rates strategist Gennadiy Goldberg said by phone. \u201cThey don\u2019t address the reason for the spike -- the shortage of excess reserves -- and the only way to fix this would be for the Fed to grow the asset side of its balance sheet.\u201d\n\nPolicy makers are already slated to discuss expanding their balance sheet at next month\u2019s two-day meeting in Washington, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said this month. Should officials announce a program in October, they\u2019ll need to characterize it as a \u201ctechnical adjustment\u201d to avoid any confusion over whether it\u2019s actually a form of quantitative easing, said Pictet economist Thomas Costerg.\n\nHe said he expects a $400 billion plan because the Fed is likely \u201cto tilt bigger rather than smaller, as they need a \u2018wow\u2019 effect after the relative timidity of what the New York Fed put on the table in recent days.\u201d\n\nSuch a program would not be without its side effects: Morgan Stanley\u2019s London-based global head of currency strategy, Hans Redeker, says it has the potential to weaken the U.S. currency. That\u2019s because when excess reserves go up, \u201cthe dollar goes down,\u201d he said by phone Thursday.\n\n--With assistance from Susanne Barton.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Vivien Lou Chen in San Francisco at vchen1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It may take as much as $500 billion in Treasury purchases by the Federal Reserve to fix all of the cracks exposed last week in the more than $2 trillion U.S. repo market.Estimates from analysts at TD Securities, Morgan Stanley, BMO Capital Markets and Pictet Wealth Management range from", "authors": ["Vivien Lou Chen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
