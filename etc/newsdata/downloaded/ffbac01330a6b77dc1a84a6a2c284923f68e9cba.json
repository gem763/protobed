(Submitted by Peggy Allen)\n\nOne such affair saw Peggy chased through the house and off the balcony by a person who, she believed, was having a bad trip from an illicit drug. She fell backwards, landing on the ground that was 1.2 metres below, and injured her neck and back.\n\nHowever, she had a revelatory moment in September 2018 when a woman walking up her driveway swore at her, she says.\n\n\"I looked at her and I just went crazy and I started running toward her. I was going to hurt her,\" Allen recalled.\n\nThen a \"light switched\" in her brain.\n\n\"I just stopped halfway down there and I said: 'Peggy, I hate the way you are. This isn't who you are,'\" she said.\n\n\"I turned around, I went back to the house and I just bawled my head off.\"\n\nShe describes the experience as an \"incredible metamorphosis\" in her life and is now giving back to the people who she once referred to as the source of her \"nightmare.\"\n\n\"I don't expect anyone to jump on the bandwagon that lives around here because they've been through hell and they've had a lot of bad things happen. But I got to tell you that what I'm gaining from helping these people way outweighs what I lost.\"\n\nDream house\n\nThe Allens and their two sons, who were 7 and 10 at the time, moved into their home on Gladys Avenue, near Highway 11 and S Fraser Way, in September 1989.\n\nThe lush, half-acre property was secluded, shrouded by a forest of towering cedars. The bungalow itself is removed from the road \u2014 separated by a long, 50-metre driveway \u2014 and the entire property backs onto a creek.\n\n\"It was the perfect life for us,\" Peggy Allen recalled, an emotional tone hanging in her voice.\n\n\"Our kids could run free and we could have animals.\"\n\nFifteen years later, the Salvation Army Centre for Hope moved into the space next door, and she says the family's \"life changed overnight.\"\n\nThey tried to move, but couldn't sell the house for the amount they paid.\n\nAllen erected fencing around her home to stop trespassers, who were living in tents near her home. (Submitted by Peggy Allen)\n\nWhen nothing changed, she invested thousands of dollars to line the perimeter of the property with a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire \u2014 like something from a prison \u2014 and outfitted its exterior with a security camera system.\n\nYet the problems persisted.\n\n\"The point is it's all little tiny stuff, but it's huge,\" Allen said of the emotional scars they had as a result of the encounters.\n\nHousing affordability\n\nIn addition to serving as an emergency shelter, the Salvation Army delivers a litany of services \u2014 such as a meal centre, mental health supports and addiction counselling.\n\nWhen The Current visited the Allens' home, 14 tents were pitched on the shoulder of Gladys Avenue, occupied by people either accessing the facility's wide range of services or transitioning out of it. Others were milling around the Allens' property on their way to and from the shelter.\n\nResidents in a homeless camp in Jubilee Park in 2013, a short distance away from Gladys Avenue where the Allens' home is currently located. In 2015, a B.C. Supreme Court judge struck down Abbotsford bylaws that prohibited homeless people from erecting temporary shelters and sleeping in city parks.

The city report notes this is, at best, only an estimate, and does not capture every homeless person in the community.\n\nOf those surveyed by volunteers, 111 people were living on the street in tents or makeshift structures or sleeping in their cars/campers, instead of one of Abbotsford's seven shelters.\n\nThe roadside near Allens' home.

He used to live on the streets, and says his interactions with Allen have changed his life.\n\nAllen's driveway in Abbotsford, B.C. She said that it was chasing trespassers up this driveway that she experienced an 'incredible metamorphosis.'
