But can Per Una's sharp new look seduce modern shoppers?", "language": "en", "text": "Once upon a time, my mother used to rely on Marks & Spencer not only for her salmon en croute emergencies, but also for good old Per Una.\n\nM&S\u2019s beloved sub-brand always had easy, vaguely bohemian pieces for every occasion \u2014 middle-aged leisurewear, if you will. But now, Per Una has been given a drastic makeover, with a new, younger aesthetic and logo.\n\nThe headline news is that the High Street giant has scrapped two of its other brands, Indigo and Limited Collection, leaving Per Una as the star. Thank goodness for that \u2014 I, along with the rest of Britain, found the multiple labels confusing.\n\n(Left), Knit, \u00a339.50, and dress, \u00a389, M&S; Boots, \u00a3149, Massimo Dutti, (centre), Coat, \u00a3129, jacket, \u00a3119, and blouse and culottes, \u00a339.50 each, all M&S; Boots, \u00a370, Dune London, (right), Top, \u00a339.50, and trousers, \u00a349.50, M&S; Shoes, \u00a3195, L.K.Bennett; Bag, \u00a329.99, Zara; Jewellery throughout, Daphine\n\n(Left), Jacket, \u00a389, and trousers, \u00a355, M&S; Shoes, \u00a3275, The Fold, (right), Jumper and culottes, both \u00a339.50, top, \u00a335, M&S; Boots, \u00a3450, L>K>Bennett; Scarf, \u00a39.99, H&M\n\nNow, womenswear has been streamlined into the main collection for basics; Autograph, which will focus on higher-priced classics such as leather coats and cashmere; and the \u2018new\u2019 Per Una. Its ad campaign stars model Lineisy Montero looking windswept and glamorous on a Dorset beach. So, what of the clothes? Fussy detail and frumpy shapes are out. Silhouettes are simple and more in tune with current trends, but without any whiff of the one-season wonder.\n\nInstead, pieces are beautifully cut with a twist here and there to give some edge \u2014 a chunky oatmeal roll-neck with blouson sleeves, for example. Outerwear has always been one of M&S\u2019s strengths and there are, of course, some fabulous coats, too.\n\nIn the past, M&S hasn\u2019t shouted about the fact all its prints are designed in-house, but pattern is front and centre here. And there are some great statement pieces \u2014 a gold velvet trouser suit; a silky two-piece with contrasting hems \u2014 which echo the catwalks, but also offer the real-life comfort you\u2019d expect from M&S. All hail the half-elasticated waistband . . .\n\n(Left), Jumper, \u00a345, and dress, \u00a355, M&S; Boots, \u00a3179.99, Mango, (right), Coat, \u00a3119, jumper, \u00a339.50, and skirt, \u00a349.50, all M&S; Boots, \u00a389.99, Zara\n\nM&S\u2019s recent woes are well-known, with falling sales and fierce competition. But now, CEO Steve Rowe, who took over in 2016, is implementing a host of changes and has enlisted a dynamic duo \u2014 the store\u2019s head of womenswear design Lisa Illis joined 18 months ago, having worked for the likes of Mulberry and Joseph, while Jill Stanton took up the role of womenswear and kidswear director for M&S last summer.\n\nJudging by this collection, they could once again persuade us all to head to Marks\u2019 for more than salmon en croute...", "description": "M&S's oldest brand Per Una has been revamped to reflect a younger aesthetic look as the former giant looks to lure in new shoppers.
