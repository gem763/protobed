We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us, and that\u2019s OK. They did well when they fought with us. They didn\u2019t do so well when they didn\u2019t fight with us.\u201d\n\nTrump has faced harsh criticism for his handling of the situation, including from fellow Republicans. He is scheduled to host congressional leaders at the White House later on Wednesday as lawmakers ready sanctions against Ankara.\n\n\u201cI viewed the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be for the United States strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe. They\u2019ve got to work it out. Maybe they can do it without fighting,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s vice president and top diplomat are scheduled to travel to Ankara to meet with Erdogan, who Trump has invited to the White House next month. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier on Wednesday said the goal was to seek a ceasefire.\n\nErdogan, speaking to reporters in the Turkish parliament earlier on Wednesday, said he was re-evaluating his planned visit to Washington in November but may visit Russia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching and we\u2019re negotiating and we\u2019re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, because we\u2019d like to stop wars regardless,\u201d Trump said, adding that it was \u201cfine\u201d for Russia to help Syria.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday played down the crisis in Syria touched off by Turkey's incursion against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces, saying the conflict was between Turkey and Syria and that it was up to the countries there to work it out.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
