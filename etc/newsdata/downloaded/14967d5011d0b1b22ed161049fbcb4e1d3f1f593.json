Ultimately whatever emerges as his Brexit plan has to be tested in a final say referendum. That is the only fair and democratic outcome. And that is why, on Saturday 19 October, vast numbers of people will gather in London for one of the biggest political demonstrations Britain has ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s vote organisers said: \u201cThis Brexit crisis has now come down to a simple question about whether we live in a democracy: can we allow Boris Johnson to force no deal \u2013 or another vicious form of Brexit \u2013 on our country, without all of us having our voice heard?\n\n\u201cThe only way to break the deadlock in Parliament, legitimise the outcome and allow us all to talk about something else, is to give the people the final say.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of an agreement between the UK and EU appears slim.\n\nEU leaders have told Mr Johnson there is no way to strike a Brexit agreement before this week\u2019s summit, destroying his hopes of presenting a deal to parliament at a special sitting on Saturday.\n\nLabour MP Margaret Beckett, co-chair of the People\u2019s Vote political committee said: \u201cThe kind of deal previously proposed by Theresa May would have left the UK significantly worse off and an ever-growing number of MPs from all parties concluded that it would be wrong to impose this on the people without going back to them to check that they still want to go ahead.\n\n\u201cBut on every test \u2013 trade, productivity and growth \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals are worse than those of Theresa May which were rejected three times by the House of Commons. Now we know the real cost of the kind of Brexit Boris Johnson is proposing, the only fair and democratic way to solve this crisis is to let the people decide in a final say referendum.\u201d", "description": "There are just five days to go until the last major anti-Brexit demonstration before the UK is due to leave the European Union\u00a0on 31 October.\u00a0\u00a0 Thousands are expected to march on the streets of London\u00a0on Saturday 19 October to demand a Final Say\u00a0vote on\u00a0the terms of any deal secured Boris Johnson, or whether the UK should leave at all.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/22/09/final-say-angela-17.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
