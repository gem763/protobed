The supposed best and faced him at his skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"It was supposed to be reciprocated. I would box him, he would fight me, but it didn't turn out that way.\"\n\nMayweather won the boxing match between the pair with an 11th round stoppage, while McGregor has since returned to mixed martial arts.\n\nHe is set to make his eagerly-awaited return on January 18, but an opponent is yet to be confirmed.", "description": "The rapper has hit out at McGregor on social media over his bus attack and loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images", "Instagram", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740746.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2019-Rolling-Loud-New-York.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
