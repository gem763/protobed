The list provides advance notice of some promising funds that you might want to put on your watchlist.\n\nProspects strategies remain on the list until the team is comfortable assigning a Morningstar Analyst Rating. Alternatively, they sometimes drop from the list if there are negative fundamental changes, such as investment team turnover or a material change to the investment process, or if investor interest isn't strong enough to maintain coverage.", "description": "A few fixed-income strategies of interest from the June 2019 Morningstar Prospects report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt1a4603afc8bf6e59/5c76b9bbe9cab2096292b787/BenjaminJoseph_1x1.jpg"}
