And that hasn't been true.'\n\nIn response, Salazar told the New York Times in an email: 'I'm sorry Mo feels that way, but I've never lied to anyone about anything related to this investigation. Before even USADA brought this case, I made public my views regarding the allegations in this case.'\n\nSalazar was found guilty after a four-year investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency of trafficking testosterone, attempting to tamper with the doping control process, and administering a prohibited method of infusion.\n\nFarah, who has faced no allegations of wrongdoing, will run in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday.", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN CHICAGO: Alberto Salazar insists he did not mislead Sir Mo Farah over the doping scandal that has brought their relationship back into the spotlight.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/20/19634094-0-image-a-10_1570908017364.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
