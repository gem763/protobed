SCMP/K.Y. Cheng\n\nTycoon Li Ka-shing has called on those in power to show humanity and provide a way out for young people in Hong Kong\u2019s protest crisis, describing them as the \u201cmasters of our future\u201d who also needed to consider the city\u2019s overall interests.\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time about the worsening civil unrest, the 91-year-old billionaire said on Sunday evening that justice might have to be tempered with mercy on political issues.\n\nLi was greeting participants during a religious gathering where 1,000 Buddhists assembled at Tsz Shan Monastery in Tai Po to pray for Hong Kong.\n\nHe took out advertisements in some local newspapers last month, calling for an end to the violence.\n\nLi touched on the unrest again on Sunday. The billionaire described the situation as \u201cthe worst blow dealt to Hong Kong except the second world war\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe hope Hong Kong will be able to ride out the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope the young people can take the big picture into consideration. For those at the helm, we hope they can give the masters of our future a way out.\n\nRead also: Li Ka Shing left a cryptic phrase about melons on the front page of Hong Kong\u2019s papers. Here\u2019s what it really means.\n\n\u201cAlthough [showing] humanity may sometimes collide with the rule of law, in political issues, both sides should try to put their feet in another\u2019s shoes, then many of the big troubles can be reduced into small ones,\u201d Li said.\n\nIt was unclear if Li was calling on the government to declare an amnesty for those arrested during demonstrations, a key demand of protesters.\n\nA spokesman for the monastery said: \u201cMr Li feels worried about the escalating violence in society and that its impacts on the rule of law in Hong Kong are unacceptable.\n\n\u201cHe believes that to keep society in harmony, people should treat others as they would themselves. He hopes we can overcome the difficulty and all sides can work towards the benefit of all for the sake of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been gripped by protests triggered by the now-shelved extradition bill since June, with violent clashes between radical demonstrators and police escalating.\n\nOutbreaks of violence during demonstrations as well as vandalism of MTR stations are a common occurrence.\n\nLast month, the city\u2019s business leaders went public, one by one, to condemn the chaos and violence triggered by the anti-government protests.\n\nLi took out advertisements in some of the city\u2019s newspapers. Two full-page statements \u2013 one in colour and the other in black and white \u2013 were signed by \u201cHong Kong resident Li Ka-shing\u201d.\n\nThe colour one was more straightforward, dominated by the Chinese character for \u201cviolence\u201d with a cross through it, flanked by slogans about loving China and loving Hong Kong. At the bottom, it said \u201cstop anger and violence in the name of love\u201d.\n\nBut the advert had an interesting header that said \u201cthe best of intentions can lead to the worst outcome\u201d. It did not specify what \u201cthe best of intentions\u201d referred to.\n\nThe black-and-white statement was minimalist in style. Apart from the header and signature, it contained only eight Chinese characters, which literally translated as: \u201cThe melon of Huangtai cannot bear the picking again.\u201d\n\nIt meant that something had suffered so much that further attack would ruin it.\n\nThe ambiguous wording of his adverts sparked speculation that he was trying to walk a tightrope, attempting not to side too much with the Hong Kong government, Beijing or the protesters.\n\nSOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The billionaire says \u2018both sides should try to put their feet in another\u2019s shoes\u2019, to turn big troubles into small ones..
