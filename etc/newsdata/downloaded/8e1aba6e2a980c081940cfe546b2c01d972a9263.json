The youngest of the KarJenner clan is seen headless on the front cover, clad in a red bra and matching panties.\n\nInside, Scott interviews Jenner about life, their respective careers and more. During one particularly saccharine exchange, Scott asks why Jenner thinks their relationship works.\n\n\u201cWe think the same and we have the same goals and passions in life. Besides the fact that we have good chemistry, we have a lot of fun together. You\u2019re my best friend. Through all the ups and downs that every relationship has, we evolve together through them and keep getting stronger,\u201d Jenner replied.\n\nAw, young love.\n\nScott responded to that answer by saying, \u201cA lot of people claim that having a baby can hurt your sex life, but I feel like that\u2019s the opposite of our experience.\u201d\n\nJenner, who the magazine tells us was laughing, says she feels \u201clike we\u2019ve definitely proven that rumor to be wrong.\u201d\n\nWell, there you have it. The wealthy couple in their 20s, who share 1-year-old daughter Stormi Webster, say they\u2019re still having great sex. What a delight for them!", "description": "The rapper and the lipstick mogul talked candidly in Playboy about their sexcapades after having daughter Stormi Webster.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bb0182400002e2a79738c.jpeg?cache=1r70sd0tfk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
