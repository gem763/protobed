They don\u2019t have children and don\u2019t want them \u2013 her decision I think \u2013 which is hugely disappointing for my husband and me, as he\u2019s our only child.\n\nI\u2019ve tried so hard with her over the years, but from the start she\u2019s been cold, distant and unwilling to have any kind of relationship with us. She\u2019s polite, but that\u2019s it.\n\nMy son says she had a difficult time with her own family (she\u2019s never met her dad and her mum passed away). She has one sister she never sees.\n\nI thought this alone would make her keen to be a part of our family, but it seems I was wrong.\n\nAll she seems interested in is her job, their dog and local friends \u2013 she\u2019s never once suggested anything social involving us and attends family events grudgingly. It makes me so sad when I see all my friends have such great \u00adrelationships with their children\u2019s \u00adpartners and families, and enjoy being grandparents. It breaks my heart that I can\u2019t connect with the person who\u2019s most important to my son.\n\nTheir relationship has always seemed good \u2013 they\u2019re close and enjoy the same things and love going on adventurous holidays.\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame she\u2019s not interested in being part of our family.\n\nColeen says\n\nSadly, it\u2019s not a given that we\u2019re going to get on with \u2013 or even like \u2013 our child\u2019s choice of partner. I can tell this is upsetting for you, but I wonder if you\u2019re also grieving over not becoming a grandparent, and I totally get that.\n\nWhen we have kids, we have certain expectations of what the future will hold, rightly or wrongly, and it\u2019s hard to accept you won\u2019t be a \u00adgrandparent if that\u2019s something you hoped for.\n\nIt\u2019s especially difficult if you\u2019re seeing all your mates enjoying their \u00adgrandkids. Perhaps your son and his wife will change their minds on becoming parents but, if not, you have to accept it\u2019s their decision.\n\nAs far as getting on with your daughter-in-law, as long as you still have a good relationship with your son and she makes him happy, then maybe that will have to be enough.\n\nPerhaps she finds it hard to relate to you and your husband because she has nothing to go on \u2013 her own upbringing sounds so fragmented she\u2019s \u00adprobably still working through all of that.\n\nBut she has found love and formed a great relationship with your son, which is wonderful. And they sound happy. I think as long as she knows she\u2019s welcome in your home and she knows you\u2019re there for her if she ever wants a deeper relationship, that\u2019s all you can do.\n\nAnd of course, you can remind your son of this, too.", "description": "All she seems interested in is her job, their dog and local friends", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544772.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Worried-mother-teenage-daughter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
