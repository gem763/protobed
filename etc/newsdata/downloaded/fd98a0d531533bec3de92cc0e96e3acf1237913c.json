Several people were missing in a town near Tokyo after a landslide destroyed two houses, NHK said.\n\nExperts warned that Tokyo, while long conditioned to prepare for earthquakes, was vulnerable to flooding.\n\nTokyo, where 1.5 million people live below sea level, is prone to damage from storm surges, Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe are heading toward high tide. If the typhoon hits Tokyo when the tide is high, that could cause storm surges and that would be the scariest scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in Tokyo have been in a false sense of security.\u201d\n\nMore than 60,000 households have lost power, including 14,900 in Chiba, which was hit hard by typhoon Faxai a month ago, the industry ministry said.", "description": "Hagibis is wreaking havoc on mainland Japan and is expected to bring with it the heaviest rain and winds in sixty years.
