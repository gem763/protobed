Email webnews@mirror.co.uk\n\n(Image: Epic Games)\n\nAt nearly 20GB, the update is pretty huge, suggesting Fortnite Chapter 2 could be a big change from Chapter 1.\n\nEpic Games is yet to release the patch notes for the update, although a trailer was leaked earlier this morning, giving us a hint of what\u2019s in store.\n\nData miner SkinTrackerCom leaked the trailer, which suggests players will be able to travel around the island on boats - a new travel method that was leaked on the App Store last week.\n\nIt also indicates there will be a new way to level via medals, as well as over 100 new rewards.\n\nMeanwhile, for those wanting to take it easy during the game, fishing seems to be available in Chapter 2.\n\nFollowing the blackout, Fortnite\u2019s Twitter page has also now been restored, after Epic Games 'deleted' all tweets.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many players have taken to Twitter to express their excitement at the imminent update.\n\nOne user said: \"I never in my life thought I\u2019d be excited about Fortnite. Turning over a new leaf AND I can\u2019t wait. A new era. It\u2019s time.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Fortnite Chapter 2: Season 1 looks lit! I can't wait to play it.\"\n\nAnd one joked: \"Having no fortnite for over 24 hours has made me go outside do stuff I don\u2019t normally do and I want fortnite back , please hurry up.\"", "description": "After almost two days of downtime, the Fortnite blackout has finally ended", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Epic Games"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575797.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fortnite-black-hole-Mums-say-kids-are-heartbroken-and-feel-world-has-ended.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
