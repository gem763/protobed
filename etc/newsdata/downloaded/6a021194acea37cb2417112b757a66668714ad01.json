Oppressive leftist policies even pervert what it means to \u201cpursue happiness,\u201d replacing the hard work required to realize personal dreams with an empty promise of happiness through instant gratification.\n\nThe \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d involves effort. No one can hand happiness to us: It is something we must work toward.\n\nGod created us in His image, with each of us reflecting glimpses of His magnificence. Some are created to be musicians, others writers or teachers. Some have abilities to excel in business, to champion a cause, or are imbued with the gift of hospitality. It is in discovering our own talents, and then developing and using them, that brings deep personal fulfillment.\n\nIn other words, we find our greatest happiness when we spend our time pursuing what we were created to do.\n\nDiscovering our purpose and doing our best to achieve it is a God-ordained right, and entire nations thrive or vanish depending on if they infringe upon this sacred prerogative.\n\nAny accomplished dancer, welder, chef or nurse will tell you it takes hard work and long hours to develop innate talents in order to exercise them to their fullest potential.\n\nTragically, that right is infringed when oppressive governments seek to foster a sense of dependency. Far too many Americans have fallen for the allure of the siren song of instant gratification. It\u2019s just so much easier to take the cash and avoid the work required to overcome adversity in order to achieve our dreams. Falling into this trance robs people of much happiness.\n\nIt also destroys liberties as the takers gradually become ensnared by the strings that are always attached to easy money.\n\nWhen governments erect unnecessary barriers that inhibit innovation and creativity, they also rob people of the opportunity to pursue their dreams.\n\nBoth the fulfillment that comes with personal achievement and the deep satisfaction that comes with trying your best, but failing and having the ability and the guts to try again, are essential to human happiness. Government has a duty to stay out of the way of those who wish to relentlessly pursue their dreams.\n\nWhen governments play God and restrict the pursuit of happiness through endless regulations and bureaucratic paperwork, they shatter dreams and set people up for failure.\n\nSpirits are crushed, and society suffers from stagnation. Hearts begin to fill with hopelessness, despair and a feeling of \u201cwhy even bother?\u201d Such negative attitudes affect the fabric of the nation and result in malaise. There is no happiness in that.\n\nJust as policies designed to oppress freedom and limit our potential lead to human misery, so do the policies of those who foolishly believe in liberty absent moral standards established by an omniscient God.\n\nThe result is anarchy at worst, and cultural chaos at best. True liberty is only possible when it is ordered by God\u2019s natural law.\n\nIt was John Adams who said, \u201cOur Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that every American must be a person of faith in order for our nation to be marked by a culture of life and liberty.\n\nIt does mean that if America bans God and his guidance from our institutions, if we prohibit believers to freely practice their faith, if we fail to seek His guidance and protection, then we will suffer the natural consequences of the choices that we have made.\n\nThe cure to our cultural ills does not reside in government. America will never conquer the growing cancers of heartbreak, anger and violence with mindless feel-good legislation.\n\nCultural healing will only come when the people can fully enjoy their rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And that is only possible when America is \u201cone nation under God.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Rebecca Hagelin can be reached at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
