And what Liverpool have to do is capitalise as much.\n\n\"And not just not think eight points is a great lead; try and make it 10, make it 12, if possible. Especially while City have problems at the back, like having Laporte out.\n\n\"Because there is no doubt that when Laporte is back and City back on their feet, they\u2019re a team capable of doing exactly what Liverpool are doing and going and winning 17, 18 games.\"", "description": "Liverpool are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League but Man City have been hampered by a couple of serious injuries", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Getty Images", "Manchester City Fc Via Getty Ima"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554753.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-10-at-175744.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
