It\u2019s a chance to out-do ourselves by pushing our creative boundaries and showing off our passions. We\u2019re always trying to one-up what we\u2019ve done before. For the iPhone 11 Pro review, the one to beat was the opening shot of our Galaxy Fold review.\n\nThis time around, we wanted to try something slightly more ambitious than usual, so we\u2019ve documented all the steps that it took for the final shot to come together. Here\u2019s the rundown on how that eye-popping opening shot above was created, which involved spray paint, fishing wire, motorized rigs, and a little post-production magic.\n\nWe started by pre-visualizing the setup in Cinema 4D by mocking up a table, a lightbox (with a 3D area light), floaty objects, and an iPhone 11 Pro model.\n\nOnce we had a pre-visualization, we moved on to re-creating it in our studio. First, we spray-painted the floating objects. (Fortunately, Verge video director Becca Farsace had already done this in advance!)\n\nThen, using fishing wire, we spaced out the objects above a lightbox in our studio, leaving a placeholder where the iPhone 11 Pro would ultimately be placed. (More on that later.)\n\nWe decided it\u2019d be more practical to do the rotation in post, but we wanted to get a parallax effect, so we set up a camera on an automated dolly. We used a fairly wide lens and shot at a higher frame rate since we knew we\u2019d need extra room on all edges of the frame and might need to re-time the footage.\n\nWe then let the whole setup sit untouched for about two hours while we worked on other parts of the review. When you shoot objects you want to be frozen in the air, and they\u2019re hanging from fishing line, they have to be absolutely motionless or the effect can be ruined. We then shot the camera push about five or six times until we were sure we got it.\n\nThen, we moved the camera to the final position and started cutting the objects down one at a time, being extremely careful with the order in which they fell based on their position and weight so they wouldn\u2019t interact too much.\n\nNext, we brought the footage into After Effects where, after a bit of rotoscoping and comping, we matched up the timing of all the falling objects.\n\nAfter that felt good, we moved on to getting the actual phone in the sequence. We agreed earlier that filming the phone at the same time would have been a nightmare, so we filmed it separately in a completely different studio.\n\nWe replicated the lighting setup from the previous shot \u2014 except, this time, everything was on its side. We filmed a few 360-degree rotations of the phone so that we could match the lighting of the earlier shot. We then brought that footage in and stabilized it so the phone was locked in place and had the light rotating around it.\n\nWe then masked out the phone, which basically means removing everything else from the frame (the table, motorized head, cables, etc). Then, we combined the phone with the falling objects into one sequence, made all of the final tweaks (then made some more final tweaks), added the title, (one last final tweak), and boom:\n\nMagic.", "description": "The few times a year when we review flagship phones like the newest iPhone, Galaxy Note, or Google Pixel, The Verge\u2019s video team aims to open these video reviews with a \"hero\" shot, which is a sequence that reveals the product in a really creative and beautiful way.", "authors": ["William Joel", "Grayson Blackmon", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycaM9jUlehCOFh8QHrRV83f_qj4=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208436/iPhone11_BTS_Lede_v001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
