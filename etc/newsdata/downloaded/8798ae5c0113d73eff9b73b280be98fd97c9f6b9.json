The documents obtained by the Post, however, suggest FINTRAC has at least considered the possibility that legalization could provide an avenue through which ill-gotten gains could be laundered.\n\n\u201cFINTRAC routinely conducts analyses of transaction reports, open source information and other material to assess the impact of both legitimate and illicit activities on money laundering and terrorist activity financing,\u201d the centre said.\n\nSo far, legalization has only partially displaced the black market, leaving legal and illegal industries to compete with each other. Statistics Canada said 42 per cent of cannabis consumers in the second quarter reported they bought at least some of their pot from illegal sources.\n\nMoney laundering has been on the radar in the current election campaign, but only as it pertains to the real-estate sector, where the phenomenon is believed to have contributed to soaring house prices in major markets in British Columbia and Ontario.\n\n\u201cWe have this particularly odd situation where you can set up a corporation in Canada and never know who the shareholders are,\u201d anti-money-laundering lawyer Christine Duhaime told the Post.\n\nThe Senate of Canada proposed an amendment to Canada\u2019s marijuana-legalization law that would have publicized people who directly or indirectly own or control cannabis companies, but it was dropped from the final bill after it went back to the House of Commons, said James Cohen, executive director of anti-corruption not-for-profit Transparency International Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anonymous companies that allow the flow of funds from criminals like drug dealers, kleptocrats overseas and tax dodgers at home and abroad,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThe cannabis industry has unique characteristics that companies trying to stay on the right side of anti-money-laundering rules must consider. Lawyers from McCarthy T\u00e9trault LLP wrote in May, for example, that legal considerations around financing cannabis businesses \u201cinclude the preference of some cannabis retail customers to using cash as a payment method, concerns around privacy, and the risks associated with the supply of cannabis to ensure its provenance from legal sources.\u201d\n\nFINTRAC has published several explainers on its website of how entities that report to it, such as banks, could navigate the world of legalized cannabis.\n\nIn one such policy interpretation, FINTRAC is asked if various entities will be expected to report all transactions conducted by legal cannabis businesses as suspicious.\n\n\u201cIf one or more transaction conducted by a legal cannabis business leads a reporting entity to determine that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or the attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, then an STR (suspicious transaction report) must be submitted to FINTRAC,\u201d says an answer dated the same day as Canada\u2019s legalization of cannabis.\n\nAnother question asks about what should be considered when assessing the risk of a cannabis business. FINTRAC suggested considering whether or not a business has the proper licenses and if its transactions are \u201cconsistent with what is expected from other retailers or similar types of businesses.\u201d\n\nIn another answer with the same date, FINTRAC said there \u201care no special or additional requirements\u201d under Canada\u2019s anti-money-laundering legislation or its related regulations when it comes to a legal cannabis company.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d it adds, \u201cwhen a reporting entity considers opening an account for a legal cannabis business, as for any business, they must assess and document the risk(s), taking the above into consideration, as part of their compliance program\u2019s policies and procedures and risk-based approach.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Documents obtained by the Financial Post suggest FINTRAC has considered if legalization could provide an avenue for ill-gotten gains to be laundered", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cannabis-mney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
