An iconic veteran Hollywood filmmaker (or comedian) tosses off a negative comment about superhero movies; 2. Media outlets quote the shade and any prominent response; 3. Social media hyperventilates like kids on the playground shouting \"Fight, fight!\", while largely ignoring the bigger picture.\n\nThe most recent case stars Francis Ford Coppola, who ratcheted up the disparaging comments about superhero movies made early in October (and reiterated on Monday) by fellow Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese.\n\nBecause Step No. 2 (as outlined above) is obligatory to move forward, here's the recap: Scorsese said that superhero films, as studios like Marvel create them, are \"not cinema\", likening such movies more to theme park entertainment. Then, Coppola, speaking while being honoured at the Lumiere festival in Lyon, France, intensified matters last Saturday by saying: \"Martin was being kind when he said it wasn't cinema. He didn't say it was despicable, which is what I say.\"\n\n\"Despicable\": Francis Ford Coppola, see here at the Lumiere festival in Lyon, is no fan of superhero films. Getty\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy and Suicide Squad sequel filmmaker James Gunn promptly responded on social media. \"Some superhero films are awful, some are beautiful,\" he wrote. \"Like westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that's OK.\"\n\nScorsese re-upped his concerns at the Rome Film Festival this week, saying \"the 'amusement park' comic books films, they're taking over the theatres. They can have those films and it's fine, but that shouldn't become what our young people believe is cinema\".\n\nAmid the hubbub and quick clicks is one pressing question: Why do film fans even care so hotly about what the two towering auteurs have to say about the contents of a mainstream superhero movie, especially given Scorsese's admission that he doesn't watch them? Would we care if a decorated chef like Jo\u00ebl Robuchon or Gordon Ramsay said he lacked a personal taste for even the world's best hot buttered popcorn, generally flavoured to appeal to the most people possible?\n\nTodd Phillips' \"Joker\" reminds us that superhero stories can be fertile ground for reinvention and adaptation.\n\nAll this unfolds as Todd Phillips' non-superhero superhero movie Joker \u2013 to which Scorsese was attached early on as a producer \u2013 becomes one of the highest grossing R-rated movies ever - $US737 million ($1.1 billion) worldwide and counting - with its heavy homage to Scorsese's urban alienation films. (Joker also features a cameo by Marc Maron, who got into his own recent Twitter fight after throwing around mockingly negative comments about superhero movies like so much live bait.)\n\nJoker, much like HBO's new critically acclaimed Watchmen series, reminds us that superhero-world stories can be fertile ground for reinvention and adaptation, just as creators at the dawn of the superhero industry were inspired by noir and gangster movies.", "description": "Fans of action movies don't need the paternal approval of Hollywood godfathers Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7961%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_223%2C$y_142/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/93129b82b6a4a328253ced65be478d011027c34c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
