Immediately after the disqualification, the Dimond HS swim coach filed a protest with the official to contest the decision. The coach's protest was quickly denied at the meet, and we expect the coach to appeal. We intend to gather all the facts surrounding the disqualification so we can accurately address the matter with officials and take appropriate action to ensure fair, equitable competition and consistent application of the rules for this athlete and her peers.\"\n\nLauren Langford, the coach at nearby West High, wrote a blog post on Medium.com titled \"Alaska\u2019s Inexcusable Swimsuit Scandal Unfairly Polices Young Girls' Bodies\" providing additional details and touching on some of the outrage the decision caused.\n\nLangford wrote the swimmer \"was targeted for the way the suit fit her curvier, fuller-figured body.\"\n\n\n\nShe also said there is a racial element in play, pointing out \"the officials are overheard acknowledging that white athletes are baring too much skin as well, yet they\u2019ve never been disqualified for a similar violation.\"", "description": "A high school swimmer in Anchorage, Alaska, was reportedly disqualified following a win on Friday because an official thought her swimsuit was too revealing...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/514/hi-res-847d0e5d5d80d24d94c8da6f50bf4369_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
