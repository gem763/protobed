Critics of the change however alleged it will weaken regulation and was being pushed through by politicians linked to lucrative private medical colleges. The weaker regime would give their colleges a free hand to admit as many high-fee paying students as they want, one senior PMDC source alleged.", "description": "Pakistan has abolished its main medical registration body in a move the government says will raise doctors' standards and stamp out fraud, but opposition parties and doctors say is undemocratic.", "authors": ["Ben Farmer", "Stephanie Flanders", "Yuki Sugiura"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000188328685-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU4HJ4AiiGZy0TyJNCL1chkS7DJv_ZtR2aEUv10dgoQM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
