It was submitted for the 2020 Grammys in categories like song and record of the year \u2014 where songwriters and producers also earn nominations; the Recording Academy will announce its nominees on Nov. 20.\n\n\"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand,\" Justin Raisen wrote.\n\nLizzo is currently selling T-shirts on her website that read \"100% that bitch \" \u2014 the line created by Lioness (She didn't immediately reply to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment).\n\n\"If Ricky and Lizzo's team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy,\" Justin Raisen wrote.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
