The Chinese derided Zuckerberg\u2019s claims as \u201cabsurd and hilarious.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg made the remarks in question during an interview with NBC News on Monday as part of Facebook\u2019s rollout of new measures to thwart election interference:\n\n\u201cWe continue to see [Russian and Iranain] tactics are evolving,\u201d Zuckerberg said in the interview with Lester Holt, which will air Monday evening on \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d \u201cToday, what we\u2019re basically announcing is that we found a set of campaigns. They are highly sophisticated. They signal that these nation-states intend to be active in the upcoming elections.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg added that China has also been found to have tried to interfere in various elections, but that the company has been able to find and stop them.\n\n\u201cWe do see today Russia and Iran and China increasingly with more sophisticated tactics are trying to interfere in elections,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut part of why I\u2019m confident going into 2020 is that we\u2019ve played a role in defending against interference in every major election around the world since 2016, in France, in Germany, in the E.U. overall, in India, in Mexico, in Brazil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat we\u2019ve been able to proactively identify them and take them down is somewhat of a signal that our systems are much more advanced now than they have been in the past,\u201d Zuckerberg said.", "description": "The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismisses Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's allegations of election interference.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mark-Zuckerberg-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
