(AP) - For Michigan State, the speed of Ohio State is followed up this week by the strength of Wisconsin.\n\nThe Spartans, who are playing back-to-back road games against Associated Press top-10 teams for the first time since 1990, are in Madison on Saturday for the No. 8 Badgers.\n\nThe Michigan State defense will need to contain running back Jonathan Taylor, a Heisman Trophy candidate who has a streak of 10 straight 100-yard rushing games.\n\nDefensive coordinator Mike Tressel said there\u2019s no secret to slowing down Wisconsin, which averages nearly 320 pounds across the starting offensive line with five in-state recruits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the notes every year: They are who they are, they\u2019re going to do exactly what you see on tape,\u201d Tressel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like old school: Pro, NFL, Packers, it\u2019s going to be 40 degrees, snow in the morning I heard. It\u2019s going to be old school football, which is sort of Spartan football, right?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Michigan State football last weekend.\n\nThe Spartans lost 34-10 to No. 3 Ohio State on Saturday as big plays blew open the game in the second quarter. The Buckeyes had two scoring plays of 60 yards or more during a 24-point quarter.\n\nMissed tackles by Michigan State (4-2, 2-1 Big Ten) contributed to Binjimen Victor\u2019s 60-yard reception, while a failed desperate attempt by Josiah Scott to force a fumble contributed to a 67-yard scoring run by J.K. Dobbins for Ohio State.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just punch the ball out,\u201d Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. \u201cYou have to wrap, tackle the guy.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans should have plenty of chances to tackle Taylor, the nation\u2019s leading scorer with 16 touchdowns and second-leading rusher at 149.0 yards per game for Wisconsin (5-0, 2-0).\n\nDespite Dobbins rushing for 172 yards to lead Ohio State\u2019s 323-yard output on the ground, Michigan State remains one of the nation\u2019s top run defenses (21st in FBS) after leading the country last year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sick,\u201d Tressel said of the Spartans\u2019 defensive players. \u201cI\u2019m sick. That\u2019s not what we do and we\u2019re upset about it. Probably there\u2019s a lot to be said that people are trying to do too much.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing what we call zeroing ourselves out, where we hit guys right in the middle where we can make both plays. You know what, your job is not to make both plays. Your job is to be on this edge of the man, make this play.\u201d\n\nWhile Ohio State featured zone blocking up front, Dantonio said Wisconsin mixes zone and gap schemes in front of Taylor.\n\n\u201cIt is a different type of attack,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201c(Taylor is) an outstanding running back. Not sure who is better, (Dobbins) or him, but both very, very good running backs.\u201d\n\nMichigan State defensive tackle Raequan Williams, who had a career-high eight tackles against Ohio State, said he has no preference on the blocking scheme he faces.\n\n\u201cI just like playing the run,\u201d Williams said. \u201cKeep running it, I can get a lot of action.\u201d\n\nThe Badgers have outscored teams by an average of 37.6 points per game, with Northwestern the only team to finish within 20 points of them. Dantonio pointed out Northwestern kept Wisconsin to 130 rushing yards.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where it\u2019s got to start,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to stop the run against these guys.\u201d\n\nMichigan State\u2019s own rushing attack suffered a blow Tuesday, as the school confirmed running back La\u2019Darius Jefferson has entered the transfer portal.\n\nJefferson, a sophomore, was the second running back to enter the portal this season, joining junior Connor Heyward.\n\nJefferson rushed for 255 yards and two touchdowns last season and accumulated 25 yards on 19 attempts with two scores this season.\n\nJunior linebacker Brandon Bouyer-Randle is also looking to transfer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For Michigan State, the speed of Ohio State is followed up this week by the strength of Wisconsin.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Schoch"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/michigan_st_ohio_st_football_58901_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
