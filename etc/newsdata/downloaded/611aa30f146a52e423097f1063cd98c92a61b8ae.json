Cory Booker of New Jersey suggested Saturday that his struggling campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination could soon end over lack of support.\n\nMr. Booker said that his presidential campaign needs to raise nearly $2 million within nine days to remain viable.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an end-of-quarter stunt,\u201d Mr. Booker said on Twitter. \u201cWe need to raise $1.7 million by September 30 to be in a position to build the organization we need to compete for the nomination\u2014and we can do it\u2014but if we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t see a legitimate long-term path forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue this without more support,\u201d Mr. Booker told CNN later Saturday. \u201cI won\u2019t continue this unless I can look people in the eye and say we have a chance to win it.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, separately wrote in a memo posted online Saturday that the deadline will determine whether or not he can remain in the race.\n\n\u201cSeptember is traditionally one of the strongest fundraising months for presidential campaigns. But after a surprisingly positive August, we simply have not witnessed the expected uptick in fundraising over the last three weeks,\u201d wrote Mr. Demissie. \u201cTo put it bluntly, we need to scale our operation up in October and November to remain competitive and need a strong September to make that happen.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s campaign previously reported fundraising more than $5 million during the first quarter of 2019 and more than $4.5 million during the second \u2013 a fraction of the amount raised by Democratic frontrunners during that same span.\n\nNationwide polling has placed Mr. Booker, a former mayor of Newark first who first won his Senate seat in a 2013 special election, as among the top 10 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to run against President Trump in 2020, albeit far behind the contest\u2019s current frontrunners: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat.\n\nStatewide polling conducted earlier this month among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters in New Jersey put Mr. Booker in fourth place behind Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, respectively.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
