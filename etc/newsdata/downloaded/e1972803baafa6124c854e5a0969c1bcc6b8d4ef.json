Trump supporters are communist and racist,\u201d Ajple reportedly told the arresting deputy. \u201cI don\u2019t even care that I\u2019m going to jail; this is actually exciting.\u201d\n\nAjple was charged with battery and taken to the Indian River County Jail. He posted $500 bond Saturday morning and is due back in court on November 19.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump supporters wearing MAGA hats have faced violence. In April, a black immigrant Trump supporter wearing a MAGA hat was beaten in Maryland, and in August, a New York City man also said he was beaten for wearing the pro-Trump hat.", "description": "A Florida man is accused of spitting on a man wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) hat in a Vero Beach restaurant on Friday evening.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Matthias-Ajple-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
