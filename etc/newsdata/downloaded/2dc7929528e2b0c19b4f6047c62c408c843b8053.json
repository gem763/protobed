They must act on impeachment now.", "language": "en", "text": "Sure, the Republican-dominated Senate might not convict the president with a necessary two-thirds vote if the House impeaches (although the silence from many Republican senators suggests they are still deciding what do to). But impeaching the president for an abuse of power in soliciting foreign help in the election will serve three purposes even if there is no conviction and removal from office.\n\nFirst, it could deter the president from trying this maneuver again in the 2020 election cycle. The Mueller report did not dissuade this conduct, but an actual impeachment could be more likely to get his attention. Either way, Democrats don\u2019t have another option to try to prevent this president from corrupting this election. Indeed, Trump has shown time and again that without any deterrence he will cheat to win, whether it was the campaign finance crime he allegedly ordered his fixer Michael Cohen to commit to cover up hush money payments to an adult film performer, or his embrace of Russia\u2019s election interference during the 2016 election.\n\nSecond, there still will be national security officials and others privy to the calls the president makes to foreign leaders, and quick impeachment on this front demonstrates there will be the risk of more whistleblowers should he try this again.\n\nThird, and most importantly, impeachment will get the American public\u2019s attention during the presidential election cycle.", "description": "", "authors": ["Richard Hasen", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Democrats-Should-Impeach-Donald-Trump-Fast-Ukraine.Html"], "top_image": ""}
