The Rangers won 10-4.(Nick Wass)\n\nSunday\u2019s matchup with the Texas Rangers marked the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 fifth shot to match their 2018 win total after they reached 46 victories in the first game of Tuesday\u2019s doubleheader with the Tampa Bay Rays. Like the previous four, it ended with them still at 46.\n\nThe Rangers completed a four-game sweep of the Orioles with a 10-4 victory Sunday at Camden Yards, handing Baltimore its fifth losing streak of at least five games in 2019.\n\nSunday\u2019s defeat was similar to Saturday\u2019s, with a pitcher who joined the Orioles (46-97) in the middle of the season struggling from the onset. Asher Wojciechowski performed well in his first month with the club, but Sunday\u2019s start of four runs in two innings gave him a 7.05 ERA since Aug. 1. His 151\u2154 innings between the Orioles and the Cleveland Indians\u2019 Class AAA affiliate are his most since he threw 160 in the Houston Astros\u2019 system in 2013.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel it, but it\u2019s my job to pitch this amount of innings,\u201d Wojciechowski said. \u201cI\u2019d say for the last few weeks, definitely am feeling the effects of it. You can see just the life on my fastball, the sharpness of all my pitches. But I\u2019ve got to be able to find a way to get through it, just like today. It was a struggle. Six singles and four runs. I feel like the ball didn\u2019t really fall my way today. I\u2019ve got to find a way. I\u2019ve got to finish strong.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers (72-73) struck first on a single by Nick Solak in the first inning, and when Solak came up again with the bases loaded in the second and another run already in, he singled through the right side to score two more off Wojciechowski.\n\n\u201cI just thought he was battling from the first pitch,\u201d Manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cHe threw a lot of innings this year, and we\u2019re probably going to push him back a few days before his next start. He\u2019s just throwing a lot of innings, and he\u2019s kind of a max-effort guy and gives you everything he\u2019s got out there. I just thought today, he was really battling himself. I think we need to give him a little bit of a breather.\u201d\n\nUnlike Saturday, when the Orioles\u2019 bullpen settled in behind Aaron Brooks, it offered little relief Sunday. Gabriel Ynoa, the losing pitcher in the game that began the string of defeats, replaced Wojciechowski to start the third and surrendered a home run to the first batter he faced, Ronald Guzm\u00e1n. Texas finished the game with 20 hits.", "description": "Starter Asher Wojciechowski lasts just two innings as Baltimore suffers fifth consecutive loss after being swept at home, 10-4.", "authors": ["Baltimore Sun", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/idgYjtn8W2jjgrAobkj0JJEE7TA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WR3L5ZWSUMI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
