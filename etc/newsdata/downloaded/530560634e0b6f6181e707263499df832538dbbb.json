We want to be able to bury her and to mourn her.\n\n\"She was just looking for a better life and we are still struggling to understand how this has happened.\"\n\nPham Thi Tra My, 26\n\nThe family of Pham Thi Tra My have not been able to contact her since she sent a devastating text saying she was suffocating.\n\nThe 26-year-old's family from Ha Tinh paid roughly \u00a330,000 for her to travel to UK in a bid to start a new life.\n\nShe messaged them on Tuesday night - hours before the 39 bodies were found - and said: \"I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed.\n\n\"I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.\"\n\nHer family had begged her not to go and \"tried to talk her out of it because it would be a very difficult journey for her as a girl\".\n\nHer father, Pham Van Thin, told CNN: \"The smugglers said that this was a ... safe route, that people would go by aeroplane, car... if I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go.\"\n\nHe added: \"But she said if I don't go, the family would stay in a very difficult situation because of the big debt.\n\n\"So she took a risk and decided to go and we had to agree.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We all have been in shock. I cannot explain our pain and devastating feeling. We were all very devastated and sad.\"\n\nNguyen Dinh Tu\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe wife of Nguyen Dinh Tu says all hope that he is still alive is rapidly starting to fade.\n\nThe dad had been working illegally in Romania and Germany before he lost his job.\n\nThe blow led him to ask his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help raise \u00a311,000 to cover the cost of a trip from Germany to the United Kingdom where he hoped to find work.\n\n\"I lost contact with him on October 21,\" his devastated wife said.\n\n\"I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything\".\n\nMr Tu's father Nguyen Dihn Tu confirmed that his son was on the truck.\n\n\"All 39 are dead and he must be one of them,\" the grieving dad said.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"He is gone now. There is nothing left of him. He died.\n\n\"I know he was in that truck because I have relatives who are working over there who called me and told me.\n\n\"They were supposed to pick him up at the drop point but then they called and told me Tu was in that truck.\n\n\"They knew the route, the time and the drop point of the truck, so if they said so, it must be true. And I think it's true because I haven't heard anything from my son.\"\n\nNguyen Dinh Luong, 20\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nAnother Vietnamese father fears his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, was among the victims.\n\nNguyen Dinh Gia said his son divulged two weeks ago he planned to travel from France to Britain.\n\nHe said was going to pay around \u00a311,000 for the journey and hoped to work in a nail salon when he arrived.\n\nBut his father claims he received a call several days ago from a Vietnamese man saying: \"'Please have some sympathy, something unexpected happened'.\"\n\nGia added: \"I fell to the ground when I heard that.\n\n\"It seemed that he was in the truck with the accident, all of them dead.\"\n\nLuong's older brother, Pham Dinh Hai, said that the missing man has a tattoo of praying hands on a cross on his right shoulder.\n\nVo Ngoc Nam, 28\n\nVo Ngoc Nam, a 28-year-old father-of-two, is also believed to have been inside the doomed trailer.\n\nHis wife Ta Thi Oanh told Vietnamese media he called her on Tuesday afternoon to say he was on the truck going to Britain.\n\nHis father Vo Ngoc Luyen say they are \"extremely shocked\" and anxiously waiting for official confirmation.\n\nCousins Hung Nguyen and Hoang Van Tiep\n\nThe aunt of cousins Hung Nguyen, 33, and Hoang Van Tiep believes they were travelling in the container.\n\nShe has posted photographs on social media in the hope that they might be found alive.\n\nLe Van Ha, 30\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA father's overwhelming agony that his son may be among those who died in the doomed Essex lorry trailer has been laid bare in devastating photos.\n\nLe Van Ha left his poor and agricultural village in Vietnam in search of a better life in the UK, but his family have not heard from him since he embarked on the journey.\n\nThe 30-year-old's wife is also struggling to come to terms with the thought she may never see him again and can barely eat or speak as the family awaits any flicker of information.\n\nDad Le Minh Tuan is convinced his son is one of the 39 migrants found dead.\n\nHeartbreaking photos show the agony etched upon his face as he sobs while clutching his young grandson.\n\n\"He's left us with a huge debt,\" he said.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children.\"\n\nInside their modest home, Le Van Ha's grandmother stares blankly and covers her face with her hands.\n\nWhile Le Van Ha's wife Ha is so consumed with grief she cannot eat or muster up the energy to speak.\n\nThe young man left for Europe three months ago, just before the birth of his second son, reports the BBC.\n\nHis family mortgaged two plots of land to pay the \u00a320,000 fee for his journey to the UK. The plan was for Le Van Ha to repay them once he found a good job - but their world has fallen apart.\n\nThe last contact Le Minh Tuan had with his son was a Facebook message saying he was about to leave for England.\n\nNguyen Huy Hung, 15\n\nNguyen Huy Hung is believed to be the youngest victim of the tragedy.\n\nHis older sister claims the 15-year-old had longed to be reunited with his parents Nguyen Huy Tung and Nyguen Thi Huyen.\n\nShe revealed he had spent the past two months travelling to the UK to see them.\n\nThe 16-year-old, living in Korea, wrote on Facebook: \"My brother left France for the UK and we have not been able to contact him since then\".\n\nIt is thought the parents paid at least \u00a310,000 to arrange the passage for their youngest son.\n\nThe sister, who has not been named, added: \"At this moment our family has not received any confirmation from the police so I hope if anyone sees my last post or photo I have posted about 39 people dead in the container in the UK (now deleted) or on any other Facebook group or website please let me know.\"\n\nEarlier she had posted: \"There has been news of 39 dead people in the container. All the chronological information matches with the time my brother set off. I hope you can help telling me how my brother is doing.\"", "description": "The grim discovery of eight women and 31 men in a refrigerated container was made in Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex, and sent shockwaves around the world", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Pa", "Internet Unknown", "Reuters", "Bbc", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723235.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
