Agencies in the UN family shouldn\u2019t be towing the Trump party line.\u201d\n\nTensions between the US and IOM have simmered over the past year, when Ken Isaacs, the proposed US candidate to head the agency, became the first American since the 1960s to be rejected as its top official, prompting concerns that funding from the state department could be cut.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ken Isaacs speaks at a press conference after being eliminated from the vote for the new president of the IOM, in Geneva, June 2018. Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPA\n\nPress reports at the time revealed that Isaacs had made comments online expressing doubts over the evidence for climate change, suggesting it was a \u201choax\u201d.\n\nPresident Trump himself has expressed doubts about the effects and causes of climate change, while the US objected to the global compact on migration, describing it as a \u201cpro-migration\u201d agreement and an \u201ceffort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states\u201d.\n\nLeonard Doyle, IOM\u2019s head of communications, said: \u201cIOM recognises and respects the priorities and limitations of its donors, including the US. We seek to ensure that staff are aware of such sensitivities when drafting funding proposals for activities which are a response to migration trends and which follow best practice.\u201d\n\nA US state department spokesperson said: \u201cIOM is an important partner for the United States around the globe. The US government supports organisations such as IOM, to conduct programmes and activities that are consistent with our foreign policy goals and objectives.\u201d", "description": "International Organization for Migration apparently amends programme documentation to avoid conflict with US \u2018political sensitivities\u2019", "authors": ["Emanuel Stoakes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a089d0b3da172b67f953db650785ac11dc2dcc0/0_151_5415_3249/master/5415.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b564dbdbcbe23884b20416e972dc667", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
