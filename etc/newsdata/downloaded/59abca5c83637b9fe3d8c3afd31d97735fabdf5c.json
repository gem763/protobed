Deadlines for our departure have come and gone.\n\n'I ask everyone to cast their mind forward to the end of today - and imagine what it could be like if the new Brexit deal has been approved.\n\nAhead of the so-called 'super Saturday' session of Parliament, the Prime Minister tried to rally support before what is expected to be a knife-edge vote\n\n'In less than two weeks, on October 31, we would be out of the EU.\n\n'A difficult, divisive and - yes - painful chapter in our history would be at an end.'\n\nEarlier, Mr Johnson has said that the Brexit deal he struck with Brussels 'busts' the UK out of the Northern Ireland backstop agreed by his predecessor Theresa May.\n\nCalling for support for the deal, Mr Johnson told ITV News: 'It busts out of [the] backstop, the previous problem with the deal, the previous deal that kept us locked in the customs union and the single market so, it's a vast, vast, vast step forward.'\n\nAsked whether Saturday's vote was the biggest thing he has done professionally, the PM said: 'Well I wouldn't deny that, I think it's a very big moment for our country.'\n\nMr Johnson added: 'There's no better outcome than the one I'm advocating tomorrow.'\n\nThe PM said he wanted the country to move on from Brexit.\n\n'This has been a long, exhausting and quite divisive business, Brexit.\n\nEarlier, Mr Johnson has said that the Brexit deal he struck with Brussels 'busts' the UK out of the Northern Ireland backstop agreed by his predecessor Theresa May\n\n'I hope that people will think well, you know, what's the balance, what do our constituents really want? Do they want us to keep going with this argument, do they want more division and delay?'\n\nSir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet minister who now sits as an independent, has thrown the so-called 'super Saturday' session of Parliament into new territory by tabling a motion allowing for amendments to Government proposals.\n\nThe MP has put forward an amendment that, if accepted by the Speaker and approved by MPs, would withhold approval of the deal unless and until implementing legislation has passed.\n\nSir Oliver explained his move, stating: 'In short, my aim is to ensure that Boris's deal succeeds, but that we have an insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation.'\n\nSir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet minister who now sits as an independent, has thrown the so-called 'super Saturday' session of Parliament into new territory by tabling a motion allowing for amendments to Government proposals\n\nThe comments came as Emmanuel Macron turned up the pressure on MPs to back Mr Johnson's new Brexit deal by raising doubts that any further delay will be granted.\n\nJust a day before the vote, the French president said that the EU would not grant a further delay to Article 50 unless there are 'some major changes'.\n\nHis threat added to one from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, however reports have suggested Germany's Angela Merkel believes a delay is inevitable if MPs reject the agreement on Saturday.", "description": "Boris Johnson tried to rally support before what is expected to be a knife-edge vote in Westminster.
