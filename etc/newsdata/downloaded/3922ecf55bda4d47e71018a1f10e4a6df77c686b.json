LVMH's shares were up more than 4% in afternoon trading, while the news boosted shares of rivals Kering SA by 3%, Burberry by nearly 2% and Cie. Financi\u00e8re Richemont SA and Prada SpA by 1%.\n\nInvestors had worried that the protests against China's encroachment on the autonomy of Hong Kong, a magnet for well-heeled shoppers from across Asia, would hurt revenue. Many of the city's high-end boutiques have been forced to close during repeated waves of mass demonstrations since March.\n\nBut at least for LVMH, the company is so large and has so many brands - -- including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Dom P\u00e9rignon -- that disruption in one shopping destination had little impact on the overall conglomerate. Louis Vuitton, the luxury industry's biggest brand, with annual sales estimated at more than EUR12 billion, \"enjoyed a remarkable performance in all its businesses and in all regions,\" LVMH said.\n\nThe trade dispute between the Trump administration and China also seemed to have little impact. Chinese shoppers are the luxury industry's most important clients, accounting for roughly a third of global sales.\n\n\"This is a testament to the strength of the LV and Dior brands, as well as a reality check on the current global luxury demand momentum,\" wrote Bernstein analyst Luca Solca.\n\nHong Kong is particularly important for the Swiss watch industry. In most years, it is the industry's biggest market; it accounted for 14% of total Swiss watch exports in 2018. This year, the protests have had an impact, cutting exports by 6% through August.\n\nBut the industry appears to be making up the slack in other markets, particularly mainland China. Swiss watch exports to China are up 14% this year. LVMH -- whose main watch brands are TAG Heuer, Hublot and Bulgari -- said watch and jewelry sales rose 5% in the quarter compared with a year earlier.\n\nWrite to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 08:59 ET (12:59 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
