However, the various annual statement credits the card offers bring the effective fee down to just $50.\n\nThe first is up to a $200 airline fee credit each calendar year. Every January, you pick one airline for that credit to apply toward. While the credit doesn't cover tickets, it covers incidental fees like checked bags, seat assignments on basic economy tickets, change fees, and more.\n\nSecond, you can get up to $200 in Uber credits each cardmember year, which is broken down into monthly chunks. Each month, cardholders receive $15 of credits to use on Uber rides or for Uber Eats. In December, that's boosted to $35.\n\nFinally, you can get up to $100 in shopping credits each year at Saks stores, broken into two chunks: You'll get up to $50 during the first six months of the year, and another $50 during the second.\n\nSince the airline fee credit is given each calendar year, you can actually collect it twice if you open your card mid-year and maximize the credit before and after January of that first cardmember year.\n\nThat would mean you're not just making up for the annual fee, you're actually getting more value than the fee in the first place. That's without even considering the other benefits and rewards.\n\nThe Gold Card\n\nThe Amex Gold Card's $250 annual fee puts it squarely in the mid-tier category, although one could make an argument that it's really a premium card with a lower-than-premium fee.\n\nThanks to two annual statement credits, the effective fee is just $30 \u2014 as long as you maximize them.\n\nThe first is up to $120 each year in dining credits, broken into monthly $10 portions. These credits only apply to a few participating chain restaurants \u2014 specifically Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, and some Shake Shack locations \u2014 but they also apply to popular food ordering services GrubHub and Seamless. The credits apply automatically to any qualifying purchase.\n\nThe Amex Gold also offers up to $100 in airline fee credits each calendar year. This works just like the Platinum Card's credit, meaning it's possible to earn it more than once each cardmember year.", "description": "The American Express Platinum Card and Gold Card both have fantastic rewards, benefits and perks.
