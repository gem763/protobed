Meanwhile, Rainie \u2014 determined to prove herself to Kathy \u2014 deposited the drugs down the kitchen sink in front of the Beale matriarch. However, unbeknown to both Kathy and Stuart, Rainie hadn\u2019t gotten rid of all of the drugs \u2014 as she decided to keep some for herself.\n\nTonight, Kathy was regretful over what she did and \u2014 determined to prevent anyone else from finding out \u2014 she agreed to allow Rainie to take Abi to the park unsupervised.\n\nMeanwhile, with Rainie behaving odd, Stuart questioned whether or not he truly trusted her, and thus he opened up to Bex (Jasmine Armfield) about his fears. However, Bex simply insisted that he give Rainie the benefit of the doubt \u2014 and he ultimately agreed to do so.\n\nWith a happier outlook, Stuart set off to find Rainie, but \u2014 upon locating her \u2014 he was left devastated when he found her, as she was about to take drugs while in charge of baby Abi.\n\nStuart berated her, and threw her drugs into the nearby grass \u2014 leaving Rainie incredibly upset. Afterwards, Stuart prompted her to make a choice between Abi and the drugs but Rainie seemingly chose the drugs, as she got down on her hands and knees and searched for them.\n\nLater, a muddied Rainy got into a verbal altercation with Martin (James Bye), but Martin proceeded to tell her to sort herself out. Upon reflection, that\u2019s exactly what Rainie set about doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterwards, Rainie paid Kathy a visit and proceeded to blame her for everything that\u2019s transpired, before confirming what Max said by reiterating that drugs will come before anything and anyone when you\u2019re an addict.\n\nThe police arrived on Kathy\u2019s doorstep, and Kathy was incredibly confused as a result, as they informed her they were here to follow up after receiving a report of an assault. Rainie didn\u2019t seem perturbed by their arrival, and it came to light that she knew exactly why they were there. Before long, she brutally attacked Kathy, which led to her getting arrested.\n\nUpon hearing an irate Rainie kicking and screaming as the police officers dragged her out of the Beale household, Stuart headed over to see what was going on \u2014 but Rainie made it clear that she was intent on getting herself sorted out, before telling him that she loves him, and that he\u2019d be better off if he let her go.\n\nIs this the end for Stuart and Rainie?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, have we seen the last of Rainie?\n\nEastEnders continues on Thursday 17th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Rainie went to extreme lengths.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stuart-and-rainie-eastenders_1571165963.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
