Umpire Nacho Forcadell gave him a warning for ball abuse. Then, when Federer flipped a second ball out of court in his next service game, Forcadell had a choice to make. He opted to apply the letter of the law, much to Federer\u2019s displeasure.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFederer had already been tetchy with Forcadell before the penalty was applied, complaining that he had not been informed about a change of balls. Then, when the point was docked, he stood and argued for the best part of a minute, suggesting that there should have been more communication beforehand.\n\nThe row continued at the next changeover. Federer was clearly stung by the decision, and played his most aggressive tennis of the set in the immediate aftermath. But Zverev \u2013 who recently joined Federer\u2019s management agency Team8 \u2013 landed 16 out of 19 first serves in that deciding set, at around 135mph apiece. He held his nerve to clinch a 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 victory on his sixth match point.\n\nAfter the match, Federer said that he had received a point penalty before, but added that it happened \u201ca long, long time ago\u201d. He was prickly when a reporter asked what his reasons for objecting to Forcadell\u2019s decisions had been, replying \u201cSo you can write on Twitter, you mean? It would be nice if you would write something nice once also about the game. Next question.\u201d\n\nSemi-finalist Alexander Zverev next faces Matteo Berrettini Credit: AFP\n\nStory continues\n\nThe role of discretion in umpiring remains a touchy subject, and all the more so after the notorious Serena Williams-Carlos Ramos flare-up at last year\u2019s US Open. Federer may have been annoyed by this point penalty, but \u2013 like Ramos \u2013 Forcadell followed the rules as they are written.\n\nThis was a significant moment for Zverev, who had not beaten a top-ten player all season. Afterwards, he acknowledged that he has lacked confidence and played too defensively this year, and ascribed this to the disruption of splitting with his previous agent Patricio Apey. He will now face Matteo Berrettini of Italy in Saturday's semi-final.\n\nThe other semi-final brings together two players who have a frosty personal relationship in Greece\u2019s Stefanos Tsitsipas and Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev. On Friday, Tsitsipas scored a superb 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over top seed Novak Djokovic. One of the side-effects was to ensure that Djokovic will lose the world No. 1 ranking at the start of November, while Rafael Nadal \u2013 who is absent from Shanghai because of injury \u2013 will climb back to the top of the table for the eighth time.\n\nAt the Tianjin Open, Heather Watson continued her excellent week by saving four match points and closing out a 7-5, 6-7, 7-6 victory over world No. 42 Magda Linette. She will return to the world\u2019s top 100 next week. In Linz, 15-year-old Coco Gauff beat Kiki Bertens to claim the first top-ten scalp of her embryonic career and reach the semi-finals.", "description": "A dramatic day of tennis in Shanghai saw Roger Federer receive a rare point penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct as he went down to a three-set defeat at the hands of Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev.
