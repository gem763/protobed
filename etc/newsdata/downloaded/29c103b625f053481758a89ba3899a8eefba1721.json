If someone is reporting about another\u2019s ugly tweets on Twitter from many years ago, that someone better check his own social media posts first.\n\nYou may have seen Carson King on Fox and Friends last weekend. He turned a silly stunt at a college football game into a jaw-dropping act of charity. The 24-year-old King held up a sign asking for money to buy more Busch Light beer. It was funny. His gesture went viral after he was captured on camera. The college football game was seen by a large audience because it was a part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d. In case you are curious, the game was between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Iowa State Cyclones.\n\nThe sign stunt happened on September 14. After it went viral, donations began pouring in. No one was more surprised than King. He got a lot of publicity and the story was told on FOX, which increased his donations. He told the audience that he was donating the money to the University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Children\u2019s Hospital. Venmo and Anheuser-Busch both pledged to match his donation. King appeared on Fox and Friends last weekend to announce he was almost at the $1 million mark. Busch Light cans were made with his picture on them. King was even promised a year\u2019s supply of Busch Light from the company. Anheuser-Busch labeled King an Iowa Legend.\n\n\u201cHey @CarsonKing2, we said we\u2019d send you a year\u2019s worth of Busch Light, but first we had to make sure the cans were fit for a King. Let us know where to send the truck. #IowaLegend,\u201d Anheuser-Busch tweeted.\n\nHey #cyclONEnation! I just wanted everyone to know I\u2019m listening to @CycloneFB from NYC! We\u2019re st over 873,000.00 total contributions after @BuschBeer and @venmo. pic.twitter.com/WooOJDd7zL \u2014 Carson King (@CarsonKing2) September 21, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a great story, right? The story brings together an imaginative young man playfully asking for beer money who then turns it around into a grand gesture for a children\u2019s hospital. The corporate guys stepped up and matched his donation. Well, hold on. As my mom used to say, no good deed goes unpunished.\n\nThe Des Moines Register picked up the story and published a piece on Carson King. Included in the piece were two tweets from when King was 16 years old. The tweets were racial. The tweets were uncovered during a \u201croutine background check\u201d, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper report, however, included a \u201croutine background check\u201d of King\u2019s social media history. Register reporter Aaron Calvin came across two racist jokes that dated back to 2012 when King was a 16-year-old high school student, \u201cone comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nHe was 16 then and now he\u2019s 24. A lot of maturity happens in those years. King clearly has turned out to be a good guy who shares his good fortune with those in need. When asked about the two tweets, King immediately apologized and expressed both embarrassment and remorse.\n\nKing was asked about the tweets and immediately expressed remorse. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that I\u2019m proud of at all,\u201d King told the Register on Tuesday. He appeared on local TV stations to apologize and said, \u201cI am embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old.\u201d\n\nAnheuser-Busch severed ties with King, though the company said they will honor the commitment to match his donation.\n\nReaders were not pleased with the newspaper\u2019s trashing of King with the tweets so some did a little investigating of their own. Guess what? The reporter had some less than stellar tweets from younger days, too. The Register\u2019s Executive Editor Carol Hunter issued a lengthy response.\n\nA statement from our editor: pic.twitter.com/ZH9AhcrYbg \u2014 Des Moines Register (@DMRegister) September 25, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. This is where we are now as a culture. Reporters are eager to do a gotcha element even in the most feel-good kind of stories. Do we hold a 24 year old guy up for doing a good thing or do we trash him with mention of tweets from his years as a teenager. Teenagers say dumb things, that isn\u2019t breaking news. There isn\u2019t any indication that those two tweets represent his life now. The reporter and the newspaper went with the inclusion of the tweets as a gotcha, whether they admit it or not. Would the editor have issued such a tortured statement if readers hadn\u2019t criticized the inclusion of the tweets? Of course not.\n\nJustifiying the decision to include the tweets by saying the mention was way down deep into the article doesn\u2019t matter. It was there. Readers read it. Also, stating the tweets weren\u2019t the headline doesn\u2019t make it right. The reporter points to the admission by King to the press before the piece was published as if it makes the paper\u2019s decision ok.\n\n\u201cShould that material be included in the profile at all? The jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts. Shouldn\u2019t that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King\u2019s cause or were planning to do so?\u201d Hunter wrote. Hunter went on to defend the paper\u2019s decision to include such information, noting that it was toward the bottom of the profile and not placed prominently at the top. \u201cThe news conference was covered by local television stations, which first reported on the racist posts and King\u2019s remorse. After those stories aired, Busch Light\u2019s parent company announced it would honor its pledge to the children\u2019s hospital but would sever future ties with King,\u201d Hunter continued. \u201cThat happened before the Register published its profile of King, which was still in the editing process.\u201d\n\nKing got out in front of it \u2013 he knows how this works. Cancel culture demands the person who offended someone be shunned, preferrably fired from a job. Also, the reporter\u2019s timeline is in question. It looks as though Anheuser-Busch was told about the tweets before King went public.\n\nCarson tells me he knew at 2:16PM that @BuschBeer was severing ties after tweets brought to its attention. Busch Light Carson King T-shirt links, with proceeds to @UIchildrens, down by 5 PM. Press conference didn't even start until 7 PM. It was not why Busch ended relationship. https://t.co/blImJXf0vz \u2014 Keith Murphy (@MurphyKeith) September 25, 2019\n\nTurnabout is fair play. It looks as though the Des Moines Register didn\u2019t do such a thorough \u201cbackground check\u201d on their reporter as the reporter did on his subject. Calvin isn\u2019t innocent here, either, if past tweets are the measure of a man.\n\nIn now-deleted tweets from 2010-2013, Calvin repeatedly used the N-word, and wrote posts attacking law enforcement like \u201cf\u2014 all cops,\u201d and in reaction to the legalization of gay marriage said he\u2019s \u201ctotally going to marry a horse.\u201d Before locking his Twitter account, Calvin issued an apology for his own tweets. \u201cHey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive. I apologize for not holding myself to the same standards as the Register holds others,\u201d Calvin wrote.\n\nThe newspaper is now investigating Calvin. King, meanwhile, has been nothing but gracious in his reaction to the newspaper. He is taking the high road.\n\n\u201cThe Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage, and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me,\u201d King tweeted. \u201cI want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize. I believe that is the right thing to do.\u201d", "description": "Double standard?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/05a44742-8915-49a8-a455-8f75846d0aa0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
