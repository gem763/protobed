The scooter has three wheels (two in front, one in back), and it can supposedly use artificial intelligence and remote cloud capabilities to guide itself without a human rider.\n\nChina's Ninebot unveils scooters that drive themselves to charging stations https://t.co/SPnF32B1X6 pic.twitter.com/OsPBdw5Ixa \u2014 Reuters Tech News (@ReutersTech) August 16, 2019\n\n\u201cThe pain point for scooter operators is to better maintain the scooters at a lower cost,\u201d Gao Lufeng, Ninebot chairman and chief executive, told Reuters.\n\nThere was no public demonstration of this capability, and the scooter is reportedly not expected to hit the road until early next year. But Ninebot said that Uber and Lyft, which have expanded into bike- and scooter-sharing, have expressed interest in the new scooter, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cwe haven\u2019t yet made any commitments around this product.\u201d\n\nBut that may not be entirely accurate. \u201cWe are always interested in seeing the latest innovations from potential partners like Ninebot, but we haven\u2019t yet made any commitments around this product,\u201d a spokesperson for Lyft said in a statement. A spokesperson for Uber declined to comment.\n\nFormed in 2015 by the combination of Chinese electronics maker Ninebot and US mobility company Segway, the company quietly became a leading provider of electric scooters to rental startups like Bird and Lime. The company sold 1.6 million scooters in 2018, according to Reuters, citing a prospectus filed in April.\n\nThe KickScooter T60 is expected to sell for 10,000 yuan ($1,420), which is more than the company\u2019s traditional scooters that sell to customers and scooter companies for $100 to $300 each.\n\nThe idea of dockless, electric scooters that can drive themselves to a charging station or a more optimal pickup spot certainly sounds useful on the surface. But it is likely to be cost-prohibitive for most scooter-sharing companies that are scrambling to bring in enough revenue to recoup the costs of their fleet operations. Uber is rumored to be interested in developing self-riding bikes and scooters, but it hasn\u2019t confirmed that publicly.", "description": "Segway-Ninebot has a solution for all of those dockless electric scooters that need to be gathered up every night for charging: build one that can drive itself to the charging station.", "authors": ["Andrew J.
