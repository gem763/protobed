However, family circumstances and needs differ from one family to the next, and the circumstances that apply to one family may not necessarily apply to another.\n\n\n\nThis is where a generic or a simple will may do more harm than good.\n\n\"The most common problems that arise from the death of a particular person are the costs and taxes associated with their estate,\" says Bester.\n\n\"There are many cases in which an estate is asset rich, but cash poor; and the last thing the beneficiaries may want is the forced sale of any of the estate assets to meet the liquidity requirement of the executor.\"\n\nThese will typically include the following executor's fees; estate duty; general administration expenses; and creditors' claims.\n\n\"Even if the deceased dies without any debt, there will always be executor's or administration expenses and possibly estate duty,\" says Bester.\n\n\n\nOne must also remember that death is deemed a capital gains tax event.\n\n\"Unless the estate devolves upon a surviving spouse, the death of a person is as if the deceased had sold his estate to the executor and (subject to certain deductions) the taxman has his last bite at the capital gains tax cherry,\" says Bester.\n\nAs for executor's fees, he says that, apart from relying on the provisions of the Administration of Estates Act to check on excessive executor's fees, it is also advisable to appoint a trusted friend or family member as co-executor.\n\nAs an alternative, the surviving spouse and a child may be appointed as executors who, in turn, could source a professional company to administer the estate at an agreed fee.\n\nThis would have the effect of reducing executor\u2019s fees and, by implication, the potential cash shortfall in the estate.\n\nHe says there are also further estate planning steps one can implement, in order to ultimately reduce an estate\u2019s exposure to estate duty, especially if these relate to the estate of the second spouse to die or where there has been no spouse at all.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Free or cheap wills can cost your estate dearly in the long run, according to Alfred Bester of Legacy Fiduciary Services.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5538/43b3438a8c9c47df9cdf0ece9ec34eb1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
