REUTERS/Amber Bracken\n\nA crowd of several thousand led by indigenous drummers with students, young people and families marched slowly from a downtown intersection toward the Alberta legislature building. Many held banners and signs with slogans including \u201cbe a better ancestor\u201d. Police rode on bicycles at the front and back of the throng.\n\nAt the same time, the honking horns of big rig trucks blared from a nearby thoroughfare, where vehicles emblazoned with \u201cWe love Canada energy\u201d signs were driving up and down.\n\n\u201cI came out to show support for Greta and everyone fighting against the climate crisis,\u201d said protester Bridget Gutteridge-Hingston, 13, who marched with her father.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m definitely scared of,\u201d she said.\n\nThe truck convoy organized by pro-oil group United We Roll drove from the city of Red Deer to Edmonton Friday morning to protest against what the group called foreign activists campaigning against Canada\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cRicher countries such as Canada and Sweden need to get down to zero emissions much faster so people in poorer countries can heighten their standard of living by building the infrastructure we have already built,\u201d Thunberg told a cheering crowd, which organizers estimated was 10,000-strong, from the steps of the Alberta legislature building.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this because it\u2019s fun or because we have a special interest in the climate or because we want to become politicians when we grow up. We\u2019re doing this because our future is at stake,\u201d the Swedish activist said.\n\nThe truck horns sounded in the distance throughout Thunberg\u2019s speech and there were around 150 counter-protesters in the crowd. After she left the stage shouting broke out between pro-energy demonstrators, armed with a noisy bull horn and yelling \u201cWe need oil and gas\u201d, and climate marchers.\n\nAlberta is home to Canada\u2019s vast oil sands and holds the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves, but has struggled to recover from the 2014-15 global oil price crash because of delays building new export pipelines as a result of environmental opposition and regulatory hold-ups.\n\nMany energy sector workers and the Alberta government feel the oil sands, scorned by environmentalists for their high carbon emissions intensity, have been unfairly targeted and say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.\n\nA 2018 study by Stanford University researchers ranked the Canadian oil industry\u2019s upstream emissions as the fourth most carbon-heavy in the world.\n\nThe energy sector provides 150,000 direct jobs in Alberta and contributes more than C$71 billion ($54.1 billion) annually to the gross domestic product of Canada, the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil and gas producer.\n\nThunberg has mobilized a global youth movement against climate change. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said he hoped she would take a \u201cfair and objective look\u201d at Alberta\u2019s energy sector.\n\nFriday\u2019s march, organized by indigenous and environmental groups, came as Canada prepares for a tight federal election Monday in which climate change and the future of the oil and gas sector are hot topics.\n\nLast month, Thunberg met privately with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following a massive rally in Montreal.", "description": "Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg joined thousands of protesters marching in Canada's energy heartland Alberta on Friday, as a smaller counter-rally led by a truck convoy of oil and gas workers also converged on the provincial capital Edmonton.", "authors": ["Alexandra Zabjek", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442459761&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H24H-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
