Samoa's Seilala Lam is shown a yellow card by referee REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nSamoa\u2019s Seilala Lam had just been yellow carded for smashing his shoulder into the head of a stooping Jacob Stockdale\u2019s head, the latest in a string of punishments to hit the islanders in the World Cup in Japan.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d pleaded captain Jack Lam. Australian referee Nic Berry replied simply: \u201cTackle lower.\u201d\n\nIt should be that simple, and to many it is. Others insist the new guidelines are impossible to apply in such a high-speed, contact sport and are littered with inconsistency.\n\nThe backdrop to the debate is the fact that thousands of rugby players of every level have and continue to suffer impact-related concussion, a brain injury with potentially devastating consequences, which only relatively recently are being understood.\n\nThe sport\u2019s governing body World Rugby (WR) set about trying to understand and improve the situation and long and extensive research revealed that the vast majority of concussions occur in the tackle.\n\nMore specifically, when the tackler is upright, hitting at or above the chest and arriving with force, there will be a far more likely outcome of concussion than otherwise.\n\nThe result is WR\u2019s high tackle framework, the step-process of decisions referees must consider when analysing a potentially dangerous tackle and heard by TV viewers and fans in the stadium and via the referee\u2019s microphone as he consults the TV match official.\n\n\u201cWas it high? Was there impact to the head? Was there an attempt to wrap the arms? Was there force? Was there any mitigation (the tackled player ducking or the tackler slipping or being pushed)?\u201d\n\nAs seen over the last three weeks, often the eventual outcome is a red card. Previously there was an average of slightly over two red cards per World Cup but in Japan there have been seven already, and the knockout stage is yet to begin.\n\nIn previous decades the principle of the tackle was to stop a player\u2019s progress and bring him to the ground by what was always considered a traditional \u201crugby tackle\u201d. That has gradually been replaced by the concept of the \u201chit\u201d - with rugby league-style defence battling to knock runners back and win the \u201cbattle of the gainline\u201d.\n\n\u2018RE-EDUCATION PROCESS\u2019\n\n\u201cThe game is changing right in front of us,\u201d said Ian McGeechan, former centre for Scotland and the British & Irish Lions and coach of both, after the Samoa v Ireland match. \u201cIt has to be a leg tackle now - it\u2019s a re-education process.\u201d\n\nSome of the cards have been for direct contact with the head by a shoulder, typically in a no-arms tackle - something that should always have been a red card offence under the existing laws but which was rarely punished as such.\n\nOthers, more contentiously, have come after the tackler has made his initial impact around the shoulder or chest area, then slid up to make contact with the head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what a tackler is supposed to do if a player dips that low,\u201d said former Ireland captain Brian O\u2019Driscoll of Lam\u2019s card, adding that players had only a split-second to react if the player to be tackled ducks down. \u201cThe big shot is going to be ruled out of our game.\u201d\n\nHowever, those complaining about \u201ccentimetres\u201d or \u201cmilliseconds\u201d are missing WR\u2019s point. The governing body, who of course have a duty of care to every level of the game, are demanding a fundamental change of approach - so that a change of position might result in a different point of contact, but still not a dangerous one.\n\nAs the legion of French referees on duty in Japan can be regularly heard advising players: \u201cChange your behaviour\u201d.\n\nDespite WR\u2019s best intentions, however, it is not a clear and easy path, even with those who are fully supportive.\n\nLast season an experimental law change outlawing tackles above the armpit in the cup competition of England\u2019s second-tier Championship was abandoned early when it was found it was actually increasing concussions - thought initially to be a result of players bending more at the waist ahead of contact.\n\nOther critics say that forcing players to tackle lower leaves the ball carrier free to offload.\n\nThat is probably true, but those with a close-up view of people suffering from the effects of tackle-induced brain damage would need convincing that more passes and potentially more exciting tries is a poor outcome in exchange for improvement in player safety.", "description": "A brief exchange in Samoa's game against Ireland on Friday perfectly encapsulated the internal struggle rugby is undergoing as officials seek to make the game safer in the face of some confusion and some blank refusal by those playing it.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440693778&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0VS", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
