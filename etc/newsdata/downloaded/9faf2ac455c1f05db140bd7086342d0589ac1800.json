Blame Wealthy Liberals.", "language": "en", "text": "It was another chapter in a dismal saga of Nimbyist urban mismanagement that is crushing American cities. Not-in-my-backyardism is a bipartisan sentiment, but because the largest American cities are populated and run by Democrats \u2014 many in states under complete Democratic control \u2014 this sort of nakedly exclusionary urban restrictionism is a particular shame of the left.\n\nThere are many threads in the story of America\u2019s increasingly unlivable cities. One continuing tragedy is the decimation of local media and the rise of nationalized politics in its place. In America the \u201clocal\u201d problems plaguing cities are systematically sidelined by the structure of the national media and government, in which the presidency, the Senate and the Supreme Court are all constitutionally tilted in favor of places where no one lives. (There are more than twice as many people in my midsize suburban county, Santa Clara, as there are in the entire state of North Dakota, with its two United States senators.)\n\nThat\u2019s why, aside from Elizabeth Warren \u2014 who has a plan for housing, as she has a plan for everything \u2014 Democrats on the 2020 presidential trail rarely mention their ideas for housing affordability, an issue eating American cities alive. I watched Joe Biden\u2019s campaign kick off the other day; the only house he mentioned was the White House.\n\nThen there is the refusal on the part of wealthy progressives to live by the values they profess to support at the national level. Creating dense, economically and socially diverse urban environments ought to be a paramount goal of progressivism. Cities are the standard geographical unit of the global economy. Dense urban areas are quite literally the \u201creal America\u201d \u2014 the cities are where two-thirds of Americans live, and they account for almost all national economic output. Urban areas are the most environmentally friendly way we know of housing lots of people. We can\u2019t solve the climate crisis without vastly improving public transportation and increasing urban density. More than that, metropolises are good for the psyche and the soul; density fosters tolerance, diversity, creativity and progress.", "description": "The demise of a California housing measure shows how progressives abandon progressive values in their own backyards.", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/opinion/22manjooSub/22manjooSub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-22"}
