Sixteen years, three free-market presidents and numerous international trade deals later, Nabisco successfully shuttered the plant for good, laying off about 350 workers and leaving behind a hulking brick monument to the Pennsylvania city\u2019s storied industrial past.\n\nToday, the old factory building has been transformed into a shiny testament to Pittsburgh\u2019s future: the luxuriously renovated Bakery Square is home to hundreds of Google employees, assembly lines and industrial ovens replaced with cubicles, meeting rooms and an indoor bamboo garden, the only hint of the manufacturing past in a few tasteful design flourishes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Google\u2019s Pittsburgh office could experience a striking return to Pittsburgh\u2019s industrial roots when a group of about 90 analysts will hold an election to decide whether to form a union with the United Steelworkers (USW). The workers, who are employed by the Indian outsourcing firm HCL America but work on Google projects at Google\u2019s offices, are just a tiny fraction of the legions of temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs) who make up an enormous \u201cshadow\u201d workforce at Google, outnumbering direct Google employees approximately 135,000 to 115,000.\n\nIf their campaign is successful, they will become what is believed to be the first group of professional tech workers to unionize in the US since a wave of workplace activism began to roil the industry in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election.\n\nIn some ways, these workers are marginal to the broader tech industry. They live and work far from its center of gravity in Silicon Valley, and their actual employer is not exactly a household name. But they also sit at the center of urgent questions about the future of a tech-driven economy.\n\nPittsburgh, the quintessential post-industrial city that lost half its population after the US steel industry collapsed in the 1980s, has enjoyed a tech-fueled renaissance in recent years as major companies including Google, Uber, Apple and Facebook opened offices there. The benefits of that economic rebirth have been distributed unevenly, community activists say, in part due to the industry\u2019s reliance on huge numbers of contractors \u2013 from Uber drivers to Google\u2019s TVCs \u2013 and preference to offer direct employment to as few people as possible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Google office in Bakery Square which used to be a Nabisco factory.

After all, this is the city that gave birth to both the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which eventually merged to form the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s largest federation of unions, as well as the USW. That a campaign to challenge the severe power imbalance between subcontracted tech workers and one of the most powerful corporations in the world should emerge here is only in keeping with historical precedent.\n\n\u201cIn the 1930s, our union was created when there was a small group of workers who said, \u2018No more,\u2019\u201d said Maria Somma, the organizing director for the USW. \u201cIt was when they were courageous enough to do that that it allowed the rest of the sector to unionize.\u201d\n\nSomma joined the USW from a nurse\u2019s union 18 years ago, when the USW set its sights on organizing workers from new industries, including healthcare, education and, now, tech. At her office in the USW\u2019s downtown Pittsburgh headquarters, a large poster celebrates the union\u2019s recent success in organizing the 300 librarians and other staff of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh system with the slogan, \u201cHahahaha, suck it Andrew Carnegie! We won!\u201d beside a crossed-out photo of the 19th century steel magnate\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThe HCL workers are the first group that\u2019s daring enough \u2013 understanding the precarity of their situation \u2013 to say we\u2019ve got to take a step,\u201d she said. \u201cThat to me is unbelievably brave. You want to see working class heroes in today\u2019s modern world, look at them.\u201d\n\nA history of workers fighting back\n\nIn Pittsburgh, technology and labor have always been inextricably linked.\n\nIt was the Bessamer converter \u2013 a furnace used to create steel in what\u2019s known as the Bessamer process \u2013 and other technological innovations that revolutionized the steel industry, turning Carnegie\u2019s Homestead steel mill, located just a few miles upriver from Pittsburgh, into a kind of late-19th-century Google, with the most advanced tech creating the most extraordinary wealth, as well as severe inequality and labor strife.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Josh Borden, a Google contractor, in Pittsburgh. Photograph: Michael Santiago/The Guardian\n\nHomestead was \u201cthe most modern mill in the country,\u2019\u2019 explained Rosemary Trump, a retired labor leader, on a recent trip to the historic site. The mill itself no longer exists, shuttered in 1986 along with most of the other steel mills that once lined the Monongahela river and replaced with a shopping mall and housing development.\n\nBut the red brick pump house, which once supplied the factory with water from the river, still stands as a monument to the bloody history of the 1892 Homestead strike, in which thousands of striking workers faced off with hundreds of Pinkerton agents (a private police force used by industrialist to control workers) sent to take control of the mill by Carnegie\u2019s agent, Henry Clay Frick. The resulting gun battle left seven strikers and three Pinkertons dead.\n\nThe Battle of Homestead was the result of \u201ca radical transformation of technology that completely changed the relationship between workers and owners,\u201d said Charlie McCollester, a retired labor activist and historian. Before the invention of the Bessamer process, a small group of highly skilled workers known as puddlers were essential to the process of turning iron into steel. After Henry Bessamer\u2019s innovation, McCollester explained, \u201cThe equipment was in charge. The workers became \u2018hands\u2019 and had much less control.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, productivity exploded, with mills going from producing 100 pounds of steel at a time to 100 tons.\n\n\u201cWe see an analogy with IT for young people,\u201d McCollester said as we drove through Homestead. The town\u2019s economic recovery is evident, though shaky; on one street we pass a crumbling former municipal building where the labor leader Mary Harris \u201cMother\u201d Jones was jailed for supporting a strike in 1919, as well as an imposing old bank building that was recently converted into a recreational axe throwing gym. \u201cWe are facing as much of a shift now.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the HCL contractors are perfect examples of how technology is affecting not just blue collar but professionals as well. The five HCL workers interviewed by the Guardian were all college educated and most were professionally fluent in multiple languages. Their work is complex, technical and, according to one Google Pittsburgh employee who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the media, \u201ccrucial to our actual business\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sunrise over factories in the city\u2019s Braddock neighborhood. Photograph: Michael Santiago/The Guardian\n\nThat they are nevertheless deemed not crucial enough to be hired as direct Google employees \u201cexposes the contradiction\u201d in Silicon Valley\u2019s major philanthropic endeavors, said Alex Wallach Hanson, an organizer with community group Pittsburgh United. \u201cThey dedicate all their philanthropy to telling particularly black and brown students that they need to learn to code and then they can achieve what tech workers are getting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not actually creating those pathways [to direct employment].\u201d\n\nComparisons between today\u2019s tech billionaires and the robber barons of the Gilded Age are practically cliche, but they resonate for a reason, especially in Pittsburgh where Carnegie\u2019s legacy as a union buster is as present as the libraries, universities and cultural institutions he funded.\n\n\u201cCarnegie was the richest man of his time,\u201d McCollester said. \u201cHe gave away his money, but it was on his terms, to things he wanted, while the people who worked for him were living in poverty.\u201d\n\nThe high paying jobs go largely to white people who aren\u2019t from Pittsburgh Alex Wallach Hanson, organizer\n\nThe richest man of this time, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, has complained that \u201cthe only way\u201d he can come up with to spend his incredible wealth is to fund space travel. Meanwhile, on 12 September, Amazon-owned Whole Foods confirmed that it was cutting medical benefits for nearly 2,000 part-time workers.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Amazon\u2019s high-end grocery chain has been embroiled in controversy over plans to open a store in a development near Google\u2019s offices in East Liberty \u2013 a historically African American neighborhood that is gentrifying rapidly. The Whole Foods is slated for a lot that was cleared for development by the mass eviction of about 200 residents, many of them elderly and low-income.\n\n\u201cThe high paying jobs go largely to white people who aren\u2019t from Pittsburgh, like the six-figure traditional coder jobs that people envision when they think of the tech industry,\u201d Wallach Hanson said, adding that local people of color and women are largely relegated to lower wage service sector roles.\n\n\u201cThey try to sell it as this new economy, but the reality is for workers it\u2019s still the same. Corporations are still coming into our city and making incredible profits while creating massive inequality. The world can change so much and yet it can remain the same.\u201d\n\n\u2018On the edge of a cliff\u2019\n\nDespite the potential historical resonance, the goals of the HCL contractors are decidedly modest.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go into this really trying to shake the structure of work in the technology industry,\u201d said Renata Nelson, a member of the organizing committee. \u201cI just want myself and my coworkers to be happy and feel secure in our workplace.\u201d\n\nThe union drive began in early 2019 when one HCL contractor, Ben Gwin, contacted the USW to see if the union could help with his frustrations with his employer. The idea of unionization found fertile ground among workers who were surrounded every day by reminders of how much better Googlers had it than they did. (\u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a party happening and some people have to watch it and not come in,\u201d one Pittsburgh Googler told the Guardian of the disparate treatment).\n\nLow pay, stingy time off, a lack of responsiveness from management and a constant sense of precarity were common concerns among the HCL workers who spoke to the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that from one Monday to the next we will have a job,\u201d said Josh Borden, who has worked for HCL for three and a half years. \u201cIt feels like being on the edge of a cliff all the time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve put in the loyalty and the time and the energy, and it\u2019s just like there\u2019s no reward at the end of the tunnel Gabrielle Norton-Moore, Google contractor\n\n\u201cFrom the time I was hired until now, me and my colleagues have been asking for certain things, like a couple extra vacation days, a better healthcare plan, more pay sometimes,\u201d said another HCL worker, Johanne Rokholt. \u201cThe answer is always, \u2018We\u2019re doing as much as we can \u2026 You are lucky and you should feel grateful.\u2019 It\u2019s a one-sided conversation and I would like to see it be a dialogue.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the HCL contractors also expressed frustration with the two-tiered system that allows them to work on Google projects with Google employees in Google\u2019s offices, but doesn\u2019t provide them with the pay or security that direct employees earn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here five years,\u201d said Gabrielle Norton-Moore, who has been at Google Pittsburgh since before HCL got its contract there and says she often feels like a \u201cpeasant\u201d at work. \u201cI\u2019ve put in the loyalty and the time and the energy and everything, and it\u2019s just like, there\u2019s no reward at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nThe union effort is being closely watched by Googlers, many of whom have participated in their own workplace activism in recent years, including the November 2018 walkout over the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment.\n\nA Google software engineer who has worked in the Pittsburgh office for nearly 10 years, Todd Derr, said that he \u201cfully supports\u201d the unionization effort. \u201cI consider everyone who works in the office (and the whole company) to be co-workers, regardless of who technically employs them.\u201d\n\nWhen the HCL workers went public with their union drive, some Googlers published a letter of support and compiled a slide deck of memes with messages of support. After HCL began an anti-union campaign, Googlers published a petition calling on Google to sign a \u201cneutrality agreement\u201d, urging them to condemn the \u201cuse of union-busting consultants\u201d by HCL.\n\n\u201cGoogle must commit to a fair election, free of interference, and oppose unfair interference by their business partner, HCL,\u201d one of the Googlers involved with the petition told the Guardian. \u201cThey must commit to maintain their contract with HCL, without regard for whether or not those employees vote to unionize.\u201d\n\nJenn Kaiser, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement: \u201cWe work with lots of partners, many of which have unionized workforces, and many of which don\u2019t. As with all our partners, whether HCL\u2019s employees unionize or not is between them and their employer.\u201d\n\nMeenakshi Benjwal, HCL\u2019s head of external communications, said in a statement: \u201cWe respect our employees legal right to decide whether or not they want to be represented by a union and are dedicated to fostering an inclusive and open office culture for all of our team members at HCL.\u201d\n\nThe Pittsburgh Googler who spoke on condition of anonymity said that she was excited by the union drive.\n\n\u201cI understand in the case of something like restaurant services or custodial services why [Google would use] a separate contracting company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for me to understand why there\u2019s a separate contracting company for people who are helping build our core business, which is software.\u201d\n\n\u201cPittsburgh\u2019s the right city for it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re an industrial city and there\u2019s a whole history of unionization here \u2026 Pittsburgh is positioning itself for moving from the steel industry to more of the tech industry and medical industry. I think it\u2019s really appropriate that some of the other ethos of Pittsburgh moves with it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, according to Somma, some Google employees have already gotten in touch with the USW.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a few,\u201d Somma said. \u201cGoogle employees \u2013 they\u2019re self-organizing, they\u2019re walking out based on social issues, so they understand their power. They\u2019re walking out to send a message to Google. But they\u2019re doing it for others. Now the question is: are they willing to do it for themselves?\u201d", "description": "An attempt by contract workers to unionize has brought the city\u2019s industrial past crashing into the 21st century", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbde13bffb30bf9c555db3ee9396a8d5e36e40b6/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=206447ea6e2999a6a7fe09874ef3caed", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
