On Monday evening, for example, Fox News aired the latest iteration, more than 40 minutes of Hannity carefully setting softballs on tees and then praising Trump\u2019s slugging.\n\nAt one point Trump claimed that Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) had fabricated a version of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky only to be revealed as a liar once Trump released the rough transcript of the call. This is entirely untrue: Schiff was paraphrasing the call after the rough transcript was already out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHannity's response to Trump's false assertion? Nudge the train back on the tracks.\n\nSchiff \u201cmade up my conversation, totally \u2014 like fiction,\u201d Trump said of the incident. \u201cIt was \u2014 it was fraudulent. He made it sound \u2014 he took that conversation, he made it sound \u2014 now he didn\u2019t know about that conversation. So he went up \u2014 and he made up a phony conversation, read it to Congress, read it the American people. And I released that, and that was the real conversation. So he then said, \u2018Uh, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019 \"\n\n\u201cIt was already out,\u201d Hannity interjected.\n\n\u201c' \u2026 it was parody,' \" Trump added.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hannity said.\n\n\u201cYes, it was parody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo this is a corrupt politician.\"\n\nAD\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that Trump's latest iteration of rationalizing the contents of that Zelensky call met with no opposition from his friend Sean.\n\nAD\n\nAt the start of the interview, Hannity read through part of the rough transcript of the call. It\u2019s the part that came immediately after Zelensky mentioned potentially purchasing more arms from the United States, aid that had already been blocked by Trump\u2019s administration. In response to that request, here\u2019s what Trump said. (Ellipses are in the original.)\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation.. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nWhen the transcript came out, a substantial translation effort ensued. What, exactly, was Trump talking about? The answer, it seems, is that he had embraced and muddled a conspiracy theory in which the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s network in 2016 was misattributed to Russia, thanks to bad analysis by a firm called CrowdStrike \u2014 a firm that can be connected to Ukraine through only four extremely tenuous steps involving a co-founder\u2019s participation with a group funded in part by money from a wealthy Ukrainian\u2019s foundation.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s important to reiterate how baseless Trump\u2019s assertion to Zelensky was. There was no \u201cserver;\u201d the DNC\u2019s network was cloud-based. While CrowdStrike did an early analysis of the hacking, its attribution was reinforced by a thorough investigation conducted by the federal government. There\u2019s no serious question that Russia hacked the DNC network, and there\u2019s no serious reason to think that the attribution stems from any effort from Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nIn his conversation with Hannity, Trump's claims about Ukraine and the server were \u2014 impressively \u2014 even less moored in reality.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the 2016 election, which was a disaster,\u201d Trump told Hannity, lamenting the people who were \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the investigation into Russian interference and connections to Trump's campaign.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was a server \u2014 the DNC server \u2014 that never went to the FBI,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe FBI didn\u2019t take it. It was taken by somebody that I guess it's CrowdStrike \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\"\n\nIf that\u2019s what Trump heard, he heard wrong. CrowdStrike \u2014 again, not a Ukrainian company \u2014 was given digital images of the devices involved in the hacking, complete replications of the accessed systems. In its analysis, it found evidence of tools typically used by Russian hackers. Those replications were later turned over to the FBI, but, as Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told ABC News last month, the government had already attributed the hacking to Russia by the time the FBI was contacted.\n\nAD\n\nA bit later, Trump went broader in his assertions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what\u2019s going on and then you see all of this horrible stuff,\u201d he added, \u201cand then you hear about Ukraine \u2014 and you\u2019ve been hearing about it. I heard Clinton was involved. I heard they got somebody who wrote the fake dossier. Was it out of Ukraine?\"\n\nNote first that this is a very different claim than the one Trump made to Zelensky. At this point, he\u2019s insinuating that the infamous dossier of reports compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele may have had origins in Ukraine. It\u2019s a politically useful line to draw, given the instant negative reaction any mention of the Steele dossier generates with his supporters and allies. But the theory undergirding it is an exotic one, centering on an early probe into Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his work for a political party in Ukraine. (It\u2019s a theory embraced by the Hill\u2019s John Solomon, whose name crops up a lot in these stories.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll of the things that happened \u2014 and I assume that the attorney general \u2014 I would like the attorney general to find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Trump said of his new theory about the dossier. \u201cBecause you know what? We\u2019re investigating corruption.\"\n\nAD\n\nThis is itself an important point. During the Russia investigation, it was not uncommon for Russia-the-state to be conflated with people-who-are-Russian. When \u201cthe Russians\u201d did something, it was occasionally \u201ca Russian guy\u201d who had done it. That distinction is important in figuring out the culpability of the state, as opposed to an individual.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth asking: Where's the alleged corruption involving Ukraine and CrowdStrike? Or involving the Steele dossier, if that's what we're talking about now? What's the role of state actors that would necessitate halting aid to the state?\n\nAD\n\nHannity raised a 2017 article suggesting that there were \u201cUkrainian efforts\u201d to aid Hillary Clinton\u2019s election in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nBut that article specifically notes that there was \u201clittle evidence of \u2026 a top-down effort by Ukraine\u201d to influence the election and, ironically, that \u201cthe rampant corruption, factionalism and economic struggles plaguing the country \u2026 would render it unable to pull off an ambitious covert interference campaign in another country\u2019s election.\u201d\n\nHannity, of course, presents it as documenting \u201cchapter and verse\u201d how \u201cthey\u201d \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 worked with Hillary to influence the 2016 election.\n\nAfter Trump reiterated his false assertions about CrowdStrike and the \u201cserver,\u201d he made a revealing comment about his vague request that his unfounded theory be investigated.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cReferring to that, that\u2019s not for an election that\u2019s going into the future, that\u2019s for a past election that was a catastrophe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd it was a very unfair situation.\"\n\nAD\n\nTrump is pointedly trying to separate his request about the DNC hacking from the 2020 election, a tacit recognition that there is a legal problem with requesting Zelensky\u2019s aid on elections moving forward. That, of course, was the other request he made to the Ukrainian president: to look into former vice president Joe Biden, a possible 2020 general election opponent of the president\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s a secondary point. The main point is straightforward: Trump\u2019s assertions about Ukraine\u2019s involvement in 2016 are only generously referred to as tenuous, are rooted in an apparent misunderstanding of what happened and are unmoored to his assertions that he\u2019s only worried about corruption.", "description": "A new interview with Sean Hannity shows just how little meat is on that bone.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iNN2k72BI9wwoin06K3R59G99OI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2TFWMTXUZ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
