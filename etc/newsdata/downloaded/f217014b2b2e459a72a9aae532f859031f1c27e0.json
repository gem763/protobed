Many of these (including the famous Astronomical Clock) were spared during WWII and left Prague as one of Europe\u2019s striking examples of history and circumstance.\n\nToday, it\u2019s busier than ever, but still worth a visit. The major parts of the city are condensed and a combination of the greatest hits plus a taste of local culture can be compiled into a three-day visit.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, summer is busy (really busy) and at that time you\u2019ll be working your way through tour groups, tour buses, and general backpackers all gawking at gorgeous 500-year-old edifices. Autumn, however, is an ideal time to visit.\n\nSTAY\n\nAs far as prime locations go, the Four Seasons Hotel Prague is right in the middle of the action on the banks of the Vitava on the edge of Old Town. The three-building complex features stately accommodations from the Neo-Classical, Neo-Renaissance, and Baroque periods, with the earliest dating to 1568.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly one of the highest-end options in a city with a surprising concentration of wealth (mainly Eastern European and Russian). It\u2019s also just far enough outside the tourist chaos of Old Town Square, with the peace and quiet that comes with being situated right along the river.\n\nAcross the river, The Luxury Collection's Augustine meshes Czech history with Mediterranean design in a historic building that\u2019s closely linked with the in-property St. Augustine Monastery. The property includes seven buildings tucked away under the shadow of Prague Castle in a slightly calmer part of town.\n\nDINE\n\nThe rapid increase in tourism (more than 10 million people visited the Czech Republic in 2018 alone\u2014the most recent data available) has signaled a significant shift away from the generalities of Czech food and created a medley of international options around the city.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest signs of this growth is the introduction and success of Manifesto Market in the hodgepodge Florenc neighborhood. More than 20 restaurants, three bars, and a few local design shops are spread out across an open lot each selling their food and wares out of a single shipping container.\n\nThe variety and quality would be at home anywhere in the world with options ranging from poke to Balinese to American barbecue. Among the standouts is Kapara\u2014a refreshing take on Israeli street food where you can order full heads of roasted cauliflower as a main course or have it chopped and jam-packed into a \u201cCauliflower Shawarma\u201d with veggies, homemade hummus, yogurt sauce, and more.\n\nFor a more traditional option, Pizza Nuova rivals any Italian meal you\u2019ll eat outside Italy with handmade pasta, Napoli-style pizza, full antipasti spreads, and more.\n\nThe city has plenty of international dining options, and a lot of beer drinking. Pixabay\n\nDRINK\n\nPrague is a beer-driven city, and the national drink, Pilsner Urquell, is available just about everywhere you go, priced on par with water. When you\u2019re ready for something a bit more unique, the nondescript Czech Beer Shop carries a nice selection of local and regional beers that are hard to find elsewhere around town.\n\nOn the other side of Old Town, Gulden Draak Bierhuis focuses primarily on Belgian beers with a range of bottle and draft options, plus a case of specialty and rare labels you\u2019re not likely to find stateside. Count on the knowledgeable staff to help guide you to your perfect pint.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to get away from the droves in Prague, but one place to take a breath is on the walk from the funicular station at the top of Petrin Hill to Strahov Monastery. It\u2019s a peaceful, half-mile stroll to the monastery and adjoining Kl\u00e1\u0161tern\u00ed pivovar Strahov\u2014the monks\u2019 17th-century brewery that reopened in 2000. Prague\u2019s relaxed alcohol laws means you can grab a couple of excellent lagers, IPAs, or blueberry beer (a local favorite) to go for the walk down.\n\nNamesti Miru (Peace Square). Geoff Nudelman\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nYou can still capture that special slice of serenity in Old Town during high season, but you have to get up early to do it. The best time to enjoy these stunning sites is 6 a.m.- to 8 a.m. As soon as the sun fully rises, the crowds arrive and the charm fades. But in those two magical hours, you\u2019ll find yourself able to casually stroll as shop owners and businesspeople begin their days and wedding parties make a mad dash for classic photos.\n\nHowever touristy it may seem, renting a paddle boat and gliding along the water underneath Prague\u2019s famous bridges is a nice way to get a new perspective on the city. Several shops along the water rent boats by the hour in two separate boating areas: one to the south of the Charles Bridge, and one to the north (a vessel waterway divides the two areas and is well marked as a no-paddle zone).\n\nThe writer was a guest of Four Seasons Hotel Prague.", "description": "Stunning old-world architecture and surprisingly eclectic dining are just the beginning", "authors": ["Geoff Nudelman"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-109378/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
