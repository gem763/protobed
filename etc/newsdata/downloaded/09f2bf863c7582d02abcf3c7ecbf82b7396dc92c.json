The pages that came from her typewriter would be saved for decades with a note in blue ink: \u201cWonderful letter from Nelle Harper Lee.\u201d\n\nIt had been three years since the publication of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d and several months since the release of the movie adaptation, when the young Pulitzer Prize winner found herself preoccupied with another deeply Southern topic.\n\nAt the moment when it must have felt like everyone in her life was waiting to read anything else she had written, Harper Lee finally had something to write about: the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\n\nShe was working with rich material. Lee had become transfixed by a scandal that appeared to implicate the legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant\u2014a story rife with corruption, bias, rivalry, peculiarities of state politics, moral quandaries and a healthy dose of the absurd. This was the essence of college football captured in one neat letter. And it happened to be written by a great American novelist who typed her name and return address on the back of the envelope:\n\n\n\n\u201cLee\n\nMonroeville\n\nAlabama\u201d\n\nHarper Lee might not be the first Alabaman who comes to mind as someone who loved Alabama\u2019s football team. In fact she might be the last. But as she once put it: \u201cI was a rabid football fan long before I was a writer.\u201d\n\nLike most rabid fans, she watched every Alabama game. Unlike most of her kind, she once skipped the Cannes Film Festival to meet Bryant. \u201cBear talked about literature, and I talked about football,\u201d Lee said at the time. She was so interested in hearing people talk about football that she even listened to ESPN host Paul Finebaum\u2019s radio show.\n\n\u201cI would say it wasn\u2019t an interest but a passion,\u201d said Tonja Carter, her attorney. \u201cMost of the fall schedule was built around watching the games on TV.\u201d\n\nThis passion was such a powerful force in the lives of Nelle Harper and Alice Lee that the sisters purchased their first television in part because they had to watch football. Alice died in 2014 and Nelle Harper in 2016, and they remained fans as Nick Saban restored the Crimson Tide to glory.\n\n\u201cI have heard that she was,\u201d Saban said, \u201cbut I never had the opportunity to have any interactions with her.\u201d\n\nHarper Lee in 1963 Photo: Associated Press\n\nThe Lees were a family divided when it came to football. Alice (who happened to be nicknamed \u201cBear\u201d) and Nelle Harper went to Alabama. Their siblings went to Auburn. \u201cThe sisters were very funny about their love for Alabama,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThey would cheer for both teams until they played each other. Then they were 100% Alabama fans.\u201d (As for Carter\u2019s allegiances, she added: \u201cROLL TIDE!!!!\u201d)\n\nBear Bryant was busy winning national championships in the 1960s as Harper Lee was becoming phenomenally successful herself. She famously wouldn\u2019t publish another book for more than a half-century\u2014and it turned out to be one that was written before \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d But for someone who seemed reclusive, Lee was never a recluse. The great paradox of this author who went silent between 1960 and 2015 is that she was a prolific writer of letters. You just had to know her to read her.\n\nThe former Auburn football coach Pat Dye found himself on the receiving end of her letters after befriending Lee near the end of her life. He\u2019d read her novel\u2014\u201cTo Kill a Blackbird,\u201d he once called it\u2014and begged for an introduction. When they finally met, Dye was sufficiently impressed. \u201cYou know, Nelle,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re not really an obnoxious Alabama fan.\u201d\n\nDye and Lee fell into an unspoken tradition when he visited her. He would bring her a bag of chocolates and a bottle of whiskey. She would write him a letter afterward.\n\n\u201cI got about 8-to-10 love letters from her,\u201d Dye said. And what do they say? \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to share your letters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re private.\u201d\n\nAlabama football players celebrate coach Bear Bryant, whom Harper Lee adored, after the Crimson Tide\u2019s unbeaten season in 1966.

Annie Laurie Williams and Maurice Crain were literary agents who donated their papers to Columbia University\u2019s Rare Book & Manuscript Library, for example, and their archives include correspondence with Truman Capote, Margaret Mitchell, John Steinbeck and a series of letters from another one of their favorite clients: Harper Lee.\n\n\u201cThat Harper Lee was always writing was obvious to anyone who knew her, if only because they were reminded whenever they opened their mail,\u201d Casey Cep writes in her new book, \u201cFurious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee,\u201d which briefly quotes her football letter. \u201cLee\u2019s correspondence constitutes its own archive, not only of her life, the heres and theres and sometimes the nowheres of her adventures, but also of her mind.\u201d\n\nOn her mind on April 3, 1963 when she wrote to her literary agents was the sort of bizarre saga that would dominate Finebaum\u2019s radio show today.\n\nIt all started with an article in the Saturday Evening Post, which is a very 1963 way to begin a scandal. The story was based on the account of an Atlanta insurance agent named George Burnett. He had been trying to place a long-distance call in September 1962 when, in an incredible twist of fortune, he was accidentally connected to a call between Bryant and Georgia athletic director Wally Butts. Burnett couldn\u2019t believe what he claimed to be hearing: Butts sharing Georgia\u2019s strategy for its upcoming game against Alabama with Bryant. A week after the phone call, Alabama beat Georgia, 35-0, and Burnett was convinced he\u2019d eavesdropped on the football equivalent of insider trading.\n\nBurnett passed along his concerns to Georgia coach Johnny Griffith, who already had a feeling that someone had given Alabama his playbook, and Butts resigned after Griffith took the information to school officials. The Saturday Evening Post published its blockbuster story in March 1963. The men admitted that they had spoken by phone, but they denied the allegation that they had conspired to rig the game, and Butts immediately sued the magazine\u2019s parent company for $10 million.\n\nBy then the sordid libel case involving this alleged scheme to fix the Alabama vs. Georgia game had captivated the South. And there was one notable resident of Monroeville paying close attention.\n\nPhoto: Annie Laurie Williams Records, Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Columbia University\n\n\u201cThe Wally Butts-Bear Bryant thing is a lallapalooza & gets more complicated every day,\u201d Harper Lee wrote to Williams and Crain. \u201cI hope the papers are giving it the right coverage in New York but doubt it.\u201d\n\nThere had been weeks of \u201crumors, counterrumors, accusations, boasts, speculations and seeping innuendoes,\u201d according to Sports Illustrated later that summer, and Harper Lee followed every part of the brouhaha from her side of the Chattahoochee River.\n\n\u201cWhat started out as most of the Southeastern Conference patrons cancelling their subscriptions to the Satevepost has as of today erupted into a major political scandal in Georgia,\u201d she wrote. But one part of the story that didn\u2019t quite make sense to Lee and \u201cpeople in these parts\u201d is why Butts would hand Georgia\u2019s secrets to a sworn enemy such as Bryant. Then again she wasn\u2019t convinced that he did. As she wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Butts said to Bryant on the telephone!\u201d\n\nPhoto: Annie Laurie Williams Records, Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Columbia University\n\nLee had two reasons to take Bryant at his word when he denied the allegations. The first was that she was an Alabama fan. The second was that she understood the importance of presuming innocence. \u201cWe believe in our dear Bear until he\u2019s proven guilty,\u201d Lee wrote.\n\nThere was actually one more reason to believe what she wanted to believe about Bryant. When a former Alabama linebacker named Lee Roy Jordan said that \u201cas far as he knows it ain\u2019t so,\u201d Harper Lee trusted him. She knew his family. They were from the next town over. \u201cThe Jordans have a reputation for veracity in these parts,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Butts won an unlikely 5-4 decision in 1967, four years after Lee\u2019s note to her agents. It had been a long time since she\u2019d ended that letter by asking Crain for an excuse to send another one.\n\n\u201cThis letter is twice as long as anything you have ever written me, and I\u2019m not going to write another word until you quit sitting in Bryant Park girl-watching and spring-fevering and WRITE.\n\n\n\n\u201cLove to all,\n\nNelle.\u201d\n\n\u2014Laine Higgins contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "description": "The author of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d watched every Crimson Tide game and wrote letters about Bear Bryant\u2014including this one.", "authors": ["Ben Cohen", "Ben.Cohen Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105268/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
