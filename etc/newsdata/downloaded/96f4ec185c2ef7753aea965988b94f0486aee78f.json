Juncker is due to leave office on October 31, to be replaced by former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nIn his new position, Brok will advise Juncker on \"strategy and priorities in relations with Ukraine in the aftermath of the country's presidential and parliamentary elections earlier this year,\" according to the Commission.\n\nBrok was one of the European Parliament's most prominent members, having served as the chairman of its foreign affairs committee. He is also a controversial figure. He faced criticism for holding a position at German media giant Bertelsmann while also serving as an MEP and for running a system that charged visitors to the European Parliament, ostensibly to cover costs but which generated financial surpluses. Brok later repaid the excess funds.\n\nBrok's new job will not go down well with everyone in Ukraine. In 2013, he was attacked by a member of the activist group Femen outside the European Parliament following reports \u2014 denied by Brok and EU institutions \u2014 that he had visited a brothel in Ukraine and made degrading comments about women.", "description": "Controversial German Christian Democrat to offer counsel to Commission chief Juncker.", "authors": ["Maxime Schlee"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-186321614-1200x628.jpg"}
