I put on weight.\n\n\"I chose taking painkillers over going out with my friends.\n\n\"It affected my relationships.\"\n\nShe said for years she could not get any help, until she was sent to the Bridge Project, a charity in Bradford that works with people with drugs problems.\n\nWith their support, she managed to wean herself off painkillers and has not taken them since the end of last year.\n\n\"There are some hard days. But I have got my life back now.\"\n\nWhat drugs were reviewed?\n\nFive classes of medicines were included in the review - asked for by government amid concern that large numbers of people were misusing prescription drugs.\n\nThey were:\n\nAntidepressants\n\nOpioid painkillers for acute pain and injury (excluding use in cancer patients)\n\nGabapentinoids (used to treat epilepsy, anxiety and nerve-related pain)\n\nBenzodiazepines (mostly prescribed for anxiety)\n\nZ-drugs (sleeping tablets)\n\nThe number of prescriptions being issued has been rising for some time - partly because of the ageing population - although there are signs their use is slowing.\n\nTo assess the levels of dependency, PHE officials analysed patient data to find out exactly how many people were taking these drugs outside of hospitals and for how long.\n\nHalf of people who were using the drugs in March 2018 had been on them for a year or more with about a quarter having used them for at least three years.\n\nRates of prescribing were higher in deprived areas and among women.\n\nCan long-term use be justified?\n\nHow long each drug should be used varies.\n\nOpioid-based painkillers should only be used for a few months at most so the fact that there were 1.2 million people on them for at least a year - 540,000 of whom were on them for at least three years - was extremely worrying, PHE said.\n\nAntidepressants by comparison take some time to become fully effective so it is not surprising to find people using them for a long time.\n\nBut there were nearly 1 million people using them who had been on them for at least three years, which rang alarm bells, PHE said.\n\nOfficials said the scale of that long-term use suggested those with mild-to-moderate depression may have become dependent on them.\n\nFor the other drugs, there was only a minority of cases where long-term use was appropriate, PHE said.\n\nProf John Read, of the British Psychological Society, said the findings were \"alarming\".\n\nWhat should patients do?\n\nImage copyright BackyardProduction\n\nPHE said patients should not simply stop taking their drugs.\n\nInstead, they are urging patients to speak to their GP, who are being told to do more to review the use of these medications and seek alternative solutions.\n\nDoctors say any attempt to tackle dependency needs to involve a gradual reduction in use and dosage.\n\nPHE said it was not clear if this scale of long-term use was causing harm - although each drug does have side-effects, including weight gain and placing stress on the heart, kidney and lungs.\n\nBut they said long-term use meant tolerance could build up and treatments could stop being effective or require patients to up the doses they were taking, while any reduction in use could lead to withdrawal symptoms.\n\nHas the situation got as bad as the US?\n\nThe misuse of prescription drugs - and in particular opioid-based painkillers - is a major problem in the US.\n\nPrescription rates have risen sharply since the late 1990s - and there are signs attempts to crack down on this have driven people into the illegal market for drugs.\n\nDeaths from opioid overdoses have more than doubled in the past decade in the US.\n\nPHE said what is being seen in England is not yet on that scale.\n\nPrescription rates are four times lower in England than the US and deaths from overdoses have not increased at such a rate.\n\nIn fact, PHE said opioid prescriptions were also lower than in many other European nations.\n\n\"We want to get on top of this now before we see the problems that have been seen elsewhere,\" Prof Cosford added.", "description": "Half of those taking drugs including strong painkillers and sleeping pills are on them for more than a year.", "authors": ["Nick Triggle", "Health Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0BA5/production/_99718920_gettyimages-531603282.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
