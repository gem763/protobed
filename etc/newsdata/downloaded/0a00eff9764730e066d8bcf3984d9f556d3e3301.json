Cellphone videos of the storm captured the ghostly funnel eerily illuminated by flashes of lightning.\n\nHardest hit were neighborhoods on the northern reaches of Dallas County as the destructive tornado passed just north of University Park and plowed through Preston Hollow. It then likely crossed route 75 and highway 635. Homes were left in ruins in Preston Hollow, an affluent Dallas neighborhood north of Southern Methodist University.\n\nThe area is home to former president George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush, who were reportedly not harmed in the storm.\n\n\u201cThey got lucky and are praying for the safety of their neighbors around DFW,\u201d a Bush spokesman told KTVT.\n\n\n\nIn this Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019 photo, Henry Ramirez, a member of Primera Iglesia Dallas, is consoled by his mother Maribel Morales as they survey severe damage to the church. (Jeffrey McWhorter)\n\nThe severe storms, featuring 70 mph straight-line winds, heavy rain, lightning and half-dollar-sized hail, left 65,000 people without power Sunday night, according to Oncor, the state\u2019s largest utility company.\n\n\u201cDamage is significant in the areas where the tornado touched down,\u201d Oncor tweeted.\n\nThe episode was part of a larger severe weather outbreak that prompted close to 200 reports of severe weather from Texas to the Illinois/Missouri border. Despite this, the only reported tornadoes occurred in the immediate DFW metroplex.\n\nThe city of Dallas said there were no reports of fatalities, but first responders were working overnight to check on residents in a door-to-door search, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nRocky Vaz, director of the Dallas Office of Emergency Management, told The Washington Post three people had been hospitalized for injuries related to the storm that are not life-threatening. Vaz added that six people also suffered noncritical injuries after an 18-wheeler overturned.\n\n\n\nA destructive tornado tosses debris more than four miles high in the northern part of the Dallas area. (GR2 Analyst/Cappucci)\n\nThe meteorological context\n\nThe supercell thunderstorm that would eventually produce the significant tornado in northern Dallas formed along a line of storms that approached the city from the west.\n\nBetween 8:10 and 8:25 p.m., the supercell intensified quickly north of Fort Worth, likely producing hail west of Grapevine. A second major supercell was ongoing south of Fort Worth, near Burleson along 35W. Rotation in the northern supercell was relatively broad and diffuse through about 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe northern cell was still relatively disorganized at 8:40 p.m. as its updraft passed over Grapevine, while a pair of showers just to the south developed. These merged with the cell around 8:55 p.m.. That may have helped consolidate the rotation and intensify the storm. By then, the nascent rotation passed directly over the DFW airport.\n\nBest video I've seen so far of the #DallasTornado https://t.co/AN2S1TPyRy \u2014 John Kassell (@JPKassell) October 21, 2019\n\nOne radar scan later at 8:58 p.m., the rotation became significantly more intense south of Farmers Branch, about two miles east of Las Colinas near Interstate 35 East. A tornado warning was issued at 9 p.m.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. Sunday, the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department confirmed a tornado had formed about two miles north of Dallas Love Field Airport and was moving east. The National Weather Service in Fort Worth labeled the tornado \u201ca life-threatening situation,\u201d indicating \u201ccomplete destruction is possible.\u201d\n\nA radar scan of the storm showed a clear and ominous \u201cdebris ball\u201d signature where the powerful funnel had tossed the remnants of homes and businesses aloft. At this point, debris reached more than two miles high.\n\n\n\nThe destructive Dallas tornado tosses debris more than 20,000 feet high. (GR2 Analyst/Matthew Cappucci)\n\nThe National Weather Service called it a \u201cParticularly Dangerous Situation, which is a rare type of tornado warning that is reserved for the most serious cases.\n\n\n\nDoppler radar reveals the powerful rotation associated with the Dallas tornado. (GR2 Analyst/Matthew Cappucci)\n\nAt 9:07 p.m., debris reached a height of at least three miles near Preston Hollow, with indications of debris potentially higher than 20,000 feet. That suggests an extremely powerful, and likely violent, tornado. Oftentimes, the height to which debris is carried is proportional to a twister\u2019s strength.\n\nThat major tornado continued just north of the center of University Park about a half mile south of the 635/75 interchange. It then crossed 635 just south of Richardson, passing near North Lake Highlands around 9:20 p.m., close to Richland College. At 9:26 p.m., a \u201clarge tornado\u201d was confirmed over Richardson.\n\nThe thunderstorm then produced a surge of downward-moving winds south of the vortex, weakening it some and causing a bit of a left turn northward. It is unclear when the initial strong tornado lifted.\n\nAt the same time, it appears a second tornado spun up nearby just a couple of miles to the south.\n\nWarnings for the storms remained in effect until 10 p.m.\n\nDallas has been placed under a \u201cmarginal\u201d risk by the Storm Prediction Center three days in advance; by Sunday, it had been upgraded to a slight risk. While discussions Sunday afternoon did mention \u201cstrong tornado potential,\" forecasters were uncertain of whether storms would develop as supercells, which have long-lasting rotating updrafts, or squall lines, which do not contain as high of a tornado threat. There were also uncertainties about the amount of moisture that would be available for these storms.\n\nA tornado watch was issued around sunset Sunday, mentioning that \u201ca few intense tornadoes\u201d were possible.\n\nSevere storms also hit other parts of the country on Sunday into early Monday. Remarkably, two busy airports were affected by tornadoes within hours of each other, with an apparent tornado also damaging Memphis Airport in Tennessee early Monday morning.\n\nDallas tornado history\n\nHistorically, Dallas is no stranger to tornadoes. And while they are most likely in the late spring months, the past several years have featured damaging Dallas-area tornadoes at all times of the year.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, a swarm of more than 20 tornadoes tore across the Metroplex, damaging at least a thousand homes and tossing semi tractor trailers into the air on live television.\n\nAn EF-4 tornado claimed 10 lives in Garland on Dec. 26, 2015, in the same community that narrowly escaped disaster Sunday night.\n\nOn March 28, 2000, an EF-3 tornado hit downtown Fort Worth, leaving two dead and causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nAs urban sprawl continues and continues and population grows in metro areas such as Dallas, the risk for destructive tornadoes impacting heavily-populated areas increases as well. Even with the lengthy tornado history in the Metroplex, Sunday\u2019s tornado may rank as one of the most significant twisters to track through Dallas County.\n\nEagles Cowboys r in Arlington #PHIvsDAL Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nTornado in Dallas tornado damage initial photo: near Love Field airport.

Started north of Irving and moved through north Dallas then ended just south of Richardson.
