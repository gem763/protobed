Anyone who expresses the intention to be incinerated confirms their separation from the Church and therefore does not have the right to a religious ceremony.\u201d\n\nThe nearest crematoria previously available to Greeks were in Bulgaria.", "description": "Rits\u00f3na (Greece) (AFP) \u2013 Greece has acquired its first crematorium, organisers said Thursday, capping decades of efforts blocked by the powerful", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/a35b4d_you-see-is-result-an-effort-began-in-1996-antonis-alakiotis-head-greek-cremation-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
