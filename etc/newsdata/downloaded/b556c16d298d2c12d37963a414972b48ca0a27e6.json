If he was out there where he was playing on one foot, then that wouldn\u2019t be the way to go.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons listed Ryan as questionable on the injury report. He was a limited practice participant on Friday.\n\nRyan, the 2016 MVP, suffered the injury while being sacked by the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Aaron Donald in last Sunday\u2019s 37-10 defeat, the Falcons\u2019 fifth straight. The Rams sacked Ryan five times, matching the total by the Falcons\u2019 defense through seven games.\n\nDespite Atlanta getting off to its worst start since 2007, Ryan had thrown for more than 300 yards in each of the first six games of the season and led the NFL with 15 touchdown passes entering last weekend. He hasn\u2019t missed a start since December 2009, his second year in the league.\n\nMatt Schaub, a 16-year veteran who was originally drafted by the Falcons in 2005, replaced Ryan and went 6 of 6 for 65 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my job,\u201d said Schaub, who hasn\u2019t started a game since 2015 with Baltimore. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in this role, doing what I\u2019m doing. If I\u2019m called upon, whether if it is the Wednesday practice, Thursday practice, we\u2019ll see how it goes. That\u2019s my role and my responsibility.\u201d\n\nQuinn was asked after the latest defeat whether he has lost the team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fair question because I spend most of the time trying to connect and get the team to play like they are capable of,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThe answer, I would say, is no.\n\n\u201cI am at a disbelief at times for not playing like we are capable of. That can be very frustrating. When you don\u2019t do that, you look and search for answers.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons will be without cornerback Desmond Trufant (toe), guard James Carpenter (knee), and running back Ito Smith (concussion) against Seattle. The status of defensive tackle Grady Jarrett (abdomen) will be determined on Saturday.\n\nThe Seahawks suffered a 30-16 loss to Baltimore last weekend at home. Russell Wilson threw his first interception of the season, which was returned 67 yards for a touchdown by the Ravens\u2019 Marcus Peters.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s defense clinched the victory with a fumble return for a score.\n\n\u201cIt hammered home one of the lessons of our program, that it\u2019s all about the ball,\u201d Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cWhen you give the ball up a couple of times, it\u2019s hard to win. You give up a couple of scores, it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d\n\nWilson was 20 of 41 for 241 yards and an 8-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett. Wilson completed fewer than half of his attempts for the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to move on and keep your head down, and sometimes you just focus on the next play and expecting a lot of great things to happen after that,\u201d said Wilson, who was listed with a knee injury on Wednesday\u2019s injury report but was still a full participant.\n\nSeahawks center Justin Britt said he has no doubt Wilson will rebound.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be Russ, and he\u2019s going to be alright,\u201d Britt said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back to it and do our job to protect and keep him cleaner. ... He\u2019s still the best quarterback in the league.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Things just aren't getting any better for the Atlanta Falcons.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
