(AP) \u2014 President Trump is making a rare visit to California, a Democratic stronghold where he is expected to rake in millions of dollars during a series of fundraisers for his reelection effort that are almost certain to be met with jeering protests.\n\nTrump has routinely mocked California over its liberal culture, policies and politics. His visit Tuesday and Wednesday signals that despite the state\u2019s decidedly leftward swing in recent years there are still plenty of wealthy Republicans who support him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been a president in living history that is as unpopular in the state of California as Trump,\u201d said Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who is an outspoken Trump critic. \u201cBut our money spends the same as everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nTrump continues to rake in gobs of cash more than a year out from the November 2020 contest, with his campaign and the Republican National Committee pulling in more than $210 million since the start of 2019, Federal Election Commission records show. That\u2019s more than all the current Democrats seeking to replace him raised combined during that period.\n\nThe California events, which will be spread across two days in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego, are expected to bring in an additional $15 million, according to a Republican official familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nCalifornia was an incubator for the modern conservative movement that swept the state\u2019s former Gov. Ronald Reagan into the White House in 1980. But demographic changes and an influx of new residents have helped drastically rework the political contours of the country\u2019s most populated state, with the former GOP stronghold of Orange County now home to more registered Democrats than Republicans. For Republicans, who have been resigned to political irrelevance at the state level, a donation to Trump can amount to its own form of protest.\n\n\u201cBy showing up to a fundraiser deep in the belly of the beast, one is saying: \u2018I don\u2019t care what the liberal politicians are saying and I want to show my support for him publicly,\u2019\u201d said California\u2019s Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon, who is an ardent Trump supporter. She added: \u201cI sold $100,000 worth of (tickets), and I could have sold another $100,000 more.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has long been a key fundraising hotbed for politicians of both parties, which have relied on the entertainment industry and wealthy industry heads to finance their political ambitions. But under Trump, the run-of-the-mill fundraising trip has taken on a complicating dimension due to his harsh criticism of everything from the state\u2019s immigration laws to its forest management practices, which he blamed for fatal wildfires.\n\nEarlier this month Trump lashed out at \u201cWill and Grace\u201d TV star Debra Messing after she tweeted that attendees of the Trump\u2019s California fundraisers should be outed publicly.\n\n\u201cI have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC\u2019s failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me \u201cSir.\u201d How times have changed!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nIn August, he took aim at the state\u2019s massive film industry, calling Hollywood \u201cvery dangerous for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cHollywood is really terrible. You talk about racist \u2014 Hollywood is racist,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s contributed to heightened security concerns surrounding the trip.\n\nTrump has also complained about the extent of homelessness in California. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is expected to follow Trump to California, if one day behind him, on visits to San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. A senior HUD official said Carson will speak on a range of issues, including increasing the supply of affordable housing and incentivizing investment in distressed communities while protecting vulnerable neighbors.\n\nAlready, the Backbone Campaign, a Washington state-based progressive group, said on Facebook that it planned to fly a large \u201cBaby Trump\u201d balloon in the Bay Area when Trump is scheduled to be there on Tuesday.\n\nIn an unusual move, Trump campaign officials \u2014 not his top donors \u2014 have been listed as sponsors of the event.\n\nDhillon said there were concerns that Antifa, an anti-fascist group, could stir violent protests.\n\n\u201cFor every person coming to this event, there would probably be 10 more,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump began his three-day trip to the West at a rally in New Mexico, which he hopes to win next year despite losing by about 8 percentage points in 2016.\n\nTrump referred to California a couple of times in his speech, and not in a good way.\n\nThe president noted that his administration is at odds with the state over fuel efficiency standards for automobiles. He long has made clear he wants to end California\u2019s clout in setting mileage standards, and Monday night he said he wants heavier cars because they\u2019re safer and cheaper, even if they are less fuel-efficient.\n\n\u201cCalifornia wants you to do the other cars and we don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will end up in big litigation and I am fighting for you,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nHe also joked about moving part of the border wall in San Diego to where it would be more appreciated.\n\n\u201cI would love to take that sucker down and move it right now to New Mexico,\u201d he said to rousing cheers.\n\n___\n\nSlodysko reported from Washington.
