Accordingly, \"we expect positive revisions to Q1 FY20 earnings and cash flow,\" he added.\n\nKaip highlighted the U.S. firm's sales during the quarter, which amounted to about 60,000 ounces (60 Koz) of gold equivalent. The total was 13% higher than BMO's estimate despite expectations for lower streaming sales resulting from production limitations at Mt. Milligan during calendar Q1/19.\n\nThe total gold equivalent ounces sold with respect to Royal Gold's streaming agreements constituted 50 Koz gold, 510 Koz silver and 1,100 tons of .\n\nOf the three metals, only gold sales were higher, thus primarily accounting for the beat. The reason for that was a drawdown and sellout of gold inventory, leaving the company with 18 Koz of the precious metal currently in inventory.\n\nRoyal Gold intends to release its Q1 FY20 results on Nov. 6, 2019, after the market closes and hold a conference call the following day at noon EST.\n\nBMO has a Market Perform rating on Royal Gold. It is currently trading at around $129.88 per share.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by The Gold Report  covering: Copper Futures.
