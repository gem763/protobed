Users can access information to learn more about each player and see their position highlighted on a virtual field. The interactive also allows users to stay up to date with the US women\u2019s standing in the group stage, their most recent match score, and game schedule.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to provide an immersive way to learn more about the US Women\u2019s team throughout the lifecycle of this year\u2019s World Cup,\u201d said Ray Soto, Director of Emerging Technology, USA TODAY. \u201cWe have seen how much AR informs and entertains users so it\u2019s a natural fit for brands to want to be a part of these engaging experiences as well. And, keeping consumers engaged throughout the World Cup experience really builds excitement.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201cMeet the Team,\u201d USA TODAY is launching its first gaming AR interactive, \u201cMake the Save.\u201d Within the game-like experience, users have the opportunity to test their skills blocking penalty kicks by stepping into the shoes of Alyssa Naeher, the U.S. goalkeeper. Naeher shares details related to being the No. 1 goalkeeper for the world\u2019s top-ranked team, her amazing record, and how she describes defending against one of the game\u2019s toughest shots. To create this experience, Naeher was captured using photogrammetry to incorporate a 3D visual similar to USA TODAY\u2019s recent AR interactives including \u201cOscars AR: The costumes and creators.\u201d\n\nThe augmented reality interactives are available in the USA TODAY mobile app, for both iOS and Android users. Please visit \"Meet the Team\" or \"Make the Save\" from a mobile device.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/06/04/usa-today-releases-two-new-augmented-reality-interactives-womens-world-cup/1339105001/", "description": "USA TODAY has released two new augmented reality (AR) experiences ahead of the Women\u2019s World Cup tournament, \u201cMeet the Team\u201d and a game-like experience, \u201cMake the Save.\u201d", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
