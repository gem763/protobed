To come here and play against one of the strongest sides on the planet showed the guys were committed.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s tormentors Leicester advanced with a 3-1 win over Burton, who will have no repeat of last season\u2019s journey to the semi-finals.\n\nAlso advancing were Everton, 2-0 winners over Watford; Colchester, who won 3-1 at Crawley; and Oxford, who beat Sunderland on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nAttention now switches to Wednesday\u2019s fixtures, with three ties to come.\n\nLiverpool host Arsenal, Chelsea take on Manchester United and Aston Villa and Wolves meet in a battle of near neighbours, if not exactly fierce rivals.\n\nThere will be no Granit Xhaka for Arsenal at Anfield, but manager Unai Emery has indicated that is unrelated to the club captain\u2019s angry reaction towards supporters who mockingly cheered his substitution against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nInstead Emery will shuffle his pack, as will opposite number Jurgen Klopp, who has included teenager Harvey Elliott in his squad after the 16-year-old completed a 14-day FA ban for using offensive language in a video mocking Tottenham striker Harry Kane.\n\nElliott became the youngest player to start a senior Liverpool match when he played in the last round against MK Dons aged 16 years and 174 days.\n\nAs United travel to Chelsea, much has changed for both sides since the Red Devils opened the season with a 4-0 rout of Frank Lampard\u2019s side at Old Trafford.\n\nWhile United have won only four of 13 games since, Lampard\u2019s side go into the game having won seven in a row in all competitions.\n\nThe draw for the quarter-finals will follow on Thursday morning, after which Guardiola may or may not allow himself to think about another trip to Wembley in March.\n\nPA", "description": "Pep Guardiola claimed it was too early to start thinking about winning the Carabao Cup for a third successive year, but his side showed few signs of weakness as they brushed aside Southampton\u00a03-1 to reach the quarter-finals.
