Now that mediated communication is performed through the devices, we lost this communication modality.\n\n\u201cWith this project, we tried to combine the best of the two. The prototypes we developed propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.\u201d\n\nWhile the concept of artificial skin has been explored in the field of robotics as scientists attempt to develop robots that look and act like humans, the researchers said they were more interested in working with everyday devices.\n\nDr Roudaut added: \u201cWe have seen many works trying to augment human with parts of machines, here we look at the other way around and try to make the devices we use every day more like us, ie, human-like.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Scientists have developed an \u201cartificial skin\u201d that they say can wrap around devices such as smartphones and make them ticklish.
