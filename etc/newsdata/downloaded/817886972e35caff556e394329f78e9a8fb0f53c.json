We know a lot about US soft power too (think Hollywood, rock-and-roll, and Marvel comics). But there is another way the US tries to maintain a pre-eminent role in world affairs. I call it software power.\n\nThe operating system on the computer you own is probably American. It\u2019s odds on that the search engine you use to find things out online is American too. It\u2018s also very likely that the social media you log into on a daily basis is American. It might be overstating things, but it\u2019s not far off to say that the \u2018Computer World\u2019 we all live in, and which Kraftwerk sang about almost forty years ago, is basically an American world, but it\u2019s not far off.\n\nIt\u2019s this dependence on US software and the products of Silicon Valley giants which makes countries which want to maintain their independence from Washington so vulnerable. The latest victim of US software power projection is Venezuela. Adobe, the Californian company which provides design tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator, and the document management system Acrobat Reader, announced that on the 28th October all subscriptions in the Bolivarian Republic will be cancelled without refund.\n\nAlso on rt.com Some targeted sanctions! Adobe cancels all subscriptions in Venezuela, no refunds will be allowed\n\nThe firm cites President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order from August which, as RT has reported, \u2018basically bans all transactions between the countries.\u2019\n\nYou can imagine the impact the Adobe ban will have on businesses in Venezuela. A whole country and not just Nicolas Maduro and his government will be hit. We can probably all survive without US food, or US films. But can we really get by in our daily lives without US software?\n\nHere\u2019s a few facts to show us how much we rely on US companies when we log in, or switch on our IPhones.\n\n*Microsoft Windows has a 77.61% share of the world\u2019s operating system market, with Apple, also from the US, in second place.\n\n*In early 2018 Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com said it had 400m active users.\n\n*As of June 2019 there were over 2.41 billion monthly users of Facebook.\n\n*In Q2 of 2019 there were 139m Twitter users.\n\n*Google has 90.46% of the search engine market share worldwide and receives over 63,000 searches per second every day, amounting to 2 trillion searches per year.\n\nNo one is arguing that the US companies named above don\u2019t provide some great services to customers. Often the criticism of them (and particularly of Facebook), is over-the-top and lacks balance.\n\nThe problem is that the market dominance of the Silicon Valley giants can be, and has been, exploited by the US government, political agitators, and lobby groups in the US in order to achieve geo-strategic political goals. When the US sanctions a country it knows full well how dependent that country is likely to be on its computer products. It\u2019s an additional and very important hold (and very 21st Century) hold the power elites of the country have over those who resist the writ of Washington.\n\nThere\u2019s also the political pressure that can be and has been exerted on these hi-tech companies to withdraw services from users from \u2018official enemy\u2019 countries. Look at the way legislators have called on Facebook and Twitter to ban dissident voices and consider the hysteria over Russian \u2018bots\u2019 following the US presidential election in 2016.\n\nAlso on rt.com The state of this! Twitter\u2019s advertising ban is ideological & anti-democratic\n\nBefore I get wrongly accused here of \u2018anti-Americanism\u2019, let me acknowledge that it would probably be the same whoever had such a dominant market position. It just so happened that the computer revolution coincided with the emergence of the US as a global hegemon.\n\nUS-backed regime change efforts in Venezuela have, it\u2019s worth noting, been backed enthusiastically by EU poster boy Guy Verhofstadt and other European \u2018liberals.\u2019 One assumes they are very happy with Adobe\u2019s withdrawal of services to Venezuelan customers.\n\n.@jguaido is the only legitimately elected lead representative of the Venezuelan people & @FedericaMog should recognise him as such!\n\n\n\n.@jguaido es el \u00fanico l\u00edder representante del pueblo venezolano elegido leg\u00edtimamente y @FedericaMog \u00a1deber\u00eda reconocerlo como tal! #Venezuelapic.twitter.com/gTSTvCGeuI \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) January 24, 2019\n\nBut Verhofstadt and co might end up with egg on their faces. Make no mistake, if US software power can be used against countries in Latin America, it can be used against European countries too, if and when it needs to be.\n\nOnly last week we saw the US slap 25% tariffs on French wines, Italian cheese, and Scottish whiskey, and announce it would add 10% duties on \u2019large civilian aircraft.\u2019 The French finance minister said that Europe was \u2018ready to react\u2019 with retaliatory tariffs on its own. But if we do get a full-scale US-EU trade war, won\u2019t America\u2019s software power give it the edge and force an EU climbdown?\n\nIf Europeans were as smart as their smartphones, they\u2019d be waking up to the fact that they are vulnerable and be planning accordingly.\n\nLike this story?
