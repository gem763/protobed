The logo of German car maker Mercedes Benz is seen on a Mercedes F125 concept car in Hanover\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler is recalling some new Mercedes-Benz EQC electric cars because of a potentially defective bolt in the differential, the company said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Daimler AG (DE: ) has determined that on certain EQC vehicles the bolt in the front axle differential transmission might not meet durability specifications. Thus, it cannot be ruled out, that the bolt breaks over lifetime,\" the carmaker said.\n\nThe fault could interrupt torque transmission to the front axle, leading to a vehicle stall. Additionally, if parts of the broken bolt become lodged within the differential transmission, this might affect the ability to control the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash, Daimler said.\n\nGerman industry publication kfz betrieb, which initially reported details of the recall, said 1,700 vehicles were targeted. Daimler declined to comment on the number of vehicles affected.", "description": "Mercedes recalls some EQC electric cars due to potentially faulty bolt", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9S1NR-OCATC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
