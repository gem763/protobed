He's a completely innocent child.'\n\nOne of the most prominent provocateurs was former journalist Gemma O'Doherty.\n\nIn a tweet that was posted alongside a billboard featuring the mixed-race family, she wrote: 'German dump @lidl_ireland gaslighting the Irish people with their multicultural version of \"The Ryans\".\n\n'Kidding no-one! Resist the Great Replacement wherever you can by giving this kip a wide berth. #ShopIrish #BuyIrish.'\n\nHer post was met with a flurry of racist comments with other social media users making reference to 'race and ancestor betrayal'.\n\nMs O'Doherty's tweet has since been deleted and she later labelled reports on her abuse targeting the ad as 'fake news' and 'hysteria'.\n\nThe supermarket were then forced to issue their own tweet in defense of the couple.\n\nPosting on their Irish account, they said: 'After offensive and racist tweets from Gemma O\u2019Doherty we have decided to block and report her to @Twitter.\n\n'We are proud of our multicultural & diverse team and our customers. We are proud to work with, and serve, each and every one of them.\n\nThe Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also condemned the abuse\n\n'Everyone is welcome in our store.\n\n'We are contacting the Ryan family regarding this online abuse and will be providing support after this unprovoked attack. We thank everyone for their kind words.'\n\nThe Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also condemned the abuse.\n\nHe branded the social media attacks on the couple as 'disgusting'.\n\nThe couple have since criticised Ireland's police force, the Garda, for how they have handled the situation.\n\nThe police reportedly asked them to read through the abusive tweets themselves to collect evidence and were then told that it was a civil matter.\n\nMs Ryan previously said that they did not harbour any ill-will towards Ms O'Doherty as she has done them a favour by highlighting a weakness in hate crime legislation in Ireland.", "description": "Fiona Ryan, 33, and fiance Jonathan Mathis, 32, appeared in ads for the supermarket chain from September.
