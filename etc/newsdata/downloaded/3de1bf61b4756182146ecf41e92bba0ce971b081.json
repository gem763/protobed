What is deemed \u2018professional\u2019 behavior in the context of a state dinner may be very different from what is considered \u2018professional\u2019 behavior during a performance by James Brown.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham disagreed with the decision, saying the ruling \u201cessentially gives free rein to members of the press to engage in unprofessional, disruptive conduct at the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Karem\u2019s conduct, including threatening to escalate a verbal confrontation into a physical one to the point that a Secret Service agent intervened, clearly breached well-understood norms of professional conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cThe press secretary must have the ability to deter such unacceptable conduct.\u201d\n\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t guarantee that Mr. Karem\u2019s press pass will be restored permanently. The judge\u2019s order grants temporary relief to the journalist while his lawsuit against the White House is argued.\n\nWhen Ms. Grisham imposed the 30-day suspension last month, she said Mr. Karem had violated commonly understood standards of professionalism.\n\nAt the Rose Garden event, Mr. Karem commented loudly that a group of invited conservative social media personalities were \u201ceager for demonic possession.\u201d Mr. Gorka, a radio host on the Salem network, approached Mr. Karem and called him a \u201cpunk.\u201d\n\nMr. Karem offered to continue their conversation outside, a comment that some considered a challenge to a fight. Mr. Karem later said he only intended for them to move their confrontational discussion to a location other than the Rose Garden.\n\nMs. Grisham said the White House spelled out standards of conduct for journalists in November 2018 after CNN reporter Jim Acosta had his pass revoked temporarily over a microphone-grabbing incident with a White House intern at a presidential press conference.\n\nThe judge said it wasn\u2019t clear that the White House\u2019s advisory about Mr. Acosta\u2019s conduct also applied at other events in addition to press conferences.\n\n\u201cThis [Rose Garden] event was also one where jocular insults had been flying from all directions,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThere is no indication in the record that other offenders were reprimanded, or even told to stop.\u201d\n\nThe judge added, \u201cTaking into account all of the evidence in the present record, the court cannot conclude that Karem\u2019s behavior was clearly proscribed by the Acosta Letter\u2019s standard, or even by any widely understood standard of \u2018professionalism\u2019 or \u2018decorum\u2019 within the context of such an unruly event.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
