REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nThe poll by Sigma Conseil, broadcast on state television, showed Ennahda with 17.5% of votes and the Heart of Tunisia party of detained media mogul Nabil Karoui with 15.6%. No official results are expected on Sunday.\n\nIf confirmed, the result would leave Tunisia with a deeply fractured parliament in which Ennahda would need to join together with numerous rival parties and independents to gain a working majority.\n\nBoth Ennahda and Heart of Tunisia had earlier claimed victory in the election. Both have ruled out working in any coalition that contains the other.\n\nIt was the third free parliamentary election in Tunisia since the 2011 revolution that ended decades of autocratic rule and introduced democracy, with a new constitution agreed in 2014.\n\nHowever, turnout in the election was only 41%, the electoral commission said, with many voters annoyed by years of ineffective coalitions that have been unable to address chronic economic problems.\n\nEnnahda and Heart of Tunisia have both made fighting poverty the central plank of their electoral platforms.\n\nKaroui is one of two candidates who made it through the first round of a presidential election last month to reach a runoff vote to be held next Sunday.\n\nHe was arrested in August on charges of money laundering and tax fraud, which he denies, and has contested the election from a jail cell pending his trial.\n\nAny new government will face the same challenges that have bedevilled its predecessors - high unemployment, inflation and public debt, a powerful union that resists change and foreign lenders who demand it.\n\nHowever, Ennahda\u2019s projected vote share would translate into only about 40 seats, with 109 needed to form a majority. In the last election in 2014, it gained 27.8% of the votes and 69 seats, while the winner, Nidaa Tunis, took 37.6% and 86 seats.\n\nThey later joined together in coalition. Any such coalition building this time will likely prove a far more vexatious and prolonged process, despite the need to urgently address economic problems that remain unsolved eight years after the revolution.\n\nEnnahda now has two months from the election to create a coalition before the president can ask another party to begin negotiations to form a government. If that fails, the election will be held again.\n\nThe failure of repeated coalition governments that grouped the old secular elite plus Ennahda to address the economy, along with declining public services has dismayed many Tunisians.\n\n\u201cAfter the revolution, we were all optimistic and our hopes were high. But hope has been greatly diminished now as a result of the disastrous performance of the rulers and the former parliament,\u201d said Basma Zoghbi, a worker for Tunis municipality.\n\nUNCERTAIN ATMOSPHERE\n\nUnemployment, 15% nationally and 30% in some cities, is higher than it was under the former autocrat, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who died last month in exile in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the president directly controls foreign and defence policy, the largest party in parliament nominates the prime minister, who forms a government that shapes most domestic policy.\n\nAt several polling stations visited by Reuters on Sunday, there seemed to be few younger voters.\n\nOne of them, Imad Salhi, 28, a waiter, was concerned about the direction of Tunisian politics. \u201cI am very afraid that the country will fall into the hands of populists in the next stage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe success of Karoui and Kais Saied, a retired law professor with conservative social views, in the first round of the presidential election has put pressure on the established parties.\n\n\u201cTunisians should be proud for their democracy but the focus should be on economic and social conditions of Tunisians,\u201d Ennahda leader Rached Ghannouchi told Reuters after voting in Tunis.", "description": "An exit poll showed the moderate Islamist Ennahda party narrowly emerging as the largest party in Tunisia's parliamentary election on Sunday, but with only a small proportion of votes, which may make it hard to build a governing coalition.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Angus Mcdowall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437983299&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960D2-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
