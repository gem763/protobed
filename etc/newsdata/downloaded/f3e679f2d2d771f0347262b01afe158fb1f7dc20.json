It could often be an impediment to winding up an SMSF account-based pension.\n\nThat said, winding up an SMSF with an account-based pension and transferring your super to an industry fund is different to winding up an SMSF with a term allocated pension and doing the same.\n\nAccording to John Perri, a technical strategy manager with AMP Wealth Management, it appears from your question that you have a term allocated pension in an SMSF that you are considering transferring to an industry fund term allocated pension.\n\nYou may be a health card holder who is concerned that winding up an SMSF paying a term allocated pension and transferred the super to an industry fund and starting a similar pension may affect a CSHC entitlement.\n\nThe good news, says Perri, is that this transaction will have no impact on any CSHC entitlement. That\u2019s because term allocated pensions are not \"account based pensions\" for the purpose of the health card income test .\n\nOnly account-based pensions are counted for a CSHC entitlement under the September 1, 2015 rule change.\n\nJust as your current term allocated pension is not assessed under the CSHC income test, so any transferred super and new term allocated pension won\u2019t be.\n\nQ: I have a follow-up to a recent question (Smart Investor, August 9) concerning being able to make two separate $25,000 tax-deductible super contributions in one year and claim them against my personal income in that year. From the answer, I understand that if I work for 40 hours over 30 days and have sufficient income against which to claim the contribution deductions, the strategy is possible. I\u2019m 69 and expect to be able to meet these conditions this year thanks to an intensive period of paid work between December 2019 and January 2020 for my GST-registered handyman business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also understand I must make the second contribution in June 2020 and then credit this to my account by July 28, 2020. But will I also need to satisfy the work test in the 2020-21 financial year as I may choose not to do so? Linton.\n\nA: What your question highlights, says Adelaide AMP private client adviser Peter Crump, is a strategy that is not only useful for managing taxation issues on a year-by-year basis but also one that can be implemented in the latter years of employment after 65.\n\nWith regard to your specific question about whether carrying forward a contribution made in June 2020 to the next financial year will require you to work for 40 hours in a 30-day period in the 2020-21 financial year, the answer is no.\n\nAs far as the overall strategy, says SuperConcepts technical manager Graeme Colley, there are important considerations when contemplating a double tax-deductible contribution strategy as it might concern your circumstances. They are:\n\nContributions are tax-deductible in the year in which the contributions are made to your super fund. In this case, the total contribution of $50,000 must be claimed in the 2019-20 financial year.\n\nFor personal super contributions, you need to be careful as the amount claimed as a tax deduction is limited to the amount of your net taxable income for the financial year. For example, if your net taxable income was $40,000 and you wished to claim a tax deduction of $50,000, the amount of the deduction would be limited to no more than $40,000.\n\nAs the total concessional contributions are greater than the concessional contribution cap of $25,000, excess concessional contribution tax will apply unless you implement a reserving strategy. Your fund\u2019s governing rules should state how to set up a reserve account.\n\nMaking two amounts of $25,000, one in June in the financial year, allows a reserving strategy to be used to avoid any excess concessional contributions tax.\n\nThis will require your first contribution to be credited to your SMSF account and the contribution in June to be credited to an unallocated contributions reserve.\n\nThe contribution in the unallocated contributions reserve is required to be credited to your account by July 28, 2020 as required by the superannuation legislation.\n\nIf this strategy is adopted, you will avoid any excess concessional contributions tax but the contribution of $50,000 will be available only in the 2019-20 financial year.\n\nEmail journalist John Wasiliev with your questions at superquestions@afr.com.", "description": "Not everyone in income phase has to be wary of switching super funds for fear of losing the CSHC, writes John Wasiliev, who answers your questions on super.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e1d59ee30a326d3deb10d794f59ea1abe6e59320", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
