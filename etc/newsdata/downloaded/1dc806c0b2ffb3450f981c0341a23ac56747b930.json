His next book, \"A Line in the Sand,\" is due out next year. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nAs America's allies in Europe begin to taste early hints of a recession, President Donald Trump is showing no evidence of changing his stance on tariffs. Just last month, the United States threatened tariffs on $4 billion worth of EU goods, and Trump has continued to threaten tariffs on European auto imports. Meanwhile, Germany's economy declined in the second quarter of 2019, raising fears of a recession in what had been the motor economy of Europe \u2014 and that's before any American tariffs might kick in.\n\nUS allies will need to come to grips with the United States' changing leadership role in world trade. But this isn't the first time the United States has championed protectionism.\n\nAfter its intervention in World War I, the United States embraced an isolationist tilt and enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. With some rates as high as 80% , it was narrowly the second-highest tariff in American industry and slapped tariffs on all countries exporting goods to the United States. Senator Reed Smoot of Iowa and Congressman Willis C. Hawley of Oregon thought they were doing just the right thing by protecting American industry and American jobs. But the results were disastrous. The act has been credited with making the Great Depression even more devastating.\n\nIn many respects, the Smoot-Hawley levies were far more damaging to the US and global economy than any tariffs that had been enacted before. Two years after Smoot-Hawley was enacted, US imports fell 40% while unemployment increased. Nations around the world \u2014 but particularly in the motor economies of Europe \u2014 began throwing up their own protective tariff shields. Canada, for instance, slapped additional tariffs on US eggs, and exports fell from 919,000 dozen in 1929 to 7,900 dozen in 1932.\n\nAs the 1930s wore on, global financial paralysis only intensified. French media reportedly called the tariff a declaration of (economic) war. Economist Percy Wells Bidwell observed in Foreign Affairs magazine in 1932, \"Nothing in recent history has so strikingly emphasized the need for international cooperation in the economic field as the business depression which now for over two years has weighed down upon the world.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "This isn't the first time the United States has embraced protectionist trade practices, writes David A.
