I\u2019ve spent hours flicking through an array of animated backdrops, trying to find the one I thought was coolest, feeling like I was flying through space, or editing the text-related ones to say insightful things like \u201cCALLUM IZ GREAT.\u201d\n\nTruly, friends, a golden era.\n\nThen \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure when exactly \u2014 screensavers stopped being so much of a thing. It could be that I entered puberty, that the point of a screensaver (to, quite literally, save your screen from burning out) wasn\u2019t relevant any more, or my life just lost the last spark of joy \u2014 who knows?\n\nBut maybe those days over. Maybe times have changed. Maybe it\u2019s time to get bang into screensavers again. And that\u2019s definitely going to change because of Reddit user NoahRhino pointing us toward an incredible repository of (mainly) free and awesome macOS screensavers.\n\nThis fake Blue Screen of Death is one of the screensavers that has got me salivating.\n\nThe selection of sick ass macOS screensavers was compiled by Adam Garrett-Harris, known by the username agarrharr on GitHub.\n\nThe macOS screensavers are split into several categories (including old standards like aquariums and clocks, as well as other more experimental types, such as a compilation of developer excuses, and an animation of \u201cevolving fractals).\n\nThis one is called ScreenMazer and it automatically generates, and then solves, mazes. Love it.\n\nInstallation of each of the macOS screensavers is slightly different, but when you click on one from the list you like, you\u2019ll be taken to another page that details how you get them to appear on your screen. The large majority of them are easy enough for the minimally tech literate amongst us to get loaded up onto the computer with ease.\n\nSo, there you have it, a wonderful collection of interesting, exciting, and occasionally weird macOS screensavers. Now excuse me, I\u2019ve got several hours to kill and a childhood to re-live.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Callum Booth", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FmacOS-screensaver-piece.png&signature=e5e43097904af6aa3b8561f1571765ee", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
