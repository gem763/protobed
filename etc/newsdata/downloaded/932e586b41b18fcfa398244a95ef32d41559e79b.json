Meanwhile, a wind-whipped fire destroyed homes near Los Angeles.\n\nMore than 50,000 people were under evacuation orders in the Santa Clarita area north of Los Angeles as hot, dry Santa Ana winds howling at 50 mph drove the flames into neighborhoods. At least six homes were burned. No immediate injuries were reported.\n\nA home burns at a vineyard during the Kincade fire near Geyserville, California on October 24, 2019.

About 2,000 people have been ordered to evacuate.\n\nThe fire burned at least 25 square miles, whipped up by the strong winds that had prompted Pacific Gas & Electric to impose sweeping blackouts affecting a half-million people in Northern and Central California. Power was restored to most people by Thursday evening, PG&E said.\n\nThe power shut-offs were imposed after PG&E electrical equipment was blamed for several blazes in recent years that killed scores of people and burned thousands of homes.\n\nHowever, PG&E said Thursday it didn't de-energize a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville that malfunctioned minutes before the fire erupted. The company reported finding a \"broken jumper\" wire on a transmission tower Wednesday night.\n\nPG&E CEO Bill Johnson said it was too soon to know if the faulty equipment ignited the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition.\n\nIn shutting off the electricity, PG&E cut power to the distribution lines that supply homes, but not to its long-distance transmission lines.\n\nCBS News weather producer David Parkinson said an offshore wind event could spell trouble for northern California starting late Saturday night and all day Sunday.\n\nThe situation there, he said, could be \"an absolute mess. \u2026 We're talking possible 80 or 90 mph gusts, which is why it is absolutely imperative that crews in Sonoma County get a handle on things on Friday.\n\n\" \u2026 This has the potential for record strength. We're more than four standard deviations above a normal wind event, which is well above record territory.\"\n\n\"We do think that it will be the strongest offshore wind event of the season by a large margin, and if models are correct, possibly the strongest offshore winds we've seen in years,\" Pacific Gas & Electric chief meteorologist Scott Strenfel said.\n\nIn Southern California, firefighters on the ground and in the air struggled to protect homes surrounded by trees and brush.\n\nIn some places, they failed. As hot embers flew, subdivision homes and rural ranch properties were damaged or destroyed in the Canyon Country area of Santa Clarita and in nearby Castaic.\n\nAlejandro Corrales tearfully watched her home burn on a ridge in Canyon Country, taking with it her mother's ashes, other belongings and possibly a pen full of pet sheep.\n\n\"I'm literally seeing sticks and fire of what used to be our home,\" she told KCBS-TV.\n\n\"Everything in the house is gone,\" Corrales said. \"The panels on one of the pens where we have some rescued sheep was too hot for my daughter to open, and so she couldn't let them out. ... So I'm probably sure that we lost them, too.\"\n\nSome residents tried to fight the blaze with garden hoses. People rushed to rescue dozens of horses, donkeys, goats, a pig and an emu.\n\nOfficials said a firefighting helicopter was grounded after its windshield was damaged by a collision with a bird.\n\nThe high winds were expected to persist through Friday. Southern California Edison, which shut off electricity to more than 31,000 customers on Thursday, was considering additional power cuts to more than 386,000.\n\nWhile the high winds in Northern California had died down by Friday, they were expected to pick up over the weekend, with gusts of 40 to 60 mph in many places, and PG&E warned it may black out an even larger region.\n\nPG&E chief meteorologist Scott Strenfel said Northern California could be in for the strongest offshore winds in years.", "description": "Record-setting winds could fan flames of numerous blazes this weekend with tens of thousands of people evacuated and more preventive blackouts possible", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/3f6552c1-6041-4399-b381-7abf32bd37ef/thumbnail/1200x630/7c0a074a5605a3a87366dede98bf54b6/fire-house-gettyimages-1177955411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
