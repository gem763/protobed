I would not,\u201d Judge Kemp told The Associated Press, adding she asked if she could hug Guyger. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\nThe judge slammed the foundation\u2019s complaint that she was \u201cproselytizing from the bench,\u201d noting the trial was already over and she stepped away from her podium.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do that from the bench,\u201d she said. \u201cI came down to extend my condolences to the Jean family and to encourage Ms. Guyger because she has a lot of life to live.\u201d\n\nJudge Kemp said she saw \u201cmarked change\u201d in Guyger and didn\u2019t want her to \u201csink into doubt and self-pity\u201d in prison.\n\n\u201cBecause she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence, and I would hope that she could live it purposefully,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
