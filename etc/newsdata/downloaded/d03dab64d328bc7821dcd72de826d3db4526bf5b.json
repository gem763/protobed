Ben Sasse (Jim Bourg/Reuters)\n\nSenator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) released a statement Friday condemning Beto O\u2019Rourke for \u201cextreme intolerance\u201d after O\u2019Rourke advocated revoking tax-exempt status from churches that refuse to perform same-sex marriages.\n\n\u201cThis bigoted nonsense would target a lot of sincere Christians, Jews, and Muslims,\u201d wrote Sasse. \u201cLeaders from both parties have a duty to flatly condemn this attack on very basic American freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis extreme intolerance is un-American,\u201d Sasse went on. \u201cThe whole point of the First Amendment is that\u2026everyone is created with dignity and we don\u2019t use government power to decide which religious beliefs are legitimate and which aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke touted his LGBT rights platform at a CNN town hall event on Thursday, telling the crowd he supported removing tax-exempt status from churches, religious schools, and charities if they are against same-sex marriages.\n\n\u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone \u2026 that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told the audience.\n\nO\u2019Rourke previously drew condemnation from conservatives after pledging at the third Democratic primary debate to confiscate semi-automatic rifles from their legal owners. O\u2019Rourke is currently polling nationally at just below two percent of the Democratic vote.\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren released her own LGBT rights platform in which she promises to provide government funding for gender transition surgeries for inmates. In addition, she pledged to incarcerate transgender inmates with prisoners of the opposite biological sex, meaning that a transgender man would be placed in a women\u2019s prison.", "description": "Senator Ben Sasse condemned Beto O'Rourke after he advocated revoking tax-exempt status from churches that refuse to perform same-sex marriages.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
