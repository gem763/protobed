Still, he was rather dominant for much of his seven innings, striking out 12 batters and finishing off each one with an off-speed pitch.\n\nThe Cardinals, quite simply, can\u2019t hit in this NLCS: They have a grand total of two runs and 11 hits through three games. Washington\u2019s three starters have a combined ERA - no calculator necessary for this one - of 0.00.\n\nNow it\u2019s Patrick Corbin\u2019s chance to see if he can match his rotation-mates. The $140 million lefty will start for the Nationals in Game 4 on Tuesday night, when they can close out a sweep at home. Rookie right-hander Dakota Hudson will be on the mound for the Cardinals.\n\nNBA\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - LeBron James believes Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \u201cwas either misinformed or not really educated on the situation\u201d and the potential consequences of his actions when he tweeted in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests.\n\nIn his first public comments since the Los Angeles Lakers returned home from a strange weeklong tour of China immediately after Morey\u2019s incendiary tweet, James\u2019 lengthy answer to a question about whether Morey should be punished for the tweet didn\u2019t specifically address the merits of Morey\u2019s support of Hong Kong sovereignty.\n\nThe Lakers superstar instead characterized the international incident caused by Morey\u2019s tweet as a cautionary tale about the power of social media.\n\n\u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech,\u201d James said. \u201cBut at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself. I don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.\u201d\n\nAUTO RACING\n\nTALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) - Ryan Blaney beat Ryan Newman in a photo finish Monday at Talladega Superspeedway to earn a spot in the third round of NASCAR\u2019s playoffs.\n\nBlaney\u2019s first win of the season advanced him to the round of eight along with Kyle Larson. The field will be trimmed from 12 to eight next weekend at Kansas, and Blaney came to Talladega needing a big rally to remain in title contention.\n\nBlaney was the leader on a restart with two laps remaining and had a strong push from fellow Ford drivers until Newman charged to the lead in the top line. Blaney stayed in the bottom lane. As an accident broke out further in the pack, he pulled alongside Newman and beat him by inches to the finish line.\n\nIt was the sixth-closest finish in the history of Talladega, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this weekend.\n\nThe race began Sunday but was stopped after the first stage for rain and resumed Monday.\n\nTENNIS\n\nTOKYO (AP) - Roger Federer says he plans to play at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe Swiss great, a four-time Olympian, says \u201cat the end of the day my heart decided I would love to play at the Olympic Games again.\u201d\n\nFederer made the announcement in Tokyo during at an exhibition event for his Japanese uniform supplier.\n\nFederer will turn 39 shortly after the Olympic tournament. He had previously planned his schedule up to Wimbledon, which ends two weeks before the Tokyo Games.\n\nHe will need a wild-card exemption because he has not played Davis Cup matches to be eligible.\n\nFederer won doubles gold for Switzerland with Stan Wawrinka at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and silver in singles at the 2012 London Games at Wimbledon.\n\nHe missed the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics with an injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "MLB", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
