Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed global warming for Hurricane Dorian and also implied Tuesday night that the storm was classist and racist.\n\nThe New York Democrat retweeted a video of the devastation the storm left behind in the Bahamas, where more than 10,000 homes were destroyed and five people killed.\n\n\u201cThis is what climate change looks like: it hits vulnerable communities first,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote.\n\nThis is what climate change looks like: it hits vulnerable communities first.\n\n\n\nI can already hear climate deniers screeching: \u201cIt\u2019s always been like this! You\u2019re dim,\u201d etc.\n\n\n\nNo. This is about science & leadership. We either decarbonize&cut emissions, or we don\u2019t & let people die. https://t.co/paUHKAp03e \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 3, 2019\n\nIt was unclear how Dorian singled out \u201cvulnerable communities\u201d except in the sense that the Bahamas, like richer and whiter Florida, is geographically vulnerable to hurricanes. All of the Bahamas \u2014 rich and poor alike \u2014 was heavily damaged by the most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded upon landfall.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez went on to acknowledge that people would criticize her for blaming the fourth named storm of the season \u2014 a below-average number by September \u2014 on global warming but said it didn\u2019t matter because opposition to her Green New Deal will kill people.\n\n\u201cI can already hear climate deniers screeching: \u2018It\u2019s always been like this! You\u2019re dim,\u2019 etc. No. This is about science & leadership. We either decarbonize&cut emissions, or we don\u2019t & let people die,\u201d she claimed.\n\nThe attacks of \u201cdim\u201d came, focusing on a point scientists constantly make \u2014 that one cannot attribute specific events such as hurricanes or tornadoes (\u201cweather\u201d) to systemic \u201cclimate\u201d change.\n\n\u201cWhere are all the journalists who mock politicians for confusing weather and climate now? This is no better than a politician like Trump declaring that global warming is fake because of a cold streak, but AOC gets a pass because she has the right views,\u201d lamented Twitter user \u201cAG Conservative.\u201d\n\nAdded Baylor Cook, the Content Director for the Trump Students Twitter account: \u201cBREAKING: Hurricane hits coast first like it has for all of human history. Stop using a tragic event to push your climate change extremism. Your loud, ignorant assertions makes it hard to have an *actual* conversation on how to realistically address climate change.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has blamed global warming for a specific and very precedented piece of weather.\n\nIn May, she blamed a tornado warning in Washington, D.C., on how \u201cthe climate crisis is real y\u2019all \u2026 casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
