As one of only four low-lying coral atoll nations in the world, the failure of the international community to adequately respond to the global climate crisis of its own making holds particularly grave consequences,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe official declaration of the \"National Climate Crisis\" cites the findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that warned of the extreme climate effects expected to impact low-lying atoll nations.\n\nThe report predicted that a global average temperature rise between 1 and 3 degrees Celsius could result in an average sea level rise between 1 and 4 feet by 2100.\n\nSuch significant water rising could have grave impacts on the Marshall Islands, an archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean. At that rate, sea level rise and erosion are expected to make the islands nearly uninhabitable by 2050. The country's 29 atolls average 6.5 feet above sea level. Nearly 75,000 people live there.\n\nThe resolution says it's a decision by the government to \"unite fully and equivocally behind the science\" and recognize calls by the country's youth and their \"right to a climate safe future.\" It adds that the declaration puts climate concerns at the forefront of the nation's mind.\n\n\"The declaration will direct the current and future governments of the Marshall Islands to ensure the fight against climate change remains the country's top priority,\" it says.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNOT A BRIGHT IDEA, DEMS SAY: Senate Democrats are urging Energy Secretary Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard PerryTrump says Gowdy can't join his legal team 'for a couple months' Overnight Energy: Dems subpoena Perry in impeachment inquiry | EPA to overhaul rules on lead contamination tests | Commerce staff wrote statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump Making sense of the key players in the Trump-Ukraine controversy MORE not to follow through with a rule that eliminates efficiency standards for about half the bulbs on the market.\n\nThe regulation, finalized by the Department of Energy (DOE) in September, leaves in place rules for standard pear-shaped bulbs, while removing such requirements for recessed lighting, chandeliers and other shapes of bulbs.\n\n\"These rollbacks are indefensible, both in terms of their costs to consumers and their contravention of Congressional intent,\" they wrote in a letter spearheaded by Sens.

Consumers are clearly taking advantage of the energy savings provided by LEDs.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK:\n\nSenate Democrats will force a vote to repeal the Trump administration's new power plant pollution rule.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee will review technology to address lead removal.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing on aquaculture.\n\nLater that day, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will hold a hearing on how disease impacts wildlife management.\n\nOn Thursday, the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis will hold a hearing on green buildings.\n\nAlso that day, House Natural Resources will review pathways to achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nAlso Thursday, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will hold a hearing on reducing emissions.\n\nAnd the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on petroleum reserves.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\n-Authorities order 100,000 evacuated in California wildfire, The Associated Press reports.\n\n-Outages include Southern California as fires spread, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\n-Fishermen live in stain of Venezuela's broken oil industry, the Associated Press reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Friday...\n\n-Democrats urge Rick Perry not to roll back lightbulb efficiency rules\n\n-Jane Fonda arrested during climate change protest outside Capitol\n\n-Marshall Islands declares national climate crisis\n\n-Committee pushes National Park Service to privatize campgrounds\n\n-Japan bracing for super typhoon during Rugby World Cup, Grand Prix\n\n-Anne Hathaway defends Greta Thunberg from 'textbook misogyny'", "description": "IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A-OK WITH KOA: A committee that reports to the National Park Service (NPS) is recommending privatizing campgrounds within national parks, limiting benefits for senior visitors and allowing food trucks as a way", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grandtetonnationalpark_08082019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
