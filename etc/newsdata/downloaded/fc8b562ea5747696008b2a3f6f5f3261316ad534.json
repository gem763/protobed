From the first whistle to the last, it\u2019s going to be a bruising bombardment on the minds and bodies of Warren Gatland\u2019s men. If the Welsh give an inch, they will be duly punished. There can be no lulls in concentration or intensity. Not against South Africa.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Wales deserve their semi-final berth, having been taken to the very edge by Jacques Brunel\u2019s side last weekend, they\u2019ve shown in Japan what they\u2019re capable of.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It was gutsy, lung-bursting, utterly absorbing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images 2/31 <b>Wales:</b> Liam Williams - 6 France did an excellent job of kicking away from him to limit his involvement, with few chances to show what he can do. Getty Images 3/31 George North - 6 Excellent tackle stopped Fickou early on, but was intercepted by Huget when Wales had a three-man overlap as they were desperately searching for the try. Didn\u2019t have a great game by all accounts, but then not many in red did. AFP via Getty Images 4/31 Owen Watkin - 5 Had big shoes to fill in Jonathan Davies\u2019s last-minute absence, but didn\u2019t show his best and showed what Wales lose without Davies in the side. Getty Images 5/31 Hadleigh Parkes - 5 Made no impact whatsoever with ball in hand and the fact that he was thumped backwards by Huget sums up the Welsh performance. Getty Images 6/31 Josh Adams - 6 Tried to come off his wing in an effort to get involved in the game but could not find anything come his way as he was starved of ball. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/31 Dan Biggar - 6 100 per cent record from the tee and his kicking from hand was average, if not good, but will need to work out how to get his back line firing again. At least he showed o signs of the recent concussions he\u2019s suffered. AFP via Getty Images 8/31 Gareth Davies - 5 Didn\u2019t look his normal lively self as France contained him around the fringe, and he made no impact off the defensive line in attempting his trademark interceptions. REUTERS 9/31 Wyn Jones - 5 Quiet in attack, quiet in defence, Just quiet, really. AP 10/31 Ken Owens - 6 Wales\u2019s most prominent defender as he led the tackling charts. Breathed a huge sigh of relief when his intercepted 25-metre pass was ruled inconsequential due to a knock-on advantage, as Guirado galloped over for what he thought was France\u2019s fourth try. REUTERS 11/31 Tomas Francis - 5 Conceded a penalty early on and struggled in the scrum, though contributed well in defence. REUTERS 12/31 Jake Ball - 6 Made one impactful tackle that sent the French into reverse, but his place is coming under threat from the returning Adam Beard. AFP via Getty Images 13/31 Alun Wyn Jones - 6 Got little change out of the French defence with the ball in hand, but his defensive effort was at the highest degree that we\u2019ve come to expect. REUTERS 14/31 Aaron Wainwright - 7 Sprung into life to snap up the loose ball and gallop away for his try that kicked Wales into life with a much-needed score to stem the flow. Was on the receiving end of Vahaamahina\u2019s disgraceful elbow in the second half, but on the whole it was another good showing from the youngster. AFP via Getty Images 15/31 Justin Tipuric - 6 Played a key role in the match-winning try by catching the rip and taking it to the line. Spent a lot of time out wide, which didn\u2019t always help his side. Getty Images 16/31 Josh Navidi - 5 Suffered a hamstring injury in the first half that forced him off. Replacement Ross Moriarty joined him minutes later when he was sent to the sin-bin, though he redeemed himself with the match-winning try. Getty Images 17/31 <b>France:</b> Maxime Medard - 7 Kicked smartly until his rash decision to attempt a drop-goal from halfway saw him grubber the ball instead. Part of a French back line that dazzled throughout the first half as he caused Wales all sorts of problems with his offloading in the tackle. AFP via Getty Images 18/31 Damian Penaud - 7 On another day he could have scored a hat-trick, but he did set up a beauty for Vakatawa as he split Biggar and Owens before offloading to the centre. He was guilty of dropping one with the line in front of him in the second half. AFP via Getty Images 19/31 Virimi Vakatawa - 8 Possibly his best performance in a France shirt. He caused all sorts of problems for the Welsh defence, scoring a try himself and knocking Biggar into next week with one emphatic charge. AFP via Getty Images 20/31 Gael Fickou - 8 Made a superb start to the match as he ran riot with Ntamack, cutting through the gaps left in the Welsh line. Could have scored early on had it now been for North\u2019s excellent tackle. EPA 21/31 Yoann Huget - 6 Made a thumping tackle on Parkes and intercepted North crucially when Wales had a three-man overlap, but otherwise he was strangely quiet. AFP via Getty Images 22/31 Romain Ntamack - 8 Ran the show throughout the first half with a stunning display of running rugby. Brought his outside backs into play beautifully that Wales simply could not contend with. Played a key role in Ollivon\u2019s try that will go down as one of the best at the tournament. AFP via Getty Images 23/31 Antoine Dupont - 7 Mixed up his play well with a blend of runs and kicks. Was on hand to take an offload from Ntamack and feed Ollivon to score the second try. AFP via Getty Images 24/31 Jefferson Poirot - 7 Won a penalty against Francis early on and made a strong contribution defensively. You could visibly see the role he\u2019s taken on within this team as he tried to lead the pack. PA 25/31 Guilhem Guirado - 6 Lost possession of the ball in contact with Ball that lead to Wainwright\u2019s breakaway try. Reliable in the lineout but disappointed slightly with his carrying. Decision to replace him straight after the red card was a puzzling one. AFP via Getty Images 26/31 Rabah Slimani - 7 Stood strong in the scrum, but needed to do more with the ball and missed two tackles. Getty Images 27/31 Bernard le Roux - 6 In the unfamiliar position of lock that stemmed his talents around the ruck. REUTERS 28/31 Sebastien Vahaamahina - 3 Got the ball rolling with the opening try of the game, only to go from hero to villain with a stupid deliberate elbow to the head of Wainwright that earned him a straight red card and swung the game in Wales\u2019s favour. AFP via Getty Images 29/31 Wenceslas Lauret - 6 Ran good support lines on occasion but could have done more defensively when the going got tough. AFP via Getty Images 30/31 Charles Ollivon - 7 On the shoulder of Dupont to inherit the ball and finish from range for the second try, and nearly found himself with another chance soon after in chasing a loose ball. A good showing. AFP via Getty Images 31/31 Gregory Alldritt - 7 Stood out with Ollivon in the back-row as he made important runs for his side.

AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut Wales cannot afford to get sucked into a similar arm wrestle against the South Africans, whose fearsome physicality was put to devastating use against the Japanese in a war of attrition that eventually left the hosts battered and broken.\n\nAnd Gatland will know that Sunday\u2019s opponents make for a very different entity to the Wallabies. There will be none of the inconsistency or errors that saw Australia gift multiple points to the Welsh in their encounter last month.\n\nSouth Africa are a far more settled, streamlined side. In Handre Pollard they have a unwavering source of composure and poise \u2013 a stark contrast to the fly-half troubles of the Aussies. Pollard\u2019s boot played a crucial role in grinding down Japan last weekend, taking him to 126 career RWC points and into the all-time top 10 in the competition. Wales\u2019 discipline must be on point to avoid handing the Springbok a similar platform with which to assert himself.\n\nThen there\u2019s Faf de Klerk, one of the best 9s on the planet whose ability to disrupt attacks at their source has unsettled many teams at this World Cup. It helps that Wales have their own superstar at scrum-half. But Gareth Davies cannot expect the same free ride he was afforded by the Wallabies. For all his intelligent reading of the game, the likelihood of him plucking an interception off Pollard or De Klerk seems slim at best.\n\nThen there\u2019s the attacking threat of the Springboks out on the wings \u2013 an area of the game where the Welsh were found wanting against Fiji and France. Indeed, Wales will have their hands full in Makazole Mapimpi under wraps, the latter of whom has scored 13 tries in 12 test appearances. However, some consolation can be taken from the fact Cheslin Kolbe won\u2019t feature on Sunday after being ruled out with injury.\n\n\u201cIt is brilliant to see guys like Cheslin and Makazole doing well,\u201d said Bryan Habana this week. \u201cNow all of a sudden (there are) these guys that are exciting, that are scintillating, that have dazzling feet, who are incredibly quick and nippy and can cause absolute havoc for defences.\n\n\u201cGoing forward it is not about what size of rugby player you are, it is actually what goods you can produce on the field.\u201d\n\nStill, for all South Africa\u2019s qualities \u2013 make no doubt, they present the most difficult challenge yet for Wales \u2013 Gatland has plenty of talent to draw upon for Sunday\u2019s clash, assuming the disjointed and underwhelming performance seen in Oita isn\u2019t repeated.\n\nGareth Davies\u2019 sniping and kicking will keep the Springboks on their toes, while the return of Jonathan Davies brings a sharp edge to Wales\u2019 backline \u2013 on both the front and back foot. And if Justin Tipuric and Aaron Wainwright, who was named man of the match against France, can continue to impose themselves in and around the breakdown, as they\u2019ve done for much of the tournament in Japan, then the South Africans may find themselves struggling to deliver the quick service needed to unleash their dangerous wingers.\n\nSouth Africa have also identified the Welsh kicking game as a crucial battlefront for the encounter in Yokohama. \u201cWe are expecting a tough battle, especially with their kicking game,\u201d backs coach Mzwandile Stick said this week. \u201cThey have got a lot of guys who have been around and they like to play for territory. They suffocate teams and do not allow them to come into their half.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to come up with a plan to get into their half.\u201d Should the Springboks get their tactics wrong, they\u2019ll have the speed and precision of George North, Josh Adams and Liam Williams to contend with.\n\nAfter seeing their campaign brought to an end by South Africa four years ago in England, Wales now have the chance to make amends and, in the process, reach the final of the tournament for the first time in their history. The recent encounters between the two teams suggests Gatland\u2019s men may have the edge \u2013 they have won the last four matches \u2013 but that will ultimately count for little in the unique, suffocating conditions of a World Cup semi-final.\n\nBut the margins, as ever, are likely to be small. \u201cThe games against them tend to come down to one score and that is what is exciting this weekend: you are going into a game and you do not know who is going to win,\u201d Edwards added this week.\n\n\u201cA World Cup semi-final is where you want to be and while our last three matches have not gone smoothly, they were character building. We have not lost a competitive game since February 2018. Are we a better team than 2011 when we reached the semi-final? We will find out on Sunday.\u201d", "description": "After a quarter-final that was decided by the swing of an elbow, Wales\u00a0will know they cannot rely on such turns of\u00a0fortune in Sunday\u2019s showdown with South Africa.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/05/wales-south-africa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
