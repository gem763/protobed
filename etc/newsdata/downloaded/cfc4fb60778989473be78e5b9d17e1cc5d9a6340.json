A series of injuries had robbed him of his chance at Bournemouth and any chance of regular football appeared to be gone.\n\nAfter playing just 140 minutes of Premier League football at the start of 2018/19, Mings was allowed to leave on loan to Aston Villa. Things began to fall into place in the Midlands though and, with a series of dominant performances, he led them back to the top flight.\n\nMings now finds himself as one of the country's most in-form defenders and is set to win his first senior England cap against Bulgaria on Monday night. It will be the latest step on his remarkable journey back from the wilderness.\n\nTyrone Mings is expected to make his senior England debut against Bulgaria on Monday night\n\nMings is expected to play alongside Harry Maguire during the Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia\n\nAfter being released by Southampton as a teenager, where he had played since the age of eight, Mings enrolled on a two-year football scholarship at Millfield School and worked his way up from Yate Town and Chippenham.\n\nHe caught the eye of then Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy during his trial at Portman Road and signed professional terms in 2012. At just 21 he was considered to be one of the hottest properties in English football after his performances for Ipswich put him on the radar of Premier League clubs.\n\nArsenal were keeping tabs too but their interest failed to turn into a serious bid and it was Bournemouth who got a deal done. The national set-up was also monitoring his progress and the FA sent scouts specifically to watch him.\n\nThe 26-year-old moved to the south coast with enormous promise. He joined from Ipswich for around \u00a310million, becoming the club's record signing, but never got close to realising his potential.\n\nMings was scouted by England and the FA when he was a highly-talented youngster at Ipswich\n\nHe won a move to Premier League Bournemouth but suffered an awful knee injury on his debut\n\nDisaster struck just six minutes into his Bournemouth debut when Mings suffered a knee ligament injury that left him on the sidelines for over a year. Things got so bad during that period that Mings admits he 'didn\u2019t want to do anything to get my knee better and didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone'.\n\nAfter missing 46 matches, Mings fully recovered early on during the 2016/17 campaign but spent huge amounts of time on the bench as he struggled to force his way into Eddie Howe's plans.\n\nWhen he finally won a place in the team Mings almost immediately dropped back down the pecking order after picking up a five-match ban for his role in an incident with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Old Trafford.\n\nIt was ruled that Mings deliberately landed with his studs on the head of the Manchester United striker before Ibrahimovic subsequently elbowed him and was also given a three-match ban.\n\nMings didn't play for the rest of the season before he suffered another devastating setback. After spending over a year out with his knee injury, Mings was then consigned to the treatment table again with a back issue and that proved to be the final straw.\n\nWhen he was fit again, Mings was banned for five matches for stamping on Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nThe unlucky star then suffered a back injury that kept him out for most of the 2017/18 season\n\nHe missed 35 games in 2017/18 and was barely afforded an opportunity the following season before Bournemouth accepted a loan offer from Aston Villa in January. It often takes a step back to move forward and Championship football proved to be Mings' saviour.\n\nFor the first time since he left Ipswich Mings managed to put together a run of appearances as Villa propelled themselves up the Championship table under Dean Smith.\n\nThere was more controversy though when Reading striker Nelson Oliveira was left with blood pouring down his face from a nasty forehead gash after Mings stamped on him.\n\nMings was making his Villa debut when he appeared to accidentally stand on the Portuguese forward while he was off balance as he chased back. The defender immediately apologised on social media and avoided any punishment though.\n\nHe was a standout performer for Villa as they went on a 10-match winning run that helped them secure a top-six finish. Mings played all but four minutes of the play-off matches as they edged Derby 2-1 in the final at Wembley to return to the Premier League.\n\nMings was loaned to Villa, helped them win promotion and signed permanently for \u00a326.5m\n\nHis impressive Premier League form has seen him win a place in the last two England squads\n\nMings then made the Midlands his permanent home by completing a \u00a326.5m switch in the summer. The step up in quality has not fazed him either. He has impressed in the first eight games of the season and earned a call-up to the senior England squad last month.\n\nGareth Southgate opted not to use him against Bulgaria and Kosovo in September and left him on the bench in Prague on Friday night. But now he looks set to start against the Bulgarians and has the chance to nail down a regular place.\n\nEngland's defensive woes against Kosovo and the Czech Republic have forced Southgate to assess his options. Harry Maguire continues to struggle for form after completing an \u00a380m move to Manchester United in the summer while Michael Keane, his partner in Prague, is also under performing for club and country.\n\nJoe Gomez is not playing regularly for Liverpool while Manchester City's John Stones is out injured and will be unavailable until the end of the month. Everything is falling into place for Mings to become a serious threat to the established order.\n\nFirst though he must come through his debut unscathed and Monday night's clash in Sofia will cap off Mings' remarkable turnaround from his injury nightmare to a senior England international.", "description": "Mings is one of the country's most in-form defenders and is set to win his first senior England cap against Bulgaria on Monday night.
