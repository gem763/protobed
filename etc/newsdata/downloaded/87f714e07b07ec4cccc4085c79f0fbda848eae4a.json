About 300,000 of them were new donors and the average contribution was $26.\n\nWarren, who this month moved into a statistical tie with Biden, raised almost $10 million more than the former vice president, who announced his campaign had collected $15.2 million in the third quarter. Sanders, who\u2019s competing with Warren for the progressive vote, raised $25.3 million.\n\nWarren\u2019s figure puts her in second place behind Sanders and ahead of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $19.1 million for the third quarter. The senator from Massachusetts, who\u2019s sworn off big-dollar donors, has $25.7 million cash in hand, the campaign said.\n\n\u201cThis means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position,\u201d Lau said. \u201cElizabeth didn\u2019t sell her time to wealthy donors, over the phone or in person at closed-door fundraisers.\u201d\n\nBiden holds several high-dollar fundraisers in wealthy enclaves each week.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee combined for $125 million in the same period.\n\n\u201cIf you think it\u2019s going to be all about scooping up a bunch of money from rich people, and then, buying a bunch of TV ads, and that\u2019s how it is someone\u2019s gonna win, then yeah it looks like Trump\u2019s doing a lot here and the Republicans,\u201d Warren said in San Diego Thursday. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s how democracy works anymore and I sure don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work in 2020.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou in Washington at megkolfopoul@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Steve Geimann\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, placing her far ahead of Joe Biden and only a bit behind her progressive rival Bernie Sanders.More than 500,000 people made about 940,000 donations from July to September, according to an email from Warren\u2019s campaign manager,", "authors": ["Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TaDK9tg7zs_UFgBl0C7coA--~B/aD0xMjIyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/cae4f264c1ed22079a37ed27dcbea9a0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
