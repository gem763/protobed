Fitch Assigns Expected Ratings to TORRENS Series 2019-2 Trust; Outlook Stable\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10098728 https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10098729 Fitch Ratings-Sydney-October 28: Fitch Ratings has assigned expected ratings to TORRENS Series 2019-2 Trust's mortgage-backed pass-through floating-rate bonds. The issuance consists of notes backed by a pool of first-ranking Australian residential full-documentation mortgage loans originated by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited (BEN, A-/Stable/F2). The notes will be issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as trustee of TORRENS Series 2019-2 Trust, which is a separate and distinct trust created under a master trust deed. The total collateral pool totalled AUD500 million and consisted of 2,195 obligors with a weighted-average (WA) Fitch-indexed current loan/value ratio (LVR) of 57.6% as at the 30 September 2019 cut-off date.

Fitch undertook an onsite operational review and found that the operations of the servicer were comparable with market standards and that there were no material changes that may affect BEN's ongoing ability to undertake administration and collection activities. BEN's collection timelines, policies and procedures are in line with those of other conforming lenders in Australia. Asset Analysis: The 'AAAsf' WA foreclosure frequency of 8.3% is driven by the WA unindexed LVR of 59.4% and, under Fitch's methodology, investment loans of 16.0%. The 'AAAsf' lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) dependent WA recovery rate of 68.0% is driven by the portfolio's WA indexed scheduled LVR of 60.5%, 16.8% of the pool benefiting from LMI and the portfolio 'AAAsf' WA market value decline of 54.6%. Liability Analysis: The class A and AB notes benefit from credit enhancement of 8.0% and 3.7%, respectively. Structural features include a liquidity facility sized at 0.85% of the asset balance with a floor of AUD425,000. The class A and AB notes can withstand all relevant Fitch 'AAAsf' stresses applied in our cash-flow analysis. Macroeconomic Factors: Fitch expects stable mortgage performance supported by sustained economic growth in Australia and specifically, Victoria. Fitch forecasts strengthening GDP growth of 2.3% for 2020, with stable labour markets and low interest rates supporting the Outlook on the rated notes. The pool is concentrated in Victoria, reflecting BEN's history and operational focus in the region. The state government forecasts gross state product growth of 2.8% over the financial year ending June 2020. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased credit enhancement may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Fitch applies recovery rate stress to the pre-LMI recovery rate to isolate the effect of a change in recovery proceeds at the borrower level. Expected impact on note ratings of increased defaults: Notes: A / AB Expected Rating: AAAsf / AAAsf Increase defaults by 15%: AAAsf / AA+sf Increase defaults by 30%: AAAsf / AA+sf Expected impact on note ratings of decreased recoveries: Notes: A / AB Expected Rating: AAAsf / AAAsf Reduce recoveries by 15%: AAAsf / AAsf Reduce recoveries by 30%: AAAsf / AA-sf Expected impact on note ratings of multiple factors: Notes: A / AB Expected Rating: AAAsf / AAAsf Increase defaults by 15% and reduce recoveries by 15%: AAAsf / AAsf Increase defaults by 30% and reduce recoveries by 30%: AAAsf / Asf The transaction structure supports LMI-independent ratings for the class A notes. LMI is not required to support the rating due to the level of credit support provided by the lower notes. The class AB notes can withstand a one-notch downgrade of the LMI providers' ratings. Key rating drivers and expected rating sensitivities are further discussed in the corresponding presale report entitled \"TORRENS Series 2019-2 Trust\", published today. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was made available for this transaction. As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of BEN's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: Loan-by-loan data provided by BEN as at 30 September 2019 Transaction documentation provided by King Wood Mallesons, the issuer's counsel. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by clicking the link to the Appendix. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions'.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
