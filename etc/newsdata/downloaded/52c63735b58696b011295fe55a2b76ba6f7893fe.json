Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been promoting Medicare For All nonstop on the campaign trail, but typical of most Democratic proposals, he made clear on Tuesday that he has no idea how to pay for it.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC\u2019s John Harwood, the Democratic presidential candidate was pressed to explain how he\u2019d finance the entire proposal.\n\nAfter targeting the ultra-wealthy, Sanders then said he didn\u2019t feel the need to come up with a detailed plan on how it would be paid for, noting that his goal right now was making Americans understand they\u2019re paying more for healthcare than people in other countries do.\n\nJohn Harwood: One of the constraints has been fiscal. Senator Warren is producing plans to pay for Medicare for All. You\u2019ve identified revenue sources for about half of it. Do you think it\u2019s important to identify revenue sources for the other half? Or do you believe, as those who subscribe to modern monetary theory believe, that we\u2019ve been a little bit too constrained by concerns about the deficit? Bernie Sanders: We\u2019re trying to pay for the damn thing. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it is my view that the wealthiest people in this country, the top 1/10th of 1% should be paying substantially more than they\u2019re paying right now. You have an insane situation [\u2026] John Harwood: But you still have more revenue to go to make it fully paid for, yes? Bernie Sanders: The fight right now is to get the American people to understand that we\u2019re spending twice as much per capita, that of course, we can pay for it. We\u2019re paying it now in a very reactionary, regressive way. I want to pay for it in a progressive way. You\u2019re asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of how every American \u2014 how much you\u2019re going to pay more in taxes, how much I\u2019m going to pay. I don\u2019t think I have to do that right now.\n\nThe reason Sanders and Warren have been dodging the question of financing is because there's no way to avoid the fact that taxes on middle-class Americans would go up.\n\n\u201cThere is simply not enough available revenue from high earners and businesses to cover the full cost of eliminating premiums, ending all cost-sharing, and expanding coverage to all Americans and for (virtually) all health services,\u201d states a report from the Committee for A Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nAccording to the liberal Urban Institute, the projected price tag for the plan is $34 trillion in its first 10 years, which is \"more than the federal government\u2019s total cost over the coming decade for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid combined, according to the most recent Congressional Budget Office projections,\" The Atlantic reports.\n\nNo wonder Sanders doesn't want to get into details.", "description": ".10/30/2019 8:31:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/af1ba20f-e0fc-4eb4-b782-42444ce0793c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
