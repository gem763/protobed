It\u2019s good for Delta too, and consistent with its global strategy, bringing the big U.S. carrier more scale throughout North and South America.\n\n\u201cThis transformative partnership with Latam will bring together our leading global brands, enabling us to provide the very best service and reliability for travelers to, from and throughout the Americas,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in the company\u2019s news release. On a combined basis, the two airlines will hold leading market share in five of the top six Latin American markets.\n\nLatam stock (ticker: LTM) was up 31% in recent trading to $11.83. Delta (DAL) shares edged higher. That reaction makes sense. Latam is a $4 billion air carrier and Delta is valued at more than $38 billion. What\u2019s more, Delta will pay $1.9 billion for 20% of Latam, valuing the company at $16 per share. The LTM depository receipts closed Thursday at $9.01. Delta will also directly invest $350 million in Latam and join its board of directors.\n\nIn reaction to the news, J.P. Morgan Latin American transportation analyst Fernando Abdalla upgraded shares of Latam from the equivalent of Sell to Hold. \u201cWe become more constructive on the case post the unexpected announcement of a partnership with Delta,\u201d wrote Abdalla in a Friday research report. \u201cDelta can positively influence Latam like it did with [ GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes ].\u201d\n\nDelta has a 9% stake in GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL), a Brazilian airline.\n\nJamie Baker, the U.S. airline analyst at J.P. Morgan, says exerting influence over smaller carriers has been a cornerstone of Delta\u2019s global strategy. He believes, like Abdalla, Delta\u2019s involvement in Latam will yield \u201csignificant benefits\u201d for the Latin American carrier.\n\nThe announcement will supercharge the stock performance of Latam. Its shares were down 4% year to date as of Thursday\u2019s closing price. Delta, on the other hand, has had a good year, returning more than 20%, better than the 17% gain of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same span.\n\nBaker rates shares of Delta the equivalent of a Buy with a $78 price target. More than 75% of analysts covering the company rate shares buy. The average buy rating ratio for stock in the Dow, for comparison, is about 55%.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Latam Airlines stock is soaring after Delta announced it would pay $1.9 billion for a 20% stake in South America\u2019s biggest airline.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111618/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
