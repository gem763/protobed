Chief Executive Fred Smith wakes up worrying about competition with Amazon.com Inc.\n\nWell, duh, you say?\n\nYes, if not for the fact that Smith called the notion of Amazon.com AMZN, -0.28% being a competitor \u201cfantastical\u201d just nine short months ago. Concerns about Amazon competition were part of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and he doubted the e-commerce giant would ever be a \u201cpeer competitor,\u201d Smith said in December.\n\nThat tune changed this week:\n\n\u2018We basically compete in an ecosphere that\u2019s got five entities in it. There\u2019s UPS, there\u2019s DHL, there\u2019s the U.S. Postal Service, and now increasingly, there\u2019s Amazon. That\u2019s who we wake up every day trying to think about how we compete against and give the best services to our sales force.\u2019 FedEx CEO Fred Smith\n\nThat was Smith\u2019s response to a question by Barclays Capital analyst Brandon Oglenski, according to a transcript of the late Tuesday post-results call provided by FactSet.\n\nRelated: FedEx stock plunges as outlook prompts four analyst downgrades\n\nOglenski asked what Smith would tell investors about FedEx\u2019s FDX, -12.92% \u201cprocess for looking at things that maybe didn\u2019t pan out quite as well as you thought?\u201d\n\nBesides acknowledging Amazon as a rival, Smith also directed a fair amount of snark toward Oglenski and other analysts that have doubted certain aspects of FedEx\u2019s trajectory.\n\nSmith called FedEx Express \u201cvery profitable\u201d in the U.S. despite some doubts about that in the analyst community.\n\n\u201cFedEx will unquestionably be the low-cost producer in the domestic Express business because of the fleet modernization. And that includes any new entrants into the business,\u201d he said, right before naming the \u201cecosphere\u201d of competitors.\n\n\u201cSo the reason I\u2019m going on about this, I\u2019m not quite sure how this mantra got started that we\u2019re hardheaded or we\u2019re not willing to look, we\u2019ll look at anything, but what we can\u2019t do is to change the reality of the math,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t make the competition go away. I wish they would, you know, just leave the field. They\u2019re very good operators.\u201d\n\nSmith, one of the most vocal U.S. executives in his opposition to recent trade policies, reiterated some of that criticism on the call.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not just the US, I think China\u2019s also pursuing bad trade policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re taking a system over the last 70 years that\u2019s drawn more people out of poverty than in the entire previous history of the world and essentially putting it all at risk.\u201d\n\nFedEx in August ended its contract to deliver Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s ground packages, and in June ended its FedEx Express domestic contract with e-commerce giant.\n\nFedEx late Tuesday reported lower-than-expected adjusted profit for the fiscal first quarter and cut its fiscal 2020 outlook, triggering several stock downgrades from Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.\n\nThe stock on Wednesday was headed to its lowest close in more than three years. FedEx shares have lost 7% this year, contrasting with gains of 20% and 16% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.03% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
