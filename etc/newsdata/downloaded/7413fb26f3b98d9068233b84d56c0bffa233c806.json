Source: Coinbase\n\nMaker-taker model on Coinbase Pro\n\nCoinbase Pro uses maker-taker fee model for determining its trading fees, where maker orders mean those that provide liquidity and taker orders indicate those who take liquidity, the firm explains.\n\nAs such, Coinbase Pro will not only continue favoring its big traders, providing a zero maker fee for trades above $50 million, but will also adopt fee reductions for trades above $100,000 million. For instance, trades above $1 billion will have a 25% discount \u2014 down from the current fee of 0.05% to 0.04%.\n\nCoinbase stated that the new fee structure is designed to \u201cincrease the depth and liquidity of [...] markets,\u201d adding that the firm periodically updates pricing in order to respond to client needs. The exchange wrote:\n\n\u201cThis latest update will slightly increase fees for lower-volume customers and reduce fees for high-volume customers \u2014 any customer transacting above $50,000 a month will either see a reduction in their trading fees, or no change at all. The update also introduces three new tiers below $100,000 a month.\u201d\n\nCrypto community is not happy\n\nThe new trading fee structure caused outrage among the crypto community, with some Coinbase Pro customers pointing out that the fee change comes amid significant reductions on stock brokerages. Reddit user heresjoNNy130 wrote:\n\n\u201cMeanwhile stock brokerages are all going fee free. I emailed support blasting them. If they don\u2019t change, I\u2019m going to Kraken.\u201d\n\nThe fee update was published just a day after Coinbase announced that it will reward holders of USD Coin (USDC) with a 1.25% annual percentage yield.", "description": "United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase announces another trading fees increase on its professional platform Coinbase Pro", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjhhMDJmYjU5MDk3ODRiZThiNWM1MjExYjUwZDA0YTAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
