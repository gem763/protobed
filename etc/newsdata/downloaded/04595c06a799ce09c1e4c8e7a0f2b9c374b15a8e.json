You can't be satisfied with what you have,' Hyypia told Sportsmail.\n\n'You have to have the passion and the will to be even better and I think Jurgen has this mentality, which drives him on.\n\n'Jurgen has done a great job and a lot of credit should go to him, his team and the scouting department who have done a good job with the players we've signed.'\n\nHyypia was part of the 2001 treble-winning team, and also won the 2005 Champions League\n\nIt's interesting to hear Hyypia talk about Liverpool as if he still plays for the club, exemplifying the strong affinity a highly popular figure still has with the fanbase.\n\nThe Finn, who was a towering figure at the back under Gerard Houllier and Rafael Benitez, staunchly believes Liverpool can win the title this season, but reinforced that every player must be bang at it at Old Trafford this weekend.\n\n'I'm aware Manchester United is in trouble but when they face us they are always on top of their game,' said Hyypia, speaking on behalf of Carlsberg, Official Beer of Liverpool FC.\n\n'The start of the season for us performance-wise, there's been a few games we haven't been at our level \u2013 I would say that we were lucky.\n\n'But if you look in the past when United won the Premier League many times, they had bad days as well but they always managed to win the games.\n\nThe 46-year-old Finn was speaking on behalf of Carlsberg, Official Beer of Liverpool FC\n\n'Before last season, I said we would have a great season if we were still competing for the title in May, and that's what we did.'\n\nThe ex-defender is currently taking some time out from the game, with his last managerial stint finishing at FC Zurich in 2016, following spells at Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton.\n\nContent spending more time with his kids, the 46-year-old concedes he will go back into coaching, but is in no rush and is enjoying representing Liverpool in a representative role.\n\nHowever, the man who succeeded him as captain in 2003, Steven Gerrard, is already being linked with the Liverpool job (for the post-Klopp era) after just one season as Rangers manager.\n\nRangers boss Gerrard was named Scottish Premiership Manager of the Month for September\n\nDoes Hyypia believe Gerrard could cope with the pressure of being in the hot seat at Anfield?\n\n'Why not?' states Hyypia. 'Stevie was a good player and he's doing well at Rangers.\n\n'He's getting the experience of managing there and he's doing well. I can't say any reason he couldn't do it.'\n\nSami Hyypia was speaking at the launch of Hotel Tia as an official Carlsberg supporter's venue. This season Carlsberg will be upgrading venues across Liverpool to improve fan experience on matchdays.", "description": "After winning the Champions League Klopp's side seem untouchable currently but Hyypia - who played at Anfield between 1999 and 2009 - asserts that they need to keep improving.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19892908-0-image-a-19_1571416186609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
