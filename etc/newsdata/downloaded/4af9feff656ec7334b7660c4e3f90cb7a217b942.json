In January, sources told Reuters that the government plans to meet this target through the sale of state-owned assets.\n\nThe government will hold a 87.4% stake in IRCTC after the IPO.\n\nEarlier this year, government-run Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RAIV.NS) and MSTC Ltd (MSTC.NS) failed to garner as much attention as IRCTC, but were fully subscribed at the end of the subscription period.\n\nThe issue for IRCTC, which also handles holiday packages and pilgrimage tours for the Indian railways, comprises an offer for sale of 20.2 million shares at a price band of 315-320 rupees per share.\n\nAccording to the red herring prospectus, IRCTC will not receive any proceeds from the offer and all proceeds will go to the government.", "description": "State-run Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp's (IRCTC) initial public offering (IPO) to raise 6.45 billion rupees ($90.89 million) was subscribed nearly 112 times by the end of the book-running process, stock exchange data showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
