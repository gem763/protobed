POLITICO has not independently verified the news outlets' reporting.\n\nThree House committees earlier this month launched an investigation into Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's dealings with Ukraine in relation to the president's re-election effort, and Giuliani revealed Thursday evening that he had asked Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, telling CNN: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nBiden on Friday rejected Trump and Giuliani's accusations of wrongdoing but refused to weigh in any further.\n\n\u201cNot one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertions,\u201d he told reporters while leaving an event in Cedar Rapids. \u201cSo I have no comment except that the president should start to be president.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump previously denied making inappropriate comments to a foreign leader in a pair of tweets Friday morning. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats and their Fake News Media partners, headed up again by Little Adam Schiff, and batting Zero for 21 against me, are at it again!\u201d he wrote online.\n\n\u201cThey think I may have had a \u2018dicey\u2019 conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a \u2018highly partisan\u2019 whistleblowers statement,\u201d Trump continued . \u201cStrange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward.\u201d\n\nThe president concluded: \u201cDo you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!\u201d\n\nNatasha Korecki contributed to this report.", "description": "The president's remarks are sure to escalate tensions between the White House and Congress over a whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2f/3e/2f3a475e4190ba0591e4db59ddff/190920-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
