(Price based on two adults and two children under seven sharing a Woody's Roundup Standard Room).\n\nThe packages don't include your transport, although you can opt to add these on as extras when you book.\n\n(Image: Disneyland Paris)\n\nHowever, you do get some fun FREE extras such as a magical call from Mickey Mouse to announce your stay and a Disney Activity Book. Oh, and they will even throw in 15 per cent off dining at Planet Hollywood and Earl of Sandwich.\n\nThere's quite a generous window of travel dates, as the offer is valid for Wednesday to Sunday arrivals, between the 7th November 2019 through to the 31st March 2020.\n\nThat means you could find deals whether you're tied to the school holiday dates or not - and the dates coincide with heaps of exciting events such as Disneyland Paris' brand new Frozen Celebration (complete with new shows) and the parks' Christmas events .", "description": "Disneyland Paris breaks are currently going from \u00a394pp and that includes a Disney hotel stay and your park tickets", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Disneyland Paris"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642442.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Disneyland-Paris-breaks-from-\u00a394-with-park-tickets-and-a-Disney-hotel-stay.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
