The Twitter feed's only mention of the game in Sofia is a retweet of an image of Bulgaria's captain Ivelin Popov supporting an anti-racism campaign.\n\nUEFA's website completely ignored any mention of the racist abuse from Bulgaria fans\n\nNeither the running match coverage nor post-match analysis detailed the horrific scenes\n\nUEFA media channels' first recognition of the shameful scenes in Sofia came 15 hours after the game finished, in a statement by the governing body's president Aleksander Ceferin which condemned racism but again made no reference to events in Stadion Vasil Levski.\n\nUEFA insisted on Monday night it had been unable to discuss events, because it could not risk prejudicing disciplinary proceedings against Bulgaria. There was a policy of not drawing attention to interruptions in play by detailing them, the organisation said.\n\nAnti-racism campaigners accept that the notion of players deciding to 'just walk' when they hear racist abuse is unworkable and naive. It would create chaos, providing grounds for teams to make legal challenges against opponents who have forfeited a fixture without reference to officials. But it became clear on Tuesday that UEFA's three-step protocol, designed to prevent racism, is as flimsy as the governing body's willingness to report obvious racist abuse.\n\nReferees are supposed to remove players for up to ten minutes under step two of the protocol, if a stadium warning about racism \u2013 step one - is ignored.\n\nUEFA retweeted an image of Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov backing an anti-racism campaign\n\nBut despite clear evidence of further bigotry after an initial stadium warning, Croatian referee Ivan Bebek decided it was too close to half time to move to step two. At half time, he asked England how they felt about leaving the field. They did not want to do. Stage two was never implemented.\n\nThough there is scope for referees to consult with teams under the protocol, it is the official who takes the decision to lead players off. Had Bebek followed UEFA rules and created a temporary or \u2013 under step three \u2013 a permanent suspension of play, the message would have translated into a global story. But he was reluctant to create that level of controversy.\n\nTroy Townsend, chairman of the Kick it Out anti-racism organisation, said referees had to carry out the three-step protocol, regardless of players' feelings.\n\nTownsend told the BBC: 'We have to take the leadership here and decide that actually we are going to listen to what's happening [and say]: \"We now have to abandon this game, regardless of whether England like it, or Bulgaria like it.\"\n\n'I don't think UEFA want to have explosions and to make [that] kind of decision. There's no point having a \"Respect\" campaign with UEFA and have players stand in front of a banner [promoting it] unless you are going to follow through on those actions.'", "description": "Neither the running match coverage nor the post-match analysis on uefa.com details bigotry so obvious that it caused two stoppages in play and a stadium announcement.", "authors": ["Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19754702-0-image-a-14_1571164488775.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
