USA TODAY\n\nOn the heels of a 33-0 loss Monday night, it's likely no one in the New York Jets facility was in a chipper mood Tuesday. And the reasons extend past what transpired on the field.\n\nESPN \"mic'd up\" Jets quarterback Sam Darnold throughout the night and aired an unflattering comment, in which the 22-year-old says he's \"seeing ghosts\" against the New England Patriots defense.\n\nNFL Films normally has an employee at games to clear any material before giving the all-clear to the broadcasts, and the New York Daily News reported that was the case Monday. On a conference call with reporters, head coach Adam Gase expressed his dismay with the decision to publicize the comment. Running back Le'Veon Bell tweeted his thoughts on the matter, saying \"the NFL screwed Sammy over.\"\n\n\"There's not one player in the NFL who's cool with having every sideline convo broadcasted to millions...there's a reason we've never heard other QB's frustrated on the sideline like that before...that's crazy,\" Bell wrote. \"@NFL did Sam dirty as hell.\"\n\nThe NFL screwed Sammy over...there\u2019s not one player in the NFL who\u2019s cool with having every sideline convo broadcasted to millions...there\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve never heard other QB\u2019s frustrated on the sideline like that before...that\u2019s crazy, @NFL did Sam dirty as hell https://t.co/2XmYXNTNoL \u2014 Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) October 22, 2019\n\nGase was just as displeased earlier in the day.\n\n\"We'll be looking into that pretty hard,\" Gase said. \"That was one of those things that I was really disappointed to hear about after the game, I don't know that I've ever seen that, where somebody that was mic'd up was basically \u2014 that a comment like that was allowed to be aired. It bothers me. It bothers the organization.\n\n\"Obviously, you're never anticipating something like that happening. The fact that it did just gives us pause to really cooperate anymore because I don't know how we can allow our franchise quarterback to be put out there like that.\"", "description": "New York Jets running back Le'Veon Bell said the NFL \"did Sam (Darnold) dirty\" by airing the quarterback's unflattering remarks during the broadcast.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
