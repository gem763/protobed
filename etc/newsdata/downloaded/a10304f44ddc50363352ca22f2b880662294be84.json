Safety Damarious Randall was already out with a concussion, and safety Morgan Burnett was listed as questionable with a quad injury on Friday.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to rush anything,\u2019\u2019 Burnett said on Friday, via Cleveland.com\u2019s Mary Kay Cabot. \u201cYou just want to follow the protocol of the doctors and trainers. But that\u2019s the thing about this business, you\u2019ve got to be accountable and trust one another and everyone can get the job done because if they couldn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nOffensive linemen Kendall Lamm and Chris Hubbard and wide receiver Rashard Higgins are also inactive for Sunday\u2019s game. Higgins was listed as questionable on Friday with a knee injury, and missed their game last week against the New York Jets. Hubbard sprained his ankle during their game against the Jets, and missed practice all week.\n\nWho will step in for the Browns secondary?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Browns don\u2019t appear to be worried about the excessive absences in their defense.\n\n\u201cNow the guys have the opportunity for their number to be called and I feel like they\u2019re prepared, they\u2019re going to do their job and guys like myself, we do our part and help out the best way we can,\u201d Burnett said, via Cleveland.com.\n\nSafety Jermaine Whitehead and cornerback Eric Murray should see an increase in minutes, as will cornerback T.J. Carrie and cornerback Terrance Mitchell.\n\nWhile stopping Jared Goff and the Rams will be no easy task, Whitehead said he\u2019s looking forward to the challenge \u2014 and more than ready to step into his new role.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time like these in my career when I\u2019ve kind of been able to be that guy to keep everybody together and keep everybody going,\u2019\u2019 Whitehead said, via Cleveland.com. \u201cLike I said, I ain\u2019t looking down at any of my teammates. I\u2019m expecting all of those guys to come out and execute. It\u2019s my turn to be the leader, and I can\u2019t wait to go out and do that.\u2019\u2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Cleveland Browns defense will have plenty of new faces on Sunday night for their matchup against the Rams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5R.LLNiWrKtexfgaLyhyMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTUuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KSM_MEWTpLypHLqng49zew--~B/aD0xODg4O3c9MzAzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d2fc37b0-dd8e-11e9-bfb7-c0ceb68a53b4", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
