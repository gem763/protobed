They're tipping that Comyn will receive just a bit under half of the maximum $2.2 million short-term bonus that he's entitled to.\n\nAnd they know that CBA's decision on executive pay will in turn have big implications for their own bonuses.\n\nThere's no doubt that the brutal backlash that Westpac, ANZ and NAB experienced at their annual meetings late last year partly reflected shareholder anger that the three banks had failed to emulate CBA's tough stance on bonuses.\n\nShareholders made their displeasure plain, with NAB receiving a staggering 88.1 per cent vote against its remuneration report, while Westpac and ANZ saw votes of 64.2 per cent and 33.8 per cent respectively against their reports.\n\nThis unprecedented shareholder mutiny means that three of the country's four largest banks have now suffered a first \"strike\" \u2013 a vote of more than 25 per cent against the remuneration report.\n\nA second strike at their annual general meetings this year would trigger a further vote on whether to spill the board, forcing all directors to stand for re-election to their lucrative posts.\n\nDesperate to avoid\n\nIt's a situation that the three big banks are desperate to avoid, and they're already consulting closely with big institutional investors to ensure there is no repeat of last year's disastrous votes.\n\nAs Westpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted put it in a letter to shareholders in June, \"the board is disappointed we did not meet your expectations on executive remuneration and we are determined to do so in 2019\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the task of appeasing furious bank shareholders has been made even more difficult by the release last month of APRA's new executive pay guidelines.\n\nUnder the proposed new rules, only 50 per cent of variable pay (short and long-term bonuses) can be linked to financial performance. What's more, equity bonuses are to be deferred for up to seven years, with stronger clawback provisions.\n\nAPRA's guidelines are aimed squarely at changing banker behaviour by changing their incentive.\n\nOne of the key lessons from the Hayne royal commission was that if bankers' bonuses depend on sales and profit, then you can be sure that they'll flog as many financial products and services as possible, regardless of whether they're of any benefit to the bank's customers.\n\nTo avoid this situation, APRA wants to make sure there's emphasis on non-financial measures when it comes to deciding the bonuses of the country's top bankers.\n\nThis would take into account a wide range of factors, such as customer satisfaction, customer complaints, employee engagement, the ability of top executives to work together as a team, and their contribution to building the bank's reputation. But many of the country's leading financiers complain that APRA's new guidelines have only compounded the problem of calculating bonuses.\n\n\"It's really difficult to develop transparent metrics for fundamentally fuzzy criteria,\" complains one highly regarded director.\n\nFundamentally different\n\nWhat's more, he complains, bank boards are now being asked to compare the cultural performance of senior executives who are in charge of running fundamentally different businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're being asked to compare the non-financial performance of the executive in charge of the dealing room with the person who's in charge of the banks' branches,\" he says. \"That's a real issue.\"\n\nIt would be possible, he says, to develop sensible metrics to compare, for instance, the performance of different branch managers or different foreign exchange dealers.\n\nThe Hayne Royal Commission demonstrated how old incentives structures produced poor outcomes for customers. APRA is trying to change that. David Rowe\n\n\"But it's very, very hard to compare parts of the organisation that are fundamentally different such as, for example, treasury and retail banking.\n\n\"Non-financial metrics like customer satisfaction, and level of complaints and staff happiness simply don't have any real cross-business applicability.\"\n\nThe APRA executive pay guidelines will also leave bank bosses and bank boards with a huge challenge when it comes to justifying any differences in the bonuses allocated to the banks' senior executives.\n\n\"It's easy to say, 'we're reducing your bonus, you've made a mistake',\" says one seasoned banker.\n\n\"That's not nearly as difficult an argument as saying to a senior executive, 'you've done well, but the person running another division has done better because their staff seem happier and there are fewer complaints'.\"\n\nExecutives who don't receive their full bonus entitlements, he says, will inevitably counter-attack, saying the decision is completely arbitrary and subjective.\n\nAlready, he says, all the big banks are trying to contend with the seething dissatisfaction of senior executives who are angry that they're being financially penalised for the misconduct of completely different areas of the bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould backfire\n\nBut bankers aren't the only ones expressing misgivings about the new APRA pay rules. Some remuneration experts have warned they could backfire, leaving bankers with even larger short and long-term bonus payments.\n\n\"History has shown that incentive structures with a scorecard of measures and long deferral typically pay out at higher levels,\" EY partner Joanne Avasti warned this week.\n\nMeanwhile, some proxy advisers are worried that banks will use the new APRA rules to justify large bonus payments, even though bank earnings are now under pressure.\n\nFinally, there's a big question as to how bankers will adapt their behaviour in response to the new APRA rules.\n\n\"I think it's going to be even harder for small businesses to get funding,\" says one corporate leader.\n\n\"If you're concerned about a report card that focuses on customer complaints and customer turnover, the easiest way to improve your figures in terms of problem customers is to make sure they don't become customers in the first place.\"\n\nHigher failure rate\n\nAs a result, he says, \"there's a real potential for bankers to decide to weed out customers who may prove to be difficult. And these will typically be marginal small businesses, which have a higher failure rate, and whose owners have strong personal motivation to complain about their treatment by the banks.\"\n\nOthers believe that it's only a matter of time before bankers \u2013 who are acutely focused on their own financial incentives \u2013 work out ways to boost their bonuses.\n\n\"I can see enormous potential for gaming the system,\" says one highly regarded chairman. \"There's a real risk that senior bank executives will spend a disproportionate amount of time writing reports about how good they are.\n\n\"If there was one thing the Hayne royal commission demonstrated it's that bankers respond to incentives. If the incentive is to write reports about how good they are, that's what they'll do.\"", "description": "Rival bankers believe CBA's Matt Comyn will get a short-term bonus next week, the first in three years as banks and shareholders grapple with new pay formulas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98b5642c288c5930cd002a8aa68194effdc66b76", "published_at": "2019-08-01"}
