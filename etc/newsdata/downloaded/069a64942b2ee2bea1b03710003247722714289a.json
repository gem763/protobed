REUTERS/Anshuman Daga/File Photo\n\nThe Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC) ruled that Singapore-based Grab, which has backing from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), had abused its dominant position in the market by preventing its drivers from promoting and providing advertising services for its competitors.\n\n\u201cMyCC further notes that the restrictive clauses had the effect of distorting competition in the relevant market that is premised on multi-sided platforms by creating barriers to entry and expansion for Grab\u2019s existing and future competitors,\u201d MyCC Chairman Iskandar Ismail told a news conference.\n\nMyCC also imposed a daily penalty of 15,000 ringgit beginning on Thursday for as long as Grab fails to address the concerns.\n\nIskandar said Grab had 30 working days to make their representations to the commission before a final decision would be made.\n\nGrab said it was surprised by the decision as they believed it was \u201ccommon practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms, tailored according to consumers\u2019 needs and feedback\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe maintain our position that we have complied fully with the Competition Act 2010,\u201d a Grab spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that the firm would submit its written representations by Nov. 27.\n\nThe regulator said last year it would monitor Grab for possible anti-competitive behaviour after its acquisition of rival Uber Technologies Inc\u2019s (UBER.N) Southeast Asian business in March 2018.\n\nMalaysia would be the third country in the region to penalise Grab after the deal with Uber.\n\nLast year, both firms were fined by anti-trust watchdogs in Singapore and the Philippines for their merger. Singapore said the deal had driven up prices, while the Philippines criticised the firms for completing the merger too soon and for a dip in service quality.\n\nHowever, Iskandar said the Malaysian regulator\u2019s investigations were based on complaints received against the ride-hailing firm, and not due to its near monopoly of the market after the Uber deal.\n\nUnder Malaysia\u2019s Competition Act, a monopoly or dominant player in the market is not an infringement of the law, unless it abuses its position in the market.\n\n\u201cMyCC does not have mergers powers. We cannot unscramble the egg,\u201d Iskandar said.", "description": "Malaysia's competition regulator on Thursday proposed a fine of over 86 million ringgit ($20.5 million) on ride-hailing firm Grab for violating competition law by imposing restrictive clauses on its drivers.", "authors": ["Liz Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436504645&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF92083"}
