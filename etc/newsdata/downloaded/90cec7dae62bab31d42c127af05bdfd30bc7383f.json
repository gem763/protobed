In the language of diplomacy, hectoring a foreign leader \u2013 eight times, according to the Wall Street Journal \u2014 to investigate a domestic political opponent is as subtle as wearing a sandwich board and clanging a cowbell.\n\nFor two years, Trump defenders had an infinite supply of indignation over the mere suggestion that the president would collude with Russia. But now that indignation is reserved for anyone who suggests the president shouldn\u2019t have tried to collude with the Ukrainians? Come on.\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to believe a president who has never shown an iota of real concern over corruption in China, Egypt, Russia, the Philippines, North Korea and elsewhere is simply upset about the one corruption story that coincidentally touches on the potential Democratic opponent who is crushing him in the polls? Does anyone believe Rudy Giuliani \u2014 Trump\u2019s personal attorney \u2014 is calling Hunter Biden a \u201cdrug addict\u201d on TV because this is all a matter of statecraft? Show of hands: If Biden weren\u2019t running, would the president have brought up Biden eight times \u2014 or at all \u2014 with the Ukrainian president?", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Latimes.Com Opinion Story Trump-Ukraine-Biden-Military-Aid"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
