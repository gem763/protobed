As if to prove the point, his book, although dark and often disturbing, is also sometimes funny thanks to its wry, observatorial style and the surreality of the material.\n\nSome of his subjects can charm even as they appall \u2013 others just appall \u2013 and Marantz is particularly good at dissecting how alt-right trolls use irony and meta-humor and plausible deniability to obscure their horrible beliefs even as they promote them. The result is an impressive work of writing and reporting, probing and profound if not always persuasive.\n\nDisclosure: I know Marantz. He and I have significant differences of opinion. Nonetheless, I can report that his book is well-paced and shot through with vivid detail and scene.\n\nIn a typical passage, Marantz describes the lobby of the Trump Hotel in Washington after the 2016 election. He sees \u201ctatted-up Proud Boys\u201d, \u201cnotorious 4chan shitlords who seemed flummoxed by the mechanics of face-to-face conversation\u201d, \u201ca former Marine wearing a hunting vest\u201d and \u201ca wealthy deaconess from Nigeria wearing a gaudy church hat\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrump had won,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe libs had been triggered. Now the Deplorables drank together in the same glassed-in atrium, listening to the same elevator music, trying to figure out what they actually had in common.\u201d\n\nDespite Marantz\u2019s distaste for his politics, his profile of Mike Cernovich \u2013 the men\u2019s rights activist turned alt-lite crusader and would-be lifestyle guru \u2013 is empathetic enough to recognize how an unhappy upbringing in an Illinois farm town might explain Cernovich\u2019s hatred of the political establishment.\n\n\u201cLook, if the experts decide tomorrow that we\u2019re going to war with Russia, who\u2019s gonna fight that war?\u201d Cernovich asks. \u201cJonah Goldberg and Ross Douthat? Fuck no. It\u2019ll be guys I know from Kewanee.\u201d\n\nAnother chapter, The Mountain, brings the reader deep into the psychology of Samantha, a young, fairly apolitical woman who gets sucked into neo-Nazism before having a crisis of conscience.\n\nMarantz makes the interesting decision to recount the events of Charlottesville in August 2017 \u2013 including the killing of Heather Heyer \u2013 through the eyes, or words, of the alt-right. The far-right activist Faith Goldy was on the scene, livestreaming, when James Alex Fields attacked. We see Goldy\u2019s distress quickly give way to rationalization and false equivalence.\n\nThe word \u201cTrump\u201d appears less than one might expect. But Trump is, of course, everywhere. Antisocial speaks to what has become a pervasive progressive-left anxiety about the influence of misinformation and disinformation on American democracy. You know: Russian hackers, bots, fake news, \u201clow-information\u201d voters, scurrilous Facebook ads. Marantz laments the fall of the journalistic \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who used to arbitrate public discourse.\n\nBut that \u201cgatekeeping\u201d also brought us Vietnam and Iraq and an establishment whose reflexive favor for the status quo often meant quietism about civil rights and poverty.\n\nMarantz recognizes that the gatekeepers had their flaws. His stance on the old media is similar to Churchill\u2019s famous remark that democracy is the worst system except for all the others. But he seems less interested in understanding why the old media lost the trust of so many Americans. He is skeptical of \u201ctwerp bashing\u201d \u2013 the temptation to take cheap swipes at those who run the prestige media \u2013 but misses an opportunity to consider such grievances more seriously.\n\nWhat if our media gatekeepers \u2013 overwhelmingly white, coastal, secular, educated at a handful of elite universities and only 7% Republican \u2013 suffer from profound myopias and bias? What if the media was discredited in the eyes of many long before Mike Cernovich or Periscope came along?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest White nationalist demonstrators clash with counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017.

For years progressives have claimed rightwing propaganda causes Americans to vote against their self-interest. As the sometime Guardian columnist Thomas Frank put it, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d But when progressives talk like this they don\u2019t seem that different from the social conservatives upset at liberal democracy because it has brought outcomes \u2013 \u201cdrag queen story hour\u201d, sexual permissiveness \u2013 that they don\u2019t like.\n\nThe real elephant in the room, made more explicit in Marantz\u2019s recent New York Times op-ed, is his skepticism about freedom of speech. It should be balanced, he argues, against other liberal principles.\n\nHow to Fight Anti-Semitism review \u2013 Bari Weiss's elegy for Pittsburgh Read more\n\nOf course, Facebook and Twitter and Periscope are private platforms. No one has a constitutional \u201cright\u201d to tweet any more than someone can demand the New York Times print their racist screed. I\u2019m OK with putting PR pressure on private tech companies to de-platform bigots and bad actors. But things get murky quickly. A Facebook page advocating genocide is obviously hate speech. But is a group against gay marriage, or a page critical of child gender transition? What about a Twitter bot that just repeats the phrase \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s the same with \u201cfake news\u201d. Is a cruel, bullying but factually true statement real or fake news? What about false claims made in satire? What about a claim that is factual but lacks context? Should we ban all conspiracy theories, or just those that are actively harmful? And on and on and on.\n\nMarantz has written what may be the definitive book on the nexus of internet culture and the new far right. Whether it is the definitive explanation of the limits of free speech remains to be seen.
