The report, released on Friday, advised that the government switch ties to China and invite it to establish a diplomatic mission in the capital, Honiara, on the island of Guadalcanal.\n\n\u201cThe findings reveal that Solomon Islands stands to benefit a lot if it switches and normalises diplomatic relations with PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China],\u201d the taskforce said.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s representative office in the Solomon Islands called the report a \u201cfallacy\u201d and said the taskforce members did not conduct proper fact-finding.\n\nThe diplomatic switch reduces the number of countries that recognise Taiwan to 16.\n\nThe south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances, though China has in recent years been expanding its influence in the region.\n\nThe Solomon Islands was by far the largest remaining Pacific ally for Taiwan. The nation has had diplomatic relations with Taiwan for 36 years, during which time it has received considerable financial support from Taiwan.", "description": "Blow for Taipei as largest remaining ally in region switches relations to Beijing", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a7fbcc9f2db001531e4038f2130d2d48283d04/0_0_5080_3047/master/5080.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2dddeb09e17772c8e764e5630086db1a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
