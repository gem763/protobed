It has always been part of it, to give a chance.\n\n\u2018I think when you are a manager and you can give a chance to a young boy, it\u2019s always fantastic. And when they can play at such a high level like Arsenal, it\u2019s even better.\u2019\n\nGuendouzi is back with the France Under-21s after his call-up to the senior squad (Getty)\n\nWenger has yet to return to the Emirates since leaving but watches the games on television avidly and continues to support the club through thick and thin.\n\nAsked what it\u2019s like watching Arsenal now, rather than managing the side, he added: \u2018Ups and downs, like for every fan! I don\u2019t judge too much, I just want Arsenal to win and play well.\n\n\u2018For me winning is the consequence of the quality of the game, of the quality of the football you play. So I am more attentive to how the players develop, how the young players come up and how we play football.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Arsene Wenger has been impressed by Matteo Guendouzi\u2019s impact at Arsenal and believes he will have a big future, though holds Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson in similar esteem.
