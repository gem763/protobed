(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, but it\u2019s not new.\n\nA former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump \u201cmight be in violation of it\u201d if there were one \u2014 because, apparently, he doesn\u2019t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.\n\nIn a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled \u201cWhy America needs a hate speech law,\u201d Richard Stengel stated:\n\nMy @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f \u2014 Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019\n\nIn the piece, Stengel writes that \u201cmany nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred\u201d in the wake of World War II:\n\nThese laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there\u2019s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for protecting \u2018thought that we hate,\u2019 but not speech that incites hate,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that \u201cthere\u2019s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,\u201d and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban \u201chate speech,\u201d he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify \u2014 the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of \u201chate speech\u201d as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there\u2019s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they\u2019d be in violation of, his argument for \u201chate speech\u201d laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, but it\u2019s not new: More often than not, it\u2019s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against \u201chate speech\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that they\u2019re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I\u2019d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.\n\nYes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be \u201coffensive\u201d with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist\u201d every day, I\u2019m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the \u201csuper woke\u201d in our government for a phrase like \u201cyou guys\u201d to become a criminal offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is, though, the right to be \u201coffensive\u201d (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what\u2019s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit \u2014 without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.", "description": "Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Andrew T.
