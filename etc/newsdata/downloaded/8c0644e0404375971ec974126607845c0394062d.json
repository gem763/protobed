Next week we will release our world economic outlook which will show downward revisions for 2019 and 2020.\u201d\n\nThe IMF has become steadily more pessimistic about the health of the global economy since 2017, when it was confident that a sustained and synchronised recovery from the financial crisis was at last under way.\n\nGeorgieva said the outlook had darkened owing to a series of \u201cfractures\u201d \u2013 trade disputes, geopolitical tensions and Brexit among them. Tackling climate change, terrorism and money laundering all required cooperation, she said.\n\nAmid reports that talks between the US and China to end their tit-for-tat protectionist battle were going badly, the IMF managing director said global trade had come to a near standstill.\n\n\u201cEveryone loses in a trade war. For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700bn by 2020, or about 0.8% of GDP. As a reference, this is approximately the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cUncertainty, driven by trade, but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions, is holding back economic potential. Even if growth picks up in 2020, the current rifts could lead to changes that last a generation: broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u2018digital Berlin Wall\u2019 that forces countries to choose between technology systems.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva said low inflation and weak growth meant it was right for central banks to keep interest rates low, but stressed that borrowing costs were already near zero or negative in many advanced countries, leaving limited scope for further cuts.\n\n\u201cProlonged low rates also come with negative side-effects and unintended consequences. Think of pension funds and life insurance companies that are taking on more risky investments to meet their return objectives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn some countries, firms are using low rates and building up debt to fund mergers and acquisitions instead of investing. Our new analysis shows that if a major downturn occurs, corporate debt at risk of default would rise to $19tn, or nearly 40% of the total debt in eight major economies. This is above the levels seen during the financial crisis. Low interest rates are also prompting investors to search for higher yields in emerging markets. This leaves many smaller economies exposed to a sudden reversal of capital flows.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nGeorgieva said it was time for countries to use higher public spending and tax cuts as an alternative way of stimulating growth.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for countries with room in their budgets to deploy, or get ready to deploy, fiscal firepower. In fact, low interest rates may give some policymakers additional money to spend,\u201d Georgieva said, singling out Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea as nations that could increase spending on infrastructure and research and development, which would boost economic activity.\n\nBut, she said, \u201cthat advice will not work everywhere. Globally, public debt is near record levels. So in countries with a high debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal restraint continues to be warranted.\u201d\n\nThe IMF will release its latest economic forecasts next week but Georgieva stressed a coordinated fiscal response could be needed if activity slowed more sharply than expected.", "description": "In her first speech, Kristalina Georgieva says looming crisis requires coordinated response", "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/391acc8cc6249bbde714c2d5a8f220e0d42618d7/0_119_2177_1306/master/2177.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28bddbec64f7f912e2fcc09e3dc1ecb1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
