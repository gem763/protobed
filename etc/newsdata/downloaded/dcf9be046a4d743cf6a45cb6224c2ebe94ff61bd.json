I mean, they care about some things very passionately, but other things, it\u2019s like \u201cit\u2019s cool, just let it happen\u201d. I think drag is definitely mixed with that.\n\n\u2018Like Adore [Delano] \u2013 even though she\u2019s a millenial, it\u2019s very Gen Z-y, you know, buy \u00a312 drag off Ebay, put on a wig and just have fun. I stopped wearing nails because they\u2019re a f***ing nightmare, and they\u2019re probably bad for the planet as well.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScaredy \u2013 the drag name of 20-year-old Sandy \u2013 most definitely showed a different side of drag on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. For starters, the then-teenager had never performed in public before, and isn\u2019t gay.\n\nScaredy and girlfriend Pussy are both drag queens (Picture: Nils Jorgensen/REX )\n\nAfter shocking her fellow queens with this admission, Scaredy explained that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with the labels bisexual and pansexual, saying: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t really call it bi. I just go out with anyone I fall in love with really. But honestly. My sexuality is my girlfriend. I wouldn\u2019t want to be with anyone else.\u2019\n\nAnd Scaredy\u2019s girlfriend \u2013 Bear, or Pussy Kat \u2013 is just as into drag as her boyfriend, with the pair working together on Scaredy\u2019s post drag career.\n\nSpeaking after becoming the second queen to be eliminated from Drag Race UK, Scaredy said: \u2018I\u2019ve released a music video. We filmed the whole thing, it\u2019s got animation in it, we did all of that, we edited it, we directed it, we came up with the set, we\u2019ve done everything \u2013 because that\u2019s what we do, we\u2019re artists, and we do everything before.\n\n\u2018We have an art exhibition explained. We want to take drag to the next level and take our art to the next level, and try and get to as many people as possible, because art nowadays is a bit s*** really, isn\u2019t it? We want to change that and make it more fun and accessible. Going to galleries should be like going to the cinema.\n\nScaredy was the youngest queen of the series (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018Every single decision I make, everything I do, it goes through her first, and the same with her. We do everything together, and I wouldn\u2019t be here, I couldn\u2019t do what I do, without her.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScaredy\u2019s sexuality and relationship became a hot topic on the BBC Three show, and has dominated much of the reaction to the queen \u2013 and there has been good and bad.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had kids messaging saying \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could do drag because I\u2019m bi\u201d, which is nuts to me, or \u201cI\u2019ve got a girlfriend\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m a girl, I didn\u2019t know I could do drag, and you\u2019ve made me realise that I can\u201d,\u2019 Scaredy told us. \u2018I never even thought about that as being a thing.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Then there\u2019s been people saying, oh, he\u2019s straight. There\u2019s a whole conspiracy that Pussy is pushing me to do it and I\u2019m actually a really macho guy. The hate for me is more controversy, which I\u2019m all for \u2013 I\u2019ll get straight stuck into that.\u2019\n\nScaredy made it to the second week of Drag Race UK but failed to impress with her acting abilities, and was eliminated in favour of Blu Hydrangea after lip syncing for the very first time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m happy with what I said and did, and I think I did well for a baby queen,\u2019 the Wiltshire queen said. \u2018I\u2019m still a baby now but I\u2019ve come a long way since I did the show, so it\u2019s weird to look back.\n\n\u2018I have this weird paradox of extreme anxiety and extreme desperation for attention. So I will just push through for the rush of it and fun of it. That comes across as confident apparently, which is nice, but really I\u2019m screaming inside.\u2019\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK continues on BBC Three at 8pm on Thursday.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
