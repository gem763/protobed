SUSL, which tracks the MSCI ESG Leaders Index, has $1.60 billion in assets. Another fund that tracks the same benchmark, the Xtrackers MSCI U.S.A. ESG Leaders Equity ETF (NYSE: USSG), has almost $1.5 billion in assets and is the third-largest ESG ETF in the U.S. Both SUSL and USSG debuted earlier this year.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\n\u201cSince the launch of the first ESG ETF/ETP in 2002, the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF, the number and diversity of products has increased steadily, with 253 ESG ETFs/ETPs listed globally at the end of September 2019,\u201d according to ETFGI. \u201cIn September, 5 new ESG ETFs/ETPs were launched.\u201d\n\nAdding to the growth trajectory of ESG ETFs is issuers' willingness to take the concept beyond domestic stocks. Said another way, the number of ESG funds with fixed income and international equity exposure is booming.\n\nEmerging markets are included in that equation. For example, the Alpha Architect Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF (CBOE:FRDM), which tracks the Life + Liberty Freedom 100 Emerging Markets Index, debuted in June. That was a well-timed launch because FRDM features no exposure to China, meaning the fund has proven somewhat durable to trade tensions since inception.\n\nFRDM measures a variety of civil, economic and political freedoms and has returned about 6.4% since coming to market.\n\nThe iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (NYSE: SUSA) is another example of a thriving international ESG ETF. In September, that fund hauled in $848.55 million of its $1.05 billion in assets, according to ETFGI.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nFor now, it appears as though ESG ETF growth will be driven by investors outside the U.S. ETFGI date indicate that in September, 15 of the top 20 ESG ETFs in terms of net new assets were listed outside the world's largest economy.\n\nRelated Links:\n\n3 Cool ESG ETFs to Buy\n\nConsider This Leveraged Bond ETF Now\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
