It is a prize given to Africa, given to Ethiopia,\u201d Abiy Ahmed said in a recorded phone call with the secretary of the award committee that was posted online.\n\nThe Nobel Committee said Abiy had won the prestigious prize for \u201cefforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.\u201d\n\nIt said the prize was meant to recognise \u201call the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions.\u201d\n\nNews of the award trickled slowly down to the streets of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Bisrat Hadte, a 45-year-old businessman, said he was glad but the government still had much to do to improve daily life in the country of about 100 million.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister also has to work on to improve the economy and drive down the cost of living,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe Nobel Committee\u2019s decision appeared designed to encourage the peace process, echoing the 1994 peace prize shared by Israeli and Palestinian leaders and the 1993 award for moves towards reconciliation in South Africa, said Dan Smith, head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIt is a case of wanting a constructive intervention in the peace process ... to give leverage and encouragement,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is internal for Abiy Ahmed, with Ethiopia needing to deal with the consequences of long-term violence, including three million displaced people and the need for continuing the political process.\u201d\n\nAbiy had been bookmakers\u2019 second favourite to win, behind the teenage Swedish climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cI have said often that winds of hope are blowing ever stronger across Africa. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is one of the main reasons why,\u201d said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\n\u201cHis vision helped Ethiopia and Eritrea achieve a historic rapprochement.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed speaks at a news conference at his office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia August 1, 2019.

The ruling coalition had already begun making conciliatory measures, including releasing many political prisoners, but Abiy speeded up the reforms.\n\nHis government has promised to liberalise the bureaucratic, state-controlled economy, unbanned many political parties and dismissed or arrested many senior officials accused of corruption, torture or murder.\n\nThe changes are the most sweeping since the coalition took power in 1991, and the loosening of the state\u2019s iron grip has raised hopes in the country and abroad.\n\nAbiy\u2019s landmark achievement to date is securing peace with neighbouring Eritrea. What remains to be seen is whether Abiy - who joined the Ethiopian army in his teens and rose through the ruling EPRDF coalition over the past two decades - can control the political forces he has unleashed.\n\nHe faces challenges from elements within the ruling coalition who feel disempowered and from new, ethnically-based parties eager to flex their muscles in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe loosening of political freedoms means many regional powerbrokers are demanding more influence and resources, fueling ethnically-tinged conflicts around the country.\n\nIn June, a rogue state militia leader killed the state president of the Amhara region and other top level officials in what the government described as a regional coup attempt.\n\nDesalegn Chane, president of the new National Movement of Amhara (NAMA) party said three of his party\u2019s leaders were still in jail, held without charge and suspected of being linked to the violence.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cAs an Ethiopian, actually, I am very happy that the prime minister won the Nobel peace prize,\u201d he told Reuters by phone.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still have legitimate concerns and grievances that Abiy needs to address. The political repression our people the Amhara have been suffering from has continued under Abiy.\u201d\n\nAbiy also faces high expectations from young Ethiopians who want jobs, development, and opportunities.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.", "description": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for his peacemaking efforts which ended two decades of hostility with longtime enemy Eritrea.", "authors": ["Gwladys Fouche", "Terje Solsvik", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439677503&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0QA", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
