REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee\n\nIndia has struggled to boost its use of gas, which produces less greenhouse gas emissions than coal and oil, because many industries and towns are not linked to the gas pipeline network.\n\nGas consumption growth was running at 11% in 2010 but growth slid to just 2.5% in the financial year 2018/19.\n\nOil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters at India Energy Forum by Ceraweek that companies were investing $60 billion in the network and building new gas import facilities to link all states by mid-2024, when the government\u2019s term ends.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about potential investment. This number relates to the project that are under execution,\u201d he said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has previously set a target to more than double the share of gas in India\u2019s energy mix to 15% by 2030.\n\nIndia\u2019s biggest gas utility Gail Ltd (GAIL.NS) has said it was close to completing the 2,660 km (1,660 miles) Urja Ganga pipeline project, connecting the eastern states of Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. The pipeline will have capacity for 16 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas.\n\n\u201cThe Urja Ganga project ... will be ready by the end of 2020,\u201d Pradhan said on the conference sidelines.\n\nIndia\u2019s overall gas consumption is about 166 mscmd.\n\nThe minister said the government had started building the northeast gas grid to connect eight states in northeastern India, a region bordering Bhutan, Myanmar, Bangladesh and China. He said the grid would be ready by 2023.\n\nHe added that, before the end of government\u2019s current term, \u201cIndia will be connected by a pipeline ring that will help transport gas from any corner of India to a demand center.\u201d\n\nMost of India\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals are in the west, making it difficult for the industry in the east and elsewhere to secure regular gas supplies.", "description": "India, one of the world's largest consumers of oil and coal, is investing $60 billion to build a national gas grid and import terminals by 2024 in a bid to cut its carbon emissions, the oil minister said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Promit Mukherjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440429513&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0JO", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
