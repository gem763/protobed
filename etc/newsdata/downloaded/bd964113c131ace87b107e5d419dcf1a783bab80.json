At 12:18pm, the ASX put WiseTech into a trading pause while it sought further information from the company. A full trading halt was granted at 1.41pm.\n\nIn the meantime, 1,211,258 shares changed hands according to Bloomberg, with the share price sinking as much as 12.6 per cent from where it was before J Capital's report.\n\nAn ASX spokesman said \"changes in price or volume of shares traded must reach a certain materiality (which differs from company to company) before ASX takes the market away\". In this case, \"ASX has followed its established procedures for matters of this kind, which include engaging with the company and liaising with ASIC\".\n\nWhile WiseTech prepares its response to what J Capital has alleged so far, J Capital has in turn flagged a drip feed of further releases. Extended turbulence seems guaranteed.\n\nAnd only those sitting in front of their terminals or with their brokers on speed dial are likely to have avoided it.", "description": "It took some $1 billion in lost market capitalisation before the ASX's surveillance\u00a0team put WiseTech on ice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7212%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_201%2C$y_160/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ec09ffd5c554e8c40d11b0c9489312a702484f4f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
