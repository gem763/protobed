Wishing a Happy Diwali to everyone celebrating the festival of lights \u2728!\n\nPresident Trump speaks in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, to announce that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed during a US raid in Syria. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nAt The White House\n\nPLAYING POLITICS: President Trump seized on the U.S. operation targeting Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria as yet another way to discredit Democrats amid a rancorous impeachment inquiry \u2014 by painting them as dangerous leakers who pose a threat to national security.\n\nDuring the announcement-turned-news conference for the mission that killed the ISIS commander, Trump went so far as to make the grave accusation that he didn't inform House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top lieutenants of the operation ahead of time to prevent the loss of U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure this kept secret,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don't want to have men lost \u2014 and women. I don't want to have people lost.\u201d\n\nTypically, U.S. presidents \u201cfollow the protocol of contacting congressional leaders, regardless of their political party, when a high-level military operation is conducted,\u201d our colleague Felicia Sonmez reports.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2014 along House Intelligence Chair Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the focus of Trump's ire lately on impeachment, and Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.)\u2014 are part of the group of lawmakers usually briefed on sensitive information. Schiff confirmed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d was not notified before the raid.\n\nBy contrast: Trump said one of its members, the \u201cgreat gentleman\u201d Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), was informed. So was Trump ally Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), whom he called a \u201cvery strong hawk\u201d who \u201cagrees with what we're doing now.\u201d (It's unclear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was notified, per CNN's Manu Raju.)\n\n(It's unclear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was notified, per CNN's Manu Raju.) Trump on why he chose to keep it secret: \u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I've never seen before. There's a very small group of people that knew about this \u2026 A leak could have cost the death of all of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I've never seen before. Even Russia received a heads up about the operation before Democrats did: \u201cWe told the Russians we're coming in, because we had to go over them,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201c \u2026 They were very cooperative. They really were good. And we did say it would be a mission that they'd like, too. Because, you know, again, they hate ISIS as much as we do.\u201d\n\nMessaging wars: The slams only stand to inflame tensions between Trump and Democrats as they investigate his role in holding up military aid to Ukraine \u2014 and haul in more witnesses to determine whether Trump abused his office for political gain. In Trump's fight to control the narrative, his insults to Democrats seemed designed to paint himself as a strong commander-in-chief who can be trusted \u2014 while diminishing his political opponents' credibility.\n\nPelosi demanded that the House be briefed on the raid, \u201cwhich the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cwhich the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region.\u201d Zinger: \u201cOur military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\u201d Schiff called it a 'mistake' not to alert congressional leaders: \u201cThe executive branch usually informs the Gang of Eight, Schiff said, so that if a mission goes awry, the White House can at least say that Congress was made aware of the risks and was given the opportunity to provide feedback,\u201d per Felicia.\n\nAnd other Democrats fired back: \u201cI am extremely troubled Trump notified only Republicans, but did not see fit to inform me or any congressional Democrats of the operation,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\n'\u201c[Trump's] implication that Speaker Pelosi, the elected representative third in line for the presidency, cannot be trusted with sensitive information is tremendously problematic and insulting, and further politicizes foreign policy \u2014 especially when Trump has shown himself to be an untrustworthy guardian of our national security and sensitive intelligence information,\u201d Engel continued.\n\nAnd House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) called on the Defense Department and Trump administration to \u201chave open and continuous dialogue with congressional officials so we can fully understand the next steps and the long-term strategy for the region.\u201d\n\n\u201chave open and continuous dialogue with congressional officials so we can fully understand the next steps and the long-term strategy for the region.\u201d Pence steering clear: Vice President Pence, who sat in the Situation Room during the raid with Trump, denied to Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace that Trump was implying that Pelosi would leak information, adding that \u201cthe president's focus on a successful mission and the safety of American troops.\u201d\n\nFlashback to the controversy that never was: The Obama administration also considered delaying congressional notification until after the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid to maintain secrecy \u2014 a point that then became moot as then-CIA director Leon Panetta had already briefed top lawmakers before the raid, per the New York Times's Charlie Savage in 2015.\n\nPoint and counterpoint, from two national security reporters:\n\nNot a red herring. Whether or not the law requires it, it\u2019s common practice, and leaders will find it insulting that Trump said he feared the operation would leak. That\u2019s a grave accusation to make. \u2014 Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) October 27, 2019\n\nA NEEDED BOOST?: The raid might help Trump with hawkish Republicans who have come out against the administration's recent decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\n\u201cThis is a devastating blow. This is not just their leader, it's their founder. He was an inspirational leader in many ways. He formed ISIS in 2014, he led to establishing the physical caliphate throughout the region, so this is a major blow to them,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told Jake Tapper on CNN's \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nEven Graham, who initially excoriated the president for his decision to withdraw from the region, lavished praise on Trump on Sunday at the White House podium before reporters: \u201cThe killing of Baghdadi is a game changer on the war on terror \u2026 What I see happening in Syria, makes sense to me. Now I understand what the president wants to do. He wants to reduce our footprint and lower our costs. And he is right to want to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe killing of Baghdadi is a game changer on the war on terror \u2026 What I see happening in Syria, makes sense to me. Now I understand what the president wants to do. He wants to reduce our footprint and lower our costs. And he is right to want to do that.\u201d Talking point: \u201cThis is a moment where President Trump\u2019s worst critics should say, 'Well done,'\" Graham said.\n\nBut he's not out of political hot water quite yet, as experts and lawmakers cautioned against conflating Baghdadi's death with an overall defeat of ISIS.\n\nEven some Republicans struck a more cautious tone: \u201cWe must keep in mind that we were able to strike Baghdadi because we had forces in the region,\u201d said Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), a former Army Green Beret, who was critical of Trump's pullout. \u201cWe must keep ISIS from returning by staying on offense.\u201d\n\nsaid Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), a former Army Green Beret, who was critical of Trump's pullout. \u201cWe must keep ISIS from returning by staying on offense.\u201d And Democrats are not exactly praising Trump's Syria policy. While Schumer called the death of Baghdadi \u201ca great victory,\u201d he also said \u201cwe must not confuse the death of this evil man with the total defeat of ISIS. He specifically referred to the Islamic State prisoners that have escaped from detention facilities in northeastern Syria in the wake of the decision to withdraw U.S. troops: \u201cNew Yorkers know all too well the destruction a small group of terrorists thousands of miles overseas can cause from so far away. I look forward to receiving a briefing about this raid and the plan to deal with the escaped ISIS prisoners.\u201d\n\nWhile Schumer called the death of Baghdadi \u201ca great victory,\u201d he also said \u201cwe must not confuse the death of this evil man with the total defeat of ISIS.

We should have learned that lesson after killing Osama bin Laden, after which al-Qaeda continued to expand globally.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

(Phil Pacheco/Bloomberg)\n\nOutside the Beltway\n\nWILDFIRES RAGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA: \"Worry gave way to panic across a huge swath of Northern California, as officials ordered more people to leave because of the Kincade fire, bringing the number of residents under mandatory evacuation to 180,000,\" the New York Times's Lauren Hepler, Jose A. Del Real and Ivan Penn report. \"The evacuations came as the state\u2019s largest utility cut power to as many as 2.7 million people, the largest intentional blackout in California history.\"\n\nThis is \"the third time in a month that the utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, had shut off power in the area to prevent its equipment from sparking fire in dry, windy weather,\" the Times reports.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a statewide state of emergency on Sunday.\n\nThe images coming out of the #KincadeFire are devastating. Residents of Sonoma County, it is imperative to heed all warnings and orders from local officials, and evacuate immediately. pic.twitter.com/4JCN9N8mrE \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 27, 2019\n\nThese stories are heartbreaking: Multiple residents told Newsom that a power outage forced them to them into horrible situations, the Los Angeles Times's Taryn Luna reports.\n\n\"Lucille Constantine, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, told the governor that she tried to pick up extra medication from a nearby pharmacy before the store lost power,\" the Times reports. \"But her health insurance under Medicare wouldn\u2019t pay for the additional treatments until her existing supply ran out, she said. Constantine, 69, said she was told she could pay over $1,000 out of pocket for the medication and seek reimbursement later.\"\n\n\"[Tom] Mogg, 93, said he can\u2019t afford for the food in his two refrigerators and freezer to spoil during an outage, and his partner, Lillian Crimmins, needs the generator to power a machine that helps her breathe at night.\"\n\nMembers of the press wait while the House Intelligence committee holds a deposition on Oct. 14.\n\nThe Investigations\n\nWHAT'S AHEAD FOR IMPEACHMENT: Four additional witnesses are scheduled to be deposed behind closed doors this week -- though Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ex-national security adviser John Bolton, is very unlikely to appear later this morning after filing a lawsuit on Friday.\n\nWitness of the week: Timothy Morrison, senior director for Russian affairs at the National Security Council. Wait, who? If he appears on Thursday, he would be the first White House official to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Morrison would also be the first person who was on Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to testify.\n\nDespite the White House's vow not to cooperate with the probe, Morrison's lawyer told Politico that he would comply with a subpoena.\n\nHere's the rest of the expected schedule, per our colleagues' handy calendar:\n\nKupperman's lawsuit is likely to have impacts stretching beyond his own testimony. Kupperman has asked a federal court to decide whether he should obey the White House or Congress's subpoena when it comes to his possible testimony, our colleagues Derek Hawkins and Tom Hamburger report.\n\nIt could be a major test of whether the White House can prevent Trump's top advisers from testifying: \"If this case is ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, it will be one of the most consequential separation of powers cases in American constitutional history \u2014 however it is decided,\u201d former federal judge J. Michael Luttig told our colleagues.\n\n\"If this case is ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, it will be one of the most consequential separation of powers cases in American constitutional history \u2014 however it is decided,\u201d former federal judge J. Michael Luttig told our colleagues. More imminently: Bolton's potential testimony could also be affected by the case, as the pair share the same lawyer.\n\nAnd the weekend brought another data point to the Ukraine pressure campaign: Philip Reeker, the diplomat in charge of U.S. policy for Europe, told lawmakers on Saturday that he implored top State Department officials to publicly back then-Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch who was the subject of a conspiracy-fueled disinformation campaign,\" our colleagues Karoun Demirjian and Carol Morello report. But he was eventually told no such support would be issued.\n\nRemember: Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and then Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) advocated for Yovanovitch to be recalled, which she later was.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence keeps dodging: Vice President Pence \"refused to say whether he believes U.S. officials were lying in testimony bolstering the case that [Trump] pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in exchange for his administration's support,\" Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt reports of his interview on \"Face the Nation.\" CBS host Margaret Brennan gave Pence four chances to directly answer the question.\n\nRep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.). (Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nKATIE HILL TO RESIGN: \"Freshman Rep. Katie Hill is resigning from Congress after facing allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with staffers in her office and on her congressional campaign,\" Politico's Heather Caygle, John Bresnahan and Kyle Cheney scooped last night before Hill made her intentions public.\n\nHill's announcement comes amid an ethics investigation: \"Last week, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that Hill was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, a relationship that would violate House ethics rules,\" our colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.\n\n\"Last week, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that Hill was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, a relationship that would violate House ethics rules,\" our colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.
