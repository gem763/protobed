Gallingly, a subsequent change to the competition\u2019s format meant Britain\u2019s win counted for little.\n\nKatie Boulter finally ready to resume her career after nearly six months spent battling injury\n\nThe injury abruptly stopped a promising 2019 campaign which saw Boulter gain a first Australian Open win and notch up other Fed Cup victories in February.\n\nShe then took some criticism for entering the Roland Garros draw in May before withdrawing late and claiming half the first-round prize money.\n\nIn her absence she has slipped to No 260 in the world, but is now training in Spain with coach Jeremy Bates ahead of her scheduled return.\n\nJo Konta, meanwhile, is due to return next week at Moscow\u2019s Kremlin Cup.
