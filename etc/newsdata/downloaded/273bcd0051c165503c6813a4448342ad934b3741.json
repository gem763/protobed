The families really want answers.\"\n\nDiversion tactic?\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded since March, as investigators evaluate the airplane's safety following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which claimed the lives of more than 340 people.\n\nBoeing in July pledged $100m to families and communities affected by the crashes.\n\nThe company later said half would be reserved for direct payments to families, with the other half set aside for education and development programmes in affected communities.\n\nRobert A Clifford, lead counsel for the Ethiopian Airlines 302 litigation, said the lack of detail at the time of the initial announcement suggested Boeing saw it primarily as a way to divert attention from the safety questions.\n\nFamily members, many of whom would like to see memorials erected, continue to have questions about how the company intends to spend the other $50m, he added.\n\n\"One of the most haunting things about an aviation disaster like this is that the families do not in many instances get anything back,\" he said.\n\n'Important step'\n\nIn a statement, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenberg called the opening of the fund to family claims an \"important step\" in the firm's efforts to help relatives of the people who died in the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes.\n\nParticipation in the fund is voluntary.\n\nFamilies who submit claims will not have to waive their right to file separate lawsuits against the firm, said Kenneth R Feinberg, administrator for the financial assistance money, who has overseen the distribution of money for victims of the September 11 attacks, among other funds.", "description": "The financial assistance fund Boeing set up after the crashes has started accepting claims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/104F2/production/_108920866_gettyimages-1167365351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
