Then some maniac shot up a sorority house in Santa Barbara and posted a manifesto proclaiming he did it for revenge against women for denying him sex. And the weekend just generally went to hell.\n\nSo now my plans have changed. W ith apologies to Big Bang Theory fans, this is all I want to say about The Big Bang Theory: When the pilot aired, it was 2007 and \u201cnerd culture\u201d and \u201cgeek chic\u201d were on everyone\u2019s lips, and yet still the basic premise of \u201cthe sitcom for nerds\u201d was, once again, awkward but lovable nerd has huge unreciprocated crush on hot non-nerdy popular girl (and also has an annoying roommate).\n\nThis annoys me.
