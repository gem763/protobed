The Spaniard played a dangerous pass inside to his Croatian team-mate but the former Real Madrid star was unaware of the pressure being applied by Scott McTominay.\n\nThe Scot was tough in the tackle and played in the rapid Daniel James once he\u2019d gained possession. The winger zipped into the box and Alonso, desperate to atone for his earlier error, brought James down in an act of desperation.\n\nThe Carabao Cup is yet to sanction the use of VAR and replays did show that there was minimal contact on James but enough for referee Paul Tierney to award United their eighth spot kick of the season.\n\nUnited have won free on the bounce away from home (Picture: Getty)\n\nMarcus Rashford had taken three of the previous season this term and he\u2019d netted just once. But the 21-year-old made no mistake this time as he sent Caballero the wrong way to put United ahead.\n\nIn a first half of few opportunities, United looked the more comfortable side. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had reverted to the 3-4-1-2 formation that nullified Liverpool at Old Trafford earlier this month and Chelsea were finding it hard to get the ball into Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi in wide areas.\n\nBut that changed in the second half and dramatically so. Where once Chelsea were looking sideways, now they looked forward. Kovacic, sitting deep with Jorginho in the first half, was given more freedom to link with the attack and Chelsea started to create chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd they should have been level just four minutes after the interval. Alonso whipped in a teasing cross along the face of United\u2019s six-yard box to find Hudson-Odoi unmarked in the middle. The 18-year-old had been shoved over the advertising boards moments earlier by Williams and was perhaps still feeling the effects as he failed to make proper contact with the cross.\n\nMichy Batshuayi equalised shortly after the break (Picture: Getty)\n\nBatshuayi fired past Romero (Picture: Getty)\n\nLampard was then ruing missed chances from Billy Gilmour and Pulisic, who both failed to make strong connections from opportunities on the edge of the box. But Chelsea didn\u2019t have to wait much longer for their equaliser. It came when the Blues, playing their visitors at their own game, broke on United at speed. Michy Batshuayi found himself in United\u2019s half and up against three defenders. The trio opted against tackling the Belgian, presumably because they felt he would turn back towards his own goal and choose to hold-up play. But he continued and arrowed an impressive effort into the bottom corner and past Romero.\n\nThe equaliser prompted Solskjaer into changes. Anthony Martial and Andreas Pereira, both starters against Norwich on Sunday, were introduced for Victor Lindelof and Jesse Lingard, while Pulisic and Gilmour were both removed for the home side.\n\nStamford Bridge had found its voice but Chelsea failed to kick on after the equaliser. Instead it was United regaining a foot on the ball and the visitors had a free-kick 30 yards from goal when Fred was fouled by Pedro. Rashford was the man charged with taking the set-piece and he left the home crowd in stunned silence when he found the top corner with a fizzing effort that had echoes of Cristiano Ronaldo in the way it rippled in the net.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea pushed forward for an equaliser but United were untypically astute at seeing out the game in the final moments and the victory passed with few scares in the dying stages.\n\nAfter going almost eight months without an away win before United\u2019s victory in Belgrade last Thursday, the Red Devils have now recorded three wins on the bounce on the road in the last six days. The pressure is relentless at Old Trafford but it was building up to a palpable level before the side\u2019s 1-1 draw with Liverpool a fortnight ago. Solskjaer\u2019s side have since relieved the tension with a string of encouraging performances.\n\nMORE: Unai Emery explains why he subbed off Mesut Ozil during Arsenal\u2019s defeat to Liverpool", "description": "Marcus Rashford's exquisite long-range free-kick sent Manchester United into the Carabao Cup quarter-finals after a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge.
