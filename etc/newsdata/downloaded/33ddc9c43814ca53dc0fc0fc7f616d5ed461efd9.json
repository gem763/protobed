A company memo stated, \u201cwe want to ensure an inclusive space for everyone, including those who identify with gender X.\u201d\n\nThe change in language will be adopted by gate agents, flight attendants and pilots.\n\n\u201cWe will be amending our on-board announcements to modernise them and remove specific references to gender,\u201d an airline spokesperson said, according to CTV News Montreal.\n\n\u201cWe work hard to make sure all employees feel like valued members of the Air Canada family while ensuring our customers are comfortable and respected when they choose to travel with us.\u201d\n\nAir Canada\u2019s move to embrace \u201cinclusive language\u201d follows a court decision in August ordering it to compensate a French-speaking couple who claimed the airline \u201cviolated their linguistic rights\u201d by making announcements they said favored the English language over French.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Judge Martine St-Louis granted them CAD$21,000 ($15,800) \u2014 CAD$1,500 per complaint \u2014 and ordered the airline to send the couple a formal letter of apology.\n\n\u201cAir Canada has not upheld its linguistic obligations,\u201d said the judge, pointing to the Canadian constitution which requires equal weight be given to English and French \u2014 the country\u2019s two official languages \u2014 in certain situations.\n\nThe Thibodeaus said some signs on their domestic flight, such as \u201cexit,\u201d were only in English or with French text that was much smaller, suggesting an imbalance in importance between the two languages.\n\nThey also noted that instructions printed on the seatbelt buckles only said \u201clift\u201d in English.\n\nThe couple were particularly upset by the boarding announcement for the Montreal-bound flight.\n\nThe Thibodeaus timed the English version of the speech to run to exactly 15 seconds and, according to them, it was much more thorough than the five-second French announcement, a gesture which offended their francophone sensibilities.", "description": "Air Canada has parted with tradition by dropping \u201cladies and gentlemen\u201d or the French \u201cmesdames et messieurs\u201d when greeting passengers.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/air-canada-boarding-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
