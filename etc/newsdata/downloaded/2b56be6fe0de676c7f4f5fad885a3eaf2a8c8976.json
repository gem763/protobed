Professional Climbers Say He\u2019s Full of Sh*t", "language": "en", "text": "Years after it was first promised and at a cost of more than $10 million per linear mile, President Donald Trump is confident that his newest stretch of a strengthened barrier along the U.S. southern border is \u201cvirtually impenetrable.\u201d\n\nHow confident? Enough to have its scalability tested by the world\u2019s greatest rock climbers, he told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers,\u201d Trump said beside a newly finished section of the barrier in Otay Mesa, California, which tops heights of 30 feet. \u201cWe had 20 mountain climbers. That\u2019s all they do\u2014they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don\u2019t want to climb mountains. But they\u2019re very good, and some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb.\u201d\n\nThe climber test, Trump boasted, is proof that \u201cthis wall can\u2019t be climbed.\u201d\n\nThe problem? The country\u2019s top climbers have no idea what the hell Trump is talking about.\n\n\u201cI have never heard of any climbers ever being recruited to try and climb a border wall,\u201d said Jesse Grupper, who won the gold medal in the men\u2019s sport lead category of this year\u2019s USA Climbing Sport & Speed Open National Championships.\n\n\u201cI absolutely have not heard of anyone testing sections of border wall,\u201d said Kyra Condie, who currently ranks second among the nation\u2019s women boulderers and is considered a serious contender for the U.S. team when the sport makes its Olympic debut in Tokyo next year. \u201cIt would even be hard to find any of us willing to do anything to help Trump and his efforts in any way.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely no well-recognized U.S. climbers have taken part in something like that,\u201d said Ross Fulkerson, a seven-time member of the U.S. national team who is currently ranked third in the country. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any climbers ever helping out with testing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the nation\u2019s top-ranked climbing athletes, past climbing and bouldering champions, and sports associations, The Daily Beast sought clues to the identity of any climber who might have participated in such a test. Not a single person in the tight-knit community of world-class climbers had heard a single word about any border wall experiment.\n\n\u201cWe live in strange times,\u201d said Marc Norman, CEO of USA Climbing, the sport\u2019s national governing body. \u201cI am not aware of any of our athletes being contracted to do such work. Ironically, I have heard rumors of climbers being contracted by zoos to test animal enclosures, but that is about all.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople and executives at the country\u2019s oldest and largest climbing and mountaineering groups, including the American Alpine Club, Mazamas, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the Alpine Institute, were similarly at a loss.\n\n\u201cWalls continue to activate the basic human sense for adventure and freedom to explore,\u201d said Phil Powers, CEO of the American Alpine Club, who was in the nation\u2019s capital this week with 60 of the sport\u2019s top athletes to advocate for action on climate change. \u201cI am not aware of any climbers who have been hired to test walls. I would think if any of our very best had done so, we would know.\u201d\n\nMany in the climbing community expressed skepticism that athletes who practice a sport defined by conquering seemingly insurmountable obstacles would participate in the construction of a barrier intended to keep people out of the country\u2014particularly the sport\u2019s most promising athletes, almost all of whom are in their teens or early twenties.\n\n\u201cI have absolutely never heard of such a test as Trump seems to be talking about,\u201d said Arlin Weinberger with the Alpine Club. \u201cI also think it might be difficult to find mountain-climbing types willing to test the detestable border wall.\u201d\n\nGrupper, the nation\u2019s reigning male sport-climbing champion, told The Daily Beast that the ethos of the sport is \u201ctoo focused on inclusion for a climber to agree to such a request,\u201d even from a sitting president.\n\nStill, some admitted a willingness to try climbing the wall, if only out of curiosity.\n\n\u201cI would like to see how it looks and try myself\u2014why not?\u201d offered Alexey Rubtsov, a former world champion boulderer who won the bronze medal at U.S. nationals in 2017.\n\n\u201cI suspect that this would be an interesting experiment,\u201d said Kai Lightner, who was considered a top contender for the U.S. Olympic team before he took a hiatus from competitive climbing to focus on his college work.\n\nBut others said that such a test would be tedious for climbers who enjoy tackling the most challenging routes.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the slat wall behind him when he made the comment, it looks like it would be easy for a professional rock climber to get up and over,\u201d said Mitsu Iwasaki, executive director of mountaineering organization Mazamas.\n\n\u201cMountain climbers climb 2,000-foot cliffs, not 20-foot artificial barriers,\u201d said Grupper. \u201cAlso, most climbers try and only use their hands, so they wouldn\u2019t be the best people to ask to climb an artificial border that one could use tools to ascend\u2014maybe a construction worker would be better.\u201d\n\nFulkerson posited that Trump might have confused rock climbers and boulderers, who largely rely on their hands and feet, with mountain climbers, who use technical equipment to navigate mountainous terrain. A rock climber\u2019s skills, honed by scaling training walls via plastic holds bolted onto them, \u201cwould transfer extremely well to trying to get over a border wall,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense that they would want people to test it out, but \u2018mountain climbers\u2019 would not be the people to do it,\u201d Fulkerson said. \u201cRock climbers would be far better suited for such a test given we constantly practice climbing up vertical and overhanging walls.\u201d\n\nThe administration did not provide any clues as to who or what Trump said scaled the wall. In response to a request for comment on the supposed recruitment of champion climbers to test the border wall, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which constructed the Otay Mesa barrier, referred The Daily Beast to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which did not respond to requests for comment. The Department of Homeland Security, which supervises U.S. Customs and Border Protection, referred questions to the White House, which did not respond to requests for clarification regarding the test\u2019s parameters, participants, or existence.\n\nThe border wall in Otay Mesa replaces 14 miles of preexisting barrier, initially constructed under the direction of now-U.S. Attorney General William Barr, and is intended to be the first stretch of a wall that will stretch along nearly the entire U.S. southern border. The new barrier section is designed to absorb heat to deter immigrants from touching it\u2014\u201cyou can fry an egg on that wall,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday\u2014and cost $147 million.\n\n\u201cThis design, it\u2019s a game-changer,\u201d Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, told reporters at the Otay Mesa event, adding that the demonstration would hopefully counter the \u201ca false narrative out there that this wall is the president\u2019s \u2018vanity wall.\u2019\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump put his signature on one of the barrier\u2019s iron-coated, concrete-filled, rebar-reinforced bollards.", "description": "President Trump claimed that a fleet of champion climbers tested his border wall.
