Have a little fun before I die.\u201d", "description": "Wrinkles first started appearing around Florida in 2013 and quickly became an urban legend - now there's a new documentary exploring his myth", "authors": ["Jasper Pickering"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20401153.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WrinklesBrightened.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
