Emmitt Smith provided the blueprint.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFormer Dallas Cowboys star Emmitt Smith during the preseason. (Ron Jenkins/AP)\n\nEzekiel Elliott got what he wanted, signing a contract extension with the Dallas Cowboys for six years at $90 million and becoming, by some measures, the highest-paid running back in NFL history.\n\nThe deal ended Elliott\u2019s holdout saga days before the Cowboys open the season Sunday afternoon against the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying he\u2019s a cornerstone player for the Dallas Cowboys,\u201d owner Jerry Jones said during a news conference with the league\u2019s reigning rushing champion Thursday afternoon. \u201cMy vision of Zeke is that inspiration before a ballgame, and when he\u2019s in there and everybody\u2019s got their game face on, and there\u2019s Zeke. \u2026\n\n\u201cAnd everybody associated with the Dallas Cowboys knows he\u2019s fixing to carry the load.\u201d\n\nJones might as well as have added, \u201call the way to a Super Bowl victory.\u201d Because that\u2019s what he, and Cowboys fans, for that matter, ought to expect now that Elliott got paid.\n\n[Ezekiel Elliott cashed in with a massive deal. The numbers say he isn\u2019t worth it.]\n\nThe 11th hour agreement reunites Elliott on the field and in the locker room with quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver Amari Cooper, the offensive nucleus of a club that went 10-6 last season to win the NFC East.\n\n\u201cFriendship is friendship and business is business,\u201d Prescott told reporters at the start of training camp when asked about Elliott\u2019s holdout. \u201cYou don\u2019t cross those.\u201d\n\nNow, Elliott can do more to justify his contract than simply winning another rushing title or sparking a division title..\n\nDelivering the Cowboys a transcendent season, for instance. The blueprint is there, although the bar is ridiculously high. The player responsible for setting that standard wore a Cowboys uniform, too, and played the same position as Elliott, finishing his career as the NFL\u2019s career rushing leader.\n\nIn 1993, Emmitt Smith skipped the first two games of the regular season, both losses, amid a contract impasse. But don\u2019t call it a holdout. Smith\u2019s rookie contract was up, and he and Jones were well apart regarding the financials for a new deal.\n\nSmith eventually signed for $13.6 million over four years, and despite spotting the league two games, won the rushing title for a third consecutive season and was voted the NFL\u2019s most valuable player, cementing his legacy with one of the most memorable single-game performances in Cowboys history.\n\n[Cowboys didn\u2019t play hardball with Ezekiel Elliott. A Super Bowl shot was too much to pass up.]\n\nIn the regular season finale against the New York Giants in early January, Smith landed violently on his right side while being tackled by Greg Jackson, separating his shoulder just before halftime. The AC joint injury left Smith in pain, but the medical staff told him he wouldn\u2019t risk further damage by continuing to play.\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t have been much higher for a regular season game, with the winner clinching the No. 1 seed in the playoffs and a first-round bye. So Smith, wearing knee pads on his shoulder for extra protection, reentered the lineup.\n\nBarely able to lift his right arm, Smith touched the ball nine times on the winning drive in overtime that ended with place-kicker Eddie Murray\u2019s 41-yard field goal for a 16-13 win at Giants Stadium.\n\nSmith finished with 168 yards on 32 carries and added 61 yards and a touchdown on 10 receptions.\n\nThe Cowboys went on to win Super Bowl XXVIII, beating the Buffalo Bills, 30-13, for their second straight championship. Smith was named most valuable player of that game, carrying the ball 30 times for 132 yards, to become the first rushing champion to win a Super Bowl.\n\nHe also secured his place among Cowboys legends. Maybe only Roger Staubach is more beloved.\n\nDon\u2019t think Elliott has that kind of sustained excellence in him? Smith does.\n\n\u201cWell, he is better in the context of his speed,\u201d Smith said in a 2016 interview with Dallas\u2019s 105.3 The Fan, via the Dallas Morning News. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019d like to think that he is better than me because obviously some of those things that we just talked about actually give him the ability to make a house call when he needs to.\u201d\n\nSo this season could become a referendum for Elliott, fairly or not, on whether he\u2019s really worth the price.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait until Feb. 2 to find out.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nSorry, Melvin Gordon, but Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s contract is an outlier among running backs\n\nMitchell Trubisky begins a crucial season with a troubling performance\n\nJerry Brewer: NFL players increasingly want to use their leverage, and realize how little they have\n\nHow Kyler Murray went from a 5-foot-5 high school star to NFL\u2019s most anticipated QB\n\nAntonio Brown facing possible suspension or release from Raiders after incident with GM\n\nFrom Steelers subtweets to potential suspension: The Antonio Brown saga, explained\n\nThe Aaron Rodgers-Matt LaFleur debut wasn\u2019t dazzling but the new-look Packers did just enough", "description": "The NFL\u2019s reigning rushing champion became the highest paid running back in league history but remains in the shadow of his Hall of Fame predecessor.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football", "September At Am", "Gene Wang Is A Sports Reporter Covering Multiple Beats", "Including Virginia", "Virginia Tech Football", "Basketball", "The Wizards", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zjx2zIZQYUUTcrLmA8P8f3Xtx0g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3FH6HZWKXII6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
