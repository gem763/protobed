Every telling of this story necessitates pointing out that Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter had cozy financial relationships with other countries, including Ukraine. It\u2019s real swamp stuff. It looks bad, say the former vice president\u2019s friends. No, it is bad.\n\nIt is infuriating that members of America\u2019s leadership class so often show themselves to the world as self-enriching. As a nation we spent the 20th century presenting ourselves to the world as a truly moral leader, a self sacrificing country, one to be looked up to. In the 21st century our political figures and their families too often look like scrounging grifters\u2014Americans with connections who can be hired, who leverage connections to fame for profit. There\u2019s a fairly constant air of soft corruption, of an easy, seamy reality of big-power back scratching.\n\nIt makes America look bad. It makes us look weak and craven, like we can be bought.\n\nThere should be something called the Class Act. If you have any class, you don\u2019t profit financially from a relative in power in the world\u2019s greatest democracy. You don\u2019t embarrass your country that way. Because, you know, you have class. You\u2019re lucky to be from a respected family. A president or vice president might say, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to make my child sacrifice a deal because of what his father does!\u201d Actually, no one asked you to ask for power; no one told you to want it. If you get it, it\u2019s an honor. Do your job. Yes, your family should sacrifice, as should you.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peggy Noonan", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
