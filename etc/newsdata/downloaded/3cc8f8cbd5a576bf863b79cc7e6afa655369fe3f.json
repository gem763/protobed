The spokesman said he did not know how many workers would be affected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a result, GM will not have access to new supplies of its top-selling U.S. vehicle, the light-duty Chevrolet Silverado. The closure comes after GM closed a Mexican engine manufacturing facility and a Canadian assembly plant, according to the AP.\n\nThe strike, now in its third week, involves more than 49,000 UAW members, who are seeking higher pay, better protection for their health care benefits and an increased share of GM profits. Management and union representatives met for talks earlier this week.\n\nThe automaker announced last week that, despite initial reports it would cut off striking workers\u2019 health benefits, the benefits would remain in place.\n\n\u201cIt should not have taken stories about UAW GM workers who faced losing their cancer drugs, or postponing their surgery dates for GM to see their workers as humans beings not pawns on a chess board,\" Jason Kaplan, a representative for UAW, told The Hill last week.", "description": "A General Motors factory in Mexico will reportedly shut down amid a parts shortage that the company has blamed on an ongoing strike in the U.S. by United Auto Workers (UAW) union members.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/uaw-strike.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
