It is a fact,\" he said.\n\n\"We demand that the Israeli government sit down with the Palestinian people and negotiate an agreement that works for all parties,\" he said.\n\n'Change your relationship'\n\nCOLUMN | Bernie Sanders: America's 'other radical'\n\nSanders said his message to Israel would be: \"If you want military aid, you are going to have to fundamentally change your relationship\" with the Palestinians.\n\nHe called for some of the $3.8bn in annual military assistance to be turned into humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip in a \"radical intercession\" for the packed, impoverished territory that has been under a blockade since it elected the Islamist movement Hamas in 2007.\n\n\"Who is going to deny that when youth unemployment is 60%, when people have no hope, when people cannot literally leave the region - who can think for a moment that you're not laying the groundwork for continued violence?\" he said.\n\nTrump, whose evangelical Christian base is staunchly pro-Israel, has taken a series of historic steps including recognising bitterly divided Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nThe Trump administration has signalled support as Netanyahu - whose political future is unclear after two inconclusive elections - flirts with annexing parts of the West Bank.\n\nDemocratic frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, both appearing before J Street in video messages rather than in person, said they would oppose any action that closes the door on a Palestinian state.\n\n\"If Israel's government continues with steps to formally annex the West Bank, the US should make clear that none of our aid should be used to support annexation,\" Warren said.\n\nWarren said that she would reverse two key measures of Trump - by resuming aid to the UN refugee agency for Palestinians and allowing the Palestine Liberation Organization to unshutter its Washington office.\n\nWhile not reversing course on the US embassy, she said she would reopen the US mission in east Jerusalem which would become an embassy if a peace deal creates a Palestinian state.\n\nIn line with the US Jewish community\n\nBiden, who had uneasy relations with Netanyahu while vice president, said: \"We can't be afraid to tell the truth to our closest friends.\"\n\n\"The two-state solution is the best, if not the only, way to secure a peaceful future for a Jewish, democratic state of Israel,\" Biden said.\n\nIn a scene unimaginable at Aipac, the mostly Jewish crowd gave a standing ovation to chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat as he stood on stage to the sounds of U2's Beautiful Day and said of creating a Palestinian state, \"Let's not give up.\"\n\nWith some 4 000 people in attendance, J Street still had less than a quarter of the turnout of Aipac, which is itself non-partisan but this year drew a who's who of Republicans.\n\nJ Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami said he believed his organisation was more in line with the US Jewish community, which votes overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\n\"If you go to the Aipac conference and you're standing and cheering for Trump and Netanyahu - that is one approach.\n\n\"This is a conference where you stand up and you fight against what Trump and Netanyahu are seeking to do,\" he said.\n\n", "description": "Democratic presidential contenders have vowed to switch gears sharply from Donald Trump's hawkish embrace of Israel, pledging they would press for a peace settlement that leads to a Palestinian state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7291/7779818ad7a846a5b0599895859d22fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
