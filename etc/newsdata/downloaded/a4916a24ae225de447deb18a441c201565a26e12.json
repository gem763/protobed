You'll never achieve agreement on it.\n\n\"The budget cap is ultimately a sensible thing for F1 but the interim period of 2020 with the current regulations we have as teams build up for 2021, with unrestricted spend, makes it a very expensive year.\n\n\"An opportunity has perhaps been lost to have had that process more controlled under the cap, and delay these regulations and evolve them.\"\n\nHorner said that there's some \"great stuff\" among the 2021 proposals but added: \"The car and the concept looks very underdeveloped at the moment.\n\n\"Another 12 months taken to develop that concept and bring in something that works, perhaps addresses some other issues like weight, would have been perhaps a more beneficial approach.\"\n\nHorner's views were supported by Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, who agreed that having the cost cap in 2020 to restrict spending ahead of the new rules was not viable.\n\n\"But as Christian said, I think they [the new rules] are not very mature,\" said Wolff.\n\nAsked by Autosport if he felt delaying the 2021 rules was possible, Wolff said: \"I don't think the regulations are going to be stopped.\n\n\"It's been made very clear that this is moving forward.\n\n\"There will be tweaks and changes in detail and interpretations.\n\n\"But broadly, it's moving forward.\"\n\nSmaller F1 teams appear split on whether delaying the rules would be a good solution.\n\nRacing Point team boss Otmar Szafnauer said it would be a \"sensible thing to do\" but considered the chance of that happening to be \"small\".\n\nBut McLaren and Williams are opposed to any further delays.\n\nMcLaren team principal Andreas Seidl said: \"We like what is on the table now, what's coming in on the technical side, sporting side and financial side.\n\n\"We're just waiting now for 31 October, to see the publication of these regulations, and see what we have to work to for 2021 onwards.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Leading Formula 1 teams wanted the championship's major rules overhaul delayed to 2022 to refine \"underdeveloped\" and \"not very mature\" ideas, while still committing to a cost cap for 2021", "authors": ["Scott Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lDkBpuFgw7bCGkNyX.U7Aw--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/1862df49f652a2cb96760bceb5a3a385", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
