However, a federal courts blocked the program\u2019s dissolution, saying it would cause \u201cirreparable harm and great hardship\u201d to participants.\n\nEarlier this month, the administration announced that it will restore about $150 million in economic aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras after reaching deals on immigration in recent months with the three countries.\n\nIn July, the U.S. signed a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement with Guatemala, which stipulates that the U.S. may send away asylum seekers who have passed through Guatemala without attempting to obtain asylum there first. The U.S. has signed less specific deals with El Salvador and Honduras pledging to work together to address the heavy migration flow.\n\nSalvadorans in the U.S. were granted temporary protected status after two earthquakes ravaged the country in 2001. The country also has one of the highest homicide rates globally.", "description": "Immigration authorities on Monday granted Salvadoran immigrants with protected status an additional year to return to El Salvador.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
