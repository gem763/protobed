From CEO to commander in chief. From boardrooms to the Oval Office. From studios to global stage.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister then repurposed his own campaign slogan in India to rally support for \u201cmy friend\u201d Trump in the United States: \u201cAbki baar, Trump sarkar,\u201d meaning, \u201cThis time, a Trump government.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s overtures come at a delicate moment in U.S.-India relations. After the United States imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminum imports, India has been looking for ways to decrease trade tensions with the Trump administration and stimulate fresh investment.\n\nThe two leaders \u2014 both center-right politicians who govern with big personalities and stir controversy \u2014 are set to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week.\n\nTrump swooped into Houston on Sunday with an unusual role: as a warm-up act.\n\nCalled \u201cHowdy, Modi!,\u201d the event was staged to honor the prime minister and was billed as the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader other than the pope. Attendees, many of them from Texas\u2019s large Indian community, packed into NRG Stadium, the 72,000-seat home to the the National Football League\u2019s Houston Texans. Houston is the nation\u2019s most diverse city and home to an estimated 150,000 Indian Americans.\n\nModi recently invited Trump to join him here, and the president agreed to be a special guest, but the signage and stagecraft made clear that Modi was the main attraction, with his image projected on large screens throughout the arena.\n\nPower Up: \u2018Howdy, Modi\u2019: Trump rallies with Indian prime minister in new 2020 battlegrounds\n\n\u201cIn Houston, we say \u2018Howdy\u2019 in more than 140 languages \u2014 and this morning we are saying \u2018Howdy\u2019 to Prime Minister Modi,\u201d Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, told the crowd.\n\nThe event pulsed with energy all morning, as artists performed Indian dances and played music onstage. Once Trump arrived, live video of him and Modi walking down a red carpet winding through the bowels of the stadium played on the screens as a drum band played in anticipation of their grand entrance. The two strode onto the stage holding hands.\n\nAs Trump stood at his side grinning widely, Modi said he admired Trump\u2019s \u201cconcern for every American, a belief in America\u2019s future and a strong resolve to make America great again.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister added, \u201cWe are witnessing history in the making.\u201d\n\nTrump delivered remarks \u2014 and, unlike at his own campaign rallies, did not appear to stray from his script on Teleprompters.\n\nThe president highlighted his stewardship of the economy, but drew far most impassioned responses from the crowd when he talked about other issues. The president received a standing ovation when he denounced \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and sustained applause when he vowed to stop illegal immigration.\n\nHe said Modi was doing \u201ca truly exceptional job\u201d as prime minister, and congratulated him on his overwhelming reelection victory in May.\n\nTrump then took a seat in the audience to watch Modi give the keynote address in his native Hindi.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump won the support of roughly 14 percent of Indian American voters, compared to 84 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to an analysis by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nBut Trump made a direct pitch to expand his share of support among Indian Americans in his 2020 reelection. In his speech, he cited the estimated 4 million Indian Americans living here.\n\n\u201cYou enrich our culture, you uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American \u2014 and we are proud to have you as Americans,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe thank you, we love you, and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to take care of our citizens first, our Indian American citizens, before we take care of illegal immigrants who want to pour into our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\nM.R. Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora and an organizer of Sunday\u2019s event, said there was an opportunity for Trump to improve upon his 2016 vote margin.\n\n\u201cHe could hope he could change some minds,\u201d Rangaswami said. \u201cIt could happen.\u201d\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said Trump was smart to come to Houston and take advantage of the large audience assembled to see Modi.\n\n\u201cPolitics being what politics is, it\u2019s really important to show up and to listen respectfully and try to find common ground with these constituents,\u201d Cornyn told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any accident the president decided to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, he loves a good rally,\u201d Cornyn added. \u201cYou might have heard that.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Trump traveled to Wapakoneta, Ohio, where Australian businessman Anthony Pratt celebrated the opening of his newest cardboard manufacturing plant in the United States and introduced his country\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Trump.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this paper mill, we are now the largest Australian employer of Americans,\u201d said Pratt, who said his company now employs 9,000 workers in the United States.\n\nAfter Pratt\u2019s remarks, Trump spoke and lavished praise on Morrison for helping to create a $65 billion annual trade relationship with the United States. \u201cHe has become a very good friend of mine, he believes a lot of the same things I do,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMorrison returned the praise in brief remarks, saying: \u201cWe are here to celebrate jobs.\u201d\n\nKevin Williams in Wapakoneta, Ohio, contributed to this report.", "description": "The leaders of the world\u2019s two largest democracies took the stage together before a roaring crowd of tens of thousands of Indian Americans.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NZ62A6W5M4I6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
