It suggests the present \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is the fruit of that poisoned tree.\n\nSmith follows the efforts of former House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) as he discovered the truth about the outgoing Obama administration\u2019s efforts to \u201cunmask\u201d the names of Americans caught up in the government\u2019s foreign surveillance and leak them, illegally, to the media. Nunes and his \u201cObjective Medusa\u201d team found that the FBI had likely misled the FISA court to obtain warrants by hiding the partisan origins of evidence.\n\nAlong the way, the mainstream media colluded with the FBI \u2014 and with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm first hired through the Washington Free Beacon to dig up dirt on Trump during the Republican primary, and then paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (who laundered their payments through the Perkins Coie law firm). The media relied on Fusion GPS for \u201cscoops\u201d and helped the FBI plant its \u201cevidence.\u201d\n\nSome of the story will be familiar to those who have followed the story of the phony Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d theory over the past three-plus years. But Smith also breaks new ground.\n\nHe argues, convincingly, that the so-called \u201cdosssier\u201d complied by former British spy Christopher Steele for Fusion GPS was actually a re-hash of earlier work \u2014 four \u201cporto-dossiers\u201d that were put together with the help of Nellie Ohr, wife of Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr.\n\nSmith fills in key gaps in the story, suggesting that the original motivation for the \u201cdossier\u201d was not necessarily to stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency \u2014 since few imagined he could, anyway \u2014 but to set Trump up as the fall guy in the event Clinton\u2019s missing emails were ever discovered and released. They wanted to make the story about how the emails were discovered, rather than how they were hidden and deleted by Clinton in the first place.\n\nTheir efforts later roped the FBI into an attempt to stop Trump from being elected \u2014 and, once elected, to stop him from taking office; and, once in office, to have him removed.\n\nDuring a key period in May 2017, Smith argues, the senior levels of law enforcement in the United States held serious discussions about how to get rid of the president. Contrary to his denials, Smith writes, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was part of those deliberations.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller was meant to deliver the goods \u2014 even though everyone involved knew that the goods were not there. Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey had hoped to entrap Trump in obstructing justice \u2014 a claim that Democrats are still hoping to use as part of the basis for impeachment.\n\nBut Nunes and new Attorney General William Barr put a stop to the scheme \u2014 as did Mueller himself, in his bumbling testimony.\n\nIn criminal law, there is a doctrine known as the \u201cfruit of the poisoned tree.\u201d Prosecutors are barred from brining evidence that was obtained illegally or through violations of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nIn this case, the Democrats\u2019 evidence \u2014 such as it is \u2014 of Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of justice was obtained through a corrupt process. Crimes may also have been committed along the way, as U.S. Attorney John Durham may soon report.\n\nThe Ukraine allegations are arguably the fruit of the same poisoned tree. They were manufactured by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who lied to the public about his contact with the so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who himself (or herself) may have violated rules by going straight to the House Intelligence Committee with complaints about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Schiff\u2019s credibility, marred by years of lying about Russia \u201ccollusion,\u201d also taints the latest inquiry.\n\nSmith\u2019s book is a chilling read. It is well-written, with all the suspense of a suspense thriller \u2014 one that documents real-life events. By sheer coincidence, it is being released as Democrats launch their latest coup effort \u2014 one that recapitulates claims of collusion, this time with Russia\u2019s enemy.\n\nThe story told in The Plot Against the President justifies Trump\u2019s efforts to find out Ukraine\u2019s role in what happened \u2014 and ought to stop impeachment in its tracks.\n\nJoel B.
