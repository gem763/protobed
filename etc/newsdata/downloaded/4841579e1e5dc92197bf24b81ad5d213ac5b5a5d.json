Khosla Ventures, Forerunner Ventures, and YC Continuity also participated in the round.\n\nThis takes Faire\u2019s total funding to nearly $270 million since its inception less than three years ago and almost doubles its valuation from $535 million at its series C round last December. At a $1 billion valuation, Faire is now a bona fide unicorn.\n\nFounded out of San Francisco in 2017 as Indigo Fair, Faire was the brainchild of a trio of former Square employees: Max Rhodes, Daniele Perito, and Marcelo Cortes. The company targets smaller local retailers with a marketplace where they can procure \u201cunique\u201d merchandise for their stores \u2014 anything from appliances and condiments to jewelry and kitchen accessories. It\u2019s kind of like Etsy, but with minimum purchase quantities in place, highlighting the fact that it\u2019s aimed at wholesalers rather than consumers.\n\nFaire\u2019s technological proposition extends beyond a simple marketplace and into the realms of artificial intelligence. Indeed, the platform leverages machine learning to automatically match local retailers with the most relevant makers for their stores, while the algorithms developed in house serve to improve product recommendations, ranking, search, logistics, and more.\n\n\u201cStarting a business can provide a level of autonomy and fulfillment that\u2019s become difficult to find elsewhere in the economy,\u201d said Rhodes, who serves as CEO. \u201cIt can also be an intensely challenging and solitary path. We created Faire with the goal of making that path easier for millions of makers and retailers throughout the world.\u201d\n\nGrowth\n\nFaire now claims 150 employees spread across offices in San Francisco, Salt Lake City, and Kitchener-Waterloo, the latter underpinning its recent expansion into Canadian retail. Faire also said it\u2019s now notching up $1 million in sales each day, a figure it was racking up each month at the beginning of 2018.\n\nThe size of Faire\u2019s latest funding round \u2014 and the new valuation \u2014 validates the demand for differentiation in a world increasingly dominated by Amazon and its ilk, with countless lookalike products available across millions of third-party retailers. In short, it can be difficult to locate unique and independent goods online.\n\n\u201cBy simplifying the wholesale buying process, Faire helps retailers and makers spend more time doing what they love,\u201d said Rhodes. \u201cRetailers get more than 7,000 of the best makers in the world available at their fingertips, making it easy to find the perfect goods for their community. Makers with great products can instantly access more than 50,000 stores, where they can showcase their creativity to tens of millions of local shoppers.\u201d\n\nWith another $150 million in the bank, the company plans to scale into new markets and improve its marketplace proposition.\n\n\u201cRaising money is sometimes mistaken for success,\u201d Rhodes added. \u201cWe view this fundraise as an important milestone for the future of retail. Our success will look like more diversity in local communities \u2014 special and unique downtowns where people can discover high-quality items sold in stores owned by their neighbors.\u201d", "description": "Faire, a wholesale marketplace that helpers creators find independent retailers, has raised $150 million in a series D round of funding.", "authors": ["Paul Sawers"], "top_image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Faire.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
