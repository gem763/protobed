The move prompted an immediate uproar from lawmakers, who cried foul that the president had infringed on Congress\u2019 appropriation authority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf the $1.08 billion in cuts coming from military facilities inside 23 U.S. states, 55 percent came from states Hillary Clinton won, versus 45 percent from states won by Trump, according to a POLITICO analysis.\n\nHardest hit was New York, where $160 million that was expected to go towards updating the engineering center and a parking structure at the U.S. Military Academy is being diverted. New Mexico and Washington State also had big-dollar projects valued at $125 million and $89 million, respectively, halted.\n\nAsked by reporters what he told members of Congress who would see projects in their districts affected by the diversion of funds, Trump said Wednesday he had delegated that task to Esper, who had \u201cvery good conversations\u201d with \u201cvarious\u201d members, the president said.\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria\u2019s devastation in 2017 \u2014 and its government has come under repeated criticism from Trump, who denounced it last week as \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth\u201d even as the island was facing a lashing from Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe five projects in Puerto Rico are primarily to rebuild after severe damage from Hurricane Maria, a senior defense official said.\n\nThe Pentagon selected these projects because many weren\u2019t expected to be awarded until late 2020 or early 2021, according to a senior defense official, who said the Defense Department is working with Congress to backfill the funding. The official declined to say how the Pentagon intends to sway lawmakers, who ultimately decided not to fund the wall, and acknowledged there are \u201cno guarantees\u201d these projects will ever be funded.\n\n\u201cAll these projects are important to us \u2026 but we also have to respond to the emergency that we\u2019ve been directed to respond to on the southwest border,\u201d the official told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nThe Pentagon is also deferring military construction projects in 19 foreign countries, as well as one classified location abroad. Some of the hardest hit are in Germany, which will see eight projects delayed, and Japan, where five projects will be cut.\n\nTrump's move frustrated even members of his own party. Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Mitt Romney of Utah criticized Trump's decision, after the Air Force told the senators that $54 million would be diverted from military construction projects.\n\n\"Congress has been ceding far too much powers to the executive branch for decades and it is far past time for Congress to restore the proper balance of power between the three branches,\u201d Lee said in a statement.\n\nRomney added that while funding the border wall is an \"important priority, the \"executive branch should use the appropriate channels in Congress, rather than divert already appropriated funding away from military construction projects and therefore undermining military readiness.\"\n\nHouse Armed Services Ranking Member Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) did not criticize Trump, but said \"it is important that Congress now restore the military construction funding diverted for border security.\"\n\nDemocratic senators also slammed the move. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) tweeted that a total $66.5 million for three Maryland projects would be diverted, adding that the \"unconstitutional money grab undermines our national security.\" Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement Wednesday that Trump's plan would take away $77 million from projects in Virginia.\n\nDemocrats also rejected the Pentagon\u2019s plan to backfill the funding. In a statement, Democratic Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Dick Durbin of Illinois \u2014 all members of the Senate Appropriations Committee \u2014 said they \u201cwill strongly oppose any request by this administration to provide additional money for the projects it has decided to defund.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement stems from Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration earlier this year, a step that would allow him to steer $8 billion from various federal accounts to build a physical barrier along the southwest border, including a Treasury Department fund and Defense Department efforts to interdict illegal drugs.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

House Democrats have sought to impose limits on the Pentagon budget to block money from being diverted to the border. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have sought to backfill the $3.6 billion in raided military construction money in their version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nSeparately, Trump also defended a different shifting of funds within the Department of Homeland Security for immigration proceedings and detention facilities along the border. DHS notified Congress earlier this month of the plan, which would siphon $155 million from FEMA\u2019s disaster fund to go toward facilities to hold immigration proceedings. The administration has claimed that this money would not affect the government\u2019s ability to respond to disasters, a main criticism from lawmakers as hurricane season kicks off.\n\nRegardless, Trump said Wednesday he isn\u2019t concerned about the move despite the threat that Hurricane Dorian continues to pose to the East Coast as it continues its churn northward, arguing that it helped that Florida largely escaped a direct hit from the storm.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Trump said when asked whether he is still comfortable with that shift in resources. \u201cWe are using much less here than we anticipated. We thought this was going to be a direct \u2014 originally this was going to be a direct hit into Miami and we would have been satisfied anyway. No, we need help on the border.\u201d\n\nDespite the administration's funding shifts, preliminary numbers obtained by POLITICO show that the number of migrants caught crossing the border continued a sharp decline in August, dropping 30 percent from the previous month. That number, which reached record levels earlier this year, has decreased by more than half since May, acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n\nTrump on Wednesday also repeated his vow to have at least 500 miles of border wall \u201calmost completed if not complete\u201d by around the time of the presidential election next year, despite progress on that front coming slowly amid litigation over his efforts to fund the projects.\n\nConnor O'Brien contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "The Pentagon revealed more than 20 states that will be hit by the diversion of funds.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Jacqueline Feldscher", "Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e7/58/2f1c27d74fb0a70398883a2b7a81/20190904-trump-close-up-oval-gty-773.jpg"}
