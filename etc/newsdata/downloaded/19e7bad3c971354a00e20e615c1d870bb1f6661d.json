Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations \u2014 from all 120 Kentucky counties \u2014 have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,\u201d said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.\n\nThe poll he referenced was a Topline Data survey of Kentucky voters from July that showed Mr. McConnell with 47% or the vote to Ms. McGrath\u2019s 46%.\n\nMr. McConnell, who has a powerful national fundraising machine, has not released his third-quarter numbers.\n\nHe has overcome tough challenges before, including in 2014 when he also was considered one of the most vulnerable Senate incumbents on the ballot.\n\nMs. McGrath ran unsuccessfully in 2018 to oust Rep. Andy Barr, Kentucky Republican. She was recruited to take on Mr. McConnell by Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and liberal activist groups.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
