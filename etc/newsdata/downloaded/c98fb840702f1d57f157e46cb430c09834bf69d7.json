The Labor Party has said it would only support a general election if there\u2019s a guarantee that a no-deal Brexit cannot happen on Oct. 31.\n\nLabor Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the withdrawal agreement would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Britain. He\u2019s pushing for Britain to negotiate an \u201cappropriate deal\u201d with the EU and then put that to a referendum vote of the people.\n\nLiberal Democrat spokesman Tom Brake said Johnson\u2019s threat to pull the bill if Parliament doesn\u2019t agree to his timeline is \u201cchildish blackmail.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fight to give the people the final say through a people\u2019s vote with the option to stay in the EU,\u201d Brake said.\n\nParliament did not approve Johnson\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement Bill last weekend and the prime minister\u2019s push for another vote Monday failed.\n\nA vote on the principles of how Britain will exit the EU in a second reading passed earlier Tuesday in the House of Commons by a 329 to 299 vote though some said they could still reject it at a later stage in the process if they\u2019re unable to amend it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go for a deal that can heal this country and allow us to believe in ourselves once again,\u201d Johnson tweeted.\n\nThe second vote will determine whether Johnson can push his agreement through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday. If both votes are successful, Britain can still make the Oct. 31 departure deadline. If they\u2019re not, a three-month extension \u2014 pushing the departure date back to Jan. 31 \u2014 will be all but certain.\n\nParliament declined to hold a yes-or-no vote on the deal last weekend, mainly because these details have yet to be approved.\n\nJohnson is bound by British law to seek the extension, and his office has said the request has already been made. The prime minister could also decide to abandon the new deal, reached in Belgium last week, altogether.\n\n\u201cMinisters are trying to bounce [lawmakers] into signing off a bill that could cause huge damage to our country,\u201d said Brexit Shadow Secretary Keir Starmer, a leader in the opposition Labor Party. \u201cBoris Johnson knows that the more time people have to read the small print of his deal, the more it will be exposed for the risks it represents to our economy and communities.\u201d\n\nEU lawmakers would need to approve any deal after it passes British Parliament.\n\nOutgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker expressed disappointment Tuesday and said the exit process \u2014 which, on his watch, has involved two British prime ministers and several variations of a proposed settlement \u2014 has been a \u201cwaste\u201d of time and energy.\n\n\u201cI will always regret the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the Union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at least we can look at ourselves in the eye and say that we have done all in our power to make sure that this departure is orderly.\u201d\n\nJuncker will be succeeded by commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen on Nov. 2.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 British Parliament members rejected Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to set a three-day window on debate of a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
