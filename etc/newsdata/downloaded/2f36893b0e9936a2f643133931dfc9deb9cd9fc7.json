(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Ramirez put on quite a show in his return to the lineup.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians enjoyed every moment.\n\nRamirez hit a grand slam and a three-run homer in his first two plate appearances after missing a month with a broken hand, and Cleveland pounded the Chicago White Sox 11-0 on Tuesday night.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRoberto Perez and Oscar Mercado also went deep for the Indians, who won for the sixth time in seven games to remain a half-game back of Tampa Bay for the second AL wild card.\n\nThe switch-hitting Ramirez homered from both sides for the fourth time. He finished with a career-best seven RBIs.\n\nBut the compact slugger downplayed his performance as just getting back to work with his teammates, even though he said through a translator that this bat handle had been modified slightly to accommodate this surgically repaired right hand.\n\n''I'm not surprised to be honest,'' Ramirez said. ''You just try to compete and try to get my best pitch and have a best swing, and that's what happened.\n\n''It was great to be back with the guys and help them in any way I can.''\n\nThe 27-year-old Ramirez was activated from the 10-day injured list prior to the game. He got hurt Aug. 24 against Kansas City and had surgery two days later.\n\nRamirez said he's ''not 100 percent yet,'' but manager Terry Francona was impressed by his immediate contribution.\n\n''Seven RBIs in his first two at-bats when he has had surgery and hasn't played in a month? That's unbelievable,'' Francona said.\n\nMike Clevinger (13-3) pitched seven innings of five-hit ball and struck out 10 while extending his scoreless streak to 18 innings.\n\n''The past five to eight starts, I've almost been trying to treat it like a playoff start even if it doesn't have the atmosphere,'' Clevinger said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBatting left-handed, Ramirez drove a 3-1 pitch from Carson Fulmer (1-2) into the right-field stands with two outs in the first inning. It was his second career grand slam.\n\nRamirez connected again in the third, this time from the right side against Hector Santiago. His 22nd homer went deep into the left-field stands.\n\nRamirez hit .254 with 20 homers and 75 RBIs in his first 126 games this season. The two-time All-Star batted .320 with 15 homers and 45 RBIs in 46 games in July and August before getting hurt.\n\nDan Otero and Phil Maton finished the combined six-hitter with a scoreless inning apiece.\n\n''Give Clevinger a little credit, the guy's pretty good,'' White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. ''Nice breaking ball, good fastball, we just weren't able to do a whole lot against him,''\n\nBut Ramirez did the real damage.\n\n''He's a special player who took advantage of a couple at-bats there that hurt us,'' Renteria said.\n\nWhite Sox shortstop Tim Anderson, who entered leading the majors with a .334 batting average, went 1 for 3. Zack Collins had two hits.\n\nSantiago replaced Fulmer after the first and yielded seven runs over four innings.\n\nAfter Ramirez's slam in the first, Perez made it 5-0 with his 24th homer in the second.\n\nFollowing Ramirez's shot in the third, Mercado hit a three-run drive to left-center in the fifth.\n\nEARLY EXIT\n\nRamirez finished 2 for 3. He struck out swinging in the fourth inning, and then was replaced at third by Yu Chang in bottom of the fifth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nIndians: Second baseman Jason Kipnis underwent season-ending surgery on Tuesday in New York, also for a fractured bone in his right hand. He has been out since Sept. 15\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndians right-hander Shane Bieber (15-7, 3.23 ERA) faces White Sox left-hander Ross Detwiler (2-5, 6.98 ERA) on Wednesday night. Bieber has won his last three decisions in four starts this month.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "Jose Ramirez put on quite a show in his return to the lineup.
