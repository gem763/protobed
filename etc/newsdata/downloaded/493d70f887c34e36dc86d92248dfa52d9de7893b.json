(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nAs the Mexican government claimed success Friday for its summerlong crackdown on Central American migrants, U.S. Homeland Security officials said the country\u2019s efforts are stalling and that the Trump administration will push for a more aggressive approach during talks in Washington next week.\n\nThe number of migrants taken into custody at the U.S. southern border has dropped by more than half in the past three months, after President Trump forced Mexico to ramp up enforcement by threatening to impose tariffs on the United States\u2019 third-largest trade partner.\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who will travel to Washington for talks Tuesday with Trump administration officials, told reporters his government\u2019s deployment of thousands of national guard troops has cut northern migration flows by 56 percent, according to the U.S. government\u2019s own data.\n\n\u201cThe Mexican strategy is working,\u201d he said.\n\n[How Mexico talked Trump out of tariff threat with immigration crackdown pact]\n\nU.S. officials are less sanguine, at least in private, pointing out that the number of border crossers taken into custody last month \u2014 approximately 65,000 according to preliminary tallies \u2014 remains far higher than any other August in at least five years.\n\nOfficials from the Department of Homeland Security said this week they believe Mexico\u2019s effort is flagging and they want more robust interdiction.\n\n\u201cMexico started off making some gains, and they have executed enforcement operations they\u2019ve never executed before, which the U.S. government has acknowledged and applauded, but those efforts have largely stalled,\u201d said a DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe how the United States is planning to approach next week\u2019s talks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that Mexico is resting on its laurels and not postured to drive down the numbers to acceptable levels,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe know they can do more, and that\u2019s what the United States expects.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted praise for Mexico\u2019s cooperation earlier in the summer, calling the government of leftist President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador a more reliable partner for immigration enforcement than congressional Democrats, who have opposed the administration\u2019s border policies.\n\nBut acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan has said the United States is seeking a return to the \u201chistoric lows\u201d registered during the initial months of the Trump administration, when monthly arrests bottomed out at fewer than 20,000.\n\nIn their June 7 accord, U.S. and Mexican negotiators agreed the two sides would reassess their efforts after 90 days. That period has expired.\n\nDuring their June negotiations, the United States pushed hard for Mexico to accept a \u201csafe third country\u201d accord that would require it to take in U.S.-bound asylum seekers from other nations.\n\n\n\nA group of migrant families waits to be taken into custody in McAllen, Tex., on June 21, after moving north through Mexico. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Mexican government resisted that pressure but agreed in a separate accord to initiate talks toward an overhaul of its asylum policies. Mexican officials later said they didn\u2019t believe such measures would ultimately be necessary because their unprecedented crackdown would achieve the results the Trump administration was seeking.\n\nTrump has not tweeted about Mexico\u2019s migration efforts in recent weeks, nor given any indication about whether he planned to insist on that part of the agreement or resume his tariff threat. Homeland Security officials declined to say if the administration plans to renew the threat.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade dispute with China and the administration\u2019s worries about a weakening U.S. economy could make it more difficult for the White House to wield tariffs, especially because the damage would impact major U.S. companies who have manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico.\n\nEbrard and L\u00f3pez Obrador told reporters Friday that Mexico had accomplished what the Trump administration had asked.\n\n\u201cThis reduction of 56 percent in the flow of migrants is a result of diverse measures that the government has taken, in compliance with the Mexican migration law,\u201d Ebrard said, citing data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \u201cI don\u2019t expect there to be a tariff threat on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nEbrard dismissed the idea that Mexico would implement a safe third country agreement at the White House\u2019s request. Leaders of Mexico\u2019s Senate, which would have to ratify such a deal, have signaled that they would not approve it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if they will try to broach that idea at our meeting, but we already have an answer,\u201d Ebrard said, referring to U.S. officials. He added that such a deal \u201cis not in Mexico\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe told them that there is a Mexican strategy that can produce results,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we showed is that we were right.\u201d\n\nMexico has deployed more than 25,000 members of its newly formed national guard to help interdict migrants, mostly along the country\u2019s southern and northern borders, Ebrard said.\n\nMigrant advocates say Mexican officials have done little to provide for asylum seekers sent by U.S. officials to wait for their court dates in northern Mexico, under the Migrant Protection Protocols policy, also known as \u201cRemain in Mexico.\u201d\n\nIn the state of Tamaulipas, in the northeastern corner of Mexico, returned asylum seekers are regularly kidnapped and extorted. The state and federal government have argued over who should bear responsibility for the migrants, and neither has made a serious attempt to provide protection, shelter or food, according to migrant advocates.\n\n[When they filed their asylum claim, they were told to wait in Mexico. There, they say, they were kidnapped.]\n\nHomeland Security officials want to continue aggressively expanding the MPP program in Tamaulipas and the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest place along the border for illegal crossings, viewing it as a major deterrent.\n\nAsked for more evidence that Mexican enforcement is waning, DHS officials said they base that view on the fact that while overall migration numbers have fallen, Mexico is apprehending a decreasing percentage of those heading north than they were in June.\n\nDHS officials said they are also concerned by a rebound in the number of mass border crossings by large groups of families.\n\nThe arrival of a single group of 1,036 migrants in the El Paso area on May 30 \u2014 the largest ever of its kind \u2014 was the incident that led Trump to erupt at Mexico in the first place.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they have had 20 large groups of 100 or more arrive since the June 7 agreement with Mexico, some with more than 200 adults and children.\n\n\u201cLarge groups are the easiest for Mexico to deal with, so the fact that they\u2019re missing large groups of over 200 people symbolizes the challenges they\u2019re facing,\u201d said the DHS official, calling it a sign that Mexico was taking its foot off the gas.\n\nConditions at U.S. border facilities have improved substantially since May, when holding cells were badly overcrowded and thousands of underage migrants were held in squalid conditions.\n\nAt one point, border agents had more than 2,800 children in custody, many for far longer than the 72-hour period mandated for their transfer to shelters. But as of Thursday morning, the Border Patrol had 110 children in its custody across the entire southern border, DHS officials said, and the average amount of time in custody has fallen to 22 hours.\n\nThe officials said they still consider the border to be in a \u201ccrisis\u201d state nonetheless, because the overall volume of people crossing into the United States remains so much higher relative to previous years. Overall, U.S. authorities remain on pace to make nearly 1 million arrests during the 2019 fiscal year ending Sept. 30, the highest total in at least a decade and almost double the amount taken into custody in 2018.\n\nSieff reported from Mexico City.", "description": "Since a June 7 accord with Mexico, U.S. border arrests have been cut in half.
