That would be the third rate cut in successive meetings.\n\nOne of the only outliers to this consensus is Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nTechnically, Swonk is of the opinion that the Fed\u2019s decision to cut or pause at the October meeting is a 50-50 proposition, but she\u2019s clear as to what she believes the central bank should be doing. \u201cI think they should pause,\u201d Swonk said in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nShe noted that a decision on Brexit doesn\u2019t look imminent and that there is a quasi-truce in the U.S.-China trade war. So, in her view, it is a good time for the Fed to pause and wait and see if the two rate cuts to date have had any positive effect. \u201cYou take your time when you can,\u201d Swonk said.\n\nThe mainstream view is that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter-point to a range of 1.5%-1.75%.\n\nOne critical factor persuading Fed watchers that a rate cut is in the works is that the markets expect the Fed to ease, and that the recent easing has improved financial conditions and helped the economy.\n\nSo most economists see it as important that the Fed follow through with a rate cut to maintain current financial conditions.\n\nEconomists have observed that Fed officials have had many chances to \u201cpush back\u201d on the market\u2019s view, and they have not done so. \u201cThe Fed could have gently steered the market in a different direction,\u201d said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets.\n\nNow, if the Fed were to decide at this week\u2019s meeting to hold rates steady, this will send a \u201cshock wave\u201d through financial markets, Shenfeld added.\n\nSwonk doesn\u2019t think so, she said. She noted that the market expects one cut by the end of the year, and so a nonmove wouldn\u2019t be so disruptive.\n\nFed policy makers, she said, opted not to push back on the market expectations because \u201cthey didn\u2019t know what the news flow was going to bring them.\u201d\n\nFed officials have played their cards notably close to their vests over the past six weeks.\n\nOur latest roundup of the best in Fed speak shows key central bankers really didn't want to tip their views about the October FOMC. https://t.co/ceGBYpXdXf \u2014 Michael S. Derby (@michaelsderby) October 23, 2019\n\nMany who expect a rate cut a week from now think it will be a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d meaning the Fed statement accompanying the decision will signal a pause after the move.\n\nTo Swonk, this would be counterproductive. \u201cThat\u2019s bad communication. It would not be communicating reality or intention,\u201d she said, noting that the Fed needs to maintain an option to cut further. So it is a better idea to pause now and leave the door open for later in the year, she argued.\n\nSwonk is not a newcomer to the Fed beat. She\u2019s been watching the Fed since the mid-1980s and is a former president of the National Association for Business Economics.\n\nSwonk predicted three dissents if the Fed cuts rates next week, with Chicago Fed President Charles Evans joining Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, both of whom voted against the first two rate cuts of the cycle.\n\nStocks have been rising ever since the Fed reversed course late last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07% is up 24% from its 52-week low hit Dec. 24. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% hit a record high on Monday and is up almost 30% since late December.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.81% is down 1.379 percentage points from its 52-week high hit last November.", "description": "Almost all economists think the Fed will cut interest rates on Oct. 30.
