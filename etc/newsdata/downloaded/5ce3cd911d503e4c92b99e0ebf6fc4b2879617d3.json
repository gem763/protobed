Some folks think the best season for travel is about to arrive.\n\nWe've done our homework to come up with 10 of the best places to go in the fall of 2019 and what to do there when you arrive at your autumn destinations\n\nMunich, Germany: Oktoberfest\n\nMuch copied but never bettered, the original Munich Oktoberfest runs from September 21 to October 6, 2019, and will welcome millions of beer chuggers from around the world.\n\nIt's the world's largest folk festival -- you can tell by all the tourists in dirndls and lederhosen. The fancy clothes get them in the mood to consume millions of liters of beer and tons of pretzels and wurst.\n\nFestival organizers say it's much better to take public transportation to the grounds than a car.\n\nBritish Columbia, Canada: Grizzly bear viewing\n\nGrizzly bears are active in British Columbia in the fall. Jorge Esquivel\n\nFor most of the year, North American brown bears (aka grizzly bears) are shy around humans and can be tricky to spot.\n\nIn British Columbia, that changes in autumn when the majestic masters of the forest food chain descend on rivers and streams to gorge on spawning salmon.\n\nFrom late August until early October, we know of few better places to see this annual feed -- and get closeup views of grizzlies -- than Bear Camp , where migratory bears join a large resident population in reliable masses.\n\nLocated on the Chilko River in central BC, the secluded tented camp built around an authentic 1950s fishing lodge offers rustic luxury along with world-class bear viewing.\n\nROAM (Bear Camp), Nelson, British Columbia; +1 888 639 1114\n\nRelated content 25 of the most beautiful places around the world\n\nThe Caribbean's ABCs: Shoulder season getaways\n\nThe Caribbean's sandy beaches and clear, blue waters can make other islands look almost dreary in comparison.\n\nIn fall, they're less crowded than in winter high season and hotel rates are considerably lower (with an exception around Thanksgiving).\n\nThis comes with a caution: Hurricane season coincides with this slower time in the Caribbean. You should purchase travel insurance and watch the weather reports, especially for places such as the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Turks and Caicos, among others. But minus a major storm, you'll likely find fall a superb time to be here.\n\nThe ABC islands -- Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao -- are close to South America and are on the fringe or outside of what's considered the hurricane belt.\n\nAruba has a dry climate and gentle surf. Bonaire is acclaimed for its snorkeling and diving. And Cura\u00e7ao has a laid-back atmosphere and flavorful cuisine. All were colonized by the Dutch.\n\nRelated content How to have the time of your life in Cura\u00e7ao\n\nMoscow, Russia: Leaf-viewing\n\nMoscow, Russia, is awash in golden leaves during fall. DMITRY KOSTYUKOV/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNo country has a patent on trees filled with russet, scarlet and golden leaves. New England in the USA and Japan, including Tokyo , remain heavy hitters in the leaf-viewing game. We also love Douro Valley in northern Portugal, where you can take in the view from a river cruise, explore wine-making villages and try a glass of local port wine.\n\nBut consider a trip to Moscow, which has some unexpectedly fine spots for autumn hues. A number of former royal estates have been converted into grand public parks.\n\nOnce owned by Catherine the Great, Tsaritsyno Park has superb colors. Kolomenskoye, a 390-hectare estate on the banks of the Moskva River, is another photogenic spot.\n\nKolomenskoye , Andropova Ave, 39, Moskva, Russia, 115487; +7 499 782-89-17\n\nChile: Catch the end of ski season\n\nRemember, the seasons are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere. So in Chile, they're heading into the tail end of ski season as the September equinox brings spring. That means travel bargains.\n\nAt Portillo resort in the Chilean Andes, many September low-season, all-inclusive rates may dip by thousands of dollars per person per week from high season rates.\n\nShorter three- or four-night stays are also available late in the season.\n\nSki Portillo : Renato S\u00e1nchez 4270, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile; +56 2 2263 0606\n\nIndia: Diwali Festival of Light\n\nDiwali is the Hindu festival of lights. It's India's biggest and most spectacular festival, with millions attending firework displays, prayer and celebratory events.\n\nFor 2019, the main action falls on Sunday, October 27, though festivities extend over several days.\n\nIn Varanasi, incredible fireworks displays explode over the Ganges. In the \"pink city\" of Jaipur in Rajasthan, there are illuminated markets to explore. In Goa, they burn effigies of the demon Narakasura, with competitions to see who can build the most terrifying one.\n\nMalawi: Lake of Stars music festival\n\nInside Africa explores Lake Malawi which is home many species of fish found nowhere else in the world.\n\nPartly inspired by the Glastonbury Festival, Malawi's Lake of Stars may lack the big names of the UK's annual music bash, but it also lacks the mud.\n\nIn a decade, LoS went from a low-key dance party on the shores of Lake Malawi to become one of Africa's hottest music events.\n\nRunning September 27-29, 2019, the party typically has an eclectic lineup. DJs are the lifeblood of Lake of Stars, but the real headliner is the location, a palm-fringed shoreline under hot starry skies.\n\nRelated content 5 reasons to put Malawi on your Africa travel list\n\nUnited States: Football tailgating\n\nWhere else is it acceptable to hang around a parking lot shirtless at 9 in the morning drinking beer and shouting abuse at random strangers the color of whose sweatshirts you don't happen to approve of?\n\nOK, there's more to tailgating than raucous revelry and engaging rival fans. Most tailgate events are, in fact, like big convivial communal picnics. But there's no doubt that the autumn kickoff of football season across America unleashes the nation's tribal party instincts.\n\nThey typically take place on any given Saturday in parking lots outside college football stadiums and on Sundays at pro stadiums. No admission required.\n\nYou don't even have to attend the actual games to enjoy the spirit. A tiny sampling of college and pro games for 2019 to consider:\n\n-- September 21: Georgia Bulldogs vs. Notre Dame Fighting Irish; Sanford Stadium, Athens, Georgia\n\n-- September 29: Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots; New Era Field, Orchard Park, New York\n\n-- October 12: Clemson Tigers vs. Florida State Seminoles; Memorial Stadium (\"Death Valley\"); Clemson, South Carolina\n\n-- October 20: Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings; U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis\n\n-- November 2: USC Trojans vs. Oregon Ducks; LA Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles\n\n-- November 10: New Orleans Saints vs. Atlanta Falcons; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans\n\nRelated content 22 of the best places to visit in the United States\n\nCayman Islands: Pirates Week Festival\n\nTomeka Jones explores a beach getaway full of food, fun and adventure in the Cayman Islands.\n\nLive music, street dances, sporting events, fireworks -- and best of all, mock pirate invasions! What's not to love?\n\nThe beautiful Cayman Islands, south of Cuba and west of Jamaica, are probably best known as an offshore financial haven and a glorious place for snorkeling. But these three autonomous British islands tap into their colorful history in November with all things pirate.\n\nPirates Week Festival : November 1-3 at Cayman Brac, November 7-11 at Grand Cayman and November 15-17 at Little Cayman.\n\nRelated content The Caribbean: Beautiful beaches and more\n\nMelbourne, Australia: Horse racing\n\nMelbourne is a standard entry on \"most livable city\" lists, and its culture and entertainment scene is one of the reasons why people like to be there.\n\nOne of the biggest events in the city happens in their spring (and the Northern Hemisphere's fall). It's the Melbourne Cup, the most prestigious horse race in Australia. It's held the first Tuesday of November (in 2019, that's November 5).\n\nBut even if you miss the actual race, you can enjoy all the hoopla, parties and fashions in the days surrounding it.", "description": "From leaf-viewing in Moscow to a \"pirate invasion\" in the Cayman Islands, here are 10 fantastic places to visit in the fall of 2019 and some special events to enjoy while you're there.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F150831152738-fall-travel-11-moscow-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
