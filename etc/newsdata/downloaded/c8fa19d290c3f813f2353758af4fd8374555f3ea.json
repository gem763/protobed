Ad Policy\n\nThere is no doubt that Donald Trump would like to exact political revenge on those behind the Russia probe, and it is fair to be skeptical of his Department of Justice. But it would be a mistake to reflexively dismiss the inquiry, which is led by US Attorney John Durham and overseen by Attorney General William Barr. The public deserves an accounting of what occurred. And given the intrusion of the nation\u2019s intelligence\u2019s services into domestic politics, a failure to learn lessons and enact safeguards could leave future candidates, especially on the left, vulnerable to similar investigations.\n\nFor more than two years, the FBI investigated a presidential campaign and then sitting president as a conspirator or agent of Russia. The story engulfed US media and political energy and had major consequences on domestic US politics and foreign relations. The probe found not only no Trump-Russia conspiracy, but barely even any contact between the two sides suspected of conspiring. Carrying a Russian passport (as the Russians in the Trump Tower meeting did), or falsely suggesting in an e-mail that you are acting at the Kremlin\u2019s behest (as the British music publicist who arranged that meeting did), does not mean that you are actually working with the Russian government. Mueller, ultimately, showed no evidence that they\u2014or any other suspected Kremlin intermediary\u2014were Kremlin intermediaries. This helps explain why, as the report found, Kremlin officials trying to reach out to the Trump campaign after its election victory \u201cappeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with senior officials around the President-Elect.\u201d MORE FROM Aaron Mat\u00e9 Ukrainegate Risks Handing Trump Another Gift October 18, 2019 The Ukraine Scandal Might Be a Bad Gambit for Democrats September 30, 2019 These Questions for Mueller Show Why Russiagate Was Never the Answer July 23, 2019 Author page\n\nAnd even with this all-consuming investigation now over, we still do not have a firm understanding of how it began. We are told that the FBI launched the probe after receiving a tip that a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos, may have been given advance notice by a mysterious professor, Joseph Mifsud, that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Former FBI director James Comey has declared that Mifsud is \u201ca Russian agent.\u201d But Mueller, conspicuously, never applied that label to Mifsud. Even more conspicuously, Mueller failed to indict him on any charges, despite claiming that Mifsud lied to FBI agents when they interviewed him in February 2017. Compounding the mystery, Barr and Durham reportedly obtained Mifsud\u2019s cell phones during a recent trip to Italy, where he went missing in November 2017. In court filings, attorneys for Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, are now contending that Mifsud is a Western intelligence asset involved in a scheme to frame Flynn and the Trump campaign by association.\n\nAs the journalist T.A. Frank notes in Vanity Fair, there are strong reasons to doubt the theory that Mifsud was involved in an effort to set up the Trump campaign. But the presence of one potentially false conspiracy theory does not negate the fact that Mifsud helped trigger the certifiably false conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government. It would be most welcome to find out exactly how that occurred.\n\nIt is also important to find out the extent to which the FBI relied on the Steele dossier. We have yet to receive a credible explanation for why intelligence officials thought it was appropriate to take cues from an unverified collection of lurid conspiracy theories about Trump\u2014all paid for by his political opponent. What has already been revealed is damning enough. The FBI cited the Steele dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016, telling the court that it \u201cbelieves that [Russia\u2019s] efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with,\u201d the Trump campaign. Its source for that wild supposition was Steele, whom it described as \u201cSource #1\u201d & \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nThen there is the role of the CIA under John Brennan. Multiple news reports make clear that the CIA is a principal focus of Barr and Durham\u2019s inquiry. In breaking the story of the expanded criminal inquiry, The New York Times includes the curious claim that Durham has asked interview subjects \u201cwhether C.I.A. officials might have somehow tricked the F.B.I. into opening the Russia investigation.\u201d Current Issue View our current issue\n\nAlthough there are limitations on how much we can make of one sentence, that is a tantalizing clue pointing to Brennan. The former CIA director has taken credit for launching the Russia investigation, telling Congress in May 2017 that his own \u201cconcerns\u201d about \u201ccontacts between Russian officials and US persons\u201d associated with the Trump campaign \u201cserved as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion-cooperation occurred.\u201d The Barr-Durham inquiry will hopefully uncover what exactly Brennan\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d were.\n\nBrennan\u2019s role should be scrutinized because he not only said he helped initiate the Trump-Russia probe but because he managed the US intelligence response to alleged Russian interference. It was Brennan who personally delivered to the White House a top-secret envelope containing the claims of a Kremlin mole that Vladimir Putin had personally ordered an interference operation to install Trump. And amazingly, we have recently learned not only the mole\u2019s identity but the curious circumstances of his exit from Russia. The mole, a mid-level Kremlin official named Oleg Smolenkov, initially refused CIA efforts to remove him, prompting concerns in Langley about his trustworthiness, and that he was possibly a double agent. Reporting from The New York Times makes clear that he left Russia only after leaks about a Kremlin mole began appearing in US media.\n\nAfter his outing, journalists found Smolenkov living in the Virginia suburbs under his own name. All of this makes for a curious profile for someone who had supposedly revealed what The Washington Post dubbed \u201cthe crime of the century.\u201d\n\nIn addition to helping trigger the Russia probe and overseeing the intelligence response, Brennan oversaw the hasty production of the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) that purportedly validated it. By claiming that Putin ordered an influence campaign to elect him, the January 2017 ICA helped cast a criminal shadow over Trump\u2019s presidency just days before he took office. A series of unsubstantiated leaks from anonymous officials\u2014about Flynn, about the Steele dossier, and about fictitious or overblown Trump-Russia contacts\u2014continued that pattern as the Mueller investigation dragged on. Perhaps the most extraordinary example came in February 2017, when The New York Times reported that the US investigators had obtained \u201cphone records and intercepted calls\u201d showing that members of Trump\u2019s campaign and other associates \u201chad repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.\u201d Four months later, FBI Jim Comey testified that this was \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nIf the FBI had investigated President Barack Obama for more than two years on the false allegation of conspiring with or being an agent of a foreign power, Democratic leaders would rightfully demand a full inquiry. It would set a dangerous precedent for liberals to now reject an effort to get answers only because those answers would not be politically expedient. If left unchecked now, the same intelligence services that involved themselves in domestic politics in 2016 could do so again against progressive candidates on similarly spurious grounds.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that under Trump, Democratic leaders and intelligence officials used the Russia investigation as a political weapon against his presidency. Now that it has proven baseless, Trump and his supporters have legitimate grounds to uncover how it began. The fact that Trump will use Russiagate\u2019s failure as a political weapon is exactly why us skeptics on the left warned that its evidentiary holes would help him. Rather than complaining, those who brought us Russiagate should accept responsibility for handing Trump that opportunity, and work to ensure that the national security state does not receive opportunities to intrude again.", "description": "There are legitimate grounds to probe the intelligence officials behind the all-consuming Trump-Russia affair.", "authors": ["Aaron Mat\u00e9", "October", "September", "July", "Our Readers", "Peter Kuper", "Elias Rodriques", "Daniel Immerwahr", "Adom Getachew", "The Nation"], "top_image": "https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-barr-ukraine-ap-img.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
