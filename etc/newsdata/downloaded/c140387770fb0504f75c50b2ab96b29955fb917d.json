It felt like I was living a nightmare.\"\n\nThe couple rushed to the hospital who sent Nohely for an emergency caesarean section.\n\nBut the situation had become so desperate that surgeons were unable to wait for the anaesthetic to kick in.\n\nNohely said: \"I felt three slashes across my stomach.\n\n\"It was the worst physical pain I've ever felt. Thankfully, then everything went black.\"\n\nKevin added: \"They wouldn't let me in during the procedure.\n\n\"I had no idea what was happening, I just desperately wanted to see my wife and baby.\"\n\n(Image: Kevin Mota / Mercury Press)\n\nAfter 30 minutes, a nurse approached Kevin and told him that the baby had been delivered but had to be taken away to a specialised unit.\n\nAfter another half an hour, Kevin was given the devastating news that their baby hadn't made it - but his wife was still unconscious from the anaesthetic.\n\nKevin said: \"I was wracked with grief and I never felt more alone than in that moment.\n\n\"Nohely was still unconscious, so there was no-one there to share my pain.\n\n\"All I could think about in that moment was finding out my baby's gender.\"\n\nKevin was eventually allowed in to see the baby, where he learned that they'd had a little girl.\n\nWhen Nohely came around, the pair were given time alone with their daughter, who they named Leylah, and were able to pose for some poignant shots to remember her by.\n\n(Image: Kevin Mota / Mercury Press)\n\nNohely said: \"That was the hardest thing, seeing our little girl in front of us but knowing she had gone.\n\n\"There was a point where we had to hand her back over.\n\n\"It was horrendous saying goodbye. I'll never forget the grief.\"\n\nDespite pushing for answers, the couple claim no doctors have been able to tell them why Nohely went into early labour.\n\nBut they hope their YouTube videos - which also document their daily life as a couple - will raise awareness and help them heal.\n\nTheir channel features emotional clips detailing Nohely's pregnancy and the couple's devastating loss.\n\nKevin said: \"I wouldn't wish this upon anyone. It's the worst pain imaginable.\n\n\"But we've received so many messages of support and from people who have been through the same thing.\n\n\"That makes it all worth it.\"", "description": "WARNING: UPSETTING CONTENT Nohely and Kevin Mota felt like they were in a \"living nightmare\" after the mum-to-be felt a lump and realised it was their daughter's limb hanging down", "authors": ["Sian Bradley", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Kevin Mota", "Mercury Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543029.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-PHOTOSHOOT-WITH-BABY-AFTER-STILLBIRTH1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
