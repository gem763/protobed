While you daydream about that \u201csomeday,\u201d it can be easy to get caught up in the present, with career, family and your current bills needing attention now.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nOftentimes, retirement doesn\u2019t get much thought. But it really should.\n\nWith time on your side, there are numerous little things you can do today to help ensure you get the most out of retirement later.\n\nDevelop a written financial plan\n\nRather than waiting until the 11th hour to find out if you\u2019ve saved enough to enjoy the type of retirement you\u2019ve been dreaming of, why not start the plan early, even simply, and make some assumptions about what you can afford to save and what you think you\u2019ll need for future living expenses?\n\nFor a young professional just starting in the workforce, this plan may be a simple spreadsheet that totals how much to save in a workplace 401(k) plan each year to take advantage of a company match opportunity.\n\nFor savers further along in their careers or for those who might have families, added expenses like a recent home purchase, school and college costs, car replacements or insurance payments become additional details of the planning process. Rather than naively assuming \u201cI\u2019ll pay for those things out of cash flow,\u201d advanced planning can help inform wise decision-making around these eventualities.\n\nInvest early and regularly\n\nThere always seems to be a reason why the present is not ideal to begin investing. Whether your excuse may be \u201cOnce I\u2019ve built up a reserve,\u201d or \u201cAs soon as I pay off my credit card,\u201d or \u201cOnce the kids are out of high school,\u201d it can always be easy to find a delay.\n\nHowever, the reason \u201cearly and regularly\u201d is typically best (even with a relatively small amount of savings), is due to the power of compound interest, or what Albert Einstein called \u201cthe 8th wonder of the world.\u201d\n\nCompound interest is simply the process by which savings grows over time because of the interest earned upon interest. This \u201ccompounding\u201d effect is a powerful tool which multiplies savings dramatically.\n\nUsing a basic online compound interest calculator can easily illustrate that saving diligently for even a few years early on and stopping (but letting it continue to compound) can still result in a larger pool of future savings than waiting to begin saving and trying to catch up later by saving twice the amount for a longer period of time.\n\nThe biggest key to harnessing the power of compound interest is starting early.\n\nConsolidate and pay down debt\n\nActively pursuing a debt reduction plan during your working years can result in tremendous financial relief during retirement.\n\nUnderstandably, for many working families, debts mount over time as the timing of important payments can require borrowing. Rather than entering retirement with a mountain of debt, you can begin a process to systematically consolidate, pay off and reduce these debts before a final paycheck.\n\nProtect while you can and it\u2019s less expensive\n\nProtecting your assets such as your health and your hard-earned savings is an important and yet often overlooked step to a happy and less stressful retirement.\n\nFor example, obtaining insurance when you\u2019re young and healthy can provide excellent coverage at advantageous rates, which may not be possible later in life. Also, optimizing your \u201cpersonal lines\u201d of insurance coverage for things like your home and automobiles can protect against unexpected and costly surprises later.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFurther, ensuring that financial accounts are properly titled in the optimal savings instruments (for example, a Trust, IRA or charitable lead trust) can add additional protections and peace of mind during the golden years.\n\nAndrew E.
