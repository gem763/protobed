Those living in more deprived areas were also more likely to be diagnosed with depression.\n\nThe researchers also found that at both time points most people with case-level depression were not on antidepressants, and most of those on antidepressants did not actually have depression.\n\nLead author Prof Antony Arthur commented on the findings saying, \"Between two comparable samples interviewed 20 years apart (1990-93 and 2008-11) we found little change in the prevalence of depression, but the proportion of participants taking antidepressants rose from 4 percent to almost 11 percent. This could be due to improved recognition and treatment of depression, overprescribing, or use of antidepressants for other conditions.\"\n\n\"Whatever the explanation, substantial increases in prescribing has not reduced the prevalence of depression in the over-65 population. The causes of depression in older people, the factors that perpetuate it, and the best ways to manage it remain poorly understood and merit more attention.\"", "description": "New UK research has found that the number of older adults taking antidepressants has more than doubled in the last two decades, although there has been little change in the number of people diagnosed with the condition.
