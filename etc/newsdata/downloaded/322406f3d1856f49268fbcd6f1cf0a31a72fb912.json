It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll see some of the best deals on popular tech products happen in the next few weeks. And judging by a few of today\u2019s deals, that\u2019s already happening a little bit.\n\nVizio\u2019s high-end 46-inch 5.1.4 home theater system is $200 off of its usual price at Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. $799 might be more than what you were considering to spend on speakers for your living room, but there\u2019s one big reason why it might be worth it: they support Dolby Atmos.\n\nBoth the soundbar and the satellite speakers have forward- and upward-firing speakers to give a more cinematic, immersive sound experience. Breaking down the \u201c5.1.4,\u201d this home theater system is comprised of five forward-firing speakers (three in the soundbar, two behind you) one wireless subwoofer, and four height channels created by upward-firing speakers bouncing off of your ceiling.\n\nI tested out the much smaller (and cheaper) Vizio 36-inch 5.1.2 Atmos-ready soundbar when the Apple TV 4K gained Dolby Atmos support. The effect is impressive, even with this smaller soundbar, but if you have a massive TV, you\u2019re probably going to want the bigger, more capable home theater system that best matches it.\n\nApple\u2019s second-generation AirPods are a little cheaper than usual at several retailers. The model that ships with the standard non-wireless charging case costs $144 instead of $159. You can snag these at a discount from Best Buy, Target, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nThe more expensive option that ships with the wireless charging case usually costs $199, but you can currently find them for $30 off, costing $169 at Amazon. At Best Buy and Target, they\u2019re $179.\n\namFilm\u2019s tempered glass screen protectors for the Nintendo Switch Lite come in a three-pack for $5 (usually $8.99). I highly suggest investing in these if you want to keep your display looking pristine. I\u2019ve had a good experience covering both my Switch and Pixel 3 with amFilm\u2019s glass. The kit includes all of the tools you need to easily install them, and it\u2019s great to have a two left over in case one gets damaged.\n\nA callback to yesterday\u2019s best deals\n\nA few deals from yesterday are still happening, so we\u2019re going to share them here again in case you missed out.\n\nAmazon is still offering a great $50 discount on the Beats Powerbeats Pro truly wireless headphones. These are our top pick if you\u2019re looking for a set of wireless headphones that are comfortable, sound good, and have excellent battery life. It\u2019s tough to find a set that can manage to do all three, but Beats have come the closest so far. They\u2019re $199.95 at Amazon and are available in all four colors (navy, ivory, black, moss).\n\nRelated The best wireless earbuds to buy in 2019\n\nAstral Chain, the excellent action-adventure game from Platinum Games on the Nintendo Switch, is $49.99 at Rakuten right now with the offer code SAVE15 used at checkout. This is the first discount that we\u2019ve seen on the title, so if you\u2019ve been waiting to jump in, now might be a good time to do it.", "description": "As we near Black Friday 2019, today\u2019s best deals include $200 off of Vizio\u2019s 46-inch Dolby Atmos home theater system, and up to $30 off of the second-generation Apple AirPods.
