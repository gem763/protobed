Today, the Washington Post published an \u2018analysis\u2019 piece at The Fix which basically reaches the same conclusion.\n\nDepending on whom you ask, on Thursday morning, the House Judiciary Committee will vote on procedures to investigate whether to open an impeachment inquiry or to continue an already opened impeachment inquiry. Or maybe there is no inquiry at all. At this point, it\u2019s hard to say, in part because House Democrats offer different, often-strained answers to a straightforward question: Has the House begun an impeachment investigation of President Trump?\u2026 Debating where impeachment stands is confusing and jargon-heavy. But Democrats\u2019 semantic contortions this week are significant. They suggest a nonexistent or confusing messaging strategy on impeachment, which is the most serious investigation the House can consider\u2026 Fourteen months before the 2020 presidential election, Democratic leadership does not have its impeachment messaging straight.\n\nAfter two years of flogging the collusion narrative without any evidence, I\u2019m shocked, shocked to learn that Democrats aren\u2019t taking impeachment very seriously. The Post also points out that Majority Leader Hoyer, who ought to know what\u2019s going on, told a NY Times reporter no impeachment inquiry was currently underway, contrary to the claims made by Rep. Jerry Nadler.\n\nHere is the complete transcript of my question to Mr. Hoyer about whether he thinks an impeachment inquiry is currently underway. pic.twitter.com/uCw6gebAqr \u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) September 11, 2019\n\nFinally, a clear answer! Maybe the Democratic leadership does have a handle on this after all.\n\nBut no, not really.\n\nTwo hours after giving this answer, Leader Hoyer walked it back saying \u201cI thought the question was in regards to whether the full House is actively considering articles of impeachment, which we are not at this time.\u201d In other words, the Majority Leader was confused. But he added that he fully supports whatever it is that Rep. Nadler is doing.\n\nAs I mentioned yesterday, there\u2019s a very good reason why this clown show is so disorganized. Democrats are trying to satisfy the base\u2019s lust for blood without alerting the majority of Americans, who polls consistently show do not support of impeachment, what they are doing. So you have the members in safe blue districts able to say they are already impeaching Trump while the members from red and purple districts can still claim it\u2019s just an investigation into the possibility of an eventual impeachment vote.\n\nI don\u2019t see how this is going to work for another six months. Either they go for it and hope the country will feel differently after many more hours of heated talk on CNN and MSNBC, or they drop it. It almost feels like they\u2019re waiting to see who looks most likely to win the nomination. If it\u2019s Sanders then you almost have to go all in. But if it\u2019s Biden, then maybe that\u2019s a signal voters are looking a more moderate approach. But for now, the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort is all things to all people.", "description": "\"...Democratic leadership does not have its impeachment messaging straight.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Steny-Hoyer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
