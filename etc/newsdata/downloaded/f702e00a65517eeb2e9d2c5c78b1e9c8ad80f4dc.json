Did it go well? No. No it did not. Not at all,\u201d the actor sarcastically wrote, attaching a picture of what appears to be a heavily burnt bagel.\n\n\u201cTo quote Rocky Balboa, \u2018It\u2019s not how many times you get knocked down, it\u2019s how many times you get up... and keep moving forward,\u2019\u201d Pratt continued, saying that the bagel \u201cnever stood a chance\u201d against his spouse.\n\nI honestly simply cannot imagine what went wrong here. Pretty simple. Microwave. 2 minutes. Maybe she thought it said 2 hours. But I want to commend her for her effort. This is a big step babe. Proud of you.\n\nSchwarzenegger apparently had a good laugh as well. \u201cLooks like my plan to just have you do the cooking is working out very well,\u201d she wrote playfully in a comment to her husband\u2019s post. Her brother Patrick joined in the fun with \u201cSmh\u201d (\u2018shaking my head\u2019). Actress Yvonne Strahovski and Pratt\u2019s co-star Karen Gillan reacted to the whole thing by posting smiley faces.\n\nAlso on rt.com Misogynist museums? New study says galleries are lacking in female animal exhibits\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, even \u2018woke\u2019 news outlets like BuzzFeed and HuffPost did not think Pratt\u2019s attitude was somehow problematic. The reporter for the former admitted to \u201chonestly cackling\u201d while reading the actor\u2019s post, while the latter threw in a pun about Pratt \u201croasting\u201d his wife.\n\nBut then some in the online crowd showed up to label Pratt as a sexist. \u201cLadies, this is the kind of posts that happen when you marry a misogynist,\u201d one person wrote. \u201c@prattprattpratt May hide it pretty well, but the misogyny rings loud and clear through the sarcasm... may think you\u2019re trying to be funny at her expense. Real comedy is not made at the expense of others.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden Anna Feris feels much better about not being with Chris Pratt. \u2014 Andrew \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 (@A_J_McLaren) October 20, 2019\n\nGod I used to like him...what happened?? \u2014 Mare (@marelette) October 21, 2019\n\nOthers quickly accused the actor of being \u201ccondescending\u201d to his wife and said that by poking fun at her cooking Pratt tried to \u201cpublicly shame\u201d his spouse.\n\nSome angry commenters went further, suggesting that the actor should cook his own food instead of complaining. \u201cMake your own damn bagel bites, @prattprattpratt. You\u2019re 40,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nMake your own damn bagel bites, @prattprattpratt. You\u2019re 40. \u2014 TierneyM (@TierneyM17) October 20, 2019\n\nWell that\u2019s exactly what Katherine Schwarzenegger said her plan was from the start, didn\u2019t she?\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
