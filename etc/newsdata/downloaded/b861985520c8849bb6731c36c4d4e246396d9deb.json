The message from the GOP is clear to this and any other whistleblower who might ever threaten a Republican president: Cross our Dear Leader, and we will destroy you. Such is the patriotism of a party that is now nothing more than a seedy cult of personality. Even Sen. Mitt Romney \u2014 not exactly a tower of courage himself these days \u2014 said recently about the Republicans trying to avert their eyes from Trump\u2019s misdeeds: \u201cI think it\u2019s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that\u2019s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s apologists will wave away his comments (including his reference to journalists as \u201cscum\u201d) as just another meaningless example of the president\u2019s swaggering New York style of verbal venting. It might be acceptable for a rich kid from Queens to talk like a sociopathic mobster or beetle-browed junta enforcer when he\u2019s trying to bully the local stonemasons and carpenters on his latest slapdash condo project, but it is utterly unacceptable in a president of the United States. The House Judiciary Committee should add this threat against a CIA officer to its list of impeachable offenses.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tom Nichols", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Trump-Ukraine-Scandal-President-Impeachment-Whistleblower-Cia-Officer-Column"], "top_image": ""}
