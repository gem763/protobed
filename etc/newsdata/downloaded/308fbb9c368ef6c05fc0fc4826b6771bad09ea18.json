I'm not sure that two terms \u2014 it might be irreparable.\u201d\n\nPrior to her announcement last week that the House \u201cis moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,\u201d Pelosi had been criticized by more liberal members of her caucus for refusing to throw her public support behind efforts to remove Trump from office.\n\nThe speaker for months had feared such a maneuver could endanger the swing district seats captured by Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, eventually backfiring on her new House majority and souring Americans on the national party ahead of 2020.\n\nBut in her interview Thursday, Pelosi offered a full-throated defense of the impeachment probe and attempted to counter prominent Republican lines of attack that have emerged in recent days \u2014 including a complaint by GOP lawmakers that she had not formally launched the inquiry with a resolution approved by the full House.\n\nPelosi said that vote could still come before the chamber but is \u201cnot necessary,\u201d adding: \u201cWe feel that we're on very firm ground as we go forward, and we may go to that place \u2026 just because it's a Republican talking point.\u201d\n\nThe speaker even claimed that a final vote to impeach the president at the conclusion of the House's investigative process is not inevitable.\n\n\u201cI don't think so, no. I think that we just go forward and follow the facts. I don't think that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's some people who say, \u2018Why are you calling for an inquiry? You should just call to impeach.\u2019 I don't think that would be fair, and it isn't worthy of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nPelosi also dismissed outrage from the president and his allies over House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s exaggerated rendition of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered at a hearing of his panel last week.\n\n\u201cI want the American people to know what that phone call was about. I want them to hear it,\" Pelosi said. \u201cSo, yeah, it's fair. It's sad, but it\u2019s using the president's own words.\u201d\n\nWhen ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos noted that Schiff\u2019s hyperbolic statement before the committee included remarks not mentioned in the White House\u2019s readout of the call, Pelosi responded: \u201cHe did not make it up.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/59/c7/9a5f6715485a8acceb55af0f0197/191003-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg"}
