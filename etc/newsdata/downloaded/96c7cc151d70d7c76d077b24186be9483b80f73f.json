The company, however, which went public in September, did not make any disclosures regarding raids or investigations in its IPO documents.\n\n\u201cThe Board, its Members, and Tippins have undertaken this campaign in an effort to squelch the competitive threat posed by the business model supported by SmileDirect, and not to protect any legitimate concern about the public health, welfare, and safety of consumers,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nSmileDirect did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The California Dental Board said it does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe suit comes days after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a new law that changes the rules on \u2018teledentistry,\u201d the model used by SmileDirect. The bill includes protections for patients who undergo direct-to-consumer orthodontic treatment, such as that offered by SmileDirect, including a provision that allows them to submit complaints to the Dental Board, even if they have signed nondisclosure agreements.\n\nSee: Charcoal toothpastes are \u2018dangerous,\u2019 don\u2019t whiten and may cause decay\n\nThose protections were included after opposition to SmileDirect from dentists and orthodontists, who have been critical of the company\u2019s business model. SmileDirect offers clear aligners by mail to customers using either a 3-D image of their teeth taken at a so-called SmileShop or from an impression made using an online kit. The company then develops and ships the clear aligners \u2014 a form of dental braces \u2014 and the customer undergoes a five- to 10-month treatment plan. Dentists say any orthodontic procedure requires a thorough exam because any mistake can cause permanent damage and even break teeth.\n\nSmileDirect has faced strong opposition from medical organizations, including the American Dental Association and the American Association of Orthodontists, which have accused it of endangering patients and practicing medicine illegally.\n\nEarlier this month, short seller Hindenburg Research published a report saying that the company has attracted more than 1,200 Better Business Bureau complaints in its five years of existence and that some of its practices have been deemed illegal by dental boards in Alabama and Georgia.\n\nFor more, read: SmileDirectClub stock falls then recovers after scathing report from short seller\n\nHindenburg founder Nathan Anderson said customers have been forced to perform emergency dentistry on themselves and described an aggressive sales culture that pressures employees to \u201csell a new smile\u201d to at least 70% of clients each month.\n\nSmileDirect responded with a statement criticizing \u201corganized dentistry\u201d and its \u201canti-competitive legal actions.\u201d\n\nThe suit was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Western Division.\n\nSmileDirect shares have struggled since the IPO and are down 50% in the past month, while the S&P 500 has fallen 0.3%. The stock dropped more than 10% in its trading debut and is 61% below its IPO price.\n\nNonetheless, a day after the Hindenburg report, all 10 banks on the IPO issued buy ratings on the stock.\n\nFor more, read: Just one day after a short seller slammed SmileDirectClub, all 10 banks on its IPO rate it a buy\n\nSee now: SmileDirectClub went public: 5 things to know about the teeth-straightening startup", "description": "SmileDirectClub Inc. shares tumbled anew on Thursday, after the company filed a lawsuit against the California Dental Board and individual members, claiming...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP861_smiled_MG_20190821113213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
