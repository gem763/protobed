Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nNow that Nancy Pelosi has set House Democrats firmly and (probably) irreversibly on the road to impeaching Donald Trump, she and they must make the fateful decision about which examples of misconduct to prosecute. As Lawfare observes today, Trump\u2019s behavior \u201cpresents what the military calls a target-rich environment.\u201d Should they go wide and include various high crimes and misdemeanors? Or go narrow and stick to the latest and hottest controversy, i.e., the president\u2019s petitioning a foreign government to help his administration smear a political enemy?\n\nAlready, people are weighing in:\n\nIMO these are the main lessons from Russia for Dems to consider:\n\n\n\n1. Be narrow and specific; focus on Ukraine, not other stuff.\n\n2. Don\u2019t overpromise on details unless you can deliver.\n\n3. Emphasize the threats to election integrity.\n\n4. Stay unified.\n\n5. Work quickly & urgently. \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 24, 2019\n\nAnd from longtime impeachment enthusiast Brian Beutler, this dissent from the idea of single-issue impeachment:\n\nNO NO NO NO WHY WTF?! https://t.co/JyXPJkRsR9 \u2014 Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) September 25, 2019\n\nHe later elaborates:\n\nAll connected investigations will become dead letters the moment the Senate rushes to acquit Trump on narrow articles.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no framework for investigating corruption other than the one Dems just established, so the process must continue until the investigations are done. \u2014 Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) September 25, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a little hard to determine exactly where Pelosi is. Multiple outlets are reporting that she wants the House to narrowly focus on Trump\u2019s Ukraine gambit. Here\u2019s how Politico has heard it:\n\nThe strategy, described by Democratic lawmakers and aides familiar with the talks, would center on streamlining the consideration of articles of impeachment to focus exclusively on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden \u2014 a push they say included an implicit threat to withhold military aid to the eastern European country\u2026.\n\n\u201cThis has clarity and understanding in the eyes of the American people,\u201d Pelosi told her leadership team, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting.\n\nBut then the very next sentence of Pelosi\u2019s quote undermines the idea of staying narrow:\n\n\u201cIf we do articles, then we can include other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cArticles\u201d means \u201carticles of impeachment,\u201d presumably the endgame for House Democrats at this point. So perhaps Pelosi wants to begin with hearings focused on Ukraine, see how it goes, and then consider broadening the scope of impeachment articles before taking the final leap. Nobody really knows at this point.\n\nSome observers emphasize the need for crisp, clear, and above all compelling grounds for impeachment rather than some preset number of items. The above-mentioned Lawfare piece has some dos and don\u2019ts:\n\n[I]t is critically important to be disciplined at this juncture\u2014to base articles of impeachment only on that activity which is not merely a plausible basis for removal but is unambiguously justified as a basis for removal. That means that anything that is a matter of policy\u2014no matter how much one might disagree with the policy or how abhorrent one might find it\u2014should not be included. For example, Congress should strongly resist the temptation to include disputes over border security\u2014including both spending on the wall and the grotesque policy of family separation\u2014in any articles it might draw up.\n\nThe author also thinks that pursuing Trumpian malfeasance before he became president would create an unhelpful side dispute as to whether actions as a private citizen can be impeachable.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the \u201ccrisp and clear\u201d approach requires a narrow scope: Lawfare recommends four major areas of inquiry beyond the Ukraine scandal: (1) obstruction of justice (as shown by Mueller and others); (2) use of law-enforcement resources to attack or punish political opponents; (3) obstruction of lawful congressional investigations and oversight; and, my personal favorite, Trump\u2019s habit of lying:\n\nThe 1974 article of impeachment concerning Nixon\u2019s obstruction of justice also noted his lies to the public about the Watergate investigation: Nixon, the Judiciary Committee charged, made \u201cfalse or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted\u201d on the Watergate matter and that White House and Nixon campaign officials had no involvement in the burglary. Kenneth Starr also suggested an article of impeachment against Clinton for \u201cmis[leading] the American people,\u201d though Congress declined to adopt this article. Trump has rather outdone prior presidents in the lies department. The Washington Post \u201cFact Checker\u201d database of presidential dissembling as of Aug. 5 had documented 12,019 \u201cfalse or misleading statements\u201d by Trump since he took office. The Mueller report documents multiple instances in which the president and administration officials speaking on his behalf knowingly lied to the public. His tenure has genuinely posed the question of whether the president has any obligation at all to tell the truth about anything\u2014ever. His presidency is, among other things, advancing the proposition that the idea of \u201cfaithful\u201d execution of the law implies no duty of candor at all.\n\nSo even if the House impeachment inquiry in its next, more purposeful phase begins with a narrow focus on the latest Trumpian outrage, you have to figure it will eventually broaden to include some of the lowlights of this president\u2019s low behavior \u2014 unless the Ukraine scandal has the kind of yet-to-be-revealed details that will get a majority of the public behind impeachment. Since the odds of the Senate\u2019s actually convicting the president are virtually nil, impeachment might still damage the president\u2019s credibility enough to make his ejection from office by the public very likely.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
