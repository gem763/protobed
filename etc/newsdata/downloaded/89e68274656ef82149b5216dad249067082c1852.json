Around 60 percent village council seats remain vacant due to the boycott by the regional parties.\n\nMost of the 1,065 candidates in the fray have been accommodated in highly guarded hotels in Srinagar, hundreds of kilometers away from the villages from where they are contesting, putting a question mark on the validity of the election process.\n\n\u201cThis is really worth seeing how the democracy of India lives in hotels in Kashmir,\u201d said 30-year-old, Dilshad Ahmad. \u201cThis is a forced election. We don\u2019t know what they plan to do here,\u201d he added.\n\nRead More: Life remains crippled in occupied Kashmir on 81st day\n\nThe ruling Hindu extremist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has abrogated Article 370, is contesting the elections and is hoping for a major win.\n\nGhulam Ahmad Mir, a senior leader of the Indian National Congress from south Kashmir\u2019s Islamabad district, accused the BJP of destroying the territory. He questioned the election process as most party leaders are in jails or under house arrest. \u201cThis election is for the BJP, by the BJP and of the BJP. They (BJP) are forcing themselves on people in Kashmir. There is no democratic way,\u201d he said.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "In occupied Kashmir, India is holding local body elections on Thursday (today) in the territory amid a boycott by most political parties", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kashmir.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
