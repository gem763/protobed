Examination of other evidence was deliberately blocked by Judge Willie Seriti.\"\n\nHe said the Arms Procurement Commission was allocated a budget of R40m, and was charged to complete its work within two years, however, it took more than four years, and spent R137m in public resources.\n\nCommission found no evidence of wrongdoing\n\nHe also claimed that the stagnant economy since 2000 was a consequence of the negative economic impacts of the arms deal and has resulted in dramatic increases in unemployment.\n\nIn April, Zuma announced that the arms deal commission of inquiry had found no evidence of wrongdoing in the deal.\n\nZuma said the commission also found that no evidence was presented before it to suggest that there was any undue influence in the selection of the preferred bidders.\n\nThe commission was appointed by Zuma in 2010 to investigate alleged corruption in the multi-billion-rand arms procurement deal.\n\nThe government acquired, among other hardware, 26 Gripen fighter aircraft and 24 Hawk lead-in fighter trainer aircraft for the air force, as well as frigates and submarines for the navy.\n\n\"The fact that the Gripen aircraft are in storage further substantiates my contention that they and other arms deal acquisitions were not bought for any rational defence needs but, instead, for the bribes that would flow from the offsets,\" read the court papers.\n\n\"The fallacy and 'red herring' of re-equipping the SANDF [South African National Defence Force] to meet its constitutional obligations was invented to divert attention from those realities. Predictably, the offset 'benefits' of R110bn that were the actual rationale for the arms deal did not materialise nor did the jobs.\"", "description": "The arms deal has unleashed a culture of corruption that now threatens the survival of South Africa\u2019s constitutional democracy, activist Terry Crawford-Browne has said in papers to the Constitutional Court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2214/55c6f06820e6417e8d1fd14f4b6cb21a.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-19"}
