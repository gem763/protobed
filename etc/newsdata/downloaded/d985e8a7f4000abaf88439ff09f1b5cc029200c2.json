Umbrellas have been used as shields against dyed water being shot from cannons.\n\nCouriers have warned that \u201ccustomers mailing products have to use their real names\u201d and that \u201cthorough investigation\u201d will be launched if any of the forbidden items are discovered.\n\nA shopper on online retail platform Shopify recently asked if \"anyone else is having trouble shipping 'black' clothing items to Hong Kong from China?

Previously it pressured Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong\u2019s flagship airline, to prevent staff who had supported the protests from flying on Chinese routes.\n\nMeanwhile, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive, used emergency powers to ban the wearing of facemasks at public gatherings, a move widely flouted across the city.", "description": "China is reportedly curbing exports of black clothes from the mainland to Hong Kong in an effort to hamper anti-government protests which have rocked the global financial hub for more than four months.
