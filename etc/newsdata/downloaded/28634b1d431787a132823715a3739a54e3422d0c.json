It therefore pays to look at what other customers are buying to get an idea of what's popular. With that in mind, here are the top five NBN plans according to around a million WhistleOut users.\n\nThe five plans below aren't the fastest on the market, nor are they the cheapest. But they are the plans most WhistleOut customers are interested in, based on monthly clicks. When you consider there are hundreds of plans from over 30 providers to choose from, this is no small feat.\n\nHere are the top five for the month of September. We've included the chief inclusions below along with the typical evening speeds you can expect to receive.\n\nTangerine's XL Speed Boost plan costs $59.90 for the first six months - the price then jumps to $69.90 per month. (There's no lock-in contract though.) The plan also comes with a 14 day risk-free trial. There's no setup fee but adding a pre-configured modem will cost you between $89 and $119 (depending on the model you choose.) Tangerine's XL Speed Boost plan has a typical evening speed of 42Mbps\n\nClick on the table below for the full inclusions:\n\nBelong's NBN Standard Plus plan costs $65 per month on a 12 month contract. Like all the plans here, it boasts unlimited data. It also comes with a free Wi-Fi modem and no activation fee. Belong's NBN Standard Plus plan has a typical evening speed of 40Mbps.\n\nClick on the table below for the full inclusions:\n\nTPG's NBN SL Bundle costs $69.99 per month. There's also a $129.95 activation fee that needs to be paid upfront. The plan is contract free, which means you're free to cancel if a better deal from a rival provider shows up. TPG's NBN SL Bundle plan has a typical evening speed of 42.6Mbps\n\nClick on the table below for the full inclusions:\n\nAt $90 per month, Telstra's Unlimited Internet Plan is the priciest plan in the top five. It also has a hefty $216 upfront fee and a $99 connection charge - although Telstra is currently waiving the latter when you buy online. On the plus side, it comes with a free Telstra Smart Modem boasting 4G mobile network backup and unlimited phone calls to Australian mobiles and standard lines. Eligible customers with deep pockets can add a Premium Evening Speed Boost for an extra $30 a month. Telstra's $90 plan has a typical evening speed of 40Mbps.\n\nThis month, Dodo managed to knock Exetel's $69.99 Unlimited Plan out of the top five. At $60 per month, it's $10 cheaper but only comes with 101GB data and average evening speeds of 20.1Mbps. Extra data costs $2 per GB.\n\nClick on the table below for the full inclusions:", "description": "Choosing an NBN plan is a bit like playing Russian roulette - while the odds are generally stacked in your favour, there's a pretty big chance something horrible will happen.
