Workers hired after 2007 who are paid a lower wage rate will hit the top wage of $32.32 per hour in four years or less.\n\nIt also has a $60,000 early retirement incentive for up to 2,000 eligible workers.\n\nThe deal now will be used as a template for talks with GM\u2019s crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Normally the major provisions carry over to the other two companies and cover about 140,000 auto workers nationwide. It wasn\u2019t clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.\n\nThe strike at GM immediately brought the company\u2019s U.S. factories to a halt, and within a week, started to hamper production in Mexico and Canada. Analysts at KeyBanc investment services estimated the stoppage cut GM vehicle production by 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles. That\u2019s too much for the company to make up with overtime or increased assembly line speeds.\n\nGM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America\u2019s trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.\n\nAmid that uncertainty, GM workers wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health \u2014 earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter \u2014 they wanted a bigger share.\n\nThe union\u2019s bargainers have voted to recommend the deal to the UAW International Executive Board, which will vote on the agreement. Union leaders from factories nationwide will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday.\n\nThe earliest workers could return would be after that.", "description": "The new four year contract would give workers a mix of pay raises, lump sum payments and an $11,000 signing bonus.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176218120-e1571336464445-638x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
