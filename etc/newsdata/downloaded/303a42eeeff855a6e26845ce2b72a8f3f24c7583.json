And that includes social media.\n\nIn Walmart's case, president and CEO Doug McMillon cares about his Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts. He has also gained a reputation as a forward-thinking leader by taking a stand on controversial issues, according to Bloomberg. That same report also called him \"emblematic of a younger generation of business leaders who are more woke than their pusillanimous predecessors in the executive suite.\"\n\nOn Friday, Walmart announced it would stop selling e-cigarettes after vaping-related lung injuries reached a total of 530 hospitalizations and eight deaths. Walmart also changed course on guns, announcing earlier this month that it would limit sales of guns and ammunition in the wake of two deadly shootings at Walmart stores in El Paso, Texas, and Southaven, Mississippi.\n\nBut McMillon isn't just changing Walmart's practices. On Thursday, he was named the incoming chairman of Business Roundtable, a nonprofit whose only members are CEOs and that promotes business through public policy. The group sparked conversations about the role of big business in society when they announced that shareholder value is no longer the driving force of business \u2014 ethics is.\n\nThat line of thinking shows in McMillon's social media accounts.\n\nAccording to a study by global business advising firm Brunswick Group, McMillon is the most connected CEO in the S&P 500 and FTSE 350.\n\nThe study, known as the Connected Leadership Survey, aimed to find which CEOs were the most connected on social media, specifically on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Other factors in the study were verification, activity on those sites, and whether they had an updated Wikipedia page.\n\nAs Walmart's CEO for the last five years, McMillon has embraced social media, using it as a place to represent the company and to show the world what the daily life of a chief executive looks like. A spokesperson for the retail giant told Business Insider that McMillon is hands-on with all of his own digital platforms, and only gets help from Walmart's social media team because his schedule is especially busy.\n\nHere's why McMillon earned the highest score on the Connected Leadership Index:", "description": "The head of Walmart uses Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to connect directly with his followers.
