Lentini was also appointed Deputy Finance Minister Laura Castelli's spokesman at the end of the summer when the 5Stars entered into a new government coalition with the center-left Democratic Party.\n\nThe move from a party that made its name pushing for transparency and against corruption triggered anger among its own lawmakers and a parliamentary session on the topic had to be suspended on Tuesday afternoon, although another explanation was given for interrupting the session.\n\nThe AIG has been in financial difficulty for some time and the idea of stopping it from being shut down had been discussed and agreed by all political groups but, according to three 5Star MPs who spoke on condition of anonymity, any plans to turn it into a public body using taxpayer cash were always rejected.\n\n\"A few of us also flagged the conflict of interest multiple times,\" one of the MPs said.\n\nAccording to a last-minute amendment on Tuesday \u2014 put forward by five 5Star MPs \u2014 the AIG would be renamed the Ente Italiano Alberghi per la Giovent\u00f9 (EIG), with 57 staff, one of whom would have \"a managerial qualification\" and \"a budget of \u20ac1.7 million for 2020.\"\n\nWhatsApp conversations seen by POLITICO show several lawmakers asked their colleagues to withdraw the amendment and warned them about compromising the party's values and damaging the deputy finance minister's reputation. However, according to two lawmakers who said they would vote in favor of the amendment, \"it was requested by Castelli and she's the one who has to ask to withdraw it.\"\n\nOne 5Star lawmaker slammed the amendment as a \"dirty trick,\" another said Lentini previously tried to lobby members of parliament to save the association but failed because of his \"enormous conflict of interest.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOver the summer, a Rome court rejected the association's request to access simplified bankruptcy procedures because it lacked the money to pay all of its creditors.\n\nThis is the latest sign of tension within the 5Star Movement, with talks of a possible split in the party and clashes between government officials and rank-and-file MPs.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Internal clash led to parliamentary session being suspended.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1162875279-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
