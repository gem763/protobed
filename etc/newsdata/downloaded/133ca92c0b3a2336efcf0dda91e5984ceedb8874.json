(AP) - With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville.\n\nCarter fell at home on Sunday, requiring 14 stiches, but he did not let his injuries keep him from participating in his 36th building project with the nonprofit Christian housing organization. He turned 95 last Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone.\n\nBefore construction began, Carter led a morning devotion for a group of several hundred volunteers.\n\nHe walked slowly across the uneven, muddy ground to the stage helped by a cane and several people who were nearby to steady him. Once seated, Carter, who still teaches Sunday school twice a week at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, spoke in a clear voice, peppering his inspirational message with jokes.\n\nHe spoke about Jesus\u2019 brother James who taught that \u201cif your life is not filled with peace, joy and thanksgiving, it\u2019s your fault.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarter said God gives us life and freedom. \u201cWith our freedom, every one of us can make a basic decision. \u2026 \u2018What kind of person do I, myself, choose to be?\u2019\u201d\n\nCarter said every person \u201ccan be a complete success in the eyes of God.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about what makes a successful life, Carter reminded the crowd that Jesus was poor, and died young, abandoned by his closest friends.\n\n\u201cBut Jesus lived a perfect life because he followed the will of God,\u201d Carter said.\n\nJoining Carter at the building site on Monday were former First Lady Rosalynn Carter; husband and wife country music stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood; and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and First Lady Maria Lee.\n\nMusician Eric Paslay played a song before Carter took the stage and joked about Carter\u2019s injury as he introduced him.\n\n\u201cAfter that bar fight, you coming out, building houses \u2026 I love you to death,\u201d Paslay said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Travis Loller"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/aptopix_jimmy_carter_fall_25643_c0-193-4615-2883_s1770x1032.jpg?c8ece3b1a3677960a07d82fca88be159e38d7d7d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
