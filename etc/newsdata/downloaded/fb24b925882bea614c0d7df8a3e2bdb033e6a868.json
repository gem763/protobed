About 30 per cent of homes in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide now have solar panels. Sydney and Melbourne are rapidly catching up.\n\nOne in every eight solar installations in Australia last year included battery storage, giving those home owners the ability to feed electricity generated on their roofs during the day into the grid, but also introducing new complexity in grid management.\n\nCarbon emissions are still growing and they need to fall dramatically to meet Paris. \u2014 Spencer Dale, BP\n\nBut all the talk about removing coal-fired power from the energy mix has done little to change its dominance \u2013 still at almost 40 per cent of the international energy mix, and much higher in Australia.\n\n\"Carbon emissions are still growing and they need to fall dramatically to meet Paris,\" Dale said, referring to the target of limiting the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees. \"It's a really worrying picture.\"\n\nThe Summit outlined the problems confronting Australia as it tries to meet its targets of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction in carbon emissions on 2005 levels by 2030. That would be a small step towards reaching the United Nations goal of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe push by 2 million households, encouraged by state subsidies, to combat soaring power bills by generating at least part of their own electricity still leaves them relying on the grid at times. Incentives for large-scale renewables through the 2020 Renewable Energy Target have meanwhile encouraged a surge in solar and wind farms.\n\nThe combined impact is to increasingly drive down daytime demand for power from the grid \u2013 known as the \"duck curve\" \u2013 resulting in low, zero or negative wholesale prices for hours at a time that threaten the economics of coal-fired power stations which run around the clock.\n\nCoal stations may be growing older and a bit less reliable, but they are the backbone of the National Electricity Market and ensure the power stays on when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, especially in the early evening peak.\n\nWhile business and industry groups have implored the federal government to embrace a national mechanism, like the National Energy Guarantee, to drive investment in cleaner supply, the Morrison government has made it clearthat this is off the table.\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor says coal, gas and hydro will protect grid stability. Louie Douvis\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor told the Summit the days of acronyms for one energy scheme after another are over.\n\nHe has chosen market intervention in the form of underwriting new \"firm\" generation, retail price caps and the threat of divestment for big energy companies to drive down prices.\n\nTaylor also wants the option of extending the life of older coal generators to provide stability in the grid and reduce the risk of blackouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe certainly doesn't want a repeat of the Hazelwood shutdown in Victoria in 2017, which sent prices soaring.\n\nEveryone loves new technology \u2013 such as battery storage, hydrogen or carbon capture and storage \u2013 but that technology is not always up to providing the solution just yet.\n\n\"Now, it's time to accept the facts, put the proselytising behind us and knuckle down to solve the biggest problems that confront us,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"This means balancing the unprecedented investment in intermittent renewables with attracting and retaining reliable, affordable on-demand generation.\n\n\"In the short to medium term, the only realistic options to do most of that balancing are coal, gas and hydro.\"\n\nBut energy companies and respected energy tsar Kerry Schott are not happy with much of the unprecedented market intervention, blaming it for the investment drought in firm generation.\n\nThe money is still flowing into renewables projects, but not into fast-starting gas peaking and pumped hydro plants that can back up wind and solar.\n\nFrom left, the Australian Energy Market Commission's Merryn York, the Energy Security Board's Kerry Schott, and the Australian Energy Markiet Operator's Audrey Zibelman at the Summit. Louie Douvis\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Government interventions to both cap prices and effectively subsidise certain generation projects will not encourage the considerable new investment and innovation that is needed,\" said Schott, chair of the government's top energy policy adviser, the Energy Security Board.\n\n\"The ongoing and costly efforts to keep ageing coal plants running for extended periods is also ill-advised. It discourages firms from giving adequate notice of closure and it discourages new investment in firm and flexible plants.\"\n\nSchotthas one of the toughest jobs in Australia. She is wrestling with extraordinary complexity in trying to future-proof the nation's electricity system as the flood of solar and wind farms meshes with the old-style poles and wires, and big shifts in technology allow households to become mini-generators and traders via their rooftop panels and batteries.\n\nSchott is alsograppling with complex regulatory shifts. At a practical level, the challenges include making sure that the correct voltage is coming down the line to protect household appliances.\n\nVoltage issues\n\nSchott said in some cases networks are able to manage with 100 per cent rooftop solar penetration, while in others solar exports are exacerbating \"over-voltage\" or \"under-voltage\" issues.\n\n\"What not being within voltage limits means, amongst other things, is that people's appliances are going to blow up. So in certain places there will be more people having trouble with their fridges and other appliances because the voltage changes, but more importantly the system becomes uncontrolled.\"\n\nElectricity retailers \u2013 loathed by consumers as the bills each quarter get higher \u2013 are scrambling too. Schott believes energy retailers and distribution companies will end up being more like telecommunications companies, making many different offers to households rather than sending a plain vanilla bill based on how much electricity has been used each quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The consumer plan they choose will be more like a telco plan,\" she said.\n\nBasically the distribution networks are turning into trading platforms. \u2014 Kerry Schott, Energy Security Board\n\nThe ''bi-directional flow'' of electricity \u2013 no longer just one-way from central power stations to households \u2013 means distributors are also under the pump.\n\n\"Basically the distribution networks are turning into trading platforms,'' Schott said.\n\nOverseas, gas has firmed its place as a transition fuel, easing the way to a low-emissions economy. But in Australia surging east coast prices \u2013 not helped by the $80 billion LNG export industry that mushroomed in Queensland \u2013 have hijacked that process.\n\nFor Audrey Zibelman, whose job as head of the Australian Energy Market Operator is to keep the lights on, the energy transition everyone else is just talking about is already a harsh reality.\n\n\"The industry has transitioned and it\u2019s the pace of change we are most concerned about,\" Zibelman said, pointing to some 15 megawatts a day of renewable energy capacity being added daily to the National Electricity Market,\n\nThe number of individual generating plants managed by AEMO has exploded from 100 in the centralised supply system of the past to 2 million because of all the rooftop solar panels scattered across the country. That\u2019s set to reach up to 4 million when the battery roll-out picks up pace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn parts of our system, particularly in Western Australia, if we don\u2019t start fixing things we\u2019re not going to be able to manage the system after that timeframe, so we need to get on it,\u201d Zibelman said.\n\nZibelman argues that buying energy reserves every summer \u2013 by asking companies to curtail their load or to put extra into the grid \u2013 is expensive and not a long-term solution to today's uncomfortably tight market.\n\n\"It's not feasible, it's dangerous and it's expensive,\" she said.\n\nIntervention\n\n\"Nobody relishes intervening but we are not going to let the system go dark, so let's get on with it \u2013 and be clear about what it's going to take to get the investment and make sure the market responds.\"\n\nThere\u2019s little argument on where the energy system needs to get to: a reliable, secure, affordable supply of power that fits with environmental aims.\n\nDale pointed out that energy transitions occur over several decades, but the rapid change meant Australia had less time to sort it out.\n\n\"It's not what the generations of 2030 or 2040 or 2050 are going to say about us, it's what people are going to say in 2025 if we don't get it right over the next several years,\" Zibelman argued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims recommended most of the market interventions being undertaken by the Morrison government hit back at the energy companies, suggesting they were profiteering from the crisis.\n\n\"Why would you rely on people who are long in electricity to invest to get prices down,\" he said, pointing out that suppliers' behaviour on misleading price discounting had also fallen short.\n\nIt's also energy-intensive manufacturers such as Incitec Pivot that are copping high prices, driving some to direct their investment offshore.\n\nThe pain is particularly acute for industrial gas users, where prices have trebled in three years. Small manufacturers such as coffee cup maker Remapak have been going under, with Sims warning others are likely to follow.\n\nAt stake are jobs, communities, skills and innovation.\n\n\"If we continue our current trajectory, we will simply kill off domestic gas demand, resulting in businesses destroyed and jobs heading overseas,\" said Incitec Pivot chief executive Jeanne Johns.\n\nBut Johns' call for intervention to effectively regulate prices for gas on the east coast was met by gas producers and investment analysts with dire warnings of a choking-off of supply.\n\nWith future investment required in Australia's energy system put at $400 billion, the potential burden on consumers is front of mind. Funds ploughed into everything from new transmission lines to extra regulation such as capacity markets \u2013 where generators are paid for having plants available even if they don't run \u2013 will be passed onto consumers through higher prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResource-blessed Australia, which once had the cheapest energy in the developed world, now has the most expensive.\n\nEnergy Consumers Australia chief executive Rosemary Sinclair said households were being punished for the crisis.\n\nShe sayid families were putting rooftop solar not because they wanted to save the planet \u2013 \"that's a distant fifth reason\" \u2013 but because they wanted to take back control of their bills.\n\n\"One of the problems in this sector is the solution is often throwing more capacity at it in the knowledge that some consumer somewhere is going to pay for it,\" Sinclair said.", "description": "Australia is grappling with a unique set of issues as it deals with the rapid influx of wind and solar power into the electricity grid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3487%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_96%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2be5bde9a591b50c2cda5979e2aa778238114d5a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
