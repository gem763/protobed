It is the largest fire currently burning in the state.\n\nMore than 6,400 hectares (15,800 acres) of land has already been scorched and as of late Sunday, the fire was only 5 percent contained.\n\nAbout 2,000 fire personnel were assigned to battle the wildfire.\n\nAlong with other smaller fires in northern California, 180,000 people have been forced to evacuate the region as homes and business are at high risk with the fast-moving blazes.\n\nWind gusts reaching as high as 100 kilometres per hour (62 miles/hour) across the area last weekend were expected to ease by Monday morning. Along with the lighter winds, relative humidity that had been as low as 6-8 percent was expected to rise by Tuesday.\n\nDeadly Tick\n\nFurther south near the city of Los Angeles, the Tick fire has been burning since October 24, instigated by the seasonal dry and gusty Santa Ana winds.\n\nWith 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of land consumed, the Tick fire has proven deadly as human remains were found in burned-out homes in the suburbs.\n\nSouthern California is expected to get a bit of help with the weather as well on Tuesday, but winds are forecast to pick back up on Wednesday.\n\nSo far this year more than 84,000 hectares (207,600 acres) have been scorched by wildfires. This is down significantly from 720,000 hectares (1.8 million acres) burned in 2018.\n\nThe California wildfire season continues through December.", "description": "Wildfires continue to tear through southern and northern parts of the western US state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/a002679500ad44408c6e8f738f5f3ebc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
