The sudden stress in U.S. dollar funding markets in recent days has spooked people by stirring memories of the 2008 crisis. A rocketing repo rate -- the key measure of liquidity in the global banking system -- and a jump in the U.S. Federal Reserve's target interest rate to levels not seen since 2008 forced the New York Fed to intervene four times to maintain the Fed funds rate in the 1.75%-2.0% range.\n\nIt is unclear yet whether the tightness was a one-off, triggered by technical issues such as Treasury maturities and tax payments, or if there's a systemic issue waiting to roil global markets.\n\nSo far there's no sign of spillover overseas but investors are on the watch for any warning signals, given the dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and investment. For instance, cross currency euro-dollar swaps, effectively a reflection of dollar funding costs for offshore investors, are nowhere near levels seen even during last October's selloff, let alone during the 2011 euro debt crisis. This is where non-U.S. banks would go to source dollar liquidity if they find themselves shut out of U.S. money markets.\n\nIf the repo chaos continues into coming days, offshore markets are likely to start feeling the heat. Watch this space.\n\n-Repo chaos tests Wall Street confidence in NY Fed's Williams (NYSE: ) -U.S. repo rate rises ahead of Fed repo operation -EXPLAINER-The Fed has a repo problem. What's that? THEN THERE WERE NONE... After the U.S. Fed's second \"insurance\" rate cut of 2019, officials' median rate forecasts hint at no more cuts this year. The shift has come as a shock given expectations prior to the Fed meeting were for several more cuts to contain the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff tussles with China.\n\nThe Fed judges the U.S. economy can get on fine without further short-term stimulus. Upcoming data may show us whether that view is accurate or if, in chairman Jerome Powell's words, \"a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate\".\n\nAugust durable goods orders will shed light on whether the trade war is eroding business investment. Orders for goods such as airplanes and toasters are seen having fallen 1% after rising 2% in July. Of keen interest will be orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft -- a closely watched proxy for business spending plans that increased 0.4% last month, even as shipments posted the biggest drop since October 2016. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate GDP.\n\nNew dot-plot projections show Fed policymakers at the median expect rates to stay within the new 1.75%-2.00% Fed funds range through 2020. Futures traders, meanwhile, see a better than 50/50 chance that the target rate will be another 25-50 bp lower by the year end. They will be watching for comments from Fed policymakers due to speak at various events in coming days.\n\n- Upbeat data suggest U.S. economy still on moderate growth path - Fed cuts rates again, gives mixed signals for next move DAY\n\nBritain's Supreme Court has concluded hearings on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending parliament for five weeks and a ruling is due in coming days. A decision against Johnson may force him to recall lawmakers, giving them more time to challenge his plan to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 -- with or without a divorce deal.\n\nIn fact, markets' mood has improved of late, first of all as parliament passed a law to avert a no-deal Brexit by end-October. More recently, comments by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stirred hopes of a Brexit deal, sending the pound to its highest level since July and putting it on track for its best month this year.\n\nThere are positive noises from Ireland too, with Foreign Minister Simon Coveney acknowledging an improvement in \"mood music\", though he and Brussels have stopped short of saying a deal is within reach. An EU diplomat in fact described documents submitted by London as a \"smokescreen\". So crashing out of the EU still remains an imminent possibility.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has said it will abide by the Supreme Court's ruling. If that comes to pass, it could be the catalyst for the next leg of sterling's recent rally.\n\n-UK Supreme Court to give ruling on suspension of parliament next week -Pound buoyed by Juncker's comments on possible Brexit deal -Ireland says not close to Brexit deal but mood music has improved WATCH While the Fed has been talking up the state of the U.S. economy, ECB chief Mario Draghi has urged euro zone governments to step on the fiscal gas pedal if they want to see economic growth speeding up.\n\nGiven that background and the Fed's promise to be \"highly data-dependent\" while setting interest rates, flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings are likely to be closely scrutinised-- a strong number would tip the balance in favour of the hawks on the Fed board.\n\nThe ECB on the other hand has already pledged indefinite stimulus and looking at depressed activity across the bloc, that seems justified. Monday's survey showed German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September as a manufacturing recession deepened and the service sector lost momentum too. Hopes are that this will chivvy tight-fisted euro zone goverments into loosening their purse strings.\n\n-Draghi ties Lagarde's hands with promise of indefinite stimulus\n\nzone business growth stays tepid as summer ends -PMI German private sector shrinks in Sept for first time in over six yrs -PMI TANGO Australia and New Zealand have been locked in a dance of alternating rate cuts this year as the zest of two of the globe's better-performing economies stales.\n\nMarkets are scrambling to price in extra easing on both sides of the Tasman Sea following a weak reading on Australian joblessness, which the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) says is crucial to its outlook. RBA chief Phil Lowe will speak on Tuesday, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets in Wellington on Wednesday.\n\nMarkets don't expect RBNZ chief Adrian Orr to move rates this month NZINTR=ECI . But then, they hadn't expected his 0.5% cut in August.\n\nThe bigger picture though, is that rates are heading downward. New Zealand's economy is growing at its slowest in six years and Australian growth is at a decade-low. All of Australia's big four banks have now brought forward rate-cut expectations. That's a lot of doves to feed. -New Zealand seen holding rates as it keeps powder dry for Nov easing -Australian budget back in balance but jobless rate at 1-yr high -New Zealand Q2 GDP growth slows but beats expectation U.S. money market rates\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/31PFfeY Fed funds target rate pprojections\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/31BDJ0b Pound on track for best month in 2019\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/30dnjgT U.S. vs Eurozone composite PMI\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/31AcwLj Antipodean interest rates\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/31MTRfv\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "GRAPHIC-Take Five: U.S. money market ruckus - one-off or warning?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
