The reading -- based on survey data from manufacturing and services businesses -- reflects a modest improvement from last month, when the index's rate of expansion hit its lowest point in three years. A reading above 50 indicates growth in activity.\n\nJoseph Lupton, Global Economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the data are \"nothing that people should get too excited about here. The global industrial cycle is still running at a very soft pace and that includes the U.S.\"\n\nMarkit readings on the eurozone separately showed signs that economic weakness was spreading to Germany's services sector as manufacturing output declined due to weakening demand from the U.K., China, Turkey and elsewhere. Germany's services sector has seen robust economic growth in recent quarters.\n\nThe September composite purchasing managers index for the eurozone fell to 50.4 from 51.9 in August. The index for Germany's manufacturing sector, meanwhile, fell to 41.4 from 43.5, hitting its lowest level in more than a decade. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity. That could turn a mild downturn into a deeper and more prolonged contraction, dragging down growth in other parts of Europe.\n\n\"It feels like Europe's economy and the German economy are suffering more than the U.S., even though the source of the angst around trade is U.S.-China tensions,\" said Amherst Pierpont Chief economist Stephen Stanley.\n\nThe U.S. economy appears to be faring better, but analysts said its performance was subdued. Readings for services and manufacturing both rose, with manufacturing at 51, from 50.3 in August, and services at 50.9, from 50.7 in the prior month, IHS Markit said.\n\nJoe Song, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said he found Monday's data on services concerning. \"We are clearly seeing a [U.S.] economy that's slowing. How far it slows is the big question right now,\" Mr. Song said.\n\nThe eurozone readings sent the euro down against the dollar and the yield on the German 10-year bund dropped. \"The manufacturing numbers are simply awful,\" said Phil Smith, an economist at IHS Markit. \"All the uncertainty around trade wars, the outlook for the car industry and Brexit are paralyzing order books.\"\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday said the bank stands ready to cut interest rates again from current record-low levels, amid a \"prolonged sag\" in the eurozone economy that is starting to hurt jobs.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament in Brussels, Mr. Draghi said a lingering downturn in the region's large manufacturing sector risked spilling into other areas of the economy. He stressed that the ECB was prepared to act again, but urged the region's governments to step up with fresh spending to support growth.\n\n\"We have seen the labor market losing momentum,\" Mr. Draghi said at his last parliamentary hearing before his eight-year term ends on Oct. 31. \"The growth outlook has been constantly deteriorating.\"\n\nMajor central banks including the Federal Reserve have been cutting interest rates in recent months, seeking to insulate their economies against foreign headwinds that range from international tensions over trade to weaknesses in emerging markets such as China.\n\nThe ECB rolled out a large stimulus package earlier this month that included interest-rate cuts and an open-ended bond-buying program. Mr. Draghi on Monday said the ECB's aggressive stimulus was justified to support eurozone inflation, which has veered far from the ECB's target of just below 2%.\n\nTom Fairless in Frankfurt contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 16:49 ET (20:49 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
