Less commonplace is the acknowledgement that human judgements also rely upon secondary information that doesn\u2019t come from any external source \u2013 and that offers one of the most powerful tools we possess for dealing with the deluge itself. This source is social information. Or, in other words: what we think other people are thinking.\n\nConsider a simple scenario. You\u2019re in a crowded theatre when, suddenly, people all around you start panicking and looking for an exit. What do you do, and why? Your senses inform you that other people are moving frantically. But it\u2019s the social interpretation you put on this information that tells you what you most need to know: these people believe that something bad is happening, and this means you should probably be trying to escape too.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s one possible interpretation. It may be the case that you, or they, are mistaken. Perhaps there\u2019s been a false alarm, or part of the performance has been misunderstood. Reading social information accurately is an essential skill, and one most of us devote an immense amount of effort to practising. Indeed, wondering what\u2019s going on inside someone else\u2019s head is one of humanity\u2019s greatest fascinations \u2013 alongside trying to influence it.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 \u2018I was a North Macedonian fake news writer\u2019\n\n\u2022 Could this be the cure for fake news?\n\n\u2022 How your social media betrays your mood\n\nSo far, so familiar. But the information suffusion of digital culture has introduced something new into this ancient psychological equation: a whole new level of reliance upon social information; and a whole new set of hazards and anxieties around errors, manipulation and cascades of influence.\n\nDanish researchers Vincent F Hendricks and Pelle G Hansen give these tumultuous processes a name \u2013 an \u201cinformation storm\u201d, or infostorm, in the sense of a sudden and tempestuous flow of social information \u2013 and suggest an intriguing alternative to the narratives of human folly and unreason so often applied to fake news and tribal divisions online. (Read about how fake news is one of the grand challenges of our time.)\n\nMany of the digital world\u2019s most fractious sites are in fact the results of perfectly rational decision-making\n\nRather than despairingly deciding that we now live in a post-truth era ruled by irrational forces, they argue in their book Infostorms, many of the digital world\u2019s most fractious sites are in fact the results of perfectly rational decision-making by those involved \u2013 and originate not so much in human foolishness as in the nature of information environments themselves.\n\nConsider the spread of an item of misinformation through a social network. Once a small number of people have shared it, anyone subsequently encountering that information will face what is at root a binary choice: is what they\u2019re looking at true, or untrue? Assuming they have no first-hand knowledge of the claim, it\u2019s theoretically possible for them to look it up elsewhere \u2013 a process of laborious verification that involves trawling through countless claims and counter-claims. They also, however, possess a far simpler method of evaluation, which is to ask what other people seem to think.\n\nAs Hendricks and Hansen put it, \u201cwhen you don\u2019t possess sufficient information to solve a given problem, or if you just don\u2019t want to or have the time for processing it, then it can be rational to imitate others by way of social proof\u201d. When we either know very little about something, or the information surrounding it is overwhelming, it makes excellent sense to look to others\u2019 apparent beliefs as an indication of what is going on. In fact, this is often the most reasonable response, so long as we have good reason to believe that others have access to accurate information; and that what they seem to think and what they actually believe are the same.\n\nThe automation of this observation is one of the foundational insights of the online age. The great initial innovation of Google\u2019s search engine was that \u2013 rather than attempting the impossible task of coming up with an original assessment of the quality and usefulness of every website in the world \u2013 users\u2019 own actions and attitudes could become its key metric. By looking at how web pages linked to one another, Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm put a proxy for content creators\u2019 own attitudes at the heart of its evaluation process.\n\nOnline, the notions both of universally trusted sources and universally accessible announcements are problematic, to say the least\n\nIt may sound crushingly obvious today, but it\u2019s worth pausing to consider how fundamental the measurement and management of social information is to almost every company seeking to turn trillions of bytes of online data into profit. User traffic, reviews, ratings, clicks, likes, sentiment analyses: what people are thought to be thinking makes the digital world go round. And these currencies of reputation, unlike money, are only enhanced by usage. The more they\u2019re spent, the more their worth increases. The public signal is all.\n\nHow to handle an infostorm? In a social situation in the real world, a false consensus can be dispelled by publicly sharing trustworthy new information: an official announcement in our hypothetical crowded theatre; a confession of confusion by someone who started a rumour. Online, the notions both of universally trusted sources and universally accessible announcements are problematic, to say the least. Yet, work such as Hendricks and Hansens\u2019s suggests that there\u2019s hope to be found if we remember that the mechanisms involved are fundamentally agnostic about truth and untruth. Infostorms, like actual storms, are the products of climatic conditions \u2013 symptoms of something far larger. And different climates can produce very different results.\n\nNetworks where members are, for example, randomly exposed to a range of views are less likely to experience cascades of unchallenged belief. The disproportionate significance of the first responses to a claim can be addressed by an engineered attention to sources, authenticity and provenance; and the public introduction of accurate information can, if a trusted source is involved, dispel false consensus.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the way in which social information ripples through a network can be understood in terms of rational reactions to uncertainty, rather than irrational impulses addressable only by further irrationalism. And the more we understand the chain of events that led someone towards a particular perspective, the more we understand what it might mean to arrive at other views \u2013 or, equally importantly, to sow the seeds of sceptical engagement.\n\n--\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
