Before any of it can begin, the Parliament's legal affairs committee must declare that none of the candidates have a potential conflict of interest.\n\nUnder Parliament rules, the assembly evaluates commissioners-designate \u201cbased on their general competence, European commitment and personal independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shall assess knowledge of their prospective portfolio and their communication skills,\u201d the rules say.\n\nParliament rules require a majority of at least two-thirds among the most influential MEPs \u2014 the political groups' so-called coordinators in each committee \u2014 for the candidates to pass immediately. That means that commissioners-designate need the support of more political groups than von der Leyen herself managed to secure at her election in July.\n\n\u201cIf coordinators cannot reach a majority of at least two-thirds of the committee membership to approve the candidate,\u201d the rules say, a candidate will have to answer additional questions in written form or could even have to reappear before the committee. If even in that event there is no two-thirds majority, a simple majority in a full committee vote would technically be enough for the commissioner candidate to pass.\n\nOfficials from the major political groups said they would start work on assessing backgrounds and portfolios of commissioners at internal meetings planned for the coming days.\n\nGood and bad\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s announcement of her team prompted praise for her focus on gender balance and green issues. But it also sparked confusion and anger, especially over the job title given to Greece's Margaritis Schinas \u2014 \u201cprotecting the European way of life.\u201d\n\n\"The very point about the European way of life is the freedom for individuals to choose their own way of life,\u201d said Sophie in 't Veld, a Dutch MEP from Renew Europe. \u201cWe do not need a commissioner for that, thank you very much.\"\n\n\"The implication that Europeans need to be protected from external cultures is grotesque and this narrative should be rejected,\u201d in 't Veld said.\n\nOthers have concerns about controversial names in the new team, including L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, the Hungarian nominee who was given the neighborhood and enlargement portfolio. He's not a member of the country\u2019s ruling Fidesz party, but he is perceived as loyal to Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and was his justice minister at a time when critics say the government worked to undermine checks and balances.\n\nCriticisms were directly targeted at individual commissioners' backgrounds and past work.\n\nMembers of Hungary's opposition Democratic Coalition (part of the S&D) will \"do everything so that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi won\u2019t be a member of the European Commission,\u201d MEP Csaba Moln\u00e1r wrote in a statement on behalf of the Hungarian party.\n\nAnother controversial name is Rovana Plumb, the Romanian candidate given the transport portfolio, who is seen as close to Liviu Dragnea, the former leader of the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD) imprisoned in May in a case involving fake jobs for party workers.\n\nOn Monday, the Romanian delegation in Renew Europe said they would vote against Plumb because of her \u201cquestionable integrity,\u201d said one group official.\n\n\u201cShe had anti-EU positions and she was a supporter from her public office of Liviu Dragnea,\u201d the official said.\n\nJanusz Wojciechowski, the Polish candidate in charge of the agriculture portfolio, is another name that's causing concern in the Parliament. A member of Poland\u2019s ruling PiS \u2014 a party that has repeatedly clashed with the European institutions \u2014 he is under investigation by the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, for alleged irregularities in the reimbursement of travel expenses when he was an MEP between 2004-2014.\n\nThen there's Sylvie Goulard, who on Tuesday was nominated for the internal market job and also interviewed by French police as part of an ongoing investigation over alleged misuse of EU funds by her former party.\n\nOther criticisms were directly targeted at individual commissioners' backgrounds and past work.\n\nMarkus Ferber, the EPP group's spokesman on the Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, said former Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni, who was named economy commissioner, did \"not manage to get the Italian economy out of the doldrums.\"\n\n\u201cThis kind of track record does not instill a lot of confidence that he will do better as commissioner for the economy,\" he added.\n\nOn the appointment of Margrethe Vestager as vice president for digital and also as competition commissioner, Ferber added that \u201ceven after five years in office, competition rules are still not up to speed to deal with the challenges of the digital world.\u201d\n\nLili Bayer contributed reporting.", "description": "MEPs need to give their approval to von der Leyen\u2019s team \u2014 and some already look in trouble.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "David M.
