Sim Seung-seob, the chief of naval operations. He promised to report to the National Assembly's Defense Committee after checking whether there were any other missile launches that the Aegis ships failed to detect.\n\n", "description": "Aegis Ships Missed N.Korea's Recent Missile Launches", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
