But Beijing may be well positioned to withstand the pressure, thanks to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nLeland Miller, CEO of China Beige Book, says tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have given Chinese leadership cover to shift the blame for any economic slowdown solely on the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is the wonderful gift that Trump has given the Chinese,\u201d Miller said, speaking to Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe Ticker\u201d this week. \u201cThey have this opportunity to say, okay, our growth is slowing, but it\u2019s not us. We\u2019re being ganged up on by Trump and the rest of the world.\u201d\n\n\u2018Beijing has an out\u2019\n\nMiller says he expects China to \u201cslow dramatically over time\u201d because of borrowing costs, which have now topped 300% of GDP, according to the Institute of International Finance. The estimated $34 trillion debt pile has ticked even higher as leaders have tried to steer an economy undergoing its slowest economic expansion since 2019, all but abandoning President Xi Jinping\u2019s promise for financial deleveraging and \u201cquality growth\u201d laid out in 2017.\n\nOSAKA, JAPAN - JUNE 29: Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) shakes hands with US President Donald Trump before a bilateral meeting during the G20 Summit on June 29, 2019 in Osaka, Japan.

China\u2019s economy posted GDP growth of 6.4% in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter of this year, but that declined to 6.2% in the second quarter, a 27-year low.\n\n\u201cI think a decision was made in Beijing in fourth quarter 2018, that they were going to play for the long game, regardless of how the trade war went,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, a cushion has gone out under the economy. And that\u2019s why we saw better data first quarter and even the second quarter.\u201d\n\nNew data suggests the third quarter could be even worse, Miller said, though he did not disclose those numbers publicly.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials have made little progress in trade talks, since Trump and Xi met at the G20 summit in Osaka in June. On Thursday, Washington and Beijing confirmed a plan for high-level talks in October, following deputy-level discussions later this month, in a welcome sign of a diplomatic thaw for the markets. That came after the Trump administration imposed a 15% tariff on roughly $112 billion in Chinese imports on Sept. 1.\n\nRecent research published by the Federal Reserve suggests the trade war has already made a significant dent in global growth, with an estimated $850 billion loss globally through early next year, shaving roughly 1% off of GDP. Its analysis of corporate earnings calls and newspaper articles found trade policy uncertainty \u201cshot up to levels not seen since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nStill, Miller says Beijing may not feel the need to drum up its domestic economy as aggressively as in the past, in part because it sees global tide shifting against the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cBeijing has an out, Xi Jinping has an out, and it\u2019s very possible they\u2019re going to take that out,\u201d he said.\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
