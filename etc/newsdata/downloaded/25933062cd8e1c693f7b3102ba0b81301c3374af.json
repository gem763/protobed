FOREX-Dollar slips against euro before Fed decision; sterling dips\n\n* Fed expected to cut U.S. rates\n\n* Britain likely to hold election in December\n\n* Aussie gains on U.S.-China trade deal hopes\n\n* U.S. consumer confidence fell in October\n\n(New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments,\n\nadds British election vote)\n\nBy Karen Brettell\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against the\n\neuro on Tuesday, a day before the Federal Reserve was expected\n\nto cut U.S. interest rates, while sterling dipped as Britain\n\nlooked likely to go to election in December.\n\nInvestors will watch the conclusion of the U.S. central\n\nbank's two-day meeting, and the dollar may gain if the Fed\n\nindicates reluctance to cut rates more.\n\n\u201cWe're looking for a hawkish reaction, which would lean\n\ntoward a stronger dollar,\u201d said Mark McComick, North American\n\nhead of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.\n\n\u201cGiven that markets are looking for the Fed to prop up the\n\neconomy over the coming months, I think them signaling a little\n\nbit of a pause would kind of reinforce some consolidation in the\n\ndollar, especially against euro and sterling which have been\n\ndriven by the Brexit euphoria,\u201d he said.\n\nIncreasing optimism that Britain will reach a deal to avoid\n\na disorderly exit from the European Union has supported the euro\n\nand sterling recently.\n\nStill, the pound dipped on Tuesday in choppy trading after\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson won parliament's preliminary\n\napproval to hold Britain's first December election in almost a\n\ncentury in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock. On Monday, the EU agreed to a three-month flexible delay to\n\nBritain's departure. Sterling fell 0.04% against the dollar to $1.2857. It\n\nhas risen from $1.2193 on Oct. 8, but is below a five-month high\n\nof $1.3012 reached on Oct. 21.\n\nThe Australian dollar climbed for a third straight session\n\nagainst the greenback on growing hopes for a U.S.-China trade\n\nagreement. Australia's economy is highly correlated to China's\n\nand on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he expected to\n\nsign a significant part of the trade deal ahead of schedule.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies\n\nfell after data showed U.S. consumer confidence\n\nunexpectedly fell in October. ========================================================\n\nCurrency bid prices at 2:30PM (1830 GMT)\n\nDescription RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid\n\nPrevious Change\n\nSession\n\nEuro/Dollar EUR= $1.1109 $1.1098 +0.10% -3.13% +1.1118 +1.1074\n\nDollar/Yen JPY= 108.8800 108.9400 -0.06% -1.25% +109.0600 +108.7800\n\nEuro/Yen EURJPY= 120.96 120.93 +0.02% -4.17% +121.0600 +120.5900\n\nDollar/Swiss CHF= 0.9933 0.9944 -0.11% +1.21% +0.9964 +0.9934\n\nSterling/Dollar GBP= 1.2857 1.2862 -0.04% +0.78% +1.2904 +1.2808\n\nDollar/Canadian CAD= 1.3088 1.3050 +0.29% -4.03% +1.3095 +1.3041\n\nAustralian/Doll AUD= 0.6861 0.6838 +0.34% -2.67% +0.6871 +0.6836\n\nEuro/Swiss EURCHF= 1.1038 1.1037 +0.01% -1.92% +1.1049 +1.1022\n\nEuro/Sterling EURGBP= 0.8639 0.8628 +0.13% -3.84% +0.8650 +0.8609\n\nNZ NZD= 0.6351 0.6347 +0.06% -5.45% +0.6375 +0.6340\n\nDollar/Dollar\n\nDollar/Norway NOK= 9.2364 9.2217 +0.16% +6.92% +9.3041 +9.2140\n\nEuro/Norway EURNOK= 10.2629 10.2343 +0.28% +3.60% +10.3121 +10.2140\n\nDollar/Sweden SEK= 9.7060 9.7021 +0.14% +8.28% +9.7488 +9.7017\n\nEuro/Sweden EURSEK= 10.7847 10.7700 +0.14% +5.07% +10.8045 +10.7706\n\n(Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)", "description": "FOREX-Dollar slips against euro before Fed decision; sterling dips", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1M100_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
