FOREX-Plans for trade talks cheer risk currencies, hit safe-haven yen\n\n* Trade-exposed currencies jump on U.S.-China trade talks\n\ndate\n\n* Yen sold as risk-on mood returns\n\n* Some moves retraced in afternoon trade as caution emerges\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - China's yuan and the\n\nAustralian dollar rallied after news on Thursday that China-U.S.\n\ntrade talks would resume next month, but investors sold the safe\n\nhaven yen, even though any de-escalation in the trade war would\n\nbenefit Japanese exporters.\n\nOther factors helping support risk sentiment, were reduced\n\nchances of Britain crashing out of the European Union on Oct. 31\n\nwithout a deal, and a potential breakthrough in the Hong Kong\n\npolitical crisis following a move to withdraw an extradition\n\nbill that had sparked mass protests. Sterling held onto gains made overnight, after the British\n\nparliament voted to stop a \"no deal\" Brexit and to prevent Prime\n\nMinister Boris Johnson from calling a snap election that could\n\nhave given him the mandate to keep alive the threat of \"no\n\ndeal\". It still leaves Brexit up in the air, with possible outcomes\n\nstill ranging from a no-deal exit to abandoning the whole\n\nendeavour.\n\nThe pound sat around $1.2241 and the euro EUR=EBS at\n\n$1.1027, mostly holding on to overnight gains.\n\nFor the broader market, the resumption of China-U.S. trade\n\ntalks was the main factor at play. Talks will be held in\n\nWashington in early October, China's commerce ministry said.\n\n\n\n\"This news has injected a fair amount of optimism in\n\nmarkets,\" said Prashant Newnaha, senior rates strategist at TD\n\nSecurities in Singapore.\n\n\"It does seem that the markets were positioning more\n\nbearishly, and now we've gotten this potential good news and the\n\nmarkets are running with it,\" he said, adding global economic\n\nindicators had also recently been showing some green shoots.\n\nSentiment has been skittish, however, and some analysts\n\nsounded a note of caution.\n\n\"The U.S. is still going to raise tariffs next month and\n\nDecember, as far as we know,\" said Joe Capurso, senior currency\n\nstrategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.\n\n\"That's a negative for the world economy and the Chinese\n\neconomy.\"\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar lifted a\n\nlittle from a one-week low to 98.482.\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars, AUD=D3 NZD=D3\n\nChinese yuan and South Korean won all jumped\n\nagainst the dollar, while the yen JPY=EBS fell nearly 0.4% to\n\n106.75 per dollar, its weakest in more than three weeks.\n\nThe Australian dollar touched a one-month high of $0.6825,\n\nseen as a technical resistance level while the New Zealand\n\ndollar hit a one-week peak of $0.6377. The trade-exposed won\n\nclimbed the most of Asia's currencies, rising about 0.5% to\n\n1198.00 per dollar.\n\nThe Canadian dollar spiked sharply to C$1.3344 per\n\ndollar after the Bank of Canada left interest rates on hold and\n\nsounded less dovish than the market had expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Plans for trade talks cheer risk currencies, hit safe-haven yen", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8107I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
