Lin-Manuel Miranda and company throw down some \u2018Freestyle Love\u2019 to find out.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nThe company of \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme.\u201d First row: James Monroe Iglehart, Andrew Bancroft. Second row: Chris Sullivan, Anthony Veneziale, Christopher Jackson, Utkarsh Ambudkar and Arthur Lewis. (Matthew Murphy/Greenwich House Theater)\n\nThis era of round-the-clock agita in America might call for a couple of hours of escapism every now and then, don\u2019t you think? That, anyway, seems to be the sentiment on Broadway, as evidenced by some of its latest high-profile offerings.\n\nEarlier this month, a British mentalist of mind-boggling agility, Derren Brown, arrived in the Cort Theatre with \u201cSecret,\u201d his latest dive into astonishing an audience with the power of suggestion. And now, three blocks away, comes another show meant to lull you out of your state of anxious world-weariness: the Broadway transfer of \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme,\u201d the hip-hop improv show dreamed up by Anthony Veneziale, Thomas Kail and nonstop entertainment machine Lin-Manuel Miranda. After striking a giddy chord in downtown audiences, with a sold-out run in Greenwich Village, this rapping romp is angling for larger crowds through its irreverent displays of rhyming wit.\n\nIt may be coincidental that these novelties end up in Broadway houses at the same moment, but they appear well-timed for the art of taking people out of themselves. Along with ventures like the long-running, two-part \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d these productions seem poised to sate our desire for someone to snap their fingers and replace anxiety with wonder. As the appeal of \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d is explained by Kail, Tony-winning director of \u201cHamilton,\u201d who has known Miranda and Veneziale since they were all undergraduates at Wesleyan University: \u201cIt\u2019s about a freedom of expression, about a joy and a possibility of making the mundane magical.\u201d\n\nThe process has begun at the 800-seat Booth Theatre on Shubert Alley \u2014 one of Times Square\u2019s crown jewels \u2014 where \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d is in preview performances before an official opening Oct. 2. That its route to Broadway has been so serendipitous seems to add some magical gloss to the enterprise, one that started long ago as tension-relieving gamesmanship among friends. Fueled in part by the power and success of Miranda and Kail, the show found an audience and a cachet. (Over the summer, it tested the elasticity of its appeal with a short stint at the Kennedy Center, featuring some of the performers who would be part of the Broadway cast.)\n\nAnd it has propelled these old friends and collaborators into new roles, as theatrical producers. Miranda also appears on some unannounced nights in the production, which Kail directs; Kail happens also to be a producer of Brown\u2019s \u201cSecret.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Sullivan, Christopher Jackson, Anthony Veneziale and Utkarsh Ambudkar in \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d at Greenwich House Theater. (Matthew Murphy/Greenwich House Theater)\n\n\u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d is modulated for that extremely modern wavelength, the one that seeks to evaporate the barriers between performers and spectators. The inclusiveness that these 75 minutes of laughter and boisterous entertainment engender begins with the guys (and occasionally, a female rapper) onstage. The camaraderie, Veneziale says, is a result of an openness to each performer\u2019s distinct hip-hop style. \u201cWe often look for people who are able to express their version of what\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about tapping into your authentic voice.\u201d\n\nUnlike, say, a night out in Vegas, or at a comedy club where the pattern tends to be one act at the mic at a time, \u201cFreestyle\u201d is communal, with the cast members sharing the stage and handing off the spotlight as if it were a baton in an Olympic relay. It\u2019s democratic comedy, with a lowercase \u201cd.\u201d Sort of.\n\n\u201cWe create these things where people feel like their voices matter,\u201d Veneziale adds. \u201cEveryone up there has a moment to express their point of view, and add to the totality.\u201d\n\nAmbudkar, who grew up in Columbia, Md., and Gaithersburg, became disillusioned with training as an actor at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, gravitated toward spoken-word performance and honed rap-battle skills. More than a decade ago, a producer, Orin Wolf \u2014 later to bring \u201cThe Band\u2019s Visit\u201d to Broadway \u2014 attended one of the rap battles, Ambudkar says, and introduced him to the guys who would develop \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d into a full production.\n\n\u201cI came from a hip-hop rap-battle background, a very competitive environment, in which emcees are in\u00adcred\u00adibly self-aggrandizing,\u201d Ambudkar says. That boastful style was seriously one-dimensional. \u201cTommy Kail sat with me and said, \u2018Listen, man, there\u2019s a lot of ego in your performance. You can\u2019t go onstage and talk about how great you are.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe credits Kail with making his performance less solipsistic, more observationally about the world around him \u2014 what Ambudkar calls \u201ca focus on listening and enhancement of the group experience.\u201d\n\nComedy is not renowned for its generosity of spirit, but maybe the escape we\u2019re craving is an entertaining environment that\u2019s both funnier and more familial than the brittle reality we endure day to day. \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d could be a good test of this thesis.\n\nAmbudkar says that when he\u2019s on the stage with his cast members, \u201cI want to show love in the same capacity that they show me.\n\n\u201cWe are in the same exact boat,\u201d Ambudkar adds, \u201cas the audience.\u201d\n\nFreestyle Love Supreme, created by Thomas Kail, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Veneziale.
