Soon after what was the Redskins\u2019 third preseason game, Reed was diagnosed with a concussion \u2014 the latest of many in his career. And now nothing about Reed seems certain to the Redskins anymore.\n\nA member of the Redskins\u2019 organization with knowledge of Reed\u2019s situation downplayed a Sunday ESPN report that said many around the team worry Reed\u2019s career \u201cis in jeopardy,\u201d calling the report \u201coverstated.\u201d But Reed has not participated in a full practice or played in a game since suffering the concussion a month ago and will miss Monday night\u2019s game against the Chicago Bears. Despite early optimism that Reed would be back by the start of the regular season, no one seems to know when he will return.\n\nThe issue seems to confound Reed and the Redskins. He has come to several practices and taken part in individual drills \u2014 usually a step toward being cleared from the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol \u2014 telling teammates and bystanders that he feels \u201cgreat\u201d and expects to play in that weekend\u2019s game, only to disappear from late-week workouts, having never received clearance.\n\nAs Reed continues to show concussion symptoms, Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s tone has changed from the early assurances that Reed would be \u201cokay.\u201d On Thursday, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re just taking it very slowly, making sure he goes through the right process to make sure it\u2019s right before he goes back on the field.\u201d\n\nIn a pivotal season, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden has ramped up the intensity\n\nPeople around the team talk a lot about prioritizing Reed\u2019s long-term health over the team\u2019s need to have its best pass-catching tight end on the field or Reed\u2019s own desire to play. But according to two people with knowledge of the team\u2019s thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, there is also frustration over the uncertainty that comes with having a player in the concussion protocol \u2014 especially a player who has had seven documented concussions in his college and NFL career.\n\nWith the team 0-2, Gruden\u2019s job may be on the line, and he doesn\u2019t know when he can use his most dynamic offensive player. Each week, Gruden and his coaches draw up a game plan with several unique plays designed for Reed, teased with the hope of being able to use them only to throw them away at week\u2019s end. Adding to the frustration is the uncertainly that comes from the league\u2019s mandate that a player can\u2019t play until cleared by a doctor independent of the team. Team officials understand why such a rule exists, but it adds to the unpredictability of Reed\u2019s situation.\n\nThey know, for instance, that running back Derrius Guice is out for at least half the season and that linebacker Reuben Foster won\u2019t be back at all. They can figure there is a good chance that defensive end Jonathan Allen will return from his sprained knee soon. Their doctors and trainers can provide updates. But they have no idea how Reed will feel a day after going through half of a practice, and there is no one to tell them when he will be good to return.\n\n\u201cI think we all know exactly where he fits in this system, the versatility and the things he can do for the other people in our offense around him as well as help out the quarterback, being the target that he is,\u201d offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said Friday. \u201cWe feel really good about that plan when we get Jordan back, but that\u2019s obviously something we let the medical staff and Coach Gruden focus on. We\u2019re just trying to make sure for Monday night we\u2019re ready to roll and we feel really good about it.\u201d\n\nKareem Copeland contributed to this report.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nTony Wyllie, Redskins\u2019 head of communications, is leaving the organization\n\nJenkins: Case Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big\n\nFor the Redskins, 0-3 would mean doom.
