He averages 187.6 yards per game and has run for 10 touchdowns.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s patient. I like what they\u2019re doing on offense with him,\u201d first-year Texas Tech coach Matt Wells said. \u201cThey do a lot of schemes where he\u2019s able to read, and then he\u2019s strong and physical. \u2026 Certainly a big challenge for our defense.\u201d\n\nA week after Oklahoma had two 100-yard receivers against them in a lopsided win, the Red Raiders (2-2, 0-1) now have to try to slow down Hubbard and receiver Tylan Wallace (123.6 yards receiving a game with six TDs).\n\n\u201cGoing against Tylan, we\u2019ve got to challenge him,\u201d cornerback Zech McPhearson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make him earn everything.\u201d\n\nSince Sanders won the Heisman, 21 of the past 29 recognized winners have been quarterbacks _ including 11 of the last 13. Gundy was asked if Hubbard is the best non-quarterback in Heisman consideration this season.\n\n\u201cSure, I think it\u2019s possible. I think it\u2019s comparable to numbers from the past,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIf you stop the race right now, he\u2019s in good shape, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go. He\u2019s got to continue to work hard and stay humble, which hasn\u2019t been an issue up to this point.\u201d\n\nLOADING UP JETT\n\nGraduate transfer Jackson Tyner started at quarterback for the Red Raiders at Oklahoma in their first game without Big 12 passing leader Alan Bowman (shoulder injury). But dual-threat quarterback Jett Duffey came on and was 11-of-20 passing for 120 yards.\n\n\u201cJett Duffey will be our quarterback moving forward\u201d Wells said. \u201cI saw it in the game first, and then video confirmed it. I thought he was aggressive. I thought he made some good plays. Room for improvement, just like me and the rest of them, but I think he gives us the best chance to win.\u201d\n\nDuffey played in eight games last season, throwing for 1,221 yards and eight touchdowns while adding 369 yards and four TDs rushing.\n\nWINNING ON THE PLAINS\n\nOklahoma State has won its last five games in Lubbock by an average margin of 53-29. Before that streak began with the 2010 game, the Cowboys had gone 0-10-2 in their previous 12 games there. The Red Raiders upset then-No. 15 Oklahoma State in Stillwater last year, but hasn\u2019t won consecutive games in the series since three in a row from 2000-02.\n\nHALFWAY POINT\n\nThe Cowboys will be the first Big 12 team to play their sixth game, and get halfway through their regular season schedule. They are the league\u2019s only team that hasn\u2019t yet had one of its two open dates. Their first will come next weekend after the Texas Tech game.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nTexas Tech hasn\u2019t won a home game against a Top 25 team since a win over TCU early in the 2013 season. \u2026 Oklahoma State LG Marcus Keyes\u2019 42 career starts are 12 more than anyone else on the roster. \u2026 Red Raiders LB Jordyn Brooks is second in the Big 12 with 10.2 tackles per game. His 6 \u00bd tackles for loss are one less than his total all of last season. \u2026 Cowboys dual-threat freshman QB Spencer Sanders ranked third among FBS quarterbacks with 380 rushing yards. He is second in the Big 12 with 13.37 yards passing per completion.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy gets a hard time from some of his quarterback buddies because he loves it when the Cowboys are running the ball.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/oklahoma_st_texas_football_57168_c0-159-3801-2375_s1770x1032.jpg?d30ab28bd59102a951af9135b9acb078a2168664", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
