And it is likely that those changes will determine the extent to which England are successful in Sofia.\n\nA 4-0 thrashing of the same opposition at Wembley last month should serve as good omens for Southgate\u2019s side, but destroying a team at home holds little importance as England discovered in their 2-1 defeat on Friday, a side that they had thrashed 5-0 on home soil.\n\nHowever, Bulgaria sit bottom of group A and this is close to the perfect fixture that Southgate would have chosen to get a low-confidence England back on their feet.\n\nWhichever front three Southgate chooses will cause problems for the Bulgaria defence, and should England show improvement defensively they will leave Sofia three points clear at the top of the group once again.", "description": "England\u2018s\u00a0next Euro 2020 qualifier assignment sees them travel to Sofia to take on bottom side Bulgaria.
