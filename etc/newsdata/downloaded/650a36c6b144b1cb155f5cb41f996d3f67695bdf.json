Of course now she understands the situation differently and would be horrified to know she\u2019d upset people. However, the bullying campaign that has been launched against Georgia by a couple of angry castmates from The Challenge isn\u2019t fair.\u201d\n\nHarrison is reportedly working and cannot access her phone to address the allegations herself but the rep insisted they are \u201cin the process of taking legal action for defamation against parties that have labelled [Harrison] racist.\u201d\n\nSARAH SILVERMAN REVEALS SHE WAS ONCE FIRED OVER AN OLD PHOTO OF HERSELF IN BLACKFACE: 'I DIDN'T FIGHT IT'\n\nMany people on social media have been calling for MTV to fire Harrison over the photo.\n\n\u201cWow Georgia. This is disgusting and way out of line,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cAlso it\u2019s no one\u2019s place to say if this is acceptable or not. It\u2019s extremely offensive, and someone needs to take accountability #TheChallenge34.\u201d\n\n\"\"See that blackface @MTV!? It\u2019s all on you for keep inviting Georgia, Bear, Joss and rookie Nicole too @ChallengeMTV!! Still not learning nothing when you check their past background first. RACISM!!\" wrote /another.\n\n\"i\u2019m younger than Georgia and know blackface is bad. i\u2019ve known it was bad for years. age isn\u2019t an excuse,\" commented someone else.\n\nHarrison's \"Love Island\" and \"Challenge\" costar, Theo Campbell, defended her on Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t going to say anything as it\u2019s BS to me. But think, loveisland is 10x bigger over here then (sic) the challenge is in the U.S. if anyone thought she was being racist it would have been picked up on it already. @georgiaharisonx is away filming atm so can\u2019t tell us who she was,\" Campbell said in since-deleted tweets.\n\n\"She\u2019s one the biggest pro LBGT people, she\u2019s all about equality and is one of the least racist people you\u2019ll ever come across. So leave it out. Look at the low life other challengers trying to shade her name as they didn\u2019t get along with her..\"", "description": "\"The Challenge\"\u00a0star\u00a0Georgia Harrison was accused of wearing blackface makeup when an old photo resurfaced of the reality TV star.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/thechal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
