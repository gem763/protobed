But only a little over 250,000 of them have provision that is legally enforceable in the form of an Education, Health and Care Plan.\n\nThe individualised plans are designed to help children with conditions such as autism access classroom support.\n\nBut campaigners say cash-strapped local authorities avoid issuing the plans, and families are often forced to find lawyers to fight their case for an EHCP.\n\nWithout it, many young people are left unable to cope with the curriculum and struggling with anxiety.\n\nThree years ago Danyal\u2019s anxiety was so bad he threatened to take his own life.\n\nMum Nazma, 36, said: \u201cHe would come home and tell us he wanted to die. He would beg us, \u2018Please don\u2019t force me to go to school\u2019.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking then and it is still very difficult for us now. He is only a small child, but I worry every day that my son might take his own life.\u201d\n\nDanyal attends Avenue Primary School, in Newham, East London, and struggles to cope in a large, busy classroom. Nazma said: \u201cEvery day is a difficult day at school for Danyal.\n\n\u201cHis needs cannot be met and there is sensory overload in a big classroom with no specialised understanding of his condition.\u201d\n\n(Image: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror)\n\nNazma, and delivery driver husband Saleem, 38, who is also autistic, have battled to get their son\u2019s profound needs met. Nazma noticed Danyal\u2019s challenges within weeks of giving birth.\n\nShe said: \u201cI took him to the GP when he was three and mentioned autism, but was told, \u2018You don\u2019t want your child labelled\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhen she took Danyal to a pre-school, it was disastrous. \u201cHe had scratches on his face when I picked him up, and the teachers told me, \u2018He doesn\u2019t get on well with other children\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe transition to primary school in 2013 was also stressful, but teachers saw Danyal struggling and he was diagnosed with autism in 2016.\n\nThe school helped Nazma apply to Newham Council for an EHCP assessment in 2017, which was turned down on the basis Danyal was supported well enough without one.\n\nDaily meltdowns and school refusals suggested otherwise and Nazma fought on until Danyal was assessed. But when he was refused an EHCP, Nazma had to go to a tribunal. She lost and is now preparing another appeal.\n\nThe EHCP replaced a system from the 1980s that assessed Special Educational Needs and Disability children.\n\nThe parents of many children who have switched to EHCPs complain they have been left with lower levels of intervention because of inadequate plans.\n\nSome SEND children have lost statutory protection entirely and a rushed 2018 transition deadline left an estimated 21,000 children without EHCPs.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Post)\n\nThe Education Select Committee report has now called for \u201cradical change\u201d to \u201censure the 2014 Act delivers\u201d.\n\nThe Department for Education said it \u201crecently announced a \u00a3780million increase to local authorities\u2019 high needs funding\u201d. Newham Council\u2019s Cllr Julianne Marriott, cabinet member for education, said it had spent an extra \u00a31.3million this year supporting SEND children.\n\nShe said the select committee\u2019s report was \u201cabsolutely right to highlight that the Department for Education has failed to provide funding where it has been desperately needed.\u201d\n\nNazma, who also has a daughter Sara, two, and year-old son Zakariya, said: \u201cLocal authorities put all their efforts into fighting parents while our children suffer badly in the crossfire. There can be no future for my son until they see this.\u201d\n\nCOMMENT: Many local authority decisions 'unlawful'\n\nWe represent 200 clients a year at the SEND Tribunal and have a 97% success rate. That\u2019s not me saying, \u2018We\u2019re fantastic\u2019. It\u2019s showing how bad and unlawful a lot of council decisions are.\n\nAcross the country, local authorities are obliterating the legal time scales, and schools and councils are giving parents wrong information. There is not enough money or training in the system.\n\nIn mainstream schools, Special Educational Needs Coordinators are trained by the council and local authorities are not going to tell staff to refer children for EHCPs because they cost money.\n\nEven if children have EHCPs, due to poor training or a lack of funds, schools don\u2019t know what to do with them.\n\nCouncils routinely turn down requests, thinking if they refuse 10 and only three appeal, they are saving money on seven.\n\nWe are in a horrible system where if you\u2019ve got the money for good legal representation you can get what you want. Legal aid is hardly ever available in this area.\n\nThe average cost of our services is \u00a37,000 to \u00a310,000 for a full tribunal appeal. Our clients are not flying private jets, they are re-mortgaging houses, but they don\u2019t see any other way.\n\nAnd there are more appeals in the system than ever. Hearings are adjourned at a moment\u2019s notice because the system is so overloaded. This is hugely emotional for parents and children, many of whom have to be home educated while they wait.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Danyal, 10, is just one of a million special needs children betrayed by system in 'major social injustice' according to report", "authors": ["Sharon Hendry", "Image", "Phil Harris Daily Mirror", "Birmingham Post"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700035.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Phil-HarrisDaily-Mirror.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
