It would help if she had a clue what capitalism is all about.\n\nA President Warren would seek to regulate big tech companies as utilities, break up big banks and split them from securities dealers, ban fracking of oil and gas, phase out carbon emission from buildings, cars and power plants in eight to 15 years, require big companies to appoint worker representatives to at least 40% of board seats, ban private health insurance and, effectively, for-profit college, and negotiate down drug prices.\n\nHer policies would directly affect companies with sales of nearly $5 trillion and stock-market value of more than $8 trillion, a third of the S&P 500 stock index. Taxes on the wealthy and corporations would rise sharply.\n\n\u201cShe could create an environment where it is next to impossible to function\u201d for health insurers, said Vicky Gregg, a former chief executive of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee and now partner in a private-equity firm. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that keeps you up at night if you\u2019re a health-plan executive.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren, in laying out her case, has said she is \u201ca capitalist to my bones,\u201d whereas fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love what markets can do, I love what functioning economies can do. They are what make us rich, they are what create opportunity,\u201d Ms. Warren said on CNBC last year. \u201cBut only fair markets, markets with rules. Markets without rules is about the rich take it all, it\u2019s about the powerful get all of it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s gone wrong in America.\u201d", "description": "Businesses are bracing for for sweeping changes, none of it .10/10/2019 14:22:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/cc6f9a97-a90c-4abb-a299-385090b48051.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
