Their appeal lies in their income stability through long leases, and the asset value is backed by physical property that is still worth something in the event of a downturn.\n\nWhen scouting around for suitable REITs in which to invest, aside from looking for those with strong sponsors, I also watch out for REITs that manage to increase their year-on-year distribution per unit (DPU). A DPU increase is a reflection of business growth for the REIT and signals that rental rates and occupancy levels are healthy and improving.\n\nHere are three REITs that recently reported year-on-year increases in DPU.\n\n1. Mapletree Commercial Trust\n\nMapletree Commercial Trust (SGX: N21U) is a Singapore-focused REIT that invests in a portfolio of properties used for office and/or retail purposes. Its portfolio consists of five assets: VivoCity, Mapletree Business City (MBA) Phase 1, PSA Building, Mapletree Anson, and MLHF.\n\nIn its Q2 2020 earnings, MCT reported a 1.9% year-on-year increase in gross revenue, while DPU increased by 2.2% year on year to 2.32 Singapore cents. Annualised forward distribution yield stands at around 3.9%, and MCT has also announced the proposed acquisition of MBC Phase 2 for S$1.55 billion. This acquisition is expected to lift pro-forma FY 2018/2019 DPU by 4% and increase pro-forma NAV per unit by 2.2%.\n\n2. Keppel DC REIT\n\nKeppel DC REIT (SGX: AJBU) is the first pure-play data centre REIT in Asia. As of 30 September 2019, the REIT\u2019s portfolio consists of 15 high-quality data centres with an aggregate lettable area of around 1.1 million square feet. The portfolio spans 10 cities in eight countries across Asia-Pacific and Europe.\n\nIn its recent Q3 2019 earnings, KDCR reported a slight decline in gross revenue, down by 2.5% year on year. However, DPU rose 4.3% year on year to 1.93 Singapore cents for the quarter. KDCR is also in the process of acquiring two additional data centres in Singapore by Q4 2019 that will increase the portfolio to a total of 17 data centres.\n\n3. SPH REIT\n\nSPH REIT (SGX: SK6U) is a Singapore-based REIT that invests in a portfolio of income-producing real estate used primarily for retail purposes. The REIT currently has a portfolio of four assets in Singapore and Australia. The Singapore properties consist of Paragon Mall, The Clementi Mall, and The Rail Mall, while the Australian property is an 85% stake in Figtree Grove Shopping Centre.\n\nSPH REIT reported its full-year 2019 earnings for the fiscal year ended 31 August 2019. For Q4 2019, gross revenue was up 10.2% year on year to S$58.4 million, while DPU increased by 2.1% year on year to 1.46 Singapore cents.\n\nMore reading\n\nThe information provided is for general information purposes only and is not intended to be personalized investment or financial advice.
