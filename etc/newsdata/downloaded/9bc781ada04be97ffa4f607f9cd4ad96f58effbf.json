Elizabeth Warren is proposing a federal ban on all fundraising activities hosted by lobbyists as part of a new, broad set of anticorruption proposals, adding weight to a theme that has underpinned her White House bid.\n\nThe plan, outlined Monday morning on the blog site Medium, builds on anticorruption legislation Ms. Warren announced last year. It adds the new lobbying prohibitions, as well as a ban to prevent senior executive branch officials and members of Congress from serving on for-profit boards\u2014whether or not they receive compensation from such positions. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, unveiled the proposal ahead of one of the splashiest events of her presidential campaign: an evening speech at New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park.\n\nThe ideas are unlikely to become law while Republicans control the Senate and the White House. GOP lawmakers have generally lined up against similar proposals, citing constitutional concerns. And any new restrictions on registered lobbyists could lead to more Washington operatives deciding not to register, instead referring to themselves as consultants or strategic advisers.\n\nBut such appeals to the idea that Washington is corrupt could pay off at the ballot box in 2020. In a WSJ/NBC News poll conducted last fall ahead of the midterm elections, 77% of all respondents said reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington ranked as either the most important or a very important factor in deciding which candidate should get their vote. The only issue that ranked higher was the economy. Many Democrats who won House seats in 2018 campaigned on decreasing the influence of money in politics.\n\n\u201cLook closely, and you\u2019ll see\u2014on issue after issue, widely popular policies are stymied because giant corporations and billionaires who don\u2019t want to pay taxes or follow any rules use their money and influence to stand in the way of big, structural change,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote Monday.\n\nMs. Warren is also pushing to alter the definition of a \u201cthing of value\u201d in campaign finance laws to include tangible benefits made for campaign purposes, in what appeared to be a nod to President Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in November 2018 that Mr. Trump intervened to suppress stories about alleged sexual encounters with women, including the former Playboy model Karen McDougal and the former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels, citing interviews with three dozen people, court papers, corporate records and other documents. The president\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, told a federal judge that Mr. Trump had directed him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty in August 2018 to eight criminal charges, including campaign-finance violations. Mr. Trump has denied the encounters.\n\nMs. Warren is additionally proposing making it harder for corporations to seal settlements of product liability litigation, something Democrats have called for in the past, notably in 2014 following a faulty ignition switch installed on 2.6 million General Motors vehicles.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "description": "The plan builds on anticorruption legislation Sen.
