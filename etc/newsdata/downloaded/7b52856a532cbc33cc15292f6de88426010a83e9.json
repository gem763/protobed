After all, don\u2019t they know how the communist world collapsed?\n\nAren\u2019t they aware of the problems in places such as Greece and Venezuela?\n\nOr, to make it personal, don\u2019t they have any inkling of the fact that they are going to get screwed by entitlement programs?\n\nAnd what about the fact that they lose out because of Obamacare?\n\nSadly, it appears many of them haven\u2019t learned the right lesson.\n\nSupport for socialism is disturbingly high among the young.\n\nI\u2019ve wondered, only half-jokingly, whether they\u2019re too clueless to vote.\n\nDavid Grasso opines on this topic for the New York Post.\n\nIt\u2019s important to look at the typical millennial trajectory, and why unprecedented government intervention into our daily lives is now widely seen as the only solution to the problems that bedevil us as a generation. \u2026the only choice was to go to a college or university. We took this journey on the faith that a college education would give us the necessary skills to kick-start our careers. After graduation, we quickly found out that our alma maters did little to prepare us to be job-ready. \u2026Just as we get our first student-loan bill, we find ourselves navigating unpaid and low-paid internships\u2026 The next predictable step is working a service-industry job that doesn\u2019t require a degree while trying to get set up in a city with job openings in our fields. Yet a booming job market often also means a housing horror show. Misguided housing policies in places like New York, Los Angeles, Washington and San Francisco have created such a tight market that it is often financially impossible for a young person to move there. \u2026We pay through the nose for health insurance, have zero job security and pray we advance as soon as possible. \u2026Many of us are eternally disappointed with the unjust system that blocked us from doing things past generations did, like get married, have kids and have a lovely oak-shaded, picket-fence life.\n\nGrasso notes that government is the underlying problem.\n\nThen we turn on our streaming services and find politicians who seem to understand us, who are tapping into the spirit of a generation that\u2019s reacting to the post-Great Recession era. \u2026Given such a journey, it is easy to see why socialism seduces young Americans. We desperately need change if we are ever going to progress as a generation. The problem is, what the socialists are proposing \u2014 more government \u2014 is exactly the opposite of what we need. In fact, many of the most prominent obstacles we have faced are the result, at least in part, of heavy-handed government interference. \u2026Truth is, young people need exactly the opposite of socialism \u2014 pro-growth policies and restrained, common-sense regulation. This will create more economic opportunities and more avenues into the middle class. Socialist policies will only choke economic opportunity and make our tough existence far worse.\n\nMore young people need to reach this conclusion.\n\nAt least if this horrifying poll is even close to accurate.\n\nIn other words, it seems like Americans are morphing into Europeans.\n\nP.S. For what it\u2019s worth, there is some polling data indicating young people aren\u2019t totally hopeless.", "description": "I\u2019ve\u00a0opined that statist policies harm young people.I also shared this .10/07/2019 15:56:26PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
