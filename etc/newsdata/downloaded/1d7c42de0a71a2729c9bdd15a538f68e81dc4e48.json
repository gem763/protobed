He told the New York Times that he gave the speech in order to explain his views on free expression, and lay out a future path for Facebook after he is no longer in charge.\"I hope this is a moment for us to put our place in history in perspective,\" he told The Times.\n\nIn the speech, Zuckerberg described Facebook as a platform that gives users two important things: \"voice and inclusion.\" He then referenced well-known social movements in which people used their voices, implicitly comparing them to Facebook.\n\n\"More people being able to share their perspectives has always been necessary to build a more inclusive society,\" Zuckerberg said, as he proceeded to quote Frederick Douglass and to reference the Civil Rights Movement and the Enlightenment. He also mentioned that #blacklivesmatter first appeared as a hashtag on Facebook.\n\nRead more: Facebook made the unusual decision to push back directly on Elizabeth Warren and her criticism of the company, but its attempt to defend itself backfired spectacularly\n\nNot everyone was convinced by Zuckerberg's attempt to include Facebook in the story of broader social movements. Vanita Gupta, President of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told the New York Times, \"Mark Zuckerberg is co-opting civil rights history to try to justify Facebook's policies that do long-term damage to our democracy.\"\n\nFacebook is under fire for its policy of running political ads with misinformation, exempting them from the normal third-party fact-checking process. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been particularly critical, and breaking up Facebook is a major part of her platform. Last week, she ran a fake Facebook ad claiming that Zuckerberg supports Trump's reelection, and the company tried to call her out on Facebook, which did not go well for them.\n\nDespite backlash against the policy, Zuckerberg maintained that he and Facebook don't want to \"censor politicians or the news in a democracy.\" Last week, after Politico published records of off-the-record dinners Zuckerberg had with Conservative leaders and politicians, Zuckerberg posted that \"hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\" and told others to try it.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg explained his beliefs on free speech, which he hopes will guide Facebook after he no longer runs it.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8b4a74af90907f72eb9b6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
