They also pledged to boycott productions and to lobby their schools to follow suit.\n\nIn a statement on the RSC website, artistic director Gregory Doran and executive director Catherine Mallyon said the decision was taken after many months of \"careful and often difficult debate\" with staff, audiences, artists and others.\n\n\"Central to our organizational values is that we listen to and respond to the views of young people,\" they added. \"Each year we actively engage 500,000 children and young people with Shakespeare's plays.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Amidst the climate emergency, which we recognise, young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC. We cannot ignore that message.\"\n\nTim Minchin and the cast of the RSC's hit musical 'Matilda' on stage at the BBC Proms in London's Hyde Park on September 10, 2016.

We recognize the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to transition rapidly to net-zero in the coming decades.\"\n\n\"Ironically,\" it added, \"the increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed. This global challenge needs everyone -- companies, governments and individuals -- to work together to achieve a low carbon future.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Mark Rylance, one of the RSC's biggest stars, resigned over the partnership. Writing in The Guardian newspaper at the time, the Oscar-winning actor said: \"I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who willfully destroys the lives of others alive and unborn. Nor, I believe, would William Shakespeare.\"\n\nOscar-winning actor Mark Rylance cut ties with the RSC earlier this year.

This seismic shift is testament to the actors, activists and school strikers who have powerfully shone a spotlight on BP's business and how, even now, the company remains 97% invested in fossil fuels.\"\n\nBut more remains to be done, Garrard said.", "description": "The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has said it is dropping its long-term sponsor, BP, a week after British school students wrote to the theatrical organization threatening a boycott.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002132603-01-royal-shakespeare-company-theatre-file-super-tease.jpg"}
