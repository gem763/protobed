Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) also dodged the question during an appearance on ABC. Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) made headlines earlier in the week for repeatedly refusing to answer similar questions.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) responded \"of course not\" when asked by CBS' Margaret Brennan if it was appropriate for Trump to ask China to investigate Biden's family.\n\n\"Elections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it's not the business of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections,\" Cruz added, without mentioning Trump by name.\n\nRepublicans have generally been reluctant to answer questions about whether it was proper for Trump to solicit foreign assistance, instead attacking House Democrats over how they\u2019re conducting the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere should be a process, but instead what Adam Schiff wants is to get United States of America drunk on his favorite cocktail,\u201d Zeldin said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201c \u201cThere's three ingredients. One is cherry-picking leaks, second is withholding facts, and three is just outright lying.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also have been pressuring Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold an impeachment inquiry vote on the House floor, citing precedent in past presidential impeachments. But Pelosi has refused, saying there\u2019s no constitutional or legal requirement to do so.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he\u2019s fine with holding an inquiry vote, but doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\u201cThis idea that the process is, somehow not, is not fair is just a fiction designed to avoid the question of whether the conduct of the president is good or not,\u201d Himes said on ABC.\n\nRepublicans have had equal access to witnesses during closed-door depositions, Himes argued, comparing the inquiry to a grand jury investigation.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is more akin to a grand jury indictment, and in a grand jury indictment, it happens behind closed doors, there aren\u2019t cross-examinations, evidence is presented,\u201d Himes said. \u201cif there is a trial in the Senate, [Republicans] will be afforded all of the other due process that they have and will always be entitled to.\u201d\n\nLawmakers return to the Capitol on Tuesday after a two-week break that saw a flurry of activity on the House side as investigators heard closed-door testimony from multiple current and former administration officials involved in the Ukraine controversy.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified Friday that she was abruptly forced out of her role earlier this year after a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d by people \u201cwith clearly questionable motives.\u201d Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony was remarkable because it came in defiance of a State Department directive to block House impeachment investigators\u2019 access to administration officials and documents related to the probe.\n\nYovanovitch instead agreed to comply with a House subpoena to attend. Similarly, lawmakers will hear much anticipated testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, on Thursday. Sondland was subpoenaed following his failure to show up for a scheduled deposition earlier this week at the direction of the State Department.\n\nDemocrats are eager to hear directly from Sondland and what role he played in trying to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son in exchange for $400 million in U.S. military aide and a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nIn a cache of damning text messages released last week by Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s former envoy to Ukraine, Sondland told the other officials involved that \u201cpotus really wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nIn a later text exchange, when another official says its \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold U.S. military aid as part of a pressure campaign to help damage Trump\u2019s political rival, Sondland responds hours later insisting that there are \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly pointed to Sondland\u2019s response in an effort to defend the president, saying without a quid pro quo, there isn\u2019t any proof that Trump or his allies committed a crime. The White House earlier this week announced a full blockade of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, calling it an \u201cillegitimate\u201d effort. But Sondland, like Yovanovitch, is expected to defy the administration\u2019s directive.\n\nSondland plans to tell House investigators later this week that his text response came at the direction of the president, after a telephone conversation with Trump, and he doesn\u2019t know if the president was telling the truth, according to a report in the Washington Post.\n\nLawmakers are also expecting to hear testimony from Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top adviser on Russia, on Monday.\n\nAnd Democrats have set several deadlines this week for the administration to hand over documents related to the probe \u2014 including from Vice President Mike Pence, the Pentagon, the Office of Management and Budget and Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and a key figure in the probe \u2014 although they aren\u2019t expecting much.\n\nBut Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on CBS on Sunday that his department will \"do everything we can to comply\" with Democrats' subpoena.\n\nPelosi and other top Democrats have refused to put a firm timeline on the inquiry, saying only they want to move \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d But privately, Democrats say they hope to wrap up their investigation \u2014 including a potential House vote on articles of impeachment \u2014 by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of this inquiry is to save the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Pelosi told Democrats on a private call Friday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve said before Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the county. But our Constitution is worth it.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Rep.
