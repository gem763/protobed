It was personal for him but business for me.\n\n\"I told him he is a hell of a fighter, but he didn't want to talk to me.\"\n\nLook at this Beautiful defense from Shakur Stevenson . Im telling you hes going to be on that p4p list at some point.#boxing#StevensonGonzalez#espn#toprankpic.twitter.com/7olvyD2oHM \u2014 Chris Deep (@Xdeep13) October 27, 2019\n\nCongrats to the new WBO Featherweight World Champion, Shakur Stevenson (13-0, 7 KOs), who defeated Joet Gonzalez (23-1, 14 KOs) by unanimous decision on Saturday night at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada.

Gonzalez, meanwhile, falls to 23-1 after the first defeat of his career.", "description": "American featherweight Shakur Stevenson came out on top in a feud writ large on the world stage to beat his girlfriend's brother, Joet Gonzalez, to win his first ever world title in Nevada on Saturday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db592f885f5404e500ea083.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-14"}
