Those targeted were notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now constitute potential security violations, according to letters reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nIn virtually all of the cases, potentially sensitive information, now recategorized as \u201cclassified,\u201d was sent to Clinton\u2019s unsecure inbox.\n\nState Department investigators began contacting the former officials about 18 months ago, after President Trump\u2019s election, and then seemed to drop the effort before picking it up in August, officials said.\n\nSenior State Department officials said that they are following standard protocol in an investigation that began during the latter days of the Obama administration and is nearing completion.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with who is in the White House,\u201d said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing probe. \u201cThis is about the time it took to go through millions of emails, which is about 3\u00bd years.\u201d\n\nTo many of those under scrutiny, including some of the Democratic Party\u2019s top foreign policy experts, the recent flurry of activity surrounding the Clinton email case represents a new front on which the Trump administration could be accused of employing the powers of the executive branch against perceived political adversaries.\n\nThe existence of the probe follows revelations that the president used multiple levers of his office to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would produce damaging information about Democrats, including potential presidential rival Joe Biden.\n\n[Trump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help on Biden, memo shows]\n\nState Department officials vigorously denied there was any political motivation behind their actions, and said that the reviews of retroactively classified emails were conducted by career bureaucrats who did not know the names of the subjects being investigated.\n\n\u201cThe process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias,\u201d said a second senior State Department official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the mechanics of an internal probe.\n\nClinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her term as secretary triggered multiple investigations by the State Department, the FBI and Congress. The bureau did not accuse her of breaking the law, but she blamed the FBI\u2019s unusual public handling of the matter as a major factor in her loss in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that this is just routine, but something strange is going on,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman, a former assistant secretary for Near East Affairs. In early 2018 Feltman received a letter informing him that a half dozen of his messages included classified information. Then a few weeks ago he was found culpable for more than 50 emails that contained classified information.\n\n\u201cA couple of the emails cited by State as problems were sent after my May 2012 retirement, when I was already working for the United Nations,\u201d he said.\n\nA former senior U.S. official familiar with the email investigation described it as a way for Republicans \u201cto keep the Clinton email issue alive.\u201d The former official said the probe was \u201ca way to tarnish a whole bunch of Democratic foreign policy people\u201d and discourage if not prevent them from returning to government service.\n\nThe probe is being carried out by investigators from the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Republican lawmakers, led by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), have been pressing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to complete the review of classified information sent to Clinton\u2019s private emails and report back to Congress.\n\nState Department officials said they were bound by law to adjudicate any violations.\n\nFormer Obama administration officials, however, described the probe as a remarkably aggressive crackdown by an administration with its own troubled record of handling classified material. Trump has improperly disclosed classified information to foreign officials and used phones that national security officials warned were vulnerable to foreign surveillance, according to current and former officials.\n\nAt the same time, Trump overrode the concerns of his former White House chief of staff and U.S. intelligence officials to give his son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner access to highly classified materials, officials said.\n\nThe list of State officials being questioned includes prominent ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state responsible for U.S. policy in the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia. But it also includes dozens of current and former career bureaucrats who served as conduits for outside officials trying to get important messages to Clinton.\n\nIn most cases the bureaucrats and political appointees didn\u2019t send the emails directly to Clinton, but passed them to William Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state, or Jake Sullivan, the former director of policy planning at the State Department. Burns and Sullivan then forwarded the messages to Clinton\u2019s private email.\n\nBurns and Sullivan declined to comment. Other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter and concern for retaliation.\n\nThose targeted began receiving letters in August, saying, \u201cYou have been identified as possibly bearing some culpability\u201d in supposedly newly uncovered \u201csecurity incidents,\u201d according to a copy of one letter obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nIn many cases, the incidents appear to center on the sending of information attributed to foreign officials, including summaries of phone conversations with foreign diplomats \u2014 a routine occurrence among State Department employees.\n\nThere is no indication in any of the materials reviewed by The Post that the emails under scrutiny contained sensitive information about classified U.S. initiatives or programs. In one case, a former official was asked to explain dozens of messages dating back to 2009 that contained messages that foreign officials wanted relayed rapidly to Washington at a time when U.S. Foreign Service officers were equipped with BlackBerrys and other devices that were not capable of sending classified transmissions. The messages came in through \u201cregular email\u201d and then were forwarded through official \u2014 though unclassified \u2014 State Department channels.\n\nIn other instances officials were relaying email summaries of time-sensitive conversations with foreign leaders conducted over unclassified cellphones.\n\nThose communications are now being \u201cupclassified\u201d or \u201creclassified,\u201d according to several officials involved in the investigation, meaning that they have been retroactively assessed to contain material so sensitive that they should have been sent only on State Department classified systems.\n\nMany of those who have been targeted by the probe and found \u201cnot culpable,\u201d described it as an effort to harass diplomats for the routine conduct of their job.\n\n\u201cIt is such an obscene abuse of power and time involving so many people for so many years,\u201d one former U.S. official said of the inquiry. \u201cThis has just sucked up people\u2019s lives for years and years.\u201d\n\nSeveral of those who have been questioned said that the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security investigators made it clear that they were pursuing the matter reluctantly, and under external pressure.\n\nOne official said the investigators were apologetic: \u201cThey realize how absurd it is.\u201d\n\nThose targeted do not appear to be in jeopardy of criminal prosecution \u2014 the FBI investigation of the Clinton email case has been closed since before the 2016 election. But many fear the results of the probe will damage their reputations and complicate their ability to maintain security clearances.\n\nSeveral said they have received follow-on letters saying that investigators \u201cdetermined that the [security] incident is valid,\u201d but that they did not \u201cbear any individual culpability\u201d \u2014 an ambiguous designation that could pose complications in future background checks and confirmation hearings.\n\n\u201cIt gives them a way to hassle pretty much anyone,\u201d a former senior U.S. official said.\n\nIn many instances, the officials said that it had been so long since they had been questioned that they assumed the email case had been resolved, even though Trump routinely rails about the Clinton email issue.\n\nTrump raised the issue as recently as Wednesday, calling it \u201cone of the great crimes committed\u201d by his 2016 opponent.\n\nTrump faces impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in the wake of a whistleblower report by a CIA officer exposing Trump\u2019s efforts on a July 25 call to pressure the leader of Ukraine to pursue investigations that Trump hoped would generate embarrassing material about Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s request for that \u201cfavor\u201d came as his administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Kiev and dangling a potential White House visit for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe FBI began examining Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server in July 2015, based on a referral from the intelligence community inspector general. Their investigation sought to determine whether anyone \u2014 especially the former secretary of state \u2014 had broken federal law in discussing classified information on unclassified systems.\n\nInvestigators reviewed 30,000 emails that Clinton turned back over to the State Department after leaving others, and took other steps, including tracking down computers and other devices Clinton had used, to find thousands more. Their investigation included examinations of the archived government accounts of people who had been in government at the same time as Clinton and who might have naturally exchanged messages with her.\n\nAlthough Clinton was considered the biggest player in the investigation, she was never formally labeled a subject or target, and investigators also considered the conduct of her top aides and colleagues.\n\nAbout a year later, in July 2016, then-FBI Director James B. Comey announced he was recommending the case be closed with no charges. He said Clinton\u2019s and her aides\u2019 handling of classified information was \u201cextremely careless,\u201d but not such that it warranted criminal charges. He suggested those who did wrong could face job-related consequences, and took a broad swipe at the State Department, saying its employees\u2019 use of unclassified email systems was \u201cgenerally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government,\u201d according to his prepared remarks.\n\nA few months later, the bureau resumed the inquiry after discovering more of Clinton\u2019s correspondence with a top aide on a device investigators were examining in a separate investigation of the aide\u2019s husband. But they found nothing to change their conclusion and closed the case again just before the 2016 election.\n\nPaul Sonne, Shane Harris, Matt Zapotosky and Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "description": "As many as 130 officials have been questioned in recent weeks by State Department investigators.", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence", "Greg Jaffe", "National Security Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "September At Pm", "Greg Miller Is A National Security Correspondent For The Washington Post", "A Two-Time Winner Of The Pulitzer Prize.
