The Washington Times takes a weekly look at some of them that may have flown under the radar.\n\nFormer Rep. John Delaney released a plan Thursday to enhance digital privacy, with his campaign saying he wants to follow California\u2019s lead in guaranteeing the public the right to know whether their electronic devices are being tracked or their personal information being shared.\n\n\u201cSo much of our lives, from our personal data to our finances, are now online and we need new consumer protections to ensure that our privacy is protected,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \u201cThe cost of doing nothing is not nothing. We aren\u2019t serving the people when we have telegraph-era laws in a smartphone age.\u201d\n\nHe would grant individuals the explicit right to sue companies that violate their digital privacy, and would prevent collection of personal data of anyone under age 16 without consent.\n\nMr. Delaney also wants to prevent companies from using smartphones to monitor people\u2019s facial expressions without their consent, and partner with the private sector to develop ways to try to prevent artificial intelligence from inheriting human bias in their automatic decision-making.\n\nHis campaign said that laws protecting privacy related to communications devices should extend to smart speakers like Alexa or Google Home or smart interactive toys marketed to children.\n\nBennet on education\n\nSen. Michael Bennet on Thursday announced a plan to create universal pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, longer school days for K-12 students, and free community college for high school graduates.\n\nMr. Bennet would set up a federal-state partnership with a goal of expanding free preschool nationwide to all 4-year-olds by 2024 and to 3-year-olds by 2027, hoping to have them better prepared to start learning in primary school.\n\nOn the other end, he wants to create \u201cRegional Opportunity Compacts\u201d to connect the skills students learn in school to what they need to enter the workforce. He would spend $10 billion a year over five years to support 500 compacts.\n\nMr. Bennet\u2019s campaign said he wants the federal government to join with states to provide free community college for all Americans, and increase Pell grant funding to make four-year college debt-free for students in families earning about $75,000 per year or less.\n\nAs a former Denver Public Schools superintendent, he expressed frustration that education hasn\u2019t played a bigger role in the presidential debates.\n\n\u201cWhen education has been raised, it\u2019s been about busing from 50 years ago, free college, or relieving all student debt,\u201d the Colorado Democrat said. \u201cWhat we should be hearing about, instead, is how to make free preschool a reality for every kid in America, and how to prepare the 70% of kids who don\u2019t graduate from college to earn a living wage.\u201d\n\nBullock on rural America\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock would create a Rural Affairs office in the White House and steer more funding toward eco-friendly farming techniques, as part of a new plan to boost rural communities.\n\n\u201cFolks shouldn\u2019t have to leave their home, their church, or their community to succeed in America,\u201d Mr. Bullock said Wednesday. \u201cWashington has paid lip service to small and rural communities for too long \u2014 they deserve a leader in the White House who will lead with action.\u201d\n\nHe would halt President Trump\u2019s tariffs, which farmers say has left them struggling to sell to markets like China, where the government has retaliated against Mr. Trump\u2019s moves with new levies on U.S. agricultural exports.\n\nAnd Mr. Bullock would insist on stricter adherence to renewable fuel standards, which could be a boon for corn growers, who benefit from sales of ethanol for gasoline. The Trump administration has granted too many waivers, Democrats and some farmers argue.\n\nThe governor included a bold plan for a two-year \u201cpause\u201d on proposed mergers of agricultural companies, on the argument that corporate consolidation in markets like poultry and beef have harmed both farmers and consumers.\n\nAnd the Office of Rural Affairs he envisions adding to the White House would help coordinate the broader effort, which includes directing federal money toward farming interests that are working toward the new economy, such as converting agricultural waste products into energy.\n\nOne part of his plan would also make it easier for wealthy foreigners to buy into the path to citizenship in the U.S. if they invest in struggling communities. He would lower the threshold for investing in the \u201cgolden visa\u201d EB-5 program down from a minimum of $500,000 to just $350,000.\n\nSanders on medical debt\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders wants to cancel an estimated $81 billion in past-due debt Americans have racked up from medical bills.\n\n\u201cIn the United States of America, your financial life and future should not be destroyed because you or a member of your family gets sick,\u201d the Vermont senator said in laying out his goal last weekend. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHis campaign said that more details about the broader plan are still forthcoming, but that under the proposal the federal government would negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections that have been reported by credit agencies.\n\nMr. Sanders would also repeal parts of a 2005 law his campaign said has made it more difficult for Americans to declare bankruptcy, including for medical reasons, and allow \u201cother existing and future medical debt to be discharged.\u201d\n\nHis campaign also said the plan would ensure that people\u2019s credit scores won\u2019t be negatively affected by unpaid medical bills.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
