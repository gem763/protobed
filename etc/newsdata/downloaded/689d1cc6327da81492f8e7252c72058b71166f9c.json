(Isaac Olson/CBC)\n\nShould people listen to music during sex?\n\nNo, concentrate on the partner that you're with, Dr. Ruth said.\n\n\"But, if the two of you are hooked on music, use it!\"\n\nShe just hopes people don't listen to tragic love songs during sex \u2014 play romantic and positive ones.\n\nIs the G-spot real?\n\nA 24-year-old male caller wanted to know if there's really a G-spot.\n\nDr. Ruth said there's no scientifically validated data on the presence of a G-spot.\n\n\"Stop looking for it,\" she said.\n\n\"If some Canadian comes up with scientific data, I would be the first to read it and come back here and talk about it.\"\n\n\"Men, women, stop looking for it,\" she said.\n\nHow do you fix a very low sex drive?\n\nThere's no one answer, unfortunately.\n\n\"You have to go see a gynecologist,\" Dr. Ruth said. \"Maybe it's something that has nothing to do with sex.\"\n\nShe urged the 29-year-old female caller to make an appointment with her gynecologist right away \u2014 and not to feel embarrassed about it.\n\n\"Have the courage to stand up and say, 'I can't get into it,'\" she said.\n\nWatch the full Radio Noon program featuring Dr. Ruth here:\n\nAre dating apps bad?\n\nDr. Ruth said she's worried apps and online communication are ruining the art of conversation \u2014 but beyond that, she likes dating apps.\n\n\"I'm all for the apps because I don't want people to be lonely,\" she said.\n\nStill, she advises would-be couples not to first meet in secluded places.\n\n\"If you meet in public, you can use a white lie to get out,\" she said.\n\nShe encouraged people to be clear about if there will be another date.\n\n\"Don't say, 'I will talk to you again.' Don't say, 'I will see you again.'\"\n\nWhat do you do if you haven't dated in a while?\n\n\"Go buy a vibrator to not be sexually frustrated,\" Dr. Ruth said.\n\n\"If you are out, and see someone that you like, get closer to them. Ask them to go for coffee. But be prepared for a 'No.'\"\n\nShe said that staying positive is important when looking for a good date.\n\n\"Say, 'Wasn't that a great play? Or, wasn't that a great concert?' So you don't feel it was a wasted evening,\" she said.\n\n\"But don't sit in your living room, waiting for a prince to appear on a white horse.\"", "description": "The 91-year-old sex expert visited CBC Montreal to answer your questions about sex and intimacy.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332741.1571908347!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dr-ruth.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
