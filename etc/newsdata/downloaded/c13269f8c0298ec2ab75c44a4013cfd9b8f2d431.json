Milwaukee, which won its fifth in a row, closed within one game of the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\n\u201cI just heard. That\u2019s not good,\u201d Cubs manager Joe Maddon said after a 9-8 loss in 10 innings at San Diego. \u201cListen, I always want to beat other teams at their best, so that\u2019s a tough one right there.\u201d\n\nYelich fouled a ball off his leg in the first inning. He was down on the ground for several minutes before limping off the field.\n\nYelich hit .329 with 44 home runs and 97 RBIs along with 30 stolen bases this season. The outfielder was leading the majors in slugging percentage and OPS when he was hurt.\n\n\u201cWe feel awful for Christian,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that resonates with me right now. He\u2019s a special player and it\u2019s a joy to watch him play every day. He\u2019s the best at what he does. Not being able to see that every day is not good.\u201d\n\nThe team learned the severity of his injury by the middle of the game.\n\n\u201cI went out there and his whole body was shaking,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cI was concerned and when he got up and went down the stairs I was optimistic. Then we got the bad news.\u201d\n\nTrent Grisham continued Yelich\u2019s at-bat with a 1-2 count and struck out - the strikeout was charged to Yelich.\n\n\u201cObviously awful, we all know Yeli and what kind of guy he is,\u201d said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who had Yelich in his final two seasons in Miami before his trade to Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cYou hate to see a player like that get hurt down the stretch. He\u2019s stepped into the superstar realm as a player, and MVP last year. You don\u2019t want to see that happen to a team down the stretch,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was 3-all when Yasmani Grandal led off the ninth with a single off Miami reliever Adam Conley (2-9) and advanced to third on Grisham\u2019s double. Pinch-hitter Austin\u2019s fly ball to medium center was deep enough to score Grandal.\n\nJunior Guerra (9-5) got the win in two innings of relief while allowing Starlin Castro\u2019s solo homer in the eighth that tied it at 3. Drew Pomeranz pitched a scoreless ninth around two singles for his first save.\n\nHernan Perez gave the Brewers an early lead with a two-run homer in the second. He connected off Elieser Hernandez for his seventh homer of the season.\n\nIsan Diaz\u2019s RBI double in the Miami second off Chase Anderson made it 2-1.\n\nThe Brewers regained their two-run advantage on Grandal\u2019s RBI double in the third before Diaz drove in another run with a single in the fourth.\n\nGRISHAM\u2019S OPPORTUNITY\n\nGrisham will get additional playing time in Yelich\u2019s absence. The outfielder tied a team rookie game record with his five-hit outing Monday and his double continued the Brewers\u2018 go-ahead rally Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA big blow, what he means to this team and the year he\u2019s been having,\u201d Grisham said of Yelich\u2019s injury. \u201cWe wish him the fastest recovery he can get. It\u2019s exciting to help contribute and do my best to help win games.\u201d\n\nANDERSON VOTED MARLINS\u2019 MVP\n\n3B/RF Brian Anderson was chosen the Marlins\u2019 2019 Most Valuable Player by media members. Anderson, 26, currently leads the Marlins with 20 home runs, 33 doubles and an .811 OPS. His season ended on Aug. 23 after he was hit by a pitch that fractured a finger of his left hand against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBrewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (oblique) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Wednesday \u2026 SS Orlando Arcia (paternity list) will rejoin the club for the series finale Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: RHP Zach Davies (9-7, 3.69) snapped a five-game losing streak in his previous start, when he limited the Cubs to one run through five innings in a 7-1 win Sept 6.\n\nMarlins: RHP Pablo Lopez (5-8, 4.75) benefited from a 16-run support in his previous start of the season against the Brewers on June 4. Lopez pitched six shutout innings in Miami\u2019s 16-0 win.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Yelich and the Milwaukee Brewers didn't need this kind of break.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/brewers_yelich_injured_baseball_81355_c0-106-2542-1588_s1770x1032.jpg?fd455eafbc0d02eeb5c3835734ee443286407638", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
