Because there\u2019s no wing that\u2019s very large that is aligned with me,\u201d Romney said in an interview this week after a two-week recess.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been back, I have not spoken with a single senator about the impeachment process or about the implications of the process that\u2019s going on or how I would vote,\u201d he added\u2026\n\n\u201cThere are many young people who might tend to think that the Republican Party is only represented by one point of view, the president\u2019s point of view, were there not people like myself,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWe are not a pup tent\u2026 rather a much larger tent. And we can accommodate different people with different views.\u201d\n\nYet today\u2019s party is not a forum for free-flowing debate about Trump. He\u2019s still popular with the conservative base, and as the GOP looks to defend its narrow Senate majority, most Republicans are riding with the president.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
