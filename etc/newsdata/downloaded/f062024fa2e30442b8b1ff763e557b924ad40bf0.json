Turner handed down the sentence nearly three months after she found Downey guilty of second-degree assault and misconduct in office.\n\nIn the August trial, prosecutors argued that Downey purposely and maliciously beat a man who was cooperating with police while being taken into custody. Downey argued he had reacted to defend himself against what he thought was a head butt coming his way.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe his behavior was egregious,\u201d Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Aisha N. Braveboy said after the sentencing.\n\nAD\n\nDowney, 32, has been with the Prince George\u2019s police for eight years and was suspended after police learned of the incident from October 2018.\n\nThe conviction stems from the police stop of Andre Vincent Verdier, who had been found sleeping in a storage container outside a CVS in Temple Hills, Md. Verdier, who was looking for a warm place to rest, set off an alarm when he entered the container, according to court testimony.\n\nVerdier was arrested and charged with fourth-degree burglary in a case that was later dropped. While taking him into custody, officers cuffed his hands behind his back and put him in a seat belt in the front of a police cruiser.\n\nAD\n\nAfter an oral exchange between Downey and Verdier, Downey asked a fellow officer at the location whether there was a camera in a police cruiser at the scene, prosecutors said. The fellow officer said there wasn\u2019t, and Downey then began to beat Verdier in an expletive-laden rant, according to court testimony from one of the officers who testified against Downey at trial.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe public needs to trust that they won\u2019t be harmed purposefully and maliciously,\u201d Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Renee Joy said in asking for a sentence of 18 months.\n\nDowney\u2019s attorney Shaun F. Owens called the state\u2019s request \u201cthe most disproportionate and draconian\u201d recommendation he has seen in more than a decade, noting that his client has no criminal record.\n\nAD\n\nAt trial, Owens said Verdier was acting erratically during the arrest, bashing his head around the cruiser and jerking around. Downey said he struck Verdier after he thought Verdier was preparing to head butt him.\n\nOwens pushed back against prosecutors\u2019 version of events, saying there was no evidence of a \u201cvicious beating.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was an error on his part,\u201d Owens said. \u201cHe went outside the scope of the force that was allowable under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter Downey\u2019s conviction in August, Prince George\u2019s County Police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III apologized to Verdier, who was not at Friday\u2019s sentencing hearing.\n\nDowney has been suspended with pay since October 2018 and now will undergo administrative proceedings to determine his status with the department.\n\nAD", "description": "The sentence was handed down on a corporal who punched the man during an arrest.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gwHGOY9SjJt8k_aJfT2_S3HlLmA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DJ5EJGV2DEI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
