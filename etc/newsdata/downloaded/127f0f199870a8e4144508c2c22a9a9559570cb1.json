Now, with the release of her second book, Maangchi\u2019s Big Book of Korean Cooking, she\u2019s practically a YouTube legend. Here\u2019s a particularly impressive example of her influence: her dakbokkeumtang recipe was recently featured in a Bon App\u00e9tit video series where a food editor reverse-engineers famous chefs\u2019 recipes by smell, touch, and taste alone. In her monthly newsletter, Maangchi summarizes the video: \u201cThey didn\u2019t even tell him what food it was, but he tasted it blindfolded, guessed what it was and then recreated it. You know, what I was surprised about was that he said it tasted like \u2018something from Maangchi!\u2019\u201d\n\nSince Maangchi (real name: Emily Kim) started her channel in 2007, she\u2019s uploaded hundreds of recipe videos, demystifying Korean food for a global audience. The \u201cglobal\u201d part isn\u2019t an exaggeration: as soon as she uploads a video, international fans get straight to work, translating her videos in up to 50 languages. Her videos make cooking accessible for everyone, guiding home cooks every step of the way. And she does it all in a gentle, good-humored style that\u2019s led fans to call her \u201cmom,\u201d a phenomenon she noticed starting a few years ago. \u201cI love it. When you think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s like my mom. She reminds me of my mom,\u2019 it\u2019s the best compliment,\u201d she tells me.\n\nmaangchi is my mother now pic.twitter.com/QGzcTXHL1K \u2014 Mothney Reynolds (@whitneyarner) October 17, 2019\n\nFor years, fans have been tuning in for her. She\u2019s a comforting presence in her consistency, giving viewers the things they know to expect from a Maangchi video: her signature greeting, \u201cHello, everybody!\u201d in her thick, endearing Korean accent. Glitzy outfits, complete with elaborate headpieces. The occasional text that pops up on-screen to give personalities to the ingredients she cooks with. (\u201cOh, we are good looking anchovies! :)\u201d) But most importantly, it\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s an authority figure on Korean cooking \u2014 a real ajumma, a term of affection for middle-aged Korean aunties \u2014 that makes her so appealing.\n\nIt\u2019s a relief when I meet Maangchi at a Starbucks in Manhattan and discover that her real-life persona is pretty much exactly as we see her on the internet. She walked in wearing white platform stiletto heels, and after giving me a warm hug, she ordered a caramel Frappuccino with whipped cream. When her drink came out, I regretted not living with the same vigor for life, looking pitifully at my watery iced latte.\n\nIn her new book, Maangchi writes about how her videos have helped everyone from Korean adoptees who yearned to learn more about their cultures to families who have lost mothers and were brought together by food to non-Koreans who started businesses and restaurants with her recipes. Her Twitter feed is filled with retweets of her followers\u2019 faithful re-creations of her recipes, and her monthly newsletters are full of praise and positive encouragement for her viewers. She writes of a reader\u2019s rendition of her recipe: \u201cOnce I saw Brigitta\u2019s kimchi pancake photo on her Facebook, I had to make it myself because it looked so delicious! Many people tell me that I inspire them to cook but I\u2019m also inspired by my readers like Brigitta.\u201d\n\nMaangchi\u2019s videos have struck a particular connection with immigrants like herself who are homesick for the meals they grew up with. I discovered Maangchi one night in college, idling about in my first apartment in San Diego, when I had a sudden craving for some Korean food. It was 2007. I didn\u2019t have a smartphone yet, so getting the recipe from my mom in Korea meant I had to dial an obscene amount of numbers through a phone card to make international calls. I wondered if there was an easier, more visual way to learn, so I typed in \u201ckimchi jjigae\u201d on YouTube and found her videos.\n\nThere was no question of whether the recipe would be authentic. The fact that she was an ajumma meant she was automatically trustworthy. I watched her cook everything from scratch \u2014 gimbap, tteokbokki, soondubu \u2014 meals I\u2019d taken for granted and never bothered to learn how to make when I had the chance. To have step-by-step video tutorials on how to make all of the food that reminded me of home was a revelation. Immediately, it felt like a door had opened from my San Diego kitchen to my mom\u2019s home-cooked meals, making the distance feel more manageable. In the weeks that followed, I would take photos of all the stews and banchans I made and email them to my mom as proof: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not starving in college. I\u2019m eating well. Everything\u2019s fine!\u201d\n\nBefore Maangchi found her calling on YouTube, her first exposure to an online community was through the MMORPG City of Heroes, which she played obsessively when she was living in Canada. By day, she worked as a family counselor; by night, she was engrossed in her virtual world, leveling up her characters and maxing out their stats. She excitedly recalls logging on after work to play for hours with her internet pals whose names and phone numbers she still keeps to this day. \u201cMy job was usually Attacker. I just always wanted to be wielding my sword and hammer,\u201c she says. Once, she was scammed out of some virtual money. She managed to track down the player to confront him online and found out he was just an eight-year-old kid.\n\nShe kept up her day / night routine for three years, sometimes playing until she was so dizzy she had to rest, until, one day, her adult son suggested that she channel her energy into something healthier, like a YouTube channel. \u201cMaangchi,\u201d meaning \u201chammer\u201d in Korean, was the name of one of her characters that she liked to dress up in \u201csexy costumes\u201d whenever she had enough virtual money. If she had chosen any of her other character names on a whim that day, we might have ended up with a YouTube sensation named Dumok, meaning \u201cgangster boss,\u201d or Ssang-kal, \u201cdouble sword.\u201d Maangchi says she hasn\u2019t played a video game since.\n\nAlthough she\u2019s been on YouTube for over a decade, Maangchi\u2019s mind is still overflowing with ideas for videos. \u201cI have to update the recipes because if I make a video, it should be the best,\u201d she says. She thinks of her viewers like customers who deserve the best product, and, in return, they \u201cpay\u201d her with their love and adoration. \u201cEven though they don\u2019t pay me directly, their compliments... you cannot buy these compliments with money. It\u2019s much more than money. Because of their compliments, my self-esteem is going up, and I\u2019m getting healthy. My endorphins are going up.\u201d\n\nThe sheer breadth of Maangchi\u2019s recipes means that she has videos on how to make Korean staples like kimchi and bulgogi as well as food that people living in Korea wouldn\u2019t necessarily make at home since they\u2019re sold on nearly every street corner. It never even occurred to me that anyone could make gyeran-ppang (egg bread), a street food I most look forward to eating when I visit Korea, until I saw Maangchi making them. And that\u2019s all part of the can-do attitude that makes her so lovable. For immigrants, if you can\u2019t go get the food you crave most, she shows you that you can take matters into your own hands to re-create it at home.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that nostalgia plays a powerful role in what recipes Maangchi decides to make. In a video in which she makes matdongsan, she cheerfully sings the jingle from a 1975 commercial for the crunchy peanut crackers. It\u2019s an enduring brand you can easily get at Korean grocery stores, but commenters say Maangchi\u2019s homemade version brings a newfound appreciation for the classic snack. Matdongsan is just one of the many old-school recipes on Maangchi\u2019s channel, and she explains that her cooking style is influenced by the way she was taught by her mother, aunts, and grandmothers.\n\nBased on her preference for traditional recipes, I ask her if she\u2019s experienced \u201cimmigrant timewarp,\u201d explaining the phenomenon described by writer T.K. Park in which \u201cimmigrants tend to preserve their modes of thought and behavior of the country at the time when they emigrated.\u201d Her eyes light up in recognition, and she tells me about the gatherings she used to have within her community of Korean immigrants when she came to America in the \u201890s. \u201cWe had a karaoke night every weekend, but all my songs were old songs that were popular when I lived in Korea. When I arrived there, the immigrants who arrived there 20 years before me, those guys\u2019 favorite songs were real great-great-grandmothers\u2019 songs,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cFood is the same thing. I know all the traditional, authentic ways to make things, but sometimes, how I know about [newer recipes] is through my Korean viewers.\u201d\n\nThe effects of immigrant timewarp can be staved off by regular travel back to the motherland, which Maangchi does every few years to visit relatives. But last year, she went with the goal of educating herself on Korean Buddhist temple cuisine, reaching out to the Korea Agro-Trade Center to ask if they could help connect her with Buddhist monks. What resulted was a lovely, wholesome video documenting her peaceful days of learning at Goun-sa, a Buddhist temple, and foraging for root vegetables in the lush mountains of the Gyeongsang Province.\n\nVegan temple cuisine is fundamentally different from most peoples\u2019 understanding of Korean food as it doesn\u2019t use meat, spicy ingredients, or anything that could \u201coverstimulate\u201d the body and prevent enlightenment. Yet, with Buddhism being one of the oldest religions in the country, its cuisine is authentically Korean. The video is especially refreshing because it\u2019s one of the few times when Maangchi is out of her comfort zone of the kitchen, and we get to see her as an earnest, eager-to-learn student next to Wonhae, the Buddhist nun who is teaching her the basics of temple cuisine. The usual roles are reversed \u2014 Maangchi is always the teacher to her audience \u2014 but seeing this other side of her speaks to the enduring power of her personality. She\u2019s been an internet fixture for over 12 years, but she can still find ways to turn the tables.", "description": "Maangchi was already a cult figure when she published her first cookbook in 2015.
