And we\u2019re getting to the point now where he can\u2019t do a fundraiser every night,\u201d Harpootlian said, because Biden will need to spend more time campaigning in early caucus and primary states.\n\nPOLITICO tracked donations by 1,923 \u201cbundlers\u201d for Obama and Clinton \u2014 people who raised at least $100,000, and sometimes millions more, for the Democratic nominees in recent years \u2014 using data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Biden\u2019s 114 third-quarter donations from this group led the Democratic field, just as he did in the second quarter. Overall this year, Biden has accrued 344 donors from this group.\n\nKamala Harris was the third-quarter runner-up among Democratic bundlers, with 86. Cory Booker \u2014 who threatened to quit the campaign if he didn\u2019t quickly raise $1.7 million at the end of last month \u2014 nabbed 78 donations from past bundlers, while Pete Buttigieg got 75. And Elizabeth Warren, who does not hold in-person fundraisers, is growing her support among the traditional Democratic fundraising crowd: 34 of the Obama and Clinton bundlers contributed to her campaign during the third quarter, which ran from the beginning of July through the end of September.\n\nThough he launched his campaign in late April, Biden similarly triumphed earlier this year with elite fundraisers, according to POLITICO\u2019s analysis. Then, as now, he captured about one in four donations from elite fundraisers, with Harris and Buttigieg also netting significant interest.\n\nBiden advisers told POLITICO the former vice president\u2019s online fundraising has picked up significantly in recent weeks, saying Biden raised more money online during the first half of October than he had during the entire month of September. They attributed the uptick to increased enthusiasm for Biden\u2019s campaign and the campaign\u2019s ongoing investment in building a small-dollar donor program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be a mix for us\u201d between high- and low-dollar fundraising, Biden deputy campaign manager Pete Kavanaugh said in an interview. \u201cBut we have seen a surge in these small-dollar and online donations and our expectation is that that is going to continue.\u201d\n\nThe bundler contributions and connections are helping keep Biden\u2019s campaign afloat, but some of those donors are cringing at the way Biden is running his campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Joe Biden is going to be the nominee,\u201d said one major fundraiser, who said he gave to Biden out of loyalty during the third quarter. \u201cI think there\u2019s a thirst for something down the road taking us towards something bigger and better. That\u2019s not going to be Joe Biden, for whom I have the utmost respect. He is acting his age and showing his age.\u201d\n\nAnother fundraiser who donated to Biden in the past three months described the former vice president as having two bases of support among wealthy donors: \u201cPeople who have genuine affection and admiration\u201d for Biden as a person, but are not sure if he can run a great campaign and are supporting other candidates in the Democratic primary while they watch Biden run, and those who feel great loyalty to the former vice president and plan to \u201cride the horse all the way.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s donors are the wealthiest and most prestigious in the Democratic Party. In the past three months, they have included heavyweights such as multibillionaire John Doerr, chairman of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, and fundraiser Emily Blavatnik, who along with her husband, oil tycoon Len Blavatnik, is worth an estimated $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nBiden has held four high-dollar fundraisers in the past week in New York, Pennsylvania and Greenwich, Conn. \u2014 where he was hosted by Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and flanked by former Sen. Chris Dodd, a longtime friend and supporter.\n\nBut he is still being outraised by candidates with better small-dollar operations.\n\nBiden raised 31 percent of his contributions from small-dollar donors who gave the campaign $200 or less, about half the rate of small-dollar donations powering the Warren and Sanders campaigns, which forgo big money fundraising and raise money predominantly online. Biden also raised significantly less money in small-dollar increments than Buttigieg. The South Bend, Ind., mayor raises money both online and from in-person events, and drew 45 percent of his $19 million haul from small-dollar donors.\n\nThe vice president did not start the year with an army of small-dollar supporters from past elections to tap for cash, Biden allies note. But neither did Buttigieg. And all of the candidates started their campaigns needing to reconnect with supporters and refresh their valued email lists, which they use to tap supporters for donations.\n\nThough big-money donors are not enough to carry a campaign, they help juice the funding of several of Biden\u2019s competitors, including Harris, Buttigieg and Booker. Many donors are still willing to give their money to more than one candidate, even within weeks of each other: one in every four fundraisers who gave a donation gave to more than one candidate during the third quarter.\n\nAnd Warren, who received 39 donations from the fundraisers during her first six months is the race, doubled that number during the most recent quarter, a reflection of quiet, but newly piqued, interest in her candidacy among high-profile donors despite her frequent repudiations of big businesses and traditional political fundraising.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me at all\u201d that Warren is not holding fundraisers, said Philadelphia megadonor Mel Heifetz, who said he agrees with Warren\u2019s politics and would like to see a woman in the White House.\n\nHeifetz \u2014 one of the more than 100 fundraisers who gave to multiple candidates in recent months \u2014 donated in the third quarter to Warren, Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro. And this week he attended two fundraisers for his ideal candidate, Buttigieg, who he wishes had a super PAC so that he could pour even more money into his campaign.\n\n\u201cI can afford to give out a lot more hundred dollar bills and have it amount to not so much that I\u2019m worried about it,\u201d Heifetz said.\n\nJames Arkin, Scott Bland, Rishika Dugyala, Zach Montellaro, Ally Mutnick, Daniel Strauss and Steven Shepard contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8f/7f/4f5e9cb240b59edcd3ba51438287/20191023-joe-biden-donors-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
