The academy is the Nationals\u2019 signature philanthropic effort, and it uses baseball and softball to promote healthy character and community development for youth from underserved communities in the city.\n\nAD\n\nHow to watch\n\nGame 4: Houston Astros at Washington Nationals (Washington leads series, 2-1)\n\nAD\n\nWhen: 8:07 p.m.\n\nWhere: Nationals Park in Washington\n\nStarting pitchers: Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (2-1, 3.95 ERA) vs. Patrick Corbin (14-7, 3.25 ERA)\n\nThe World Series is back. Just when the Washington Nationals seemed like they might be able to shut down the Houston Astros after seizing a 2-0 lead on the road, the team which finished this season with baseball\u2019s best record looked like itself again. The Astros averted threat after threat with runners in scoring position and slammed the door late to secure a 4-1 Nationals defeat in the first World Series game in Washington since 1933.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals didn\u2019t use starter Patrick Corbin out of the bullpen, which leaves him available to start Game 4 on Saturday night. The prized left-hander will face the Astros bullpen, headed by starter-reliever hybrid Jos\u00e9 Urquidy. The 24-year-old rookie right-hander has made two appearances so far this postseason in long relief and those outings, combined with his regular season performances, indicate he can probably throw at least 45 pitches. He was stretched out enough in late September to throw 79 in one start.\n\nAD\n\nOnce Urquidy leaves the game, the Astros will use a parade of relievers to cobble together whatever\u2019s left of the 27 outs. Houston has a solid bullpen \u2014 its 3.75 collective ERA was MLB\u2019s third-best rate this season \u2014 though they\u2019ve faltered in the postseason with a 4.69 ERA.\n\nThe Nationals have at times struggled with bullpen games this season, including against the Miami Marlins and Baltimore Orioles, because the rapid turnover against pitchers doesn\u2019t allow hitters to get comfortable or know what to expect. But they expressed confidence after Game 3 that this time would be different for one main reason. They forced Astros starter Zack Greinke out of Game 3 after just 4 \u2154 innings, and they kept it close enough that the Astros needed to use all their best pitchers to maintain the slim lead. The unfamiliarity that has been a problem before won\u2019t be again.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you play in a team in the [American League] or in another division, it\u2019s nice to get at-bats off those guys because you don\u2019t see them very often,\u201d shortstop Trea Turner said. \u201cFirst time facing a lot of these guys for me. Anytime you can kind of just gain information and use it for the next day, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLineups\n\nHouston Astros\n\nGeorge Springer RF\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve 2B\n\nMichael Brantley LF\n\nAlex Bregman 3B\n\nYuli Gurriel 1B\n\nCarlos Correa SS\n\nRobinson Chirinos C\n\nJake Marisnick CF\n\nJose Urquidy P\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nGame 4 reading\n\nThe scary history of the Nationals\u2019 bullpen cast a shadow in Game 3.
