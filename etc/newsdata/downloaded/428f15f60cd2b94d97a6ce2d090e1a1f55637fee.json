Fantastic! Meet the brothers who are using robotics to produce plastic-free cotton", "language": "en", "text": "How do you introduce the brand that has cracked the supposedly elusive circular economy? You begin in the same way they design their clothes \u2013 at the end. But in true circular economy fashion, the end is just the beginning of the story... \u201cI know, we\u2019ll write your first piece of code, that will be fun,\u201d says Mart Drake-Knight, the 32-year-old co-founder of the fashion tech company that is set to transform the industry as we know it. I\u2019ve been well and truly \u201cMarted\u201d, as one of his employees describes it later.\n\n\n\nA tour of the Teemill factory on the Isle of Wight usually takes around half an hour; by the time we\u2019re coding at the boardroom table, handmade from salvaged materials, we\u2019re already an hour-and-a-half late for lunch and I\u2019m just learning that every programmer\u2019s first line of code starts with those two little words.\n\nBut first, we have to get one thing straight, says Mart: \u201cTechnology on its own solves nothing. It\u2019s kind of like a chainsaw \u2013 in the hands of a lumberjack, it\u2019s life-changing for a person and their family. In the hands of a psychopath, it\u2019s devastating for everyone. The key is the conscientious application of technology.\u201d\n\nFor 10 years, Mart and his brother Rob, 33, have been creating solutions to our fast-fashion problems, right under our noses. Their factory is powered by renewable energy, they use non-toxic inks, 97 per cent of the water used to dye the products is recovered and they have practically eradicated single-use plastic from their supply chain.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTechnology on its own solves nothing. It\u2019s like a chainsaw \u2013 in the hands of a lumberjack, it\u2019s life-changing for a person and their family. In the hands of a psychopath, it\u2019s devastating for everyone\n\nThey launched their first company, fashion brand Rapanui, in 2010 from their garden shed. In 2014 the brothers set up sister-company Teemill to enable charities, initially, to use their technology for free to build e-commerce stores and print their designs to order, in real-time. This made Teemill\u2019s 100 per cent organic cotton products more widely available, while removing the need for charities to have to invest in bulk orders or deal with surplus stock when creating merchandise.\n\nFashionistas Kate Moss and Vivienne Westwood have been photographed wearing their tops; comedian Ricky Gervais posted their \u201cEnd Trophy Hunting Now\u201d slogan tee on Instagram; adventurer Ranulph Fiennes took one of their hoodies to Antarctica.\n\nThey have partnerships with the likes of designer Katharine Hamnett, charities such as Save The Children and WWF, and ethical companies like Lush cosmetics. Yet, despite an estimated 1 million products being in circulation at any one time, both brands still relatively fly under the radar. You possibly own one of their T-shirts, but you\u2019ll have no idea it was produced by them.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because the ferry across the Solent is a journey too far to be practical, and not quite far enough to be exotic: though the coastal route to Freshwater is a beautiful one. Possibly it\u2019s because they mainly sell T-shirts, which aren\u2019t sexy enough to make headlines. Maybe it\u2019s that sustainability hasn\u2019t really been a hot topic, excuse the pun, until fairly recently.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are the antithesis of fast fashion and yet can deliver you a \u00a319 T-shirt with a bespoke design within 24-hours of you ordering it. At peak performance, they are producing a T-shirt every second and their business is doubling in size every year. \u201cSustainability cannot be a luxury. It has to be for everyone,\u201d insists Mart.\n\nJust this year the brothers cracked \u2013 truly cracked \u2013 the circular economy. Importantly, the process doesn\u2019t involve plastic.\n\nWhen looking at the whole product life cycle, we realised that there\u2019s no such thing as waste, it\u2019s just a resource going to waste\n\nIn the race to the bottom for faster and cheaper fashion, low-quality material is often blended with polyester, which creates items of clothing that are hard to remake back into anything of value. But by using higher quality organic cotton from the start, and coming up with some clever engineering solutions inside the factories that respin recovered fibre, Teemill has built a supply chain where their T-shirts can be sent back and remade into new T-shirts. Like the energy that powers their factory, the process is renewable \u2013 older and newer material streams are mixed together so T-shirts can be remade time and time again.\n\n\u201cWhen looking at the whole product life cycle, we realised that there\u2019s no such thing as waste, it\u2019s just a resource going to waste,\u201d says Mart. \u201cUtilising it is common sense, and that happens to be great for the environment and good for business because we keep the value in the system.\u201d Even the unusable fibres are mixed with water and used to make paper notebooks, stickers and packaging, printed with soy sauce.\n\nThey have been working towards this goal since their inception, always conscious of the materials they are using, not just for the garments, but for the labels and dyes as well. Every product is designed to send back for remanufacturing, with customers incentivised by free postage and a \u00a35 credit to go towards their next purchase.\n\n\u201cI think the most interesting part of our business is the fact that everything we\u2019ve ever made, we designed with the end of life in mind,\u201d says Mart.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how long you have a garment, most fashion systems design clothes to be thrown away at the end of their life and that currently leads to a truckload of textile waste, burned or buried in landfill every second. If everyone halves their waste that\u2019s a good start. It means a dump truck full of waste getting burned or buried in landfill every two seconds.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not a solution. If you\u2019re in a car driving towards a cliff with your friends, slowing down doesn\u2019t change the end result \u2013 you\u2019re still going off the cliff.\u201d\n\n30,000 products made with waste material so far\n\nCurrently, a ton of material is being recycled each month, with 30,000 products made with waste material so far. Their T-shirts are like a baker\u2019s starter dough, they could be one year old or 10 years old.\n\nThey aim to recycle everything ever bought from them \u2013 the challenge is their products are built to last so this could take some time. Mart explains: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many times the system goes round. You could say, let\u2019s buy fewer items and it goes round slower. Or you might say, I want to buy more, so it goes around faster. The system goes round, not along.\u201d\n\n100bn items of clothing bought each year\n\nRapanui\u2019s whole reason for being is to eradicate waste from the fashion industry. The story starts when Mart was just five years old walking to school, hand-in-hand with his mum. He innocently asked about where rubbish from the bin ends up and was so traumatised by her answer (landfill) that she had to take him home. He shows me the letter they wrote to the binman together, which reads: \u201cI am five years old. I am very worried about lots of rubbish. Will there be enough room left for me in the world when I\u2019m a grandad? Where does all the rubbish from my dustbin go?\u201d\n\nToday, a staggering 100 billion items of clothing are bought each year, and three out of five T-shirts will end in landfill within 12 months.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to do to fashion what Elon Musk did to the car industry with Tesla\n\nThe brothers didn\u2019t go into fashion because they have a particular eye for design and love of style, they saw a \u201cdirty\u201d industry they wanted to disrupt. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do to fashion what Elon Musk did to the car industry with Tesla,\u201d Mart says.\n\nBroadly speaking, Mart, who studied engineering at university, looks after the tech, while Rob studied business and handles that side of things. Their garments are the canvas for both established or aspiring designers to work. Just over two years ago, they opened their e-commerce platform to anyone and now 97 per cent of the 40,000 people using it are start-up brands, with profits split 50:50 between Teemill and store owners.\n\nThis technology has designed waste \u2013 and waste-inducing economies of scale \u2013 out of the making process by digitally printing designs one at a time to order, using a reconditioned classic Epson inkjet printer similar to the one you probably had at home a few years ago. \u201cWhy are we waiting for big brands to turn around and say they had a change of heart and are going to be values-based organisations now?\u201d asks Mart. \u201cWe\u2019re providing the tools for people to build their own ready-made values brand instead. It\u2019s disruption, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nMart is passionate that solving sustainability is also a social issue. Theirs is a classic entrepreneurs tale that began with \u00a3200 savings each, \u00a370 of which they blew on letterheads and business cards. At the time, both Mart and Rob were struggling to find jobs locally. Youth unemployment is a big issue on the Isle of Wight, almost nine per cent of the current resident population aged 18-24 are claiming out of work benefits. Most leave to pursue higher education, employment and career opportunities on the UK mainland and beyond.\n\nAt Teemill, the average age of their 65 employees is 25 years old. All have access to an employee-ownership scheme and a clear path for progression. With the help of a dedicated mentor, the most motivated employee can follow a transparent digitised programme to go from complete newbie to a leadership role within 18 months.\n\nTheir robotics engineer, Adam Bullen, was a seasonal farmworker with no qualifications or experience to suggest that should be his path when he joined as an apprentice, five years ago. But he had passion and motivation and a willing teacher in Mart. It\u2019s another Alan Sugar cliche, and one that Mart is very aware is the exception, not the rule. Employee self-confidence is usually one of the first things they have to build up.\n\nEveryone, from the people packing, folding and sorting clothes to coders, is encouraged to come up with ideas for improvements with whiteboards around the factory on which to write their ideas. These are then discussed every Friday, with the best ideas implemented by the team, then and there if possible. Their motto is \u201cour favourite time is now\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese innovations are possible because automation frees up people\u2019s time and capacity to do this sort of thing,\u201d says business development manager James Gray. \u201cThere are no wrong ideas, which sounds naff, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOne comment said that carrying socks and underwear from A to B across the factory was literally a pants idea \u2013 time-consuming and non-value-adding. So the manufacturing team are custom printing 3D parts to create a new robot out of an old vending machine. \u201cWe\u2019re automating away the jobs that are an insult to humanity. We shouldn\u2019t expect young people to do the rubbish jobs we had to do, they should have better jobs where they can provide more value,\u201d explains Mart.\n\nThe brothers have built the machine that, in the right hands, can transform the clothing industry\n\nTeemill reinvests the profits these efficiencies generate \u2013 the picking and packing robot directly pays for the eco-friendly paper packaging, for example, which is at least five times more costly than plastic. There are no rush jobs or zero-hour contracts at the printing factory because they have built a bespoke AI scheduler that accurately predicts orders, how fast each person works and creates the shift schedules in real-time \u2013 giving each worker two weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nThis means there\u2019s no need for middle management, either. Workers know whether they\u2019re on track or not by a simple green or red light system and can manage themselves and any issues, accordingly. This allows them to get on with the job energised by the dulcet tones of Justin Bieber \u2013 or techno tunes, depending on who\u2019s controlling the playlist \u2013 blaring at full volume on the production line. With the circular economy T-shirts now in production, the final piece of the sustainable puzzle is in place.\n\nThe brothers have built the machine that, in the right hands, can transform the clothing industry. It\u2019s a blueprint for a factory that can be replicated anywhere in the world. \u201cThat\u2019s what this piece of paper is over there,\u201d says Mart, nodding to some plans, for now top-secret, casually folded over at the end of the table.\n\nGoodbye waste.
