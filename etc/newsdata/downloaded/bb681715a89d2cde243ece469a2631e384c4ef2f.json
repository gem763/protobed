(Craig Desson/CBC)\n\nThe city says it's the most snow to survive the summer since 2008.\n\nCity spokesperson Philippe Sabourin calls it \"Montreal's snow glacier.\"\n\nThe dark mass of snow and ice, coloured by pollution, would tower above a street of Plateau triplexes.\n\nAbout 3 million cubic metres of snow was dumped by the city at the municipal pound in Saint-Michel last winter. (Craig Desson/CBC)\n\nIt's been melting since the spring, with the water forming a lake that the city drains into the sewer.\n\nThousands of plastic bottles line the shore, which the city collects and sends to the dump.\n\nThe water from the melting ice mass goes into the sewer where it's treated before flowing into the St. Lawrence River. (Craig Desson/CBC)\n\n\"Snow in Montreal is a 12-month operation,\" says Sabourin.\n\nThe garbage collected during a snow-removal operation ends up at the snow dump where the city isn't able to recycle it. (Craig Desson/CBC News)\n\nAbout half the city's snow was brought to Saint-Michel last winter.\n\nThe site was originally the Miron Quarry, where thousands of employees used to work. The city bought the land in the 1980s.\n\nIn the winter, trucks will dump the snow from platforms that line the lip of the former quarry. (Craig Desson/CBC )\n\nAt the city's other snow dumps, heavy machinery crushes the snow that doesn't melt, but here there's just too much snow.\n\n\"It's huge,\" said Sabourin.", "description": "Montreal's blustery winter of 2018 left so much snow that about 175,000 cubic metres still haven't melted at the city's largest snow dump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316313.1570724025!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/snow-glacier.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
