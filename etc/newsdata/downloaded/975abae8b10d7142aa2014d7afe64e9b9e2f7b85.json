It is nearly 12 months since the tragic passing of Leicester\u2019s beloved owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha but by the end here, the home support were chanting about European tours.\n\nBuilding on Khun Vichai\u2019s legacy was always the intention, and Youri Tielemans\u2019s winning goal will only have enhanced the sense that something is stirring under Brendan Rodgers.\n\nOn an emotional afternoon at the King Power Stadium, Leicester continue to progress on an upward curve and even benefited from another Video Assistant Referee controversy as a late Burnley goal was ruled out to leave Sean Dyche furious.\n\nChris Wood was convinced he had added a second goal, after Tielemans\u2019s excellent strike, but the equaliser was disallowed due to an alleged foul on Jonny Evans.\n\nIt ensured another home victory for Rodgers, cementing the club's place in the top-four, and provided a fitting tribute in front of Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, who is now the club\u2019s chairman.", "description": "They came to remember \u2018The Boss\u2019, the man who helped make the impossible possible.", "authors": ["John Percy", "James Ducker"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213506588-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqvf93cyop1gpr4w56dB_PHIn2pZoIcmajc70c214YJZo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
