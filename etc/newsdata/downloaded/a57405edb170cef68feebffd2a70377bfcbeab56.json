Revoking the special waiver would mean that no state can enact stricter pollution controls than the federal government.\n\n\u201cWhile the White House clings to the past, automakers and American families embrace cleaner cars,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence is irrefutable: today\u2019s clean car standards are achievable, science-based, and a boon for hardworking American families and public health.\u201d\n\n\"You have no basis and no authority to pull this waiver,\" Becerra added. \"We're ready to fight for a future that you seem unable to comprehend; we'll see you in court if you stand in our way.\"\n\nGov.
