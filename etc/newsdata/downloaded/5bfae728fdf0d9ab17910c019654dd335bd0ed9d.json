Usually, they ping each other about different bills or votes but also their kids, family fishing trips or drinks after work. Over this past weekend, though, the familiar back-and-forth turned far more serious, and fast. What they were learning, Sherrill told me, recalling their running conversation, was \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cgrave.\u201d Had the president solicited a foreign leader to dig up dirt on one of his main potential rivals in the 2020 election?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Sunday, Sherrill attended a memorial service for a councilman in her New Jersey district, did two fundraisers and spoke to a group of high school students considering attending a military academy, reminding them that they were \u201csigning up to a lifetime of service\u201d\u2014all the while stealing time to tend to the mounting stream of pressing texts. By 9 that night, on a conference call, Sherrill said, the group of seven had decided they needed to step off the sidelines. Until then, they had remained conspicuously noncommittal on impeachment, a position House Speaker Nancy Pelosi effectively had endorsed with her own refusal to fully embrace formal hearings. Now, they put what they had to say in clear, blunt language in a joint op-ed: They felt they had to \u201cpreserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, in a shared Google document, they worked quickly, fussing over edits and choices of words, wanting it to land before Congress resumed. In the evening, some 10 minutes before their thunderclap of a piece published, Sherrill called her mother to tell her what it said and that she loved her.\n\nOn Tuesday, she went on CNN and MSNBC, and she talked to \u201cThe Daily\u201d and WNYC. Characteristically measured, affable and unflappable, she said there was no ringleader in the group; and yes, they realized it would be an important statement. That evening, she watched as Pelosi stood before a bank of cameras at the Capitol and formally agreed to the very thing that she and her co-authors had requested. In a whirlwind span of some 72 hours, this former Navy helicopter pilot, this former federal prosecutor, this mother of four who had never held elected office of any kind before January of this year, and who for months had scrupulously avoided calling for impeachment, had become an agent of historic change.\n\nSitting in her office on Wednesday evening, finally at relative rest after a series of meetings and votes, she tried to put into words for me what had compelled her to act. She repeated variations of things she had said all week, and then, as she spoke of priorities of hers that might get shuffled because of the impending hearings, her chin started to quiver. Her eyes started to well. Sherrill started to cry.\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d she said, struggling to collect herself to speak, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m getting so emotional \u2026\u201d\n\nGiven her usual discipline and disposition, this was unexpected. But it was somehow simultaneously also the most normal thing I saw on Wednesday in the midst of the growing frenzy on the Hill. These last few years have been unprecedented, a relentless stress test for this democracy. In two and a half centuries, three presidents of the United States have faced impeachment, and now, Donald Trump is about to be the fourth. All of it can feel overwhelming, and should, because it is. And Sherrill is at the center of this latest turn. She\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s happening.\n\nThis is the third installment of a series on the first term of Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey. The first installment appeared in February, and the second was published in August.\n\nNone of this would be unfolding\u2014it couldn\u2019t be\u2014if Sherrill and others like her hadn\u2019t won in 2018, in districts like hers, flipping them from red to blue, giving Democrats control of the House of Representatives and thus the ability to perform meaningful oversight, including pressing forward on impeachment. But she had won partly by promising she wanted to work with not only those in her caucus but Republicans as well, preaching the necessity of bipartisanship. She didn\u2019t come down here looking for a fight, and certainly not this one. It was \u201cthe squad,\u201d not \u201cthe badasses,\u201d who arrived clamoring to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, and in a way that felt unusual for a freshman, Sherrill seemed to understand the source of her power. That her district mattered. That what she thought mattered. That what she said (and didn\u2019t say) mattered. And then she said what she said on Monday. \u201cAs members of Congress,\u201d she wrote with the others, \u201cwe have prioritized delivering for our constituents\u2014remaining steadfast in our focus on health care, infrastructure, economic policy and our communities\u2019 priorities. Yet everything we do harks back to our oaths to defend the country. These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nNow, 48 hours later, in her office, she used a Kleenex to wipe her eyes.\n\n\u201cHell of a lot of pressure,\u201d I offered.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not the pressure of doing this, because I think we were all comfortable doing this,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think it\u2019s the pressure of conveying to our country\u2014because I think we all understand how egregious this is\u2014and so, if we somehow fail in conveying that to the country, and fail in conveying how important this is, and fail in conveying why we need to support the Constitution and our values, and why need to be better than, you know, what we\u2019re demonstrating, if we fail to bring America along with this, that feels \u2026 like a really big blow to our values. It feels like \u2026 a crack in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAgain, her voice got thick, shaky.\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d she said, \u201cfeels like a really big responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nEven before the outset of the 116th Congress, I had decided to keep tabs on Sherrill. She was important, more important, perhaps, than many believed. I had a suspicion that what Sherrill did and did not do, as much as or even more than her more famous counterparts among the new women of Congress, would help determine the direction Democrats took and the broader dynamics of today\u2019s fraught political terrain. That meant visits with her here, and especially visits with her in her district in New Jersey.\n\nUntil this point, as she attempted to drill down on her less sexy slate of issues, as she sat on the House Armed Services Committee and chaired the oversight and investigations arm of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee and even helped form a bipartisan group working to protect the nation\u2019s political system from enemy attacks, Sherrill resolutely had pushed back on constituents\u2019 requests for her support for impeachment.\n\nWhen she was quizzed about it at her very first town hall, at a big, packed gym at the Police Athletic League of Parsippany, she urged the people to wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to finish his investigation. She called him \u201cwidely respected.\u201d Well aware, of course, that she had won due to the support of Democrats but not just Democrats, she made sure to mention that Mueller was a Republican.\n\nShe tried to impress upon the audience the stakes. \u201cPeople know that impeaching our president is going against the democratic will of the people,\u201d she said then. \u201cGoing against the will of the people like that is a huge step to take. I think it undermines our executive branch. It undermines institutions of our democracy. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a step that I would take. It\u2019s simply a step that I would take very carefully.\u201d\n\nThose last two words. They were a preview of what was to come.\n\nI was at a town hall in May at which she said she wanted to wait to listen to Mueller\u2019s testimony.\n\nAnd at a sequence of town halls last month, spanning the broad political spectrum of the area she represents, from bluer Verona to redder Kinnelon to a sprawling retirement home in Pompton Plains, more and more of her constituents expressed impatience with her message of restraint.\n\n\u201cIf not now,\u201d I watched a 93-year-old man ask her, \u201cwhen?\u201d\n\nMikie Sherrill answers Q&A with a packed house. | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nSherrill tried to sharpen her rationale. She cited the variety of congressional committees investigating the president as well as dozens of other investigations in different jurisdictions. She discussed the slew of pending lawsuits arguing for more materials and additional testimony. And she gently warned of the potential for failure and what it might mean.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get a conviction on any impeachment charges we might levy, then we have suddenly given precedence to the idea that the executive branch is not accountable\u2014to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, if we are going to go forward with something as critical as impeaching the president, which will stop all further legislation in Congress on the issues that we\u2019re working on and overtake us, I think it\u2019s critical that we can make the strongest possible case to the American people.\u201d\n\nNot even a month ago, sitting with her on a concrete bench outside a corporate headquarters in Florham Park, New Jersey, before we went to meet with a bipartisan collection of mayors and chamber of commerce types for a tour of a local airport, Sherrill insisted she wasn\u2019t feeling pressure to change her mind as much as she was feeling pressure to explain to her constituents why she wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI think what I\u2019m feeling pressure to do is to convey to people how much I care,\u201d she said. \u201cOne woman\u2014I was really taken aback, because she came up to me, and she goes, \u2018You know, people just don\u2019t think you get how important this is.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Jeez \u2026\u2019 I\u2019m going down to Washington weekly to fight for our country. I care so deeply.\u201d\n\nThere were, however, \u201cbright lines,\u201d she added, and she would continue to look for them, she said, heading into the fall.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAnd then there one was.\n\nShe just knew.\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States,\u201d Sherrill wrote on Monday night in a separate statement that she posted on her Facebook page, \u201cis threatening our national security.\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday afternoon, I walked with her from her office to the Capitol, where we stood outside the doors to the floor of the House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so incredibly offensive,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we, in my mind, are not a democracy\u2014we are the democracy. We have always protected democracies across the world. I don\u2019t have rose-colored glasses about some of the things the United States has done that have been bad for the world\u2014but, my gosh, we\u2019ve protected democracies from foreign influence. We\u2019ve helped nations become democracies. And so, to have the president now try to use a foreign government to harm our democracy at home \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so beyond the pale,\u201d she continued when we got back to her office.\n\nShe likened the president\u2019s actions to those of the Mafia.\n\n\u201cTo hear the president kind of shake down a foreign power, it\u2019s just egregious conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, the bright line, of course, is the fact that, in very basic terms, the president of the United States withheld congressionally directed military funding, illegally, from the foreign power, and then went to that foreign president and said, \u2018Could you do me a favor? Basically, look into this guy running against me.\u2019 That\u2019s the bright line.\u201d\n\nRep. Sherrill leaves a caucus meeting at the Capitol after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced formal impeachment proceedings against the president. | Getty Images\n\nShe was sitting in the middle of the couch in her office, and I was sitting on a chair across from her with a coffee table between. On her shelves were her helicopter helmet and a doorstop of a history of the Navy and a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution given to her by a constituent, and I asked her whether she knew that her op-ed with the other \u201cbadasses and the guys,\u201d as she called the seven of them, was going to lead to \u2026 all of this? To more and more Democrats voicing similar support? To the dam breaking, so to speak?\n\nShe was, at first, the calm, cautious controlled Sherrill I\u2019ve become accustomed to.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of the calculation,\u201d she started.\n\n\u201cBut I think we suspected that our decision would have an impact,\u201d she added.\n\nHere, though, after practically reflexively mentioning people\u2019s tax burdens and health care costs and the importance of the funding of tunnels and roads for the many commuters in her district, she found herself grappling with the breathtaking stakes of this now much larger fight. And for Sherrill, it became clearer and clearer as she kept talking, this is far from merely about checking the 45th president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical for people to believe in our democracy,\u201d she said, \u201cand to not feel like \u2026 the whole thing is rigged.\u201d\n\nThis is when her chin started to quiver.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent upon me to be able to explain to our country why this is different and why we have to act.\n\n\u201cThis is against everything we fought for in the military,\u201d she continued, \u201cas somebody who invested in her country from the time I was 18 years old. Um, so I think we all knew we had to stand up for these values, but now we have to remind people in the country\u201d\u2014she stopped, trying to gather herself again, to little avail\u2014\u201cwho don\u2019t seem to be coalescing around our values right now. We have to remind people that these aren\u2019t just kind of a set of, um, you know, these aren\u2019t just kind of things that somebody worked out on the back of an envelope in 1776. I mean, these are, these are things that a group of people who were deciding that they didn\u2019t want to operate under tyranny, a group of people who were deciding that they wanted to try this experiment, where individuals, um, could actually have a say in the government \u2026\u201d\n\nSniffling, she kept talking. \u201cI\u2019m trying to talk through this,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate that I\u2019m getting emotional about it, but I just think that, um, we as Americans are\u2014it\u2019s just there\u2019s a little bit of a lack of faith right now, and I think it\u2019s important that we remind people of the sacrifices that\u201d\u2014she paused again to try to settle her voice\u2014\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we remind people of the sacrifices that have been made for the Constitution and for what we believe in.\u201d\n\nIt feels, Sherrill said, like a \u201c1776 kind of fight.\u201d\n\nAn existential fight.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a really big fight,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a really big fight,\u201d she agreed.\n\nShe took another Kleenex and wiped her face and stood up.", "description": "A freshman congresswoman reckons with the historical weight of standing up to the president.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "John F.
