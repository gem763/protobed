One with boundaries.", "language": "en", "text": "Advice columnist\n\nDear Carolyn: I'm a 70-year-old mom of a 35-year-old, newly married son, my only child. What are your thoughts about his telling me that if I visit them, I need to stay in a hotel? I would only visit if invited of course. I visited him before and stayed in his apartment. Prior to that, he lived in a different city and said if I visited, I needed to stay in a hotel. I didn't visit him there.\n\nAs explanation or support he writes only that all his friends have their families stay in hotels. Just a by-the-way: I know lots of his friends and this isn't true. My son and his wife host their out-of-town friends in their second bedroom with a comfy sofa bed. I've emailed back that my family and I, and everyone else I know, aren't people who stay in hotels on short family visits. I think I also wrote that such a visit would engender not-good memories for me. (I have too many to ignore already.)\n\nI don't know his wife well. We haven't chatted or spent time together just us two. She has a warm personality, many friends and writes me friendly thank-you notes for gifts I send her. (I always email her first to ask if she'd like whatever it is.) It's been that way since we met, and I don't have a judgment or opinion about what our lack of closeness is about.\n\nI 100 percent get that other families happily do stay in hotels for excellent reasons. I may change my thoughts, like if my son has children or whatever (though parents I know and parents of his friends stay with their children and grandchildren on visits).\n\n\u2014 \"Jane\"\n\n\u201cJane\u201d: If you indeed \u201caren\u2019t people who stay in hotels on short family visits,\u201d then you aren\u2019t people who will ever visit your son.\n\nDone. Your choice.\n\nFor the record, I can think of about a dozen more helpful people not to be. You cannot be people who:\n\n\u25cfPresume to tell your hosts how to host you. Because doing that is so incredibly rude, and, when you do it at a time you\u2019re hoping to endear yourself to a child-in-law, it\u2019s also self-defeating to a degree that leaves me agape.\n\n\u25cfRummage around in a son\u2019s other relationships for proof of how justified you are to feel wronged by him. \u201c[T]hough parents I know and parents of his friends stay with their children and grandchildren on visits\u201d?! Just, stop. You are not a child; take unwelcome news with some grace.\n\n\u25cfExpect grown children to follow your blueprint for what \u201cfamily\u201d does or doesn\u2019t do. They\u2019re old enough now to have their own vision of \u201cfamily,\u201d and you owe them and their choices the same respect you\u2019d show any other adult (in those \u201cother families\u201d you \u201c100 percent get\u201d).\n\n\u25cfShift blame onto the most vulnerable target. You say yourself that your son made the hotel request once before, pre-marriage. So quit the side-eye at the wife. Your son wants this. Period.\n\n\u25cfRefuse to be an agreeable or flexible guest, and then marvel when you\u2019re invited only under certain terms and conditions.\n\nJust for example.\n\nI realize none of this is welcome advice for someone who is, at heart, just feeling hurt to be kept at arm\u2019s length. (Right?) I also understand the underlying fear \u2014 that you\u2019re losing your son to the new family he and his wife have created.\n\nAnd you\u2019re clearly aware you need to do your part, since you took pains to note your daughter-in-law\u2019s good qualities and that you wait to be invited.\n\nBut anyone who really wants to solve the riddle of a strained relationship must reckon with this possibility, full on: \u201cMaybe I have no one to blame but myself.\u201d Even if you ultimately disprove it. Yet none of your finger-pointing is at you.\n\nI urge you to look inward now because everything I\u2019ve listed is an alienating behavior that you\u2019ve employed \u2014 each one on its own an effective method at pushing people away. They all fit into a cycle of defensiveness, which no doubt this answer risks perpetuating, but which I also hope you override long enough to say to your son: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I overstepped when I emailed you. I struggle with change, but I will adapt. I owe you and [wife] that.\u201d\n\nIf overstepping has been your mothering brand, then a deeper reckoning is in order.\n\nThere are some objectively terrible people out there, many of whom become someone\u2019s son- or daughter-in-law, of course \u2014 a sad and intractable problem. But you make it plain your son\u2019s wife isn\u2019t one of them. That means it\u2019s on you to work with the people you\u2019ve got, the arrangements they offer and opportunities you see. Open mind, open heart, open arms \u2014 and, yes, a room at a stinkin\u2019 hotel.\n\nThough I suggest treating yourself to a non-stinkin\u2019 one, as your means permit.", "description": "Before you visit (or forgo a visit), let\u2019s have a frank talk about what kind of mother you are.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
