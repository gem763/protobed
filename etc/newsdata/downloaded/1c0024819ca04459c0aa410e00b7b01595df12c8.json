And on Monday, right tackle Morgan Moses essentially confirmed that report \u2014 calling the running back\u2019s benching a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d\n\nIn a radio interview, Moses said he planned to discuss the decision with coach Jay Gruden and advocated for Peterson, who led the Redskins in rushing last year, to receive playing time.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019ve got a Hall of Fame guy that doesn\u2019t dress, man, it\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d Moses told 106.7 The Fan. \u201cAnd obviously, we\u2019ve gotta figure out what the reason is. And it\u2019s my job as one of the older guys on the offensive line to speak up and say, \u2018Hey, we need him.\u2019\n\n\u201cObviously, you don\u2019t put a Hall of Fame guy like that on the sideline. When he\u2019s healthy, as well.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins made Peterson a healthy scratch because of their confidence in second-year back Derrius Guice and the veteran\u2019s inability to play special teams. Gruden said after Sunday\u2019s 32-27 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles that the decision to keep Peterson inactive will be \u201cweek-to-week.\u201d\n\nBut Gruden also said: \u201cIf we have a game where we think can run the ball 55 times in an I-formation, then sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d (The Redskins have never run the ball 55 times in a game under Gruden.)\n\nMoses said Peterson brings \u201ca lot\u201d to the Redskins.\n\n\u201cTo have that guy just standing on the sideline is just, it doesn\u2019t sit well to guys on the team or the NFL,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think this is something we need to correct, man, because he is a helluva football player.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
