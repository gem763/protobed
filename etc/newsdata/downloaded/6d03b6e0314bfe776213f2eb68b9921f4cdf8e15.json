You're not and you're failing our children.\"\n\nWhile the opposition initially shared Senator Lambie's concerns about the education fund, it backed the bill after securing $50 million a year for disaster mitigation.\n\nThrough the fund, $200 million will be available each year to support communities facing a significant or catastrophic event.\n\nUnder the deal, $50 million will also be given for TAFE upgrades, with that money expected to be matched by states and territories.\n\nLabor frontbencher Murray Watt said he was extremely disappointed the education fund would be shut down.\n\nBut, on balance, the government's commitments were enough to clinch the opposition's support.\n\n\"As a result of climate change, we do face the certainty of increased frequency and scale of natural disasters into the future,\" he told the upper house.\n\nThe Greens also opposed the bill, with senator Mehreen Faruqi slamming the government for cuts to tertiary education funding, and not doing enough to address climate change.\n\nShe said $50 million for TAFEs was a \"drop in the ocean\" compared with the end of a $4 billion fund.\n\nThe bill will return to the lower house for final approval.", "description": "Independent senator Jacqui Lambie has launched a blistering attack on major parties over a deal to create a $4 billion disaster relief fund at the expense of...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
