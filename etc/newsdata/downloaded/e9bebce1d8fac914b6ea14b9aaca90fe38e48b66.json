That \u201ccomes to nearly 1 million fewer jobs for black Americans as a result of the competition from illegal immigrants \u2026 and it is the wage levels also,\u201d Kirsanow told the audience on October 25.\n\nThe huge impact of this discrimination is mostly ignored by wealthy \u201cwoke\u201d professionals, who prefer to use discrimination claims as a political club against conservatives. The documented discrimination is just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg,\u201d but left-wing critics have gone silent since Donald Trump was elected, said CIS director Mark Krikorian,\n\nYet white-collar workers are also losing salaries and jobs because of discrimination, said Kevin Lynn, founder of Progressives for Immigration Reform:\n\nThe gains made by women and minorities in STEM fields over the past three decades have really been reversed. For example, today on average 12 percent of women earn degrees in computer science. In 1984 it was 37 percent. So you have to ask yourself what\u2019s going on. Well, when the opportunities become scant and the workplaces become hostile to women, they typically choose other career alternatives. \u2026. There is a preference for hiring Indians over Americans in these [Indian-run] consulting firms because, one, they will work longer hours. It\u2019s a quiescent workforce, largely because they\u2019re here on H-1B visas. And a lot of what goes into this is they are given the hope that their company will sponsor them for an \u2013 a green card, and then they\u2019ll eventually get citizenship here in the U.S. Unfortunately for the American worker, that means that they\u2019re competing with someone who is willing to work for less, work for increasingly lower benefits and other benefits that go along with their salaries, and it just ultimately makes things a lot more difficult.\n\nThe press club event was scheduled to spotlight Richwine\u2019s study of discrimination lawsuits by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He summarized several of the EEOC cases, often quoting directly from the commission\u2019s reports:\n\nWhen a warehouse in Memphis began using a new employment agency to fill its daily work crew, the agency, quote from EEOC, \u201cessentially replaced the African Americans with Hispanics.\u201d End quote. Potential workers would line up outside the warehouse each day, but the agency would select Hispanics over blacks even when black workers were farther ahead in line. Sometimes managers would send potential black workers home by announcing in English that there were no more positions. After the African Americans left, the Hispanics were allowed to come into the warehouse and work. Again, systematic \u2013 neither subconscious nor subtle.\n\nRichwine described cases where Hispanic managers discriminated against American blacks:\n\nPerhaps the most egregious example of this comes from Prestige Transportation Services. It would discard or refuse to accept employment applications from non-Hispanic blacks. Quote from EEOC: \u201cOn multiple occasions when a black person applied for employment, Prestige managers Mr. Ramirez and Ms. Rodriguez would stand behind the applicant and rub their hand on their skin to display their disdain for black people.\u201d End quote. Staff meetings were conducted in Spanish only.\n\nThe record shows that some Indian immigrants also discriminates against blacks, he said.\n\nAt a Hampton Inn in Colorado, three non-Hispanic white housekeepers were fired by the new general manager and replaced by Hispanics. The owners, Falgun Patel and Mukund Patel, told the general manager that they prefer that maids be Hispanic because in their opinion Hispanics worked harder while American employees are lazy. The general manager allegedly told a Hispanic employee to recruit friends for the incoming vacancies because the owner preferred a Hispanic workforce. After three months, all of the Hampton Inn\u2019s non-Hispanic housekeepers were gone.\n\nThe pattern of lawsuits by Hispanics is very different, said Richwine. Instead of losing job opportunities because of discrimination, Latinos lose workplace protections that were once normal for Americans, he said:\n\nWhen Hispanics file suits, they are not complaining that they are being replaced by some other group in the workforce; instead, they\u2019re complaining about working conditions, they complain about low pay, they complain about dangerous situations on the job site, and they complain about harassment. Harassment oftentimes is ethnically based, ethnic slurs and so on directed at them. The saddest part is that when we\u2019re talking about Hispanic women, sexual harassment is a very pervasive problem if you believe these EEOC lawsuits,\n\nThe examples are merely the most egregious ad straightforward cases, he said, ensuring that they are likely many other cases of discrimination that do not end up in court.\n\nDeputies for President Donald Trump have partly reversed some discrimination against blacks, for forcing wages up to record levels.\n\nBut his deputies done little to curb the white-collar discrimination, partly because there is so much more money at stake for high-tech firms, hospitals, and investors.\n\nAnother lawsuit alleging discrimination by Indian managers in the US, this time at Intel Corp. One Indian manager rejects a US graduate, says \"It would be easier to hire a younger, unmarried Indian man.\"\n\nMany US grads have similar stories, so share yours. https://t.co/Xko2kuuhiO \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 1, 2019\n\nFor example, the federal government rewards companies that discriminate in favor of Indian \u201cOPT\u201d work-permit workers by rejecting American graduates, Lynn said.\n\nAmerican companies which hire Indian graduates are not required to pay Social Security taxes, he said, adding:\n\nThat\u2019s about a 15 percent premium that is added to hiring someone on the OPT program and, again, these people compete directly with our new [American] graduates in the workplace \u2026 [where] a [U.S.] student today might exit university with anywhere from $35 [thousand] to $85,000 in debt. That\u2019s a lot of money, and \u2026 they\u2019re having their legs broken as they leave the gate into the workplace.\n\nInstead, American victims of Indians\u2019 discrimination are suing the Indians firms in court. For example, in a 2016 lawsuit against a giant Indian software firm, Infosys, American witnesses alleged:\n\nHiring Manager Instructions: an Infosys hiring manager admitted \u201cThere does exist an element of discrimination. We are advised to hire Indians \u2026 because they will work off the clock without murmur and they can always be transferred across the nation without hesitation unlike [a] local workforce.\u201d Talent Acquisition Unit Observations: Recruiters in Talent Acquisition observed that Indians were highly favored, and it was extremely difficult to move non-South Asians ahead in the hiring process. Non-Indians were regularly rejected as being \u201cnot a good fit,\u201d \u2013 an Infosys euphemism for \u201cnon-Indian.\u201d This discrimination is on-going. In 2016 for example, an Infosys manager in their Talent Acquisition Unit observed that of Infosys\u2019 2,900 hires in the United States, 2,200 (76%) were Indian. She observed a similar hiring disparity in prior years. Applicant Data Manipulation: Infosys manipulates applicant tracking data in such a way that consideration of non-South Asians and non-Indians is minimized, and the hiring of South Asians is maximized. For example, recruiters have observed that non-South Asian applicants were repeatedly deleted from Infosys\u2019 applicant tracking system, forcing one recruiter to keep a separate spreadsheet of applicants on his computer. Recruiters have also observed South Asian applicants, located by Infosys\u2019 \u201csourcers\u201d in India, manually entered into the applicant tracking system despite those individuals not having formally applied, thus streamlining the hiring process. Individuals sourced in this way were moved \u201cto the front of the line\u201d ahead of applicants in the U.S. A recruiter also observed that applications for United States positions were regularly not reviewed, and in 2016, approximately 11,000 to 12,000 were rejected en masse.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.\n\nBut the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants. It also adds replacement workers to a resident population of more than 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and about 500,000 blue-collar H-2B, H-2A, and J-1 visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners, and it rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.\n\nThis policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThe federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy.\n\nThe Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work.", "description": "Mass migration encourages mass discrimination against Americans, especially against black employees, said experts who reviewed EEOC lawsuits.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/immigration-arrival-customs-america-USA-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
