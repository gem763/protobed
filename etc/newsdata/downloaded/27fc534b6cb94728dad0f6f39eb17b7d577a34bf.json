Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer and National Security Council official responsible for Ukraine policy, confronted Trump\u2019s EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about Sondland\u2019s push for Ukraine to launch \u201cinappropriate\u201d politically motivated investigations, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by VICE News. Sondland has testified under oath that no such complaint was ever raised with him.\n\nVindman is scheduled to testify before Congress Tuesday as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump. He\u2019s the first White House official to appear, but joins an ever-growing list of past and present administration officials who\u2019ve defied Trump\u2019s blanket ban on cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. His testimony adds yet more detail to allegations that the Trump administration pressured Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden and the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nRead: Trump Had a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Impeachment Week\n\n\n\nVindman was on the now-notorious July 25 phone call when Trump asked to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d Biden \u2014 and plans to tell investigators he was disturbed by what he heard.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call,\u201d Vindman plans to say. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen.\u201d\n\nThe July Meeting\n\nSondland raised the prospect of swapping investigations for a meeting with Trump during a meeting with officials from Ukraine in the White House on July 10, according to Vindman\u2019s account. But former National Security Advisor John Bolton \u201ccut the meeting short.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, during a scheduled debriefing, \u201cSondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma,\u201d Vindman\u2019s opening statement says, referring to the Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nRead: Bill Taylor\u2019s Testimony Paints a 'Damning' Picture of Trump's Ukraine Quid Pro Quo\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\u201d Vindman plans to say.\n\nFiona Hill, who was Vindman\u2019s boss and Trump\u2019s top advisor for Europe and Russia, also confronted Sondland, according to Vindman.\n\n\u201cDr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate,\u201d Vindman\u2019s statement reads.\n\nSondland, under oath, has painted a very different picture of that meeting \u2014 and said that no one raised any objections with him.\n\n\u201cIf Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later,\u201d Sondland testified, according to a copy of his own opening statement to his Oct. 17 testimony.\n\nThe Phone Call\n\nVindman is also the first person to testify who was on the fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. What he heard \u201cconcerned\u201d him enough to prompt him to reach out to the NSC\u2019s lead attorney.\n\nVindman doesn\u2019t get into the details of the call, although he says that the public record released by the White House corresponds with what he heard. According to that record, Trump asked Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden and pursue a conspiracy theory that suggests Russia might not really have interfered in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\u201d Vindman\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nCover: President Donald Trump walks from Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., and waves as he arrives following a trip to Chicago to attend the International Association of Chiefs of Police Annual Conference and Exposition, Monday, Oct. 28, 2019.
