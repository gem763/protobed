Cory Gardner, Colorado Republican, and Washington Times Special Sections Manager Cheryl Wetzstein for this section, which is developed by The Washington Times Advocacy Department. Shares\n\nDirect diplomacy needed to de-escalate North Korean threat This statement was made on July 5, 2017, in response to a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile test that was conducted on July 4, America's Independence Day holiday. Shares\n\nCapitalize on U.S. economy -- and a ramped-up missile defense The current situation on the Korean Peninsula is the result of both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama making deals with Pyongyang that gave North Korea significant ransom money but failed to secure the hostage in either case. Shares\n\nTime to use U.S.'s 'entire toolbox' These excerpted remarks were made at a March 21, 2017 hearing on \"Pressuring North Korea: Evaluating Options,\" held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Shares\n\nU.N. sanctions: Defunding DPRK's nuke, missile programs Exactly one month ago, I came before members of the Security Council and declared it was a dark day for the world because of the dangerous and irresponsible actions of North Korea. Almost one week ago, I said the days of talking were over and it was time to act. Shares\n\n'A clear message' to North Korea The following is a fact sheet prepared by the United States Mission to the United Nations about the sanctions recently adopted on North Korea. Shares\n\n'We will remain vigilant' Secretary Mattis and I are grateful for the opportunity today to host Foreign Minister Kono and Defense Minister Onodera today. The bonds of America and Japan have \u2014 forged over previous decades \u2014 will continue to endure. Today's honest and productive discussions reaffirmed our mutual commitment to confronting threats to regional peace and security. Shares\n\nMattis, Tillerson pledge closer military bond with Japan in face of North Korean threat Washington and Tokyo have agreed to accelerate military cooperation between U.S. and Japanese forces, bolstering maritime and ballistic missile defense and expanding into new areas such as cyberwarfare, in an attempt to curb the threat of North Korea to the Pacific region. Shares\n\nOnly a negotiated settlement will bring peace to the Korean Peninsula A few weeks ago, there was concern that there could be conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Reacting to North Korea's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) launches on July 4 and July 28, and the vitriolic statements from North Korea, to include YouTube simulated nuclear attacks on New York and Washington, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would respond to the North Korean threat with \"fire and fury the world has never seen.\" Shares\n\nAn Open Letter to Kim Jong-un and the people of North Korea I write to you today, not as a stranger from another country ... and most certainly not as an enemy, but as someone who has devoted my life to recognizing the natural rights of men. Shares\n\nWithout public diplomacy, U.S.-North Korean policy will fail Secretaries Rex Tillerson and James Mattis recently wrote that the U.S. is not seeking regime change in North Korea. Depending on whether they meant it or not, this policy has enormous implications for the success of their putative policy, which is to remove the North Korean nuclear threat. Shares\n\nThree Prayers for The Sake of North Korea Oh Father of all Creation, through your Holy Spirit and its wisdom, please grant us the words and actions needed to resolve the most dangerous conflict on Earth. As a nation, we pray for peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula. Let your Holy Spirit change the heart, mind, soul and spirit of the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, so he will realize that all of Korea needs peace and prosperity \u2014 not war and destruction. Shares\n\nThe human rights holocaust of North Korea It should come as no surprise that North Korea is threatening parts of the United States with annihilation. For decades, the North Korean regime has been systematically annihilating segments of its own population. More specifically, the North Korean regime has been engaged for decades in the supreme human rights offense of genocide \u2014 the deliberate attempt to exterminate entire racial, ethnic or religious groups. Shares\n\n'Red-teaming' the diplomatic option in Korea Should President Trump meet personally with Kim Jong-un? John Glover, a graduate student at George Mason University wrote an article advocating such a meeting and, frankly, I think that he's on to something. Shares\n\nParliamentarians' Association formed to focus on peace As the world faces a wide range of 21st century challenges and threats \u2014 including the current crisis with North Korea \u2014 it becomes increasingly clear that in order to address and solve critical global problems, a more collaborative and multisectoral approach to governance and international relations is required. While the Westphalian system of world order, centered on sovereign states, has prospered and endured for centuries, we face a wide range of global or transnational problems that require the full complement of stakeholders being engaged. That is, not only governments, but also non-state actors from civil society to the private sector and, indeed, faith-based organizations. Shares\n\nAiding refugees brings freedom closer for North Korea North Korea continues to make news for all the wrong reasons. Scarcely a day goes by without a headline about Pyongyang's ambitions to develop and perhaps use nuclear weapons. North Korea's unwillingness to respect the norms of international relations derives from the fact that there is no rule of law. As the Trump administration and Congress grapple with Pyongyang's security challenge to the United States and our allies, it's important to remember that North Korea's human rights abuses are not unrelated. Shares\n\nWho is the real target of North Korea's nuclear weapons? Missile tests by North Korea and threats against the United States by her leader, Kim Jong-un, and an unprecedentedly firm response of \"fire and fury\" from President Donald J. Trump combined this summer to create what may be described as a panic over the prospect of a nuclear attack on American soil. Shares\n\nROK's President Moon: A stellar first 100 days When Moon Jae-in was elected president of the Republic of Korea in May, in the wake of the momentous popular protests that had led to the impeachment and ouster of his predecessor, he inherited the roaring Seoul street distrustful of the government; the raging northern neighbor who seemingly \"went off rail\" with the \"right-in-your-face\" nuclear and endless missile tests; an unpredictable U.S. ally who threatened to break off the strategic free trade agreement and unleash war on the peninsula; as well as deteriorating relations with prickly China and unyielding Japan. It was a difficult hand to play. Shares\n\nGovernment warns North Korean cyber attacks continue The Department of Homeland Security and FBI issued a new warning on Wednesday [Aug. 23] that North Korean government hackers are continuing to target critical U.S. infrastructure for cyber attacks. Shares\n\nMaking the best of a bad nuclear hand That so many of the nation's leading Democrats believe President Trump poses a greater threat to world peace than the mad dog leader of a nuclearized North Korea says more about them than either the president or Kim Jong-un. Shares\n\nThe other North Korean threat After massive intelligence failures grossly underestimating North Korea's long-range missile capabilities, number of nuclear weapons, warhead miniaturization, and proximity to manufacturing a hydrogen bomb, the biggest North Korean threat to the United States remains unacknowledged. North Korea has two satellites in orbit, and more to follow, that could be nuclear-armed for a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack that would black out North America for months to years, killing millions. Shares\n\nIn search of a grand U.S. strategy Richard Nixon's rapprochement with China, the end of the Cold War, President Obama's outreach to \"the Muslim world,\" the growth of the (largely American-funded) United Nations \u2014 weren't such developments supposed to lead to a safer world, one in which the \"international community\" would embrace \"universal values\" and pursue common interests \u2014 peace and security key among them? Shares\n\n'Juche' or consequences \"Juche\" -- the ideology of North Korea -- compels unquestioned obedience to the \"supreme leader,\" who is exalted as the greatest source of political thought. It is enforced by fear and murder even among the elite and accounts for the Kim regime's paranoia and belligerence. Shares\n\nToward a more muscular missile defense There is no excuse for an inadequate anti-missile shield Shares\n\nReliving the nuclear worry Intelligence reports to the effect that North Korea has produced a miniature nuclear warhead that can be placed inside its missiles jolts the historian to relive a past that most Americans don't recall. It was on Aug. 22, 1953, that the Soviet Union detonated its first hydrogen bomb. Like most Augusts in the nation's capital, the summer heat had driven officialdom from the city. As one newspaper put it: \"There was a minimum of official comment, with President [Dwight] Eisenhower and most lawmakers out of town on vacation, and no sign that there would be any immediate change in United States policy.\" Shares\n\nCountering bombast from North Korea The escalating exchange of nuclear threats between North Korea and the United States has pushed us closer to the brink of war. Shares\n\nThe South Pacific's strategic role Kwajalein Atoll. Guam. Saipan. Shares\n\nA superstar in Donald Trump's Cabinet Donald Trump has a skill for recruiting Cabinet officers he has treated badly. Serving in his administration can require selfless devotion to duty. Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, could tell you about that. So could Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is swiftly becoming the Cabinet superstar. Shares\n\nArmageddon postponed North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un appears to have blinked and President Trump can claim a foreign policy victory and justification for his strategy.
