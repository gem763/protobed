It\u2019s an important infantry force for the offensive,\u201d said Emre Kursat Kaya, of the EDAM think-tank in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe group is formed around Sunni Arab and Turkmen fighters who are locals of the region. Thus, their presence in the operation provides an undeniable intelligence advantage.\u201d\n\nThe SNA now claims to have some 80,000 men at its disposal, having boosted its ranks earlier this month by integrating another coalition, the National Liberation Front, based primarily in Idlib province.\n\nSome 14,000 of its fighters have been mobilised for the new operation, according to the group\u2019s spokesman, Major Yusuf Hamoud.\n\n\u201cThat number can increase as the battle unfolds,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nA large number of these fighters come from areas targeted by the Turkish offensive, he said, which is aimed at pushing back the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) militia.\n\n\u201cThese soldiers were forced to leave when the YPG took control\u201d of territories such as Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Tight control\u2019 \u2013\n\nTurkey has so far deployed around 1,000 SNA soldiers in the Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain areas, estimates Charles Lister, of the Middle East Institute.\n\n\u201cFor now, the SNA appears to be operating under the tight control of the Turkish military and Ankara is using them as the primary force,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nLister said this mirrored the way that the US had used the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in their battle against the Islamic State group.\n\n\u201cTheir role is crucial for now,\u201d Lister said. \u201cTurkey\u2019s strategy is not just to train these forces, but to give them sufficient operational experience so that once territory is captured they will operate as capable hold-forces wholly loyal to Ankara.\u201d\n\nKaya, of the EDAM think-tank, believes Turkey has taken measures to minimise the risk of rights violations by the SNA since their last operation in Afrin.\n\nThe United States has warned Turkey that any abuses will result in severe economic sanctions.\n\n\u201cThese forces have been intensively trained by Turkish forces for this operation. Thus, compared with less-organised groups in Syria, we can expect them to have a higher level of self-control.\n\n\u201cTurkey chose the most professional Syrian moderate forces to participate in this operation. We should also mention that elite Turkish commando forces on the ground will supervise the offensives and react to any excesses,\u201d he added.", "description": "Istanbul (AFP) \u2013 In the vanguard of Syrian revolt before being ripped apart by division and indiscipline, the Free Syrian Army has returned as a key", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/b2904d_turkey-has-so-far-deployed-000-sna-soldiers-one-expert-rebel-faction-takes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
