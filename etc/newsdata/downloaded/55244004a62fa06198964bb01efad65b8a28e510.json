How did we all get so scruffy? And what about all those lovely ties? Richard Godwin charts the demise of looking smart\n\nOne afternoon about a decade ago, I was standing at a pub urinal not far from my old newspaper office when the man standing next to me opened up a conversation.\n\n\u201cA tie, huh?\u201d (He was American.) \u201cNever take a job where they make you wear a tie.\u201d\n\nHe was in his mid-30s, wearing expensive-looking trainers, jeans and a sweatshirt. I was in my mid-20s, wearing my standard workwear: some nicely cut trousers, a decent white shirt, probably some black Chelsea boots and, yes, a tie that I would have taken some care selecting.\n\nI tried to explain that I liked my job. And I wasn\u2019t forced to wear a tie, I chose to wear a tie. I liked ties! I liked how the French actor Romain Duris paired his tie with a high-collared leather jacket in the movie The Beat That My Heart Skipped. I liked how those old Italian dudes wore their ties on the Sartorialist blog. I liked how I never used to wear a tie and now I did and that meant I was a grown-up. I liked how people sometimes went: \u201cOoh, looking sharp,\u201d and they definitely hadn\u2019t said that a few years before, when I thought a Sparta Prague football shirt was the way to communicate how cosmopolitan and discerning I was.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seldom seen: Mark Zuckerberg, for once without his usual Silicon Valley T-shirt. Special case, he was testifying before a Senate committee, 10 April 2018. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nI even liked buying ties. So easy \u2013 one size fits all \u2013 and potentially bargainous. I had a fancy peacock silk one that my then-girlfriend-now-wife had bought me from Liberty, but also a weirdly chic green blobby-stripy one we found in an old flea market in Florence for about \u20ac2. But hang on \u2013 why am I justifying myself to a random toilet person? Who starts a conversation in a urinal?\n\nThe kind of man who never wore a tie, clearly. The kind of man who refused to see the tie as anything other than a corporate noose around my neck. The kind of man whose workwear vision would ultimately prevail.\n\nFor the American Neckwear Toilet Evangelist clearly had a better grasp of the future than I did. To wear a tie in 2019 is only marginally less eccentric than turning up to work dressed in chainmail. Formalwear, in general, is increasingly the preserve of dandies and defendants.\n\nAccording to market analysts Kantar, sales of suits are down 7% year-on-year, ties are down 6% and blazers down 10%. Marks & Spencer is cutting back on its formalwear; Moss Bros, the suit specialist, has issued three recent profit warnings. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs \u2013 whose bankers were once renowned for their Armani suits and Gucci loafers \u2013 announced a move to a \u201cflexible dress code\u201d. A company-wide memo cited the \u201cchanging nature of workplaces generally in favour of a more casual environment\u201d. Other financial firms have since followed suit as the banks seek to emulate the \u201cwhatever\u201d dress codes of the tech companies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Power dressing: Dominic Cummings sports a laidback look in Downing Street. Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe suit in turn has become \u201ca uniform for the power- less\u201d, according to the American site Vox \u2013 only worn by people impelled to do so. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wears a suit when he testifies before Congress. When he is in control, he wears the Silicon Valley uniform of T-shirts and jeans \u2013 and don\u2019t think that isn\u2019t its own form of power-dressing, a way of saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to play by your rules.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s calculatedly dishevelled appearance is another way of communicating that, too. However, it\u2019s his special adviser, Dominic Cummings, whose dress is emblematic of the age, somehow \u2013 a contemptuous mish-mash of athleisure, dadwear and public school signifiers: the grey Levi\u2019s hoodie with workshirt poking out; the hurriedly grabbed tote bag; the quilted gilet. This mess is what the people voted for, he seems to be saying. Deal with it.\n\nI am now in my mid-30s and I don\u2019t work in a London newspaper office any more. I am freelance and I do a lot of my writing in a co-working space in Bristol where I moved a couple of years ago, amid nut-butter influencers and CBD start-ups and 20-something digital marketing types who say things like: \u201cYeah, a third of my capital is in crypto.\u201d It\u2019s kind of fun. But I have never even attempted to wear a tie there. Bristol isn\u2019t really a tie sort of city. Not having been called to testify before Congress recently (what have I been doing with my life?), I haven\u2019t worn a suit for a while either. The grown-up accoutrements I collected in London \u2013 the vintage mother-of-pearl cuff links, the Brooks Brothers shirts, the Paul Smith socks \u2013 I sort of left behind. If you want to know the truth of it, I\u2019m writing this in slightly mildewy jogging bottoms and luminous orange Adidas running shoes. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like a liberation.\n\nClearly, I am not the only person readjusting to the new workwear rules. Dan Rookwood, formerly US editor of the menswear site Mr Porter, was once rarely seen without at least eight items of exquisite tailoring. He has recently taken a job as creative director at Nike, moved from New York to Portland, and adjusted his attire accordingly. \u201cI now have the best wardrobe I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 a proper walk-in wardrobe, where I can see all my clothes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what it shows me is that I can\u2019t wear the vast majority of it any more. It\u2019s all made-to-measure suits and shirts and ties and bench-made shoes that I just can\u2019t see myself wearing outside the occasional wedding as the winds of style have changed. It\u2019s like a museum.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clean cut: Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men. Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nRookwood notes that the shift away from formal is industry-wide. \u201cMen\u2019s fashion changes more slowly than women\u2019s fashion. But if you look at what men were wearing in 2014 compared to 2019, it is markedly different. This is a big change. We\u2019re just not as buttoned up as we were.\u201d The emphasis has moved from fine tailoring to luxury streetwear; from Milan and London to New York and Los Angeles; from Don Draper on the front of GQ to Kanye West on the sneaker site Highsnobiety. Louis Vuitton last year appointed West\u2019s old associate Virgil Abloh as the artistic director of its menswear collection. Abloh made his name with the Chicago sneaker brand Off-White, where his stated mission was to add an \u201cintellectual layer\u201d to streetwear. While in the past, a woven silk tie from Brioni sent a subtle cue about status, now it\u2019s more likely to be limited-edition Yeezys. There is a whole new set of rules to fall foul of \u2013 as the billion-heir Kendall Roy discovers in the HBO TV series Succession when he fails to impress some prospective clients by wearing a pair of Lanvin calfskin sneakers to a meeting.\n\nRookwood feels that suits and all that will come around again \u2013 \u201ceverything comes back, eventually, in fashion\u201d \u2013 but I\u2019m not so sure. There\u2019s a feeling of permanence in this shift, a once-and-for-all changing of the guard. You might cherish an idea of a father taking his son out to buy his first suit. Now a father is more likely to ask his son where to get a limited-edition Supreme hoodie. In any case, today\u2019s 40- and 50-somethings grew up in a world of hip-hop and punk and trainers and tees. It\u2019s what they know.\n\nBesides, when I survey a few not-particularly-fashion-y friends, they seem OK with the new relaxed dress codes. No, hardly anyone wears a suit to work any more. And no, hardly anyone mourns this loss. It\u2019s just easier, freer and more comfortable to wear, say, a checked shirt and chinos. And if you happen to spill mayonnaise on your Urban Outfitted crotch while snarfing an al-desko sandwich, there\u2019s usually no need to visit a dry-cleaner either. Economy comes into play. One friend notes that if you spend \u00a3100 on a suit, you will end up with a rubbish suit, but if you spend \u00a3100 on trousers and a shirt, you can look sharp and distinctive. He does keep a suit in the office, just in case he needs to go and meet that sort of client. But it\u2019s become the sartorial equivalent of a fax machine; a faintly arcane piece of equipment reserved for specific uses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The way we wore: Dan Rookwood, US Editor for Mr Porter in January 2015. Now he says his wardrobe is \u2018like a museum\u2019. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, notes the American style writer David Coggins. \u201cIf you look at the men who wear formalwear well, they always look incredibly relaxed and ultimately comfortable. That\u2019s what style is: it\u2019s having a sense of ease with yourself in any situation.\u201d\n\nThe idea of tailoring wasn\u2019t about following trends \u2013 massive collars one season, tiny ones the next, etc \u2013 it was to find something that worked for your shape, your build, your outlook. It was a process that required a certain self-knowledge. I suppose there\u2019s no reason why luxury streetwear shouldn\u2019t provide the same journey. I mean, when Frank Ocean sings about Nikes, it sounds like a meaningful relationship. But one thing that troubles me about this new power-dressing is the emphasis on branding, labels, items that cost hundreds of pounds not because an apprenticed tailor has spent a long time crafting it, but simply because that\u2019s what the market says this thing is worth. Enforced sneakerdom is its own tyranny.\n\nCoggins suggests we have come to place too high a value on comfort as a society. \u201cIt used to be accepted that you would go through stages of slight discomfort to have an education. So you would read difficult books, or you\u2019d sit through some operas, and maybe the first time you didn\u2019t like it, but you would learn to like it \u2013 or at least appreciate what it is at stake. Now there\u2019s this thought that comfort is everything. People dress as if they\u2019re at home all the time, and they act like they\u2019re at home when they\u2019re in public. It\u2019s why people lie down on the floor in airports and Facetime in restaurants and put their feet up on train seats.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another aspect of this that troubles me. One of the pleasures of wearing a suit to work, for me, was shedding it when I got home. Now there is less distinction between work and home, on and off, public and private. I might be answering a work email at 10.37pm, I might be having a nap at 3.07pm, I might be tapping away in a caf\u00e9 a 11.45am on a Sunday while families brunch around me.\n\nSome freelancers I consult cherish the freedom of working in their pyjamas \u2013 \u201cIf you can\u2019t motivate yourself without a literal suit on, maybe freelancing is not for your temperament,\u201d says one. Another notes the environmental cost of maintaining a full office wardrobe with a different outfit each day. But others warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms.\n\nFreelancers warn against the entropic lure of Uniqlo stretch jogging bottoms\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m usually in some smart-casual-compromise outfit that is neither truly smart nor truly casual. Maybe some overly formal trousers and some underly white Stan Smiths. Maybe a canvas tote bag with my laptop in it, or a shirt that could use an iron \u2013 but am I going to iron a shirt for the school run?\n\nI am more often than not in trainers. I find brogues or loafers make a huge clomping noise on the laminate floor of my co-working space. And when I come up to London, I\u2019m often, literally, running between meetings. I can\u2019t help thinking that the move towards trainers as acceptable workwear has a lot to do with the fact that work is now so much a question of inputs and outputs; life is just hectic; we\u2019re expected to \u201cperform\u201d like athletes. But the trainer is also the footwear of the retired, the overleisured, the underemployed.\n\nIn Nikolai Goncharov\u2019s 1859 novel Oblomov, the dressing gown worn by the title character \u2013 khalat in Russian \u2013 becomes a symbol of the turpitude of the archetypal 19th-century \u201csuperfluous man\u201d. There is even a word in Russian \u2013 khalatnost, \u201cdressing-gown-ness\u201d \u2013 to describe the condition. I wonder what the 21st-century equivalent would be. Sneakerness? Jerseyness? Dressing-down-ness?\n\nI say I never wear a suit and tie any more. The one exception was a recent 20-year university reunion which required all of the men to dress in \u201clounge suits\u201d. Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
