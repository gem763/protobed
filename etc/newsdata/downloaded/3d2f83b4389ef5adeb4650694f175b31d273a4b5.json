Well, probably not, considering the second- and third-hand nature of the information in the whistleblower complaint, but Donald Trump argues that he should get the chance before the House goes down Impeachment Road. Trump made the constitutional argument on Twitter last night, and continued in a similar vein this morning.\n\nIn another constitutional argument, he also wants Adam Schiff interrogated and arrested for \u201cTreason.\u201d And that is called overplaying your hand, to put it mildly:\n\nHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\n\u2026.In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u201cWhistleblower.\u201d Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nTrump escalated to asking for Schiff\u2019s arrest this morning:\n\nRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThis is as stupid as Schiff\u2019s parody last week. It\u2019s incredible that we have to explain this to adults, but what Trump describes here bears absolutely no resemblance to treason \u2014 not even in a moral sense, let alone the legal sense over which Trump rants. Article III Section 3 of the Constitution establishes the only legal definition of treason:\n\nTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\n\nIn other words, it requires a declaration of war (which we haven\u2019t had since World War II) and explicit aid to the enemy named by it. Bzzzzt! Thank you for playing! Nor is what Schiff did treason in a moral sense; he\u2019s attacking Trump, not the United States of America. We do not have lese majeste laws in the US; one is allowed to criticize the president, even unfairly, even dishonestly, without it being a case of treason. Schiff may be lying, he may be smearing Trump, and he may be abusing his position as House Intel chair, but those are all things that fall a very, very long way short from treason. Or even fraud, although at least that one\u2019s arguably in the ballpark in the moral sense, if not legal.\n\nIf Barack Obama had accused Republicans pushing the birther conspiracy theory of treason and called for their arrest, his critics would have screamed for Obama\u2019s impeachment. If Trump wants to make a case that Schiff\u2019s dishonest about him abusing his office, then just stick to that. It would be a lot easier to defend Trump against allegations of abusing the powers of his office if Trump wasn\u2019t going all Red Queen in demanding Schiff\u2019s arrest for a non-existent crime. Just sayin\u2019.\n\nAnyway, the whistleblower does plan to meet with someone, but it\u2019s not Trump:\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff said Sunday that his panel has reached an agreement to secure testimony from the anonymous whistleblower whose detailed complaint launched an impeachment investigation into President Trump. The announcement from Schiff came on the same day that Tom Bossert, a former Trump homeland security adviser, delivered a rebuke of the president, saying in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the implications of Trump\u2019s recently reported actions.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite clear just how solid this agreement is. His attorney Mark Zaid was more ambiguous about a specific date for this meeting, and even whether it had been fully nailed down:\n\nOne of the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, Mark Zaid, said in a statement that bipartisan negotiations in both chambers are ongoing \u201cand we understand and agree that protecting the whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount.\u201d He added that no date or time for the testimony has been set.\n\nEventually the meeting will take place, but almost surely in closed session. Unfortunately for Trump, it\u2019s not a judicial process that would put his liberty or property at risk, so the House does not have to allow him to personally face his accuser. Fortunately for Trump, a number of Republicans on the committee will act as his proxies in that regard, testing the veracity of the hearsay in the complaint. That might be enough \u2026 if Trump doesn\u2019t lose his mind and call for the arrests of opposition lawmakers for the crime of being politicians. Maybe someone should take his phone away for the next few weeks.", "description": "Whistleblower to meet with House Intel instead.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TrumpAngryFingerPt715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
