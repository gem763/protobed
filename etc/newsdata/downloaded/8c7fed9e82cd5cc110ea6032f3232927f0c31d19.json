Industry sources said some oil buyers were holding off hiring COSCO tankers while they check with legal teams to better understand the impact of the sanctions.\n\n\"The market is fearful of sanctions so refiners are taking some preventive measures. We'll have to see how widely implemented the sanctions will be,\" said KY Lin, spokesman for Taiwanese refiner Formosa Petrochemical , a major crude oil buyer in Asia.\n\nFriday's jolt left shipping rates springing back to levels not seen since mid-September drone and missile strikes on key Saudi Arabian oil production facilities roiled global markets. The COSCO vessels are equal to about 7.5% of the world's fleet of supertankers, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\"Charterers are in trouble,\" a North Asian shipbroker said, declining to be named citing company policy. \"It was terrible news for every one of us with the Saudi drone attack, and now the market has to deal with U.S. sanctions on COSCO.\"\n\n\"Good news for owners, good time for them to earn money,\" the broker said.\n\nWhile diplomatic tensions between the United States and Iran remain high, a British-flagged tanker that had been detained by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday left Bandar Abbas port heading for international waters. Thursday, Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec and India's largest refiner Indian Oil Corp , cancelled bookings of some COSCO ships and scrambled to find alternative ships to move their crude on. have definitely been pushed higher by these sanctions,\" said an executive at a top shipbroker in Singapore, adding that ships carrying Middle East and to Asia were subject to the biggest impact. The broker declined to be identified, citing company policy.\n\nCrude shipments from the United States to Asia have also been affected. Industry sources said provisional bookings for VLCCs Cosmerry Lake and Qiu Hu to load U.S. oil in the second half of October had been scrapped. Cosmerry Lake is owned by Cosmerry Lake Maritime Inc and managed by Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian), while Yuan Qiu Hu is owned and managed by Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian).\n\nCOSCO officials were tight-lipped on Friday.\n\n\"(The) company is assessing the situation and impact internally as soon as possible, but so far we don't have anything to update you,\" said Zhang Zheng, an investor relations official with COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation , parent of COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co, Ltd.\n\nTrading in shares of COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation was halted on Thursday after the news on the sanctions, and will remain halted on Friday.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2n96Yb2 FACTBOX-U.S. imposes Iran sanctions on China tankers\n\nGRAPHIC: Global oil freight rates rocket as U.S. sanctions tanker units of Chinese giant COSCO\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2n41dM4\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "WRAPUP 1-Global oil shipping rates soar as U.S. supertanker sanctions rattle crude trade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED0B1A3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
