On the other, it has meant that the case \u2013 and the smiling face \u2013 of Tafida are not featuring as prominently as they might in the public discussion. And that is, to my mind at least, to be regretted.\n\nTafida is the latest small child whose fate rests with the UK courts, having become the subject of a high-stakes legal tussle between parents and doctors. The small girl collapsed in February after complaining of a headache. Doctors found that blood vessels in her brain had ruptured, and there was nothing that could be done. Barts Health NHS Trust, which is responsible for the Royal London Hospital where she is being treated, wants to stop life support, arguing that this is in the child\u2019s best interests.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHer parents, Shelina Begum, and her father, Mohammed Raqeeb, are at odds with the medics on two counts. Tafida\u2019s mother insists that Tafida is aware; she can track visitors around her room, open her eyes and move her limbs. In other words, she retains hope, whereas her London doctors insist there is none.\n\nSecond, there is disagreement about what should happen next. Her parents want to move her to Italy. They say that a children\u2019s hospital in Genoa has agreed to treat her and will continue life-support until doctors there establish that Tafida is brain dead.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 16-year-old Swede, who sets sail for New York this week to take her message to the United States, has been a target for abuse but sees that as proof she is having an effect AFP/Getty\n\nThe barrister for the trust, Katie Gollop QC, presented the conflict as one between the parents, who wanted the right to go to a country where they were the \u201csole decision-makers\u201d, and the doctors, who believed that this was not in the child\u2019s \u201cmedical best interests\u201d. Not necessarily, note, her best interests in any broader sense, but her \u201cmedical\u201d best interests.\n\nAt which point, you will realise we have been around these tracks several times before.\n\nThe last time such a dilemma hit the headlines was two years ago when Charlie Gard\u2019s winsome face beamed out from practically every front page. He had been born with a rare genetic condition which entailed severe brain damage, partial paralysis and an incapacity to breathe unaided.\n\nAgain, the conflict was between his parents, who wanted to take him for what they saw as last-resort treatment in the US, and UK medics, who said there was no hope and he should be allowed to die with dignity. The case ended up in the European Court of Human Rights, which upheld the ruling of the UK Supreme Court, that life support should be halted. His parents were, though, allowed to take him home for his final few days.\n\nThere was also the case of Alfie Evans, who suffered from a degenerative neurological condition and had spent most of his short life in a semi-vegetative state. His parents \u2013 like Tafida\u2019s \u2013 disagreed with the UK doctors\u2019 decision to switch off his life support and wanted to transfer him to Italy, where they believed he would be kept alive for longer, and they would have a greater say.\n\nI would also add the case of Ashya King, the 12-year-old boy who was taken by his parents from a Southampton hospital, where he had been treated for what doctors diagnosed as a terminal brain tumour. They were pursued across Europe by UK police, but eventually took him to Prague for the proton beam therapy they had wanted all along. The last news on Ashya was that he had recovered well and was back at school.\n\nNow it is true that in some respects all these cases are different. Neither Charlie Gard nor Alfie Evans ever had anything that might be described as a normal life. Tafida and Ashya did \u2013 which may partly explain why their parents were reluctant to accept medical advice to the effect that there was, essentially, no hope.\n\nBut they also have many aspects in common: the quest for different treatment, or treatment at all, abroad, and the view of the parents that they, rather than medics or lawyers, should have the last word on what happens to their children.\n\nIt is a view, I would suggest, that many, maybe most, parents would sympathise with, if not totally concur with. And it is one reason why I continue to find these cases so troubling.\n\nAs seen by the doctors and the courts, it is the welfare of the child \u2013 the child\u2019s best interests \u2013 that must be protected, as per England\u2019s 1989 Children Act (updated in 2004). This law was seen then, and still is, as a landmark piece of legislation, enshrining the principle that the child\u2019s welfare is always, and in all circumstances, paramount.\n\nTo this end, it requires that in any litigation a child must have his or her own representation, who is separate from parents or guardian and argues in the interests of the child alone.\n\nWhich is all well and good. Where a child has been harmed, or is judged to be at risk of harm, that principle deserves to be unimpeachable. But are these children \u2013 whose fate has reached some of the highest courts of the land \u2013 really in this sort of danger?\n\nI can understand that removing a child from the medical support they are being given at a UK hospital will entail risks, could even prove fatal, but if the parent recognises this, and nonetheless sees treatment elsewhere as a choice they have considered and want to pursue \u2013 and are prepared to pay for \u2013 why should UK medics try so hard to stop them?\n\nIn none of these cases, that I am aware of, has any parent demanded that the NHS fund the travel or treatment they wanted. Many of them undertook exhaustive research, and often fundraising, before deciding. If other countries, such as Italy, have a different cut-off point for life-support, and the parents find this preferable for religious reasons or any other, why should a UK parent not transfer a child there, if the Italian hospital is prepared to admit them? I find the Ashya King case particularly concerning.\n\nHis parents felt that his doctors did not want to accept that treatment unavailable in the UK might be more suitable for their child \u2013 even as it later transpired, a very small selection of children were already being sent to the US for proton beam treatment at NHS expense, and that the NHS was in the early stages of investing in facilities to provide the same treatment itself.\n\nWhat is more, it appears to have left Ashya no worse off: in other words, his parents have been proved right.\n\nWith Tafida Raqeeb, the medical prognosis presented to the court this week is dire. Lawyers for the hospital trust said that keeping her alive artificially would mean she could suffer seizures, hip dislocation and curvature of the spine. This is part of their argument for ending her life support now \u2013 those \u201cmedical best interests\u201d they talked about. Cutting off her life at this point, though, with this justification, seems quite at odds with the refusal of parliament and the courts to countenance assisted suicide, let alone euthanasia.\n\nThere is another point, too, which might seem peripheral but needs to be raised. Ashya King\u2019s family were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses; Charlie Gard\u2019s parents were reportedly advised by people sympathic to the US pro-Life movement; Tafida\u2019s parents are Muslims and insisted on having a Muslim \u201cadvocate\u201d to represent their child.\n\nConsciously or not, does the medical profession perhaps take a different attitude to parents whose beliefs might lie outside the mainstream? Or do some of these parents perhaps place less trust in UK medics?\n\nWhatever the ruling by the high court, Tafida Raqeeb\u2019s case is another that could well make its way to the UK Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. And once again, no doubt, any rights of the parents will come a poor second to the perceived rights of the child.\n\nIt seems to me, though, that the legal interpretation of a child\u2019s rights may have become too narrow, and it is time to accept that the parents of a young and very sick child are also entitled to a view as to their child\u2019s best interests.", "description": "It may be both a blessing and a curse for the family of five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb that the UK public and media currently have other things on their minds.", "authors": ["Mary Dejevsky"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/16/15/tafida-raqeeb-court.jpg"}
