More than three million people expressed an interest in taking part.\n\nHowever, warning signs around Area 51 made it clear that no trespassers would be tolerated.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Little is known about what happens inside the facility\n\nThe US Air Force warned that Area 51 was \"an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces\".\n\nWhat happened on Friday?\n\nNot a lot.\n\nDespite much anticipation surrounding the event, only around 75 people turned up at the front gate and nobody attempted to enter.\n\nThe only person to be arrested was a man caught urinating near the entrance and a woman was detained for an undisclosed reason, Associated Press reported.\n\nThe \"raid\" was more of a small-scale celebration, with enthusiasts dressing up and holding placards.\n\n\"I'm a little disappointed because it's a lot less people than they said online,\" Nathan Brown, who drove more than 700 miles from Portland, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper.\n\nWhat is Area 51?\n\nIt was created during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union as a testing and development facility for aircraft.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Some local businesses have embraced Area 51's association with alien mythology\n\nThe secrecy surrounding the site has helped fuel many conspiracy theories.\n\nMost famous is the claim that the site hosts an alien spacecraft and the bodies of its pilots after they crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government says there were no aliens and the crashed craft was a weather balloon.\n\nOthers claim to have seen UFOs above or near the site, while some say they have been abducted by aliens, and even experimented on, before being returned to Earth.", "description": "Some three million expressed an interest in raiding the US base to \"see aliens\", but 75 turned up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1837E/production/_108889199_mediaitem108889198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
