In a new interview with CBS News, O\u2019Rourke says his compensated confiscation plan wouldn\u2019t require any new taxes, because they\u2019d just confiscate the cash to pay for the program from gun manufacturers.\n\n\u201cI think that a mandatory buyback can be financed with a surcharge that would be paid by gun manufacturers,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThose who are making the AR-15s and AK-47s and continue to sell them into our communities despite the terror that they\u2019ve inspired and the lives that they\u2019ve taken. I think this is the right way to fund a mandatory buyback without imposing any new taxes on our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nIf O\u2019Rourke really wants Americans to turn in 15-million firearms for fair market value of, say, $1000 per gun, he\u2019s talking about a $15-billion price tag just for the compensated confiscation portion of his plan. The entire firearms, ammunition, and hunting industry generated an estimated $21.3-billion in retail sales 2018, but that figure includes a lot of sales by companies that have nothing to do with the firearms that O\u2019Rourke wants to ban. His delusional plan wouldn\u2019t just strip legal gun owners of the most commonly sold rife in America today, it would cause huge economic upheaval in the firearms industry. And why would Beto stop with gun manufacturers? Surely firearm retailers would be expected to pay their \u201cfair share\u201d of his program as well, right?\n\nO\u2019Rourke continues to offer up vague talk of punishment for those who wouldn\u2019t comply with his ban as well.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who does not [turn in their weapon] and is caught in possession or seen in possession of one of these weapons of war, one of these instruments of terror, that weapon will be taken from them and they will be fined, and if they should persist in continuing to use and to buy these weapons, then there will be other consequences in the criminal code.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther consequences\u201d. O\u2019Rourke can\u2019t bring himself to talk about throwing people in prison for non-violent possessory offenses, but that\u2019s exactly what he means. O\u2019Rourke is running as a champion of criminal justice reform, but you can\u2019t talk about reforming the criminal justice system while declaring your support for a host of new non-violent felony offenses in federal statutes. The media\u2019s not even asking O\u2019Rourke about his gun licensing and firearms registration scheme, but enforcement of those plans would also lead to otherwise law-abiding American citizens going to federal prison for possessory offenses. O\u2019Rourke says he wants to end the war on drugs, but he\u2019s not nearly as vocal about the fact that he wants to replace it with a war on guns.\n\nI haven\u2019t written much about O\u2019Rourke lately, because his presidential campaign is going nowhere. It\u2019s been more than a week since he\u2019s had a poll where he\u2019s scored higher than 1%, in fact, so I\u2019m not too worried about a President O\u2019Rourke being in a position to enact his gun ban fantasies. I do think this particular bit about confiscating cash from gun companies to pay for a \u201cbuyback\u201d is worth noting, however, because I suspect that as we get closer to Election Day next year, you\u2019ll hear the eventual nominee bring up the idea of making the firearms industry pay a financial price for engaging in the business of guns and ammunition. It may not look exactly like Beto\u2019s $15-billion idea, but the intention will still be to hurt the industry as much as possible.", "description": "The presidential candidate is polling at 1%, but he still has big plans for his gun ban, including confiscating cash from gun companies to pay for it.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/df70e45d-db25-4f5c-adf4-10277a1f7f10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
