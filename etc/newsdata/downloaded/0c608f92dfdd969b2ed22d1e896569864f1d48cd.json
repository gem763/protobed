Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, told reporters the report is the first he\u2019d heard of it.\n\n\u201cThat person, Mr. Stier, didn\u2019t reach out or provide information to the committee majority,\u201d Mr. Grassley said during a Senate floor speech. \u201cMy office never received anything from Mr. Stier or his unnamed friends.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Grassley, whose panel oversaw the Kavanaugh confirmation process, said Monday that his staff members would have interviewed Mr. Stier and investigated a charge that resembled that in The Times had they been told.\n\n\u201cHad my staff received substantive allegations or had he approached me or my staff, we would have attempted to take a statement and interview him,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nIn his floor speech, Mr. Grassley denounced The New York Times for \u201csome embarrassing, irresponsible missteps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not an allegation. It\u2019s barely a third-hand rumor,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong other things, The Times report initially hadn\u2019t noted that the woman in Mr. Stier\u2019s account does not recall any such misconduct.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
