REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo\n\nThe justices, on the second day of their new nine-month term, kicked off a scheduled two hours of arguments in three related cases as LGBT rights activists held a demonstration near the courthouse.\n\nThe Supreme Court delivered an important gay rights decision in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Its dynamics on LGBT issues, however, changed following the 2018 retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who backed gay rights in major cases and wrote the same-sex marriage ruling.\n\nAt issue is whether gay and transgender people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, colour, national origin and religion.\n\nThe legal fight focuses on the definition of \u201csex\u201d in Title VII. The plaintiffs, along with civil rights groups and many large companies, have argued that discriminating against gay and transgender workers is inherently based on their sex and consequently is illegal.\n\nA couple of hundred demonstrators advocating for LGBT rights gathered a short distance from the white marble courthouse on an overcast day in the U.S. capital. They chanted for equal rights and held signs including ones that read, \u201cDo fire Trump. Don\u2019t fire LGBTQ workers,\u201d \u201cDiscrimination is bad for business\u201d and \u201cLGBT Americans power our economy.\u201d\n\nPolice moved demonstrators away from the plaza in front of the courthouse due to concern over \u201csuspicious\u201d packages.\n\n\u201cI am here because I\u2019m a queer person and right now my right to live my life as everyone else is being determined by nine people, none of whom are queer, all of whom are cisgender,\u201d said Washington resident Raegan Davis, 21. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important for our voices to be part of this conversation because if we aren\u2019t here there\u2019s no guarantee that they will.\u201d\n\n\u2018THIS HAS TO STOP\u2019\n\nA small group of demonstrators opposing gay and transgender rights also was present holding signs including two that read, \u201cFear God\u201d and \u201cSin and shame, not pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has to stop. The more and more we give to the homosexual community, the more and more this nation is going to be destroyed,\u201d said Jacob Phelps, 36, from Topeka, Kansas, who held a sign that read, \u201cJesus will return in wrath.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very easy in the workplace, shut your mouth, do what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by President Donald Trump, whose administration has argued that Title VII does not cover sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe arguments present the court with its first major test on gay and transgender rights since Trump appointed conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy, with the four liberal justices sympathetic to LGBT rights. Kavanaugh, whose approach to gay rights is unclear, could provide a pivotal vote.\n\nA ruling in favour of the plaintiffs would give gay and transgender workers greater protections, especially in the 28 U.S. states that do not already have comprehensive measures against employment discrimination. A ruling against the plaintiffs would mean gay and transgender people in those states would have few options to challenge workplace discrimination.\n\nThe court will hear two cases about gay people who have said they were fired due to their sexual orientation. One involves a former county child welfare services coordinator from Georgia named Gerald Bostock. The other involves a New York skydiving instructor named Donald Zarda. He died after the case began and the matter is being pursued by his estate.\n\nThe third case involves a Detroit funeral home\u2019s bid to reverse a lower court ruling that it violated Title VII by firing a transgender funeral director named Aimee Stephens after Stephens revealed plans to transition from male to female.\n\nRulings in the cases are due by the end of June.\n\nTrump, a Republican with vigorous support among evangelical Christian voters, has pursued policies taking aim at gay and transgender rights. His administration has supported the right of certain businesses to refuse to serve gay people on the basis of religious objections to gay marriage, restricted transgender service members in the military and rescinded protections on bathroom access for transgender students in public schools.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department and the employers in the cases have argued that Congress did not intend for Title VII to cover gay and transgender people when it passed the law. Conservative religious groups and various Republican-led states back the administration.\n\nBig business, typically eager to avoid liability in employment disputes, is backing the LGBT plaintiffs. More than 200 companies, including Amazon, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Bank of America Corp, joined a friend-of-the-court brief asking the justices to rule in favour of the plaintiffs.", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing arguments in a major LGBT rights dispute over whether a landmark decades-old federal anti-discrimination law that prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex covers gay and transgender employees.", "authors": ["Lawrence Hurley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438319798&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9709B", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
