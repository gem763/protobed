This fell to 67 per cent in Wales and 57 per cent in Northern Ireland. More than half of libraries were also used as a classroom for regular lessons.\n\nThe survey also shows discrepancies between rich and poor - 91% of schools that have between none and 9% of pupils eligible for free schools meals - a key measure of poverty - have a library area.\n\nThis drops to 81% among schools where 25% to 49% are eligible for free dinners, and to 56% where half or more pupils are eligible. Only 12 schools in this final category took part in the survey.\n\n'These findings indicate that pupils in schools with a higher proportion of free school meals are less likely to experience the range of positive benefits a school library can provide,' the report said.\n\nThe survey was commissioned by the Great School Libraries campaign, which aims to ensure all children have access to books.", "description": "A study of 1,750 schools in the UK has found that 13 percent did not have a designated library and poorer children are less likely to have access to loan books than their wealthier peers.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19805950-0-image-a-19_1571257987658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
