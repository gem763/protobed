CNBC reported on an internal company memo about the change, and Walmart confirmed the news in a statement to The Verge.\n\n\u201cGiven the growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty regarding e-cigarettes, we plan to discontinue the sale of electronic nicotine delivery products at all Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club U.S. locations,\u201d says the statement. \u201cWe will complete our exit after selling through current inventory.\u201d\n\nWalmart\u2019s decision comes soon after US health officials announced the eighth death due to a mysterious vaping-related lung illness. The first death was reported in August. Since then, several media companies have pulled vaping ads, and policymakers have begun to tighten restrictions in the US and elsewhere. Yesterday, Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced a bill to ban e-cigarette flavors other than tobacco and apply new taxes to the products.\n\nWalmart stopped selling fruit-flavored vaping products earlier this year\n\nWalmart stopped selling fruit-flavored e-cigarette products earlier this year, and it raised the minimum age for buying tobacco products to 21. E-cigarettes have been promoted as a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes, but dessert-like flavors have been blamed for enticing teenagers into vaping.\n\nThe lung illness, however, is related to e-cigarettes in general. In fact, it\u2019s not clear precisely what\u2019s causing it. Since the start of this year\u2019s vaping-related deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that people \u201cconsider refraining from using e-cigarette or vaping products\u201d \u2014 although if they used vaping products to quit smoking, they shouldn\u2019t switch back to cigarettes.\n\nWhile the rules around cigarettes are well-established, vaping has occupied a more nebulous position, and it\u2019s not surprising that a company like Walmart could find that disconcerting. Walmart declined to say whether it might restart selling e-cigarettes if new legislation is passed or health inspectors offer more information about the recent illnesses.", "description": "Mega-retailer Walmart will stop selling e-cigarettes once its current stock is exhausted, citing \"regulatory complexity and uncertainty\" around the products.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AUSusxzjNAbciFR3u2ebqjdbIQs=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11908455/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
