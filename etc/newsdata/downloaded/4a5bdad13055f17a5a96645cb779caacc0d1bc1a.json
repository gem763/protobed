He has designed a collection that conveys fashion as a way to allow people to walk through fields of possibilities, cultivate beauty, make diversity sacrosanct and celebrate the self in expression and identity.\"\n\nRead more: People are outraged after a fashion brand made Columbine and Sandy Hook-inspired hoodies with rips that look like bullet holes\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times, Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele said he wanted the Spring/Summer 2020 collection to show how \"Gucci can be the antidote\" to restricted individuality.\n\n\"I wanted to show how society today can have the ability to confine individuality and that Gucci can be the antidote,\" Alessandro told the New York Times. \"For me, the show was the journey from conformity to freedom and creativity.\"\n\n\"Uniforms, utilitarian clothes, such straitjackets, were included in the fashion show as the most extreme version of restriction imposed by society and those who control it,\" he continued. \"These clothes were a statement for the fashion show and part of a performance.\"\n\nThe New York Times also reports that because the fashion show \"was partly about freedom,\" the brand \"felt the model should be free to protest.\"\n\nStraitjacket-inspired clothes from Gucci.
