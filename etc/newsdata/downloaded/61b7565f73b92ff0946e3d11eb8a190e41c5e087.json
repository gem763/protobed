It will happen.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of The Lima Group, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru, some of the more than 50 countries recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the interim president of Venezuela, also attended the meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the puppeteer with the puppets telling them what to do,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cAnd, of course, they are all really frustrated because they have tried all year long to overthrow our government... they have sanctioned, and they have imposed all these blockades against the Venezuelan people, and they haven\u2019t reached their goals... and they won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAT U.N., TRUMP SLAMS MADURO AS 'CUBAN PUPPET' WHILE VENEZUELAN REPRESENTATIVE CASUALLY READS BOOK\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration stepped up pressure on Maduro\u2019s regime, renewing demands for tougher sanctions and more aid for refugees.\n\n\u201cThe Maduro regime does not care about the welfare of their own people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey care about their own power. It\u2019s what they want \u2014 power and money.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and more than a dozen Latin American countries have agreed to investigate and arrest associates and senior officials of Maduro\u2019s administration suspected of crimes like drug trafficking and financing terrorism, but have not appeared to support using force or military intervention to depose the controversial leader.\n\nVENEZUELA REPORTEDLY SET TO JOIN ROSTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSERS ON U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is leading our allies to act against a tyrant regime that is a clear threat to the maintenance of peace and security of the region and the world,\u201d said former senior diplomat Isaias Medina, who represented Venezuela at the U.N. in New York until 2017 when he left his post over killings of anti-government protesters. \u201cLatin America is waking up... the Venezuelan people need an international coalition action urgently.\u201d\n\nTrump previously refused to rule out U.S. military intervention in Venezuela but said his goal has been to secure a peaceful transition of power to Guaid\u00f3. \u201cWe have it under control, we\u2019re watching it very carefully,\u201d he said earlier this week.\n\nWHO IS NICOLAS MADURO? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT VENEZUELA'S SOCIALIST LEADER\n\nThe White House announced this week it would more than triple support for pro-democracy work in Venezuela, a nation suffering from a humanitarian crisis after 20 years of socialist rule.\n\nDuring the meeting with the opposition\u2019s delegation, Trump cited U.N. statistics showing that since 2018, Maduro\u2019s Cuban-trained \u201cdeath squads\u201d have killed up to 10,000 Venezuelans, \u201cand they think that number is extremely low.\u201d\n\nArreaza said his country would continue working with Cuban security and military forces despite Trump calling Maduro a \u201cCuban puppet\u201d in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday morning.\n\nAlmost 200 leaders from around the world descended on New York for the UNGA\u2014but Maduro and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key ally in his country\u2019s political crisis, were not among them, instead holding their own talks in Moscow on Wednesday\u2014a reflection of the growing relationship between the two countries that Medina called \u201ca direct challenge to NATO\u2019s partners and allies.\u201d\n\nArreaza seemed to extend an offer of peace talks to the U.S. \u2014 but under strict conditions.\n\n\u201cWe hope that someday the United States... learns to respect not only the Venezuelan people but all the Latin American people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf President Trump or his government wants to have dialogue with the Venezuelan government, our hands are open and we can have dialogue. If they respect us, we will respect them,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite the U.N. and other nations still recognizing the Maduro government and its delegation, Arreaza called on U.N. member states to reconsider New York City as the headquarters of the international organization, saying the host country has disrespected his country.\n\n\u201cThe representation of a delegation at the United Nations is predicated upon the fact that the delegation truly represents the people, or at least does not oppress them,\u201d Medina said. \u201cThe General Assembly should declare that the current Venezuelan regime in power has no right to represent the people that they oppress in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza blasted President Trump Wednesday for meeting with the Venezuelan opposition\u2019s delegation to the United Nations General Assembly instead of the official government delegation.", "authors": ["Allie Raffa", "Allie Raffa Joined Fox News In", "Currently Serves A Multimedia Reporter Based In Tampa"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/26/694940094001_6089520856001_6089521112001-vs.jpg"}
