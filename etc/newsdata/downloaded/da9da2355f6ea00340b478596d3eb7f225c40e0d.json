Still, Bonkers saw the opportunity when Pocket.Watch, the company that owns the licensing to \"Ryan's World,\" reached out.\n\nRyan is known for his unboxing videos, particularly those with mystery boxes. So the first product Bonkers decided to make for \"Ryan's World\" was a \"giant mystery egg,\" which includes many toys.\n\nThat toy, \"Ryan's World Giant Mystery Egg,\" became a hit. It was recognized as a top-rated kids toy in 2018 by Walmart and is available at major retailers like Target, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nBut the mystery egg was just the start of an emerging business for Bonkers.\n\nEstablishing a name in the digital-media toy space.\n\nBonkers, founded three years ago by Brian Bonnett (president and CEO), Jade Throgmorton (creative director), and Stallings Stumm, who heads the marketing department, has made a name for itself making toys focused on influencers and other digital-media properties.\n\n\"We noticed there were a lot of changes going on in the toy industry,\" Stallings Stumm said. \"Kids are not really watching television, they are online, on social media. And the stars these days are YouTube stars.\"\n\nBut Stallings Stumm said the team still felt kids would like to have something tangible to go along with their new digital interests.\n\nBonkers launched its first product in partnership with the popular mobile game Slither.io, which Bonnett got the idea for after watching his son continuously playing the game.\n\n\"What really put us on the map was our Slither sales,\" Stallings Stumm said. \"We placed them in Target and Walmart, which really set us on the right path.\"\n\nBonkers also found that mystery boxes were a big hit.\n\n\"Kids love the mystery, surprise element of not knowing what they are going to get,\" she said. \"We leveraged that blind unboxing element first with the Slither brand, and saw it became quite successful.\"\n\nThen came Ryan's World, where Bonkers built on what it learned with Slither.io.\n\nAfter the success of the launch with Pocket.Watch and Ryan's World, Bonkers is expanding to other influencer clients. (Ryan's World has expanded its licensing deals, too, and is working with other toy companies.) Bonkers has created a toy line with FGTeeV (a family gaming channel with 12 million subscribers) and is working with other influencers who haven't yet been announced. Ryan ToysReview began working with Bonkers at the end of 2017. Bonkers Toys\n\nPartnering with the right influencers and driving sales.\n\nThe key to a successful influencer toy line is collectability and working with a family-friendly YouTube channel that's willing to promote the product, Stallings Stumm said.\n\nShe said being active and reaching parents on platforms like Facebook has also been important because not everyone is on YouTube with their kids. Bonkers also promotes at industry events and submits toys for traditional parenting magazines.\n\nBut what's really helped Bonkers is working with the right influencers.\n\n\"We don't need television advertising for this brand,\" she said of Ryan's World. Bonkers knew that if it pulled off the collaboration with Ryan ToysReview correctly, it would be massive because of the engagement and following he has online.\n\nFor more on how influencers are profiting from their success online, according to industry professionals, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "Toy manufacturing company Bonkers Toys creates products for the new media companies by developing branded products with popular internet stars.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8246812e22af70eb5a3497-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
