It\u2019s a sentiment that resonates. She\u2019s the same size as the average woman in the UK \u2014 16 \u2014 and we bond over the singularly demoralising pursuit of flattering jeans. But with sunny Californian optimism, Hayley says the shape of fashion is changing. \u2018We have made amazing leaps and bounds. \u201cCurve\u201d collections in the UK High Street are so advanced compared to America.\u2019\n\nShe should know \u2014 she\u2019s been modelling plus-size clothes since she was 14 and has become one of the sector\u2019s most outspoken advocates. We meet as her new campaign with British fashion website Simply Be is about to launch, for which she models a range that comes in sizes 12 to 32.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff's daughter Hayley has revealed that being a plus-size model helped to save her self-esteem\n\nWhile her father was running up and down a beach in red swimming trunks, pictured together in January 2010 in Los Angeles, Hayley was cutting clothes to 'make them fit'\n\nWearing a ribbed black wool dress from Simply Be with her own emerald fake fur stole (\u2018it\u2019s my cuddler for the cold,\u2019 she says, stroking it), if anything Hayley looks smaller in person than in her campaign shots.\n\nShe\u2019s tall at 5ft 8in (although she always wears heels; today it is black patent leather boots). But the most plus-size things about her are her eyelashes and luxuriant blonde hair. She has inherited her father\u2019s turquoise eyes and defined jawline.\n\nHayley talks frankly about how she hit puberty early. \u2018I\u2019m so blessed, I love my bosoms,\u2019 she laughs, and juts out her chest in a Baywatch-style pose.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t always so confident in her body. Hayley\u2019s breasts grew when she was eight, long before anyone else in her class. \u2018Early development isn\u2019t really talked about, so in the swimming changing room the person next to me would go \u201cwhat are those?\u201d It was uncomfortable.\u2019\n\nInstead of tearing herself apart over cruel comments from other children \u2014 \u2018I don\u2019t want to hang out with you because you\u2019re the chubby girl,\u2019 say \u2014 or comparing herself to her father\u2019s svelte Baywatch colleagues, Hayley started modelling.\n\nA size 16 - the average for UK women - she signed on to Ford Models at the age of 14 to get involved in Curve fashion which is about encouraging women to feel comfortable in their skin\n\nShe also hit out at Piers Morgan's comment that size 22 model Tess Holliday celebrates morbid obesity. She said that the TV personality was 'not their doctor'\n\nAt 14, on the advice of her dad\u2019s publicist, she signed to Ford Models, the prestigious agency that had on its books Jerry Hall and Christy Turlington \u2014 joining its groundbreaking plus-size division.\n\nAt the time, Ford represented the highest paid plus-size model in the world, Ashley Graham, as well as Crystal Renn, who at a mere size 14, is what Hayley calls an \u2018inbetweenie\u2019 \u2014 neither plus size nor a regular model. \u2018Back then, in 2004, people didn\u2019t know what plus-size fashion was,\u2019 says Hayley. \u2018People were confused when I said I was a curve model.\u2019\n\nCurve fashion is about encouraging women to feel comfortable in their own skin\n\nAs Hayley\u2019s career progressed, however, so did the idea that models didn\u2019t have to be a size zero. Today, the catwalk looks more like real life than ever, sales on the website Asos Curve (sizes 16 to 30) are soaring and even luxury site Net-a-Porter has won the battle to stock bigger sizes.\n\nBut the process of changing the norm has not been without controversy. When model Tess Holliday, who is a size 22, posed for the October 2018 cover of Cosmopolitan, it sparked impassioned debates about obesity. Was it healthy, some asked, to present such a plus-sized woman as a role model?\n\nHayley and Tess are represented by the same agency, London-based MiLK Management. What does Hayley make of Piers Morgan\u2019s argument that plus-size models \u2018celebrate the morbidly obese\u2019?\n\nShe also said that UK fashion has been streets ahead of US fashion in terms of Curves. (Pictured with her father in New York this year)\n\nHayley, aged three, hugs her father during a ceremony honouring him with a star on Hollywood's walk of fame\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not their doctors,\u2019 she retorts, seeing no need to judge other women for their size. \u2018Curve fashion is about encouraging women to feel comfortable in their own skin.\n\nShowing different body types is a way of women supporting other women. Not only in fashion, it makes a difference in their life.\u2019\n\nShe insists she hasn\u2019t felt any pressure to be a certain size as a model \u2014 large or small, \u2018there\u2019s a place for everyone\u2019. And she\u2019s adamant that her lifestyle and diet are balanced.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m always going to eat healthy, limiting carbs and sugar, I\u2019m a salad buff, a kale and quinoa girl.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve always done spin cycle classes as a family and my older sister is a Pilates instructor.\u2019\n\nLabelling people \u2018plus-sized\u2019 or \u2018curvy\u2019 doesn\u2019t faze her, either. \u2018You can call me whatever you please,\u2019 she states. \u2018I have nothing against the word curve. Or plus-sized.\u2019\n\nAs plus-size becomes more mainstream, salaries are catching up with the rest of the industry. At the top, though, plus-sized models have not reached pay parity, with Ashley Graham earning \u00a36.5 million last year, to Kendall Jenner\u2019s \u00a318.4 million.\n\n\u2018We should all have equal pay,\u2019 says Hayley. \u2018With this campaign we\u2019re saying you can be iconic whatever shape you are.\u2019\n\nTalking about her figure she says the labels 'plus-size' and 'curve' don't faze her\n\nAlthough she says she doesn\u2019t remember what size she was when she started modelling, she\u2019s clear that her first job, a plus-size swimwear shoot, had a life-changing impact. \u2018Seeing beautiful, voluptuous, healthy, toned women who I could look up to was empowering. I am so unbelievably glad I started modelling at 14. When you have hindering thoughts as a teenager . . . I was on set with women that I aspired to.\u2019\n\nFourteen is young to start working, she acknowledges \u2014 many agencies require models to be at least 16 \u2014 and when Hayley\u2019s career took off she had to be home-schooled.\n\nStories abound of young models being pressured to look a certain way or pushed into shoots they\u2019re not ready for, and suffering damage to their self-esteem as a result. In the plus-size world, however, she says her experience was very different.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t too young in my case. Do I believe it is right to have laws where you can start modelling after 18? Yes. But in my case, being a plus-sized model at 14 when the media didn\u2019t speak so openly about curve was important. I was protected.\u2019\n\nThat may be thanks in part to the guidance of the family she still speaks to every day.\n\nHer father and mother, actress Pamela Bach, divorced in 2006. A year after the divorce, a video leaked of David drunk, trying to eat a hamburger off the floor. Hayley\u2019s sister Taylor, now 29, is in the video begging him to stop. He later checked into rehab for alcohol addiction.\n\nHayley, pictured here modelling clothes for brand simplybe.co.uk, said her first job was a swimwear shoot, which had a life-changing impact\n\n'I am so unbelievably glad I started modelling at 14', she said. 'When you have hindering thoughts as a teenager . . . I was on set with women that I aspired to'\n\nHayley will only say she doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, \u2018out of preference\u2019, and is \u2018proud\u2019 of her parents.\n\nShe and Taylor were at her father\u2019s wedding to another Hayley, a 38-year-old former Debenhams sales assistant from Wales, last year.\n\n\u2018There was never a moment where I realised my family was famous,\u2019 she says. \u2018I didn\u2019t know anything different. It\u2019s more that when you grow into being your own person, you realise your parents have paved an amazing path, continuously doing amazing things in their careers.\n\n\u2018Growing up, I dealt with a lot of trying to find who I was. We all do. The most beautiful thing family can do is allow you to express yourself and mine did.\u2019\n\nShe always loved acting and dressing up. Taylor and Hayley liked to dress up as each other as children and ask their parents to spot the difference.\n\nAs well as modelling, she has a role in a new TV drama for U.S. network CBS, Why Women Kill, alongside Lucy Liu. ABC\u2019s breakfast show Good Morning America has appointed her its curve style host, and she provides fashion tips on ITV\u2019s This Morning over here.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t get much sleep,\u2019 she says. \u2018I have flying between the UK and US down to a T.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s even in a long-distance relationship with a Brit \u2014 her boyfriend of two years is actor Dominic Farrell, \u2018based in the English countryside\u2019. She means Kent.\n\nThey met through his brother, a friend of hers. \u2018We moved in together a month after meeting. \u2018He cooks for me. Who doesn\u2019t like an English roast? Not too often, though.\u2019\n\nNow she hopes she, and others like her, can make sure \u2018curve\u2019 is more than just a trend.\n\n\u2018Women still feel that when a curve model is in a campaign, it\u2019s just to tick a box.\n\n\u2018I applaud that box being ticked, but I don\u2019t want designers to feel [a lack of diversity] will just go away because they have [included a range of models] once.\n\n\u2018I want them to show people of different sizes, ethnicity, people with disabilities. We should all be represented.\u2019", "description": "David Hasselhoff's daughter Hayley said that being a plus-sized model saved her self-esteem.
