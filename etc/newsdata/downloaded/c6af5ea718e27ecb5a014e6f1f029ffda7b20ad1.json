Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Legal DOJ cites Dems' mixed-up impeachment messages to undercut House probe\n\nThe Justice Department on Friday flatly rejected House Democrats\u2019 claim that they\u2019re in the midst of an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d into President Donald Trump, pointing to the scattershot messaging by Democratic leaders in recent days \u2014 even citing Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reluctance to use the term at a news conference just a day ago.\n\nIn a new court filing on Friday, Justice Department lawyers argued that the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s effort to obtain former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s most sensitive secrets \u2014 evidence and testimony collected by a grand jury \u2014 should be denied, in part because House Democrats can\u2019t agree on what to call their investigation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cMost prominently, the speaker of the House has been emphatic that the investigation is not a true impeachment proceeding,\u201d the lawyers wrote, citing Pelosi\u2019s June statement that Democrats were \u201cnot even close\u201d to such a move.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 attempt to access Mueller\u2019s grand-jury information hinges on the courts acknowledging that they are conducting an impeachment investigation. The Judiciary Committee argued in late July that their impeachment investigation satisfies one of the exceptions to federal grand jury secrecy rules: that the House is engaged in an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d and therefore is taking an action preliminary to a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d \u2014 the Senate\u2019s trial on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2063/1155968404_6085709065001_6085703631001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBut the Justice Department rebuffed that claim on Friday, citing inconsistent statements from senior Democratic leaders \u2014 as well as their own claims that the ongoing investigation might lead to innumerable outcomes other than an impeachment vote.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,\u201d the filing states.\n\n\u201cAs the committee\u2019s chairman has stressed\u2014and as the speaker of the House and the House majority leader both reiterated this week\u2014the purpose of its investigation is to assess numerous possible remedial measures, including censure, articles of impeachment, legislation, Constitutional amendments, and more,\u201d it continues. \u201cWhat may come of this investigation\u2014if anything\u2014remains unknown and unpredictable.\u201d\n\nSenior Democrats expressed concern this week that the lack of a unified message on impeachment could hurt their prospects in court, as they seek access to Mueller\u2019s secret files and testimony from his key witnesses, which they say is necessary in order to determine whether Trump should be impeached.\n\nEven if a judge determined that the House activities were close enough to a preliminary impeachment probe, the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers went further, arguing that impeachment itself \u2014 and a removal trial in the Senate \u2014 would still fall short of an exception to grand jury secrecy.\n\n\u201c[I]mpeachment proceedings in Congress \u2014 including hypothetical removal proceedings in the Senate \u2014 are not \u2018judicial proceedings\u2019 under the plain and ordinary meaning of that term,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe filing comes a day after the committee approved a set of technical procedures for its impeachment investigation, the most significant legislative move yet in Democrats\u2019 potential effort to oust the president. Impeachment supporters said approving the parameters was a historic embrace of ongoing impeachment proceedings, but other Democrats \u2014 including Pelosi \u2014 publicly downplayed the move.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\nThe messaging whiplash highlighted some Democrats\u2019 reluctance to embrace the \u201cimpeachment\u201d moniker, amid competing political priorities within the House Democratic Caucus. Moderate Democrats, particularly those who are vulnerable in 2020, have shied away from impeachment talk, while the party\u2019s progressive base has urged Pelosi and her leadership team to adopt a more aggressive posture.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) initially offered a flat \u201cno\u201d this week when asked if an impeachment investigation had begun, even though he had signed off on the House\u2019s legal filings which stated otherwise. He later walked back those comments. And the No. 5 House Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, on Wednesday said he wasn\u2019t sure whether an impeachment investigation had begun, before voting to support it on Thursday.\n\nLast month, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel was engaged in \u201cformal impeachment proceedings,\u201d a rhetorical escalation that echoed what House lawyers had told federal judges in recent court filings. Nadler has also said that if the courts move quickly to address the House litigation, his committee could recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year. The Justice Department cited Nadler\u2019s comments in its filing on Friday.\n\nNadler and his allies say no formal vote of the House is needed to open an impeachment inquiry, noting that the impeachment of judges and some executive branch officials that the Judiciary Committee has overseen in recent decades required no House authorization.\n\nBut Republicans say impeaching a president is a weightier step and that Democrats are refusing to provide the probe full House authorization because they lack the votes \u2014 a dynamic driven in part by Pelosi\u2019s outward resistance to taking that step.\n\nPelosi is mindful of forcing her most vulnerable caucus members to take a politically difficult vote when impeachment efforts are all but doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate. She has repeatedly argued for continued litigation against and investigation of the president even though a majority of House Democrats now favor impeachment or an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans have pointed to Pelosi\u2019s comments as evidence that no formal inquiry has begun, with GOP leaders calling Democrats\u2019 setup a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir imaginary impeachment is going nowhere,\u201d House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said Friday morning at House Republicans\u2019 annual retreat in Baltimore.\n\nIn their own legal filings, Democrats say they need Mueller\u2019s grand jury material because it could pertain to their consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump. Mueller, in his 448-page report released in April, revealed evidence \u2014 some based on grand jury testimony \u2014 that Trump repeatedly attempted to obstruct the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday shared with the Obama-appointed judge \u2014 Beryl Howell, chief judge of the federal district court in Washington \u2014 elements of the grand jury material the House is seeking to obtain.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

The manual indicates that impeachment proceedings can be launched in a variety of ways, not just through a formal vote of the House. One method is via the referral of articles of impeachment to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs Nadler and other Democrats note, the House referred articles of impeachment to the committee in January, and they say those articles are now officially under consideration for approval or amendment.\n\nDemocrats in recent weeks have pointed to a series of House actions they say bolster their position. In early June, the House voted to allow all committee chairs to enforce subpoenas in court \u2014 with the approval of House leaders acting on behalf of the entire chamber.\n\nAnd last month, the House adopted a resolution declaring all Trump-related subpoenas and demands for information \u2014 retroactively and into the future \u2014 to have the support of the full House. Impeachment inquiry supporters say this is evidence that the House intended, however indirectly, to back impeachment proceedings without a formal vote.\n\nSimilarly, Judiciary Committee officials have noted that previous votes to authorize impeachment proceedings have been intended to empower the committee to issue subpoenas and convene depositions in an era when committees had far less authority than they do in the modern era. Now, the committee already has subpoena and deposition authority, they note.", "description": "The filing comes a day after the committee <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/12/house-judiciary-committee-approves-guidelines-for-trump-impeachment-probe-1492044\" target=\"_blank\">approved</a> a set of technical procedures for its impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a5/6f/3418719940e4b3ebb1a57f5d4c60/20190913-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
