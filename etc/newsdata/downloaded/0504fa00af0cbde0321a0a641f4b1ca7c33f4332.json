Katie Hill was the talk of Capitol Hill this weekend, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the glaring lack of public statements by women\u2019s rights groups or Hill\u2019s fellow Democrats. Even two years after the explosion of the #MeToo movement, Hill\u2019s unique case proved too complicated for many anti-harassment advocates to address.\n\nHill\u2014one of a record number of women elected to Congress in 2018, and the first openly bisexual representative in history\u2014resigned her seat Sunday after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that she had an affair with a congressional staffer. Hill has denied that but admits to engaging in a three-person relationship with a campaign staffer and her then-husband.\n\nHill claims the now-estranged husband was involved in the publication of nude photos of her in conservative news outlet RedState, complicating what could have been a straightforward story about an elected official\u2019s alleged abuse of power. Some women\u2019s rights advocates said the leak and publication of the photos amounted to revenge porn, the distribution of someone\u2019s nude images without their consent.\n\nHill also leaned in to this narrative on Sunday, vowing to pursue \u201call of our legal options\u201d against those who had \u201cweaponized\u201d her personal images.\n\n\u201cThose of you who know me personally know that I\u2019m a fighter,\u201d Hill wrote in a letter. \u201cNow, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.\u201d\n\nA chorus of voices on social media protested Hill\u2019s resignation, with many suggesting she was being held to an unfair standard because she is a woman or because she is bisexual. Some pointed to Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was indicted for misappropriation of campaign funds\u2014allegedly to finance affairs with two Republican congressional staffers. Hunter has not resigned.\n\nOthers pointed to President Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than 20 women.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has sexually harassed or assaulted dozens of women,\u201d tweeted Jenna Lowenstein, deputy campaign manager for Cory Booker\u2019s campaign. \u201cKatie Hill had, as far as we know, some consensual relationships and an ex with an affinity for revenge porn. Don't let anyone tell you men and women are held to the same standards.\u201d\n\nOthers compared Hill\u2019s resignation to that of Al Franken, the Democratic senator who resigned last year over allegations of sexual misconduct. Some said the allegations\u2014groping in Franken\u2019s case, and what appeared to be a consensual relationship in Hill\u2019s\u2014were insufficient to warrant resignation. (\u201cThe injustice here is so over the top,\u201d tweeted Shaunna Thomas, founder of women\u2019s rights group UltraViolet.)\n\nEven some Republicans jumped to Hill\u2019s defense. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz called the Ethics Committee\u2019s investigation \u201cabsurd\u201d and suggested that the only person with a complaint was the congresswoman\u2019s \u201csoon-to-be ex.\u201d Heather Nauert, a former State Department spokesperson and current White House staffer, said that Hill would not have resigned if she were a man.\n\n\u201cI appreciated her willingness to reach out to both parties to discuss/debate policies,\u201d Nauert added.\n\nMany of Hill\u2019s fellow Democrats, however, were silent on the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a short statement acknowledging Hill\u2019s \u201cgreat contribution to the Freshman Class\u201d but adding that the congresswoman\u2019s \u201cerrors in judgment\u201d made her continued service \u201cuntenable.\u201d None of the women in Hill\u2019s notoriously Twitter-friendly freshman class spoke out publicly.\n\nOne Democratic staffer attributed the silence to lawmakers\u2019 indecision around the issue, telling The Daily Beast that the addition of the revenge porn angle \u201cmakes it, for lack of a better term, messy.\u201d\n\n\u201c It comes from an inability to say that someone can be hurt and can also hurt others. Someone can victimized and also be a victim. \u201d \u2014 Carly Mee, SurvJustice\n\nCarly Mee, a senior staff attorney for the victim\u2019s rights organization SurvJustice, said women\u2019s rights groups faced the same challenge.\n\n\u201cThe hesitation is that in my opinion, is the nuance that she both was wronged and did something wrong,\u201d Mee told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt comes from an inability to say that someone can be hurt and can also hurt others. Someone can victimized and also be a victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like to think of that as really black and white\u2014you're a victim or you\u2019re a perpetrator,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s uncomfortable to say you can be both.\u201d\n\nCampus anti-rape group Know Your IX\u2014one of the few organizations that commented publicly\u2014emphasized this dichotomy, tweeting that allegations of Hill\u2019s inappropriate relationships came \u201cafter a campaign of harassment and revenge porn from an abusive ex-husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about both pieces,\u201d the organization tweeted.\n\nJaslin Kaur, a student engagement organizer for Know Your IX, told The Daily Beast the group was troubled by the allegations against Hill, but that she should have been able to admit to them \u201con her own terms.\u201d The leak of Hill's private information and photos, she added, was a \u201ctextbook case\u201d of abuse and manipulation.\n\n\u201cIt just really shows that you can comply with investigations, you can still do everything to promote progressive cause, but you will still be vilified because your abuser has the power to turn world against you,\u201d Kaur said.\n\nHill\u2019s husband did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nAfter publication, the National Organization for Women responded with a statement saying Hill had been \u201cslut-shamed\u201d and \u201crun out of office based on rumor and innuendo.\u201d\n\nMee, meanwhile, compared the discussion about Hill to that around Asia Argento, the Weinstein accuser who was subsequently accused of sexually assaulting a teenager. She said many anti-rape advocates were silent about the later accusations at the time, because they simply \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d\n\nBut in order for the #MeToo movement to move forward, Mee said, advocates need to learn how to address these multifaceted issues.\n\n\u201cWe just have to be consistent and not remain silent, because part of changing the culture around this is acknowledging the complexity around it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very common thing for there to be overlap, and we do a disservice to this work if we don't acknowledge that.\u201d", "description": "The silence by women advocates and some Democrats comes as some Republicans have jumped to her defense.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572285473/191028-Shugerman-Katie-hill-tease_kshsja", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
