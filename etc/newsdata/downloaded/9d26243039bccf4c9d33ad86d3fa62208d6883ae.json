Tonight maybe we didn\u2019t catch the breaks.\u201d\n\nKirby Yates fanned pinch-hitter Ryan Braun with a runner on second base to close out the win.\n\nRookie Seth Mejias-Brean hit his first career home run to help the Padres end a six-game losing streak.\n\nYates took over took to begin the ninth and walked Eric Thames to start the inning. With one out, pinch-runner Tyrone Taylor strayed too far off first base on a popup to shallow left and nearly got doubled off, but was hit in the back by Mejias-Brean\u2019s throw. Taylor went to second on the throwing error, and was stranded when Yates struck out Braun for his major league-leading 41st save.\n\nThe Brewers appeared to score the tying run on a fluke play with two outs in the seventh inning, but it was not allowed. With Cory Spangenberg on third base, Trent Grisham swung and missed at a third strike that wasn\u2019t caught cleanly. Grisham was called safe when first baseman Eric Hosmer dropped the throw from catcher Francisco Mejia, with Spangenberg crossing the plate.\n\nBut after a brief discussion among the umpires, it was ruled Grisham had kicked the ball, apparently inadvertently, on his way to first and that made it a dead ball and a strikeout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the umpire\u2019s judgment, whether the fact it hit Trent hindered the ability of the fielder to make the play,\u201d Counsell said.\n\nLamet (3-5), who missed the entire 2018 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, repeatedly hit 97 mph. He struck out five of the first six Milwaukee batters - three on three pitches each.\n\n\u201cI honestly try not to think about whether it\u2019s a playoff team or whether it isn\u2019t, I\u2019m trying to prepare as best I can to face that team and do well against them,\u201d Lemet said through a translator.\n\nAfter giving up his first hit of the game, a single in the third inning to Greg Garcia, Brewers starter Adrian Houser (6-7) reached for his back and the game was stopped while he stretched and was examined by the team trainer. He remained in the game.\n\nThe next batter, Mejias-Brean, in his 11th career at-bat, hit his first home run. The drive, on an 0-2 pitch, hit the top of the wall in right-center field and gave San Diego a 2-0 lead.\n\nKeston Hiura connected off Lamet in the sixth for his 17th home run of the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing great baseball this whole month, so far,\u201d Hiura said. \u201cAs much as we want to win every single game, sometimes you\u2019ve got to tip your cap to the other pitcher, the other team. It\u2019s not a setback at all. It\u2019s more that we should be better next time.\u201d\n\nYelich broke his right kneecap on a batted foul ball at Miami on Sept. 10.\n\nSUTER-ABLE\n\nSince being activated from the injured list (Tommy John surgery) on Sept. 1, Brewers LHP Brent Suter has pitched 12 1/3 innings over six games and has a 2-0 record and 0.73 ERA. \u201cHe has pitched to a level that has exceeded everybody\u2019s expectations,\u201d Counsell said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe teams finish their four-game set with Padres LHP Joey Lucchesi (10-8, 4.22 ERA) facing Brewers RHP Jordan Lyles (11-8, 4.25 ERA).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Since losing Christian Yelich for the season, the Milwaukee Brewers stepped up their push for the playoffs, winning six of their first seven games without the reigning NL MVP.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Kertscher"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/padres_brewers_baseball_66342_c0-136-2512-1600_s1770x1032.jpg?65f74c5e165e892c361115ff36f58faa8ad6302c", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
