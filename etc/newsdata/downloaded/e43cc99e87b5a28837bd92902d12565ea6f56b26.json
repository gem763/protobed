That depends on how much you love Apple. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nWhen you plunk down the Apple Card to split a bill, it makes a satisfying clank. The snow-white card with its silver trimmings is impossible to ignore \u2014 partly because few cards are white, and partly because of that clanking noise. One of your friends will probably pick it up, turn it in their hands and say, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a metal card alright\u201d before reaching into their wallet to compare it with another metal credit card. This will inevitably devolve into a discussion about the Apple Card\u2019s benefits, and whether it\u2019s worth applying. As an Apple Card owner, all eyes at the table will divert to you, and you\u2019ll be expected to give a verdict.\n\nApple Card WHAT IS IT? Apple's credit card PRICE Your monthly statement. Possibly your dignity. LIKE Zero fees! No waiting for cash back. Yay privacy. NO LIKE Mediocre rewards. People wanting to talk to you. Being that arsehole.\n\nThat\u2019s the part I struggle with. It\u2019s not that the card is bad \u2014 no card boasting zero fees can be all that bad. It\u2019s just not amazing enough to gush over. I\u2019m not going to grab my friend\u2019s iPhone, navigate to the Wallet app, and demand they apply for the sake of their financial health. The best I can say as a response as to whether or not it\u2019s worth it is, \u201cIt depends on how much you love Apple.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note: The Apple Card is not available in Australia, so you can rest assured that you're safe from its weird, metallic charm. While we wait and see if Apple plans on launching it locally, check out this review from our U.S. team.\n\nWhen Apple first announced the card at its services event in March, I was sceptical. The interest rates (12.99 to 23.99 per cent) are only slightly lower or on par with the market average, and the cash back rewards are mediocre unless you\u2019re an Apple Pay devotee and likely to buy a ton of Apple products. And even then, the rewards are just ok. (More on these in a second.)\n\nPrivacy was the big selling point \u2014 Apple vowed not to share your financial transactions, and the physical card itself would be devoid of any information besides your name. Obviously, this also a nonstarter for anyone with an Android phone as everything operates out of Apple\u2019s Wallet app.\n\nAfter using the card for roughly a month, I don\u2019t think anyone needs this card, especially not as their go-to payment method. That said, using it has opened my eyes to what a cashless future and widespread mobile payment adoption might look like \u2014 and on that front, the Apple Card is nifty.\n\nThe entire application process is digital and requires an iPhone. Apple dropped a series of ten videos last month detailing the nuts and bolts of how to apply and use the card itself. Unless your credit is godawful (i.e., a score of under 600), or you\u2019ve got an outstanding bill collection, you\u2019ll likely be approved in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe user limit and APR depends on whatever magical formula Goldman Sachs, the issuing bank, decides based on individual creditworthiness. I had a TransUnion score of nearly 800 and Goldman granted me a $US6,500 ($9,567) limit with 17.99 per cent APR. I found that middling. The average interest rate for a new customer is around 19.24 per cent, so I did ok on that front. However, the limit was about half that of my other cards. (That said, some readers have emailed me screenshots showing they did get 12.99 per cent, so it\u2019s possible.)\n\nWhile a digital Apple Card shows up immediately in the Wallet app, users have to opt-in for the physical card during the application process. Plus, it takes about 4-6 days for shipping. I applied for the card but immediately had to leave for a 5-day road trip up through upstate New York, Vermont, and finally, Montreal. I figured this was a good opportunity to see just how widespread contactless payments were outside New York City. In turn, that would inform how feasible a mobile-only Apple Card was in practice.\n\nThe way the Apple Card\u2019s cash back rewards are structured, you\u2019re incentivised to use Apple Pay. The highest 3 per cent tier is limited to purchasing Apple gear, Uber rides and Uber Eats deliveries, and now Walgreens purchases.\n\nThe 2 per cent tier is for any Apple Pay purchase made with a phone. Purchases with the physical card get a measly 1 per cent. Unless you really need to use the physical card, it behooves users to use Apple Pay whenever and wherever possible.\n\nIf you\u2019re a normal person and store this card in your wallet, you really don\u2019t have to worry about stains. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nDuring my road trip, I found difficult to predict what retailers would or wouldn\u2019t accept Apple Pay. It was fine at a pharmacy in Halfmoon, New York, and at a parking metre in Burlington, Vermont. It also worked fine for buying metro tickets at a kiosk in Montreal. It\u2019s handy that after a long sweaty run, I can buy Gatorade at my local grocery store using the Apple Card via my Apple Watch. However, just because a store accepts contactless payments, doesn\u2019t mean you can always use Apple Pay.\n\nI tried buying a Pumpkin Spice Latte at Gregory\u2019s Coffee near my apartment. They accepted Chase Pay, but not Apple Pay. Likewise, my local deli does not accept contactless payments. Neither does the cafeteria in Gizmodo\u2019s giant office building, but somehow, the coffee stall two feet away does. Trying to get 2 per cent cash back was an exercise in asking annoyed clerks if they accepted Apple Pay. It stirred up my anxiety, but at the same time, I got a greater appreciation for just how far contactless payments have come in the past few years.\n\nYou can also use Apple Pay for more online purchases than you might expect, particularly in apps. Discovering which apps accept Apple Pay, however, is a pain. You can use it in Lyft and Seamless, but not Amazon. It works on Airbnb, but you can\u2019t just add it; you have to book a place and then add it.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to input the card info for digital transactions manually, but it involves hopping over to the Wallet app, tapping the Apple Card, tapping the three-dot button, scrolling down to the Card Information menu, hoping Face ID doesn\u2019t crap out on you as it verifies your identity, and copy-pasting the information within. I\u2019d rather die than do this repeatedly, especially if I\u2019m only getting 1 per cent cash back.\n\nAs for the physical card itself, it\u2019s a good looking card. As for reports about it being easily stained, I stored it in my phone wallet like a normal person, and it was fine. (Who carries a naked credit card in their jean pocket anyway?) That said, using the physical card highlighted some pitfalls that I\u2019m sure Apple hadn\u2019t intended when it decided on the design.\n\nBleary-eyed from a long flight to Berlin, I handed my Apple Card over to the receptionist at my hotel for an early check-in fee. She handed it back to me in confused indignation, saying there was no chip, magnetic strip, or credit card number. I replied that yes, in fact, there was a chip and magnetic strip. We had a standoff lasting several uncomfortable seconds before I acquiesced and got out another card. The same happened when I tried paying for a taxi home from Newark Airport. The cabbie grouchily informed me that the card had no information, no chip, and no magnetic strip.\n\nI debated pulling out my phone and navigating to the card number, but in a moment of rudeness, swiped the card for him myself. (In my defence, I was jet-lagged, and this was the final obstacle between me and my bed.) The same thing happened, yet again, at my eye doctor\u2019s office while trying to process my copay. It took two receptionists about ten minutes, and multiple tries to get the card to read properly. Once, I would have written off. Three times and I am utterly baffled.\n\nI should note that plenty of other clerks did not have this issue. At the same time, zero clerks have had issues with my other credit cards. The other common reaction was clerks asking me if this was the new Apple Card, how they could apply, did I like it, and what was my recommendation? As a socially awkward turtle, it was a level of interaction I didn\u2019t want when trying to buy tampons at Duane Reade. I imagine the novelty will fade as more people get the Apple Card, but in the meantime, I find myself opting for other cards if I want a transaction to go quickly.\n\nThe magnetic strip seems obvious to me. Yet it was invisible to some clerks. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nThat\u2019s the weird thing about the Apple Card. For a credit card that\u2019s meant to be simple, it often overcomplicates things. Some of that has to do with its focus on privacy and security. Before you make a purchase, Face ID has to authenticate you. Face ID works about two-thirds of the time for me, but when it doesn\u2019t, it becomes a problem I have to solve.\n\nYou can turn this feature off, but it feels like nerfing one of the card\u2019s enhanced security features for a frivolous reason. The lack of card number is cool in that if my card is stolen, it\u2019s not like the thief can use it for online purchases. It\u2019s less cool when the card\u2019s blankness flusters a clerk or sends me scrambling to pull up the number in the app. Security isn\u2019t convenient by any means, but enhanced privacy can certainly add friction where you don\u2019t expect it.\n\nI happen to be a religious user of You Need A Budget (YNAB). Because your purchases on Apple Card are meant to be private \u2014 Apple says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what you bought. Or where. Or how much you paid\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not compatible with any software that automatically exports transactions for easier logging.\n\nProbably because such software doesn\u2019t meet Apple\u2019s standards. That means if you\u2019re a personal finance nerd, using the Apple Card means manually logging purchases, so you have a complete picture of your debt. I know I voluntarily put myself through this torture, but the extra time spent logging is a consideration when I reach for my wallet and pick which card I\u2019m going to use.\n\nAnd how valid are Apple\u2019s privacy claims anyway? Apple\u2019s site says, \u201cOf course, Goldman Sachs will use your data to operate Apple Card, but they will never share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or advertising.\u201d\n\nApple might not know what you\u2019re buying, but Goldman Sachs does. It\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s nothing in that statement saying Goldman Sachs can\u2019t use your data internally for whatever purposes it deems \u2018necessary.\u2019 Call me cynical, but I don\u2019t believe a giant bank known for servicing the rich will be morally upright about how it internally handles my data.\n\nGizmodo looked into a similar case with the Amazon Prime credit card and its issuing bank Chase. In that instance, Chase noted it shared data with affiliates both for operational purposes and marketing. That\u2019s not the case with the Apple Card, according to its privacy disclosure. But, Chase also said it used the Amazon Prime card data for its marketing purposes, i.e., to market its own products to Chase card users.\n\nApple\u2019s wording only says Goldman Sachs will never share or sell data to third parties. Goldman Sachs recently expanded its consumer banking presence, and if I ever get one of those envelopes in the mail advertising their Marcus personal loans, well, I might have a pretty good idea where it came from.\n\n\u201cWhen you get a new card in the mail, it typically comes with disclosures about how your data will be used. These disclosures are legally required due to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernisation Act of 1999 and often indicate that the credit card issuer may sell or share information with other companies, or at least use it internally to market other products to you,\u201d Oliver Brown, an analyst at Credit Card Insider told me.\n\n\u201c[Apple\u2019s] disclosure shows less information sharing than many other credit card issuers, but it still leaves open the possibility that Goldman Sachs may get transaction data and use it internally, but not for marketing purposes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fine. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nAt the end of the day, the Apple Card is fine but not exactly deserving of its hype. The fact that subprime applicants can apply for it and not get slammed with 30 per cent interest rates is arguably good.\n\nBut the things I liked best about the Apple Card were not its splashiest features\u2014and they also reminded me of the card\u2019s shortcomings. For instance, I liked that Daily Cash gets added to your Cash account the next day, instead of waiting an entire month. Kinda. It\u2019s a relief that I don\u2019t have to navigate some abstract point system, but you accrue cash back so slowly, it might as well not even matter waiting a month or two to get it. So far, I\u2019ve got about $22. It\u2019s cool I can redeem it now if I want, but that\u2019s not much to write home about.\n\nI will say this month of using the Apple Card is the most I\u2019ve ever used Apple Pay since it debuted in 2014. And because I have this card, I will probably continue to use Apple Pay wherever possible. It\u2019s a fact that I look for the Apple Pay logo more frequently at retailers. If it\u2019s not clear, I will nag a clerk. Beneath the altruistic messaging of zero fees, better financial health, and privacy, hooking indifferent consumers like me on its payment platform is probably what Apple was gunning for all along. I knew that going in, and yet here I am.\n\nSo should people get the Apple Card? It\u2019s not a terrible idea if they're trying to rebuild credit and plan to pay in full every month. Or if they've tattooed \u201cApple Pay All the Way\u201d across their heart. Or even if they like to be that person who clanks a titanium card down so their friends can ooh and ahh. For everyone else, there\u2019s probably a better card elsewhere. It just won\u2019t be as buzzworthy.\n\nREADME", "description": "When you plunk down the Apple Card to split a bill, it makes a satisfying clank.
