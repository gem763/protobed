It also claims that Trump\u2019s due process rights are being violated.\n\nHouse intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted in response that Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the inquiry signals an attitude that \u201cthe president is above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution says otherwise,\u201d he asserted.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the Constitution regardless of a formal impeachment inquiry vote.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are not above the law,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cYou will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution states the House has the sole power of impeachment, and that the Senate has the sole power to conduct impeachment trials. It specifies that a president can be removed from office for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d if supported by a two-thirds Senate vote. But it offers little guidance beyond that on proceedings.\n\nThe White House letter marks the beginning of a new all-out strategy to counter the impeachment threat to Trump. Aides have been honing their approach after two weeks of what allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the probe.\n\nThe president himself is sticking with the same Trump-as-victim rhetoric he has used for more than a year.\n\n\u201cPeople understand that it\u2019s a fraud. It\u2019s a scam. It\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI think it makes it harder to do my job. But I do my job, and I do it better than anybody has done it for the first two and half years.\u201d\n\nEarly Tuesday, Trump escalated his fight with Congress by blocking Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, from testifying behind closed doors about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney, Robert Luskin, said his client was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t be able to testify. And Schiff said Sondland\u2019s no-show was \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that will only strengthen a possible impeachment case.\n\nThe House followed up Tuesday afternoon with subpoenas for Sondland\u2019s testimony and records.\n\nTrump is also bulking up his legal team.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy is being brought on as outside counsel, according to an administration official. Gowdy, who did not seek reelection last year, led a congressional investigation of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint and text messages released by another envoy portray U.S. Ambassador Sondland as a potentially important witness in allegations that the Republican president sought to dig up dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden in Ukraine and other countries in the name of foreign policy.\n\nPelosi said thwarting the witness testimony on Tuesday was an \u201cabuse of power\u201d in itself by the president.\n\nThe White House letter to Pelosi, Schiff and other House committee chairmen, though asserting a legal argument that Trump and other officials cannot cooperate, would not be likely to win respect in court, said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n\n\u201cThis letter reads to me much more like a press release prepared by the press secretary than an analysis by the White House counsel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House is claiming that Trump\u2019s constitutional rights to cross-examine witnesses and review all evidence in impeachment proceedings extend even to House investigations, not just a potential Senate trial. It also is calling on Democrats to grant Republicans in the House subpoena power to seek evidence in the president\u2019s defense.\n\nElsewhere in Washington, a federal judge heard arguments Tuesday in a separate case on whether the House has actually undertaken a formal impeachment inquiry despite not having taken a vote and whether the inquiry can be characterized, under the law, as a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nThat distinction matters because while grand jury testimony is ordinarily secret, one exception authorizes a judge to disclose it in connection with a judicial proceeding. House Democrats are seeking grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as they conduct their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe House under the Constitution sets its own rules, and the House has sole power over impeachment,\u201d Douglas Letter, a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee, told the court.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Miller on Twitter at https://twitter.com/zekejmiller and Colvin at https://twitter.com/colvinj", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House declared it will halt any and all cooperation with what it termed the \"illegitimate\" impeachment probe by House", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/a91b9c_trump-23960-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-ceremony-present-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
