CHEAP!\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: with the volume of pics we snap these days, everyone could use some extra storage to hoard frozen memories (and selfies). And you\u2019re in luck, because there\u2019s a killer deal on the internal Hitachi Ultrastar 2TB hard drive.\n\neBay is currently selling a refurbished model for a measly $30 \u2014 about half the usual price of 50 to 70 bucks. It\u2019s also got a one-year warranty. It\u2019s an internal hard drive so you\u2019ll still need an enclosure, but with the money you\u2019d be saving, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nThe best part is that you can easily use it on both your Mac and Windows machines. Just make sure to format it correctly.\n\nI personally haven\u2019t tried this Hitachi drive, but it\u2019s got solid reviews (and its price is too good to ignore). Having recently put together a gaming rig for myself, I can tell you that 2TB for $30 is certainly a catch.\n\nLook, you can always opt for cloud storage, but you ought to carefully weigh out the pros and cons. Sure, cloud services are practically accessible anywhere (as long as you\u2019ve got an internet connection). That comes at a price, though \u2014 and you\u2019d still be risking getting your account hacked.\n\nIf you\u2019re more concerned with saving money and don\u2019t need instant access to your storage at all places, at all times, then this Hitachi drive might be the thing for you.\n\nGrab an enclosure, install it (it\u2019s super easy), and you won\u2019t have to worry about extra space for a while.\n\nYou can purchase the Hitachi Ultrastar 2TB hard drive for just $30 bucks by clicking here. At this price, it really is a steal. Hurry up, though, this deal won\u2019t last forever.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
