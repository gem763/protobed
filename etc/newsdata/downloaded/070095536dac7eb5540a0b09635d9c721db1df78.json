Previously, the company's stock was down more than 20% from three months earlier.\n\nNetflix was much more profitable than analysts expected during the third quarter. It posted earnings of $1.47 per share, or $665 million, compared to $0.89 per share during the same period a year earlier.\n\nNetflix added 6.8 million paid subscribers globally during the third quarter, in line with what Wall Street analysts estimated, but slightly below the company's own forecast of 7 million.\n\nNearly 6.3 million of those new paid subscribers were international, above the 6 million Wall Street analysts projected.\n\nBut the company missed its subscriber targets in the US, its largest single market, after rolling out price hikes earlier in the year. The miss came after Netflix lost US subscribers for the first time since 2011 during the second quarter.\n\nStarting next year, Netflix will stop giving guidance for the US as a region, the company said in its release. Instead, it will report based on four regions: US and Canada, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa. It will provide guidance only on global subscriber additions.\n\nSome analysts, like Monness Crespi Hardt & Company's Brian White, have been calling on Netflix to stop reporting and offering guidance on paid subscribers, because the data point is getting harder to predict now that Netflix has a large, established audience.\n\nAhead of the report, Wall Street had been bracing for a miss on subscriber growth, after Netflix posted, during the previous quarter, paid subscriber additions that were far below its forecasts.\n\nNetflix blamed its bad second quarter, in part, on a content slate that failed to deliver. During the third quarter, it ramped up releases with new seasons of popular shows like \"Stranger Things,\" \"La Casa de Papel (Money Heist),\" and \"Orange Is the New Black.\"\n\nThe company lowered its subscriber guidance for 2019 to 26.7 million paid net additions, down from the 28.6 million additions it brought in last year, because of stiffer competition; upcoming original releases that may be harder to predict an audience for, like its boost in high-profile movies; and higher cancellations driven by price hikes.\n\nThe third quarter is Netflix's last full period before a rush of new rivals hit the market, starting in November with Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus.\n\nHere are the key numbers to watch in Netflix's Q3 earnings:", "description": "Netflix reports on Wednesday its most pivotal earnings in years, after badly missing its subscriber growth forecasts last quarter.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da75b6dcc4a0a12fd157976?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
