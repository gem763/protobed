So that whole brand of the Knicks is not as cool as let\u2019s say the Golden State Warriors, or even the [Los Angeles] Lakers or the Nets now.\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying? The cool thing now is not the Knicks.\u201d\n\nDurant, who became a free agent in the off-season, signed a multiyear contract with the Nets in free agency. At one point, the speculation during the off-season was the Knicks were expected to make a strong push to sign Durant.\n\nDurant said Tuesday he didn\u2019t seriously consider signing with the Knicks in free agency.\n\n\u201cI thought about it, yeah, just a thought. But I didn\u2019t really do any full analysis on the Knicks,\u201d Durant said.\n\nDurant, the 2013-14 NBA MVP and two-time Finals MVP, continues to recover from a ruptured Achilles he suffered in the NBA Finals with the Golden State Warriors. The Nets previously said they aren\u2019t planning on the 10-time All-Star playing this season.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Brooklyn Nets star forward Kevin Durant believes the New York Knicks\u2019 brand has deteriorated over the years and many young", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
