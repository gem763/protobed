Against the odds, they were 17-0 up against the Chicago Bears.\n\nAll that was needed was a cool head, but Carr added to the drama in a topsy-turvy game by gifting possession to former team-mate Khalil Mack after an errant pitch to running back Josh Jacobs.\n\nDerek Carr got the better of close friend Khalil Mack during a pulsating win for the Raiders\n\nThe Bears were gifted the ball on Oakland's 14-yard line and scored 21 unanswered points before Jacobs - who rushed 26 times for 123 yards and two touchdowns - put the Raiders ahead with 1minute 57 seconds remaining.\n\nAfter Chase Daniel threw his second interception of the game, the road-weary Raiders held on for back-to-back wins.\n\n'It was my fault. I'll say it was my fault. I'm not going to lie to you. It was one of our faults. And we'll just make sure that the young guy gets another rip at it,' Carr said after a heartening 24-21 win over the Bears.\n\nIn his third outing on English soil, Carr impressed, completing 25 of 39 for 229 yards.\n\nHe found nine separate receivers and Oakland were equally impressive on the ground, with 169 rushing yards.\n\nJacobs became the first running back to put up over 100-yards on the Bears since Saquon Barkley's 125 yards last December.\n\nThe victory was all the more impressive with the Raiders missing wide receivers Tyrell Williams, Dwayne Harris and JJ Nelson.\n\nCarr paid tribute to their back-ups, saying: 'We were really shorthanded when it comes to starters. But we weren't shorthanded in terms of talent. Yes, we made some mistakes. We could have played better, but everybody stepped up and we won a football game against a playoff football team.'\n\nJon Gruden was glowing with pride after the game and added: 'Jacobs, he got hurt early in the game. He came back twice. He proved a lot tonight.\n\nRaiders head coach Jon Gruden was delighted after winning a seesaw game at Spurs\n\n'He made some great runs. I thought Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington picked up the slack for him. But we were persistent.\n\n'No one talks about our guys up front. We've got some good tight ends that can a good fullback, great run back and our line is quality stuff. And Trent Brown and Kolton Miller, I don't know who gets the game ball, I'll make that decision here in front of you guys.'", "description": "Derek Carr did all the hard work in a glowing first-half performance but looked have thrown it away in an error strewn third quarter.
