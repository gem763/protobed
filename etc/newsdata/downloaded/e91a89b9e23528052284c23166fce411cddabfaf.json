As the NAO makes clear, the government\u2019s planned recruitment drive only just makes up for the numbers the Tories cut from 2014 onwards, despite a vastly increased workload.\n\n\u2018The government talks tough on law and order, but the reality under them is cuts and chaos.\u2019", "description": "The National Audit Office said there were still 'significant risks' to the smooth operation of the border - as it warned resolving them was 'out of the government's control'.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19782398-0-image-a-6_1571221134098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
