At the Conservative Party conference last week, Chancellor Sajid Javid floated the idea of abolishing death duties.\n\nSenior Tories want him to address it in his Budget, which could take place by October 31.\n\nMr Jenrick told Sky News: \u2018People are having to leave property that they have saved up their whole lives to leave to their children and grandchildren, to then see them pay additional tax. It\u2019s always been a tax that has been perceived to be unfair, and of course many of those on higher incomes will find financial arrangements to ensure they don\u2019t pay. So I can see why the Chancellor is interested.\u2019\n\nOriginally, it only applied to the rich. But property inflation since the Eighties has made more families eligible. It is charged at 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the tax-free threshold of \u00a3325,000 (\u00a3650,000 for couples).\n\nThere is also a tax-free allowance for homes passed to direct descendants. This currently stands at \u00a3150,000 (\u00a3300,000 for couples) and will increase to \u00a3175,000 (\u00a3350,000) by April.\n\nAt the Conservative Party conference last week, Chancellor Sajid Javid floated the idea of abolishing death duties\n\nThe rise means parents will be able to pass on an estate, including their main home, worth \u00a31million to their children tax-free.\n\nLabour has suggested a lifetime gift tax allowance of \u00a3125,000, above which income tax rates would apply. This means a typical couple leaving everything to their two children could let them inherit just \u00a3250,000 tax free.\n\nAn official review recommended overhauling the rules. Currently, gifts of money, property or possessions made during the seven years before death may be liable to inheritance tax.\n\nThe Office of Tax Simplification, an independent adviser to the Treasury, suggested cutting the threshold to five years.", "description": "Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also argued that well-off families used tax-avoidance schemes to 'ensure they don't pay'.
