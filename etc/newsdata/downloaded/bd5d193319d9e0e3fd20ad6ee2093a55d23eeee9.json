It is slated to record a $19.3 million loss in the coming financial year, which would be materially consistent with the $18.7 million loss in fiscal 2019.\n\nJPMorgan's trio stopped short of valuing the business, taking a conservative view of ASIC's RG246 guidelines.\n\nInstead, the analysts presented a basket of comparable companies including US and European-listed payment services providers and American payment networks Visa and MasterCard.\n\nThe comparable stocks traded at a wide range in terms of enterprise value-to-sales, from as little as 2.2-times forecast sales to as much as 24.8-times.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what valuation Tyro shareholders seek as part of the mooted IPO, and how it is structured. They're expected to seek up to a $2 billion valuation.\n\nTyro is a payment terminals provider with an estimated 5 per cent market share in Australia. The business is run as an unlisted public company and has more than 400 shareholders. Its biggest investors include TDM Growth Partners, entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes and Tiger Global.\n\nThe mooted float comes at an important time in Australian equity capital markets, with vendors pulling six IPOs in the past three weeks following a weak response from potential investors.\n\nTyro looms as an important litmus test heading into the new year.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley's analysts are expected to spend the coming week in front of fund managers, before Tyro boss Robbie Cooke kicks off his pitch.\n\nTyro is slated to list in mid-December.", "description": "Tyro Payments Ltd has kicked off arguably the year's most anticipated initial public offering campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3686%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_417%2C$y_131/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/745ee63af87ae92a46904a6f423d9693fa85666b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
