Underlying inflation has been as projected. Global uncertainty persists, and interest rates abroad are very low,\" the central bank wrote.\n\n\"At the same time, the weak (crown currency) may result in higher inflation ahead.\"\n\nThe crown last week hit an all-time low of 10.24 to the euro and is trading near 18-year lows against the dollar, weighed down by global trade jitters and as investors reduce their risk exposure towards year-end, analysts have said.\n\n\"Norges Bank indicates no major change in its view. Hence, rates will remain unchanged at the December (policy) meeting,\" Nordea Markets wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe currency's impact on inflation should nevertheless be closely watched, Nordea added.\n\n\"If the current (crown) weakness continues over the next couple of months, we should expect the rate path to be revised up in December,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Gwladys Fouche and Catherine Evans)", "description": "Norway's central bank kept its main interest rate unchanged at 1.5% on Thursday as expected and said the economy had developed largely in line with forecasts made in September.
