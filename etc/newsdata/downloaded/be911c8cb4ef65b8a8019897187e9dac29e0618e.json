Absolutely furious. They didn't care. It's really upsetting that big business and big corporations go do whatever they want, against a parent's legal right.'\n\n'The judge and the guardian ad litem both agreed that it wasn't in my children's best interests to be filmed, but my ex wife and TLC had other ideas.\n\n'They put profits and ratings ahead of the well being of my children and filmed illegally without work permits.'\n\nJon Gosselin is 'furious' after TV network TLC defied a court order barring them from filming his and Kate's children for reality show Kate Plus 8. In an exclusive interview Jon told DailyMailTV: 'I'm furious. Absolutely furious. They didn't care. It's really upsetting that big business and big corporations go do whatever they want, against a parent's legal right'\n\nJon and Kate's 15-year-old children Alexis (center), Aaden (bottom, left), Joel (bottom, center) and Leah ( bottom, right) all appeared on camera. Their other kids Mady (top right) and Cara, 19, (top left) are now adults and 15-year-old Hannah (middle row, right) and Collin (middle row, left) live with Jon and weren't filmed\n\nDailyMailTV has discovered that in 2018 the Department of Labor denied filming permits and a judge also ruled that it was not in the 'best interests' of the Gosselin children to allow them to be filmed for the show.\n\nBut brazen network executives ignored the court order and went ahead anyway, filming the family at their home in Pennsylvania and on location in North Carolina.\n\nJon and Kate's 15-year-old children Alexis, Aaden, Joel and Leah all appeared on camera.\n\nTheir other kids Mady and Cara, 19, are now adults and 15-year-old Hannah and Collin live with Jon and weren't filmed.\n\nTLC declined to comment when contacted by DailyMailTV. Kate has been contacted for comment.\n\nIn 2018 eight applications for a Minor in a Performance permits were lodged with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Labor Law Compliance signed by Kate.\n\nThe Bureau wrote to an attorney for TLC, who was handling the matter, on June 5, 2018 and in the letter seen by DailyMailTV says it had completed a review of the applications and will not provide entertainment permits for any of the Gosselin children.\n\nIt stated: 'There are serious questions about whether Kate Gosselin has the legal authority to agree to have her children filmed as part of this reality television program.'\n\nThe letter added that Jon Gosselin had contacted the Bureau and told them he was not granting permission for the children to be filmed and that he had provided a copy of an April 2018 court order showing the Gosselins have joint legal custody of all of the minor children.\n\nJon, 42, tells DailyMailTV that Kate and TLC appealed the decision and the Bureau sent the case to the courts.\n\nAnd in further damning claims the guardian ad litem - the impartial person appointed by the court to act as a representative for the Gosselin children - noted that they feared money had been 'misappropriated' by Kate\n\nDailyMailTV has discovered that in 2018 the Department of Labor denied filming permits and a judge also ruled that it was not in the 'best interests' of the Gosselin children to allow them to be filmed for the show\n\nA judge then upheld the decision but on further appeal the case was sent to the Pennsylvania Superior Court.\n\nAnd in a damning opinion written by Judge Timothy J. Rowley to explain his order, he slammed Kate.\n\nHe wrote: 'Based on the limited information available - and in large part because of Mother's and her counsel's repeated failure to provide further information to Father, the guardian ad litem, and the Court - the Court concluded that involvement of the children in filming is not in their best interests.'\n\nThe judge made clear that Kate and tried her best to keep the legal process confidential so as not to reveal her earnings and wasn't forthcoming with the relevant financial information.\n\nIn the document lodged with the court on October 25, 2018 Judge Rowley said the lack of clear information wasn't limited to financial matters.\n\n'Though several of the children indicate they enjoy filming, one does not and is experiencing physiological symptoms apparently brought on by the general stress of the custodial disputes, and another is in a facility undergoing treatment for mental and emotional issues tied in part to the filming and fame.\n\n'It is reasonable to be concerned that one or more of the children who currently claim to enjoy filming may at some point suffer negative consequences they cannot foresee now as young teenagers.\n\n'As the guardian points out, even those children who do not participate in the filming may be negatively affected by the show continuing without them.\n\n'Indeed, the statements of several of the children to the effect that they need filming to survive, that it is their normal way of life, and that it feels weird not to film, although apparently intended to make filming seem innocuous or positive, raise concerns in the Court's mind as to whether continued filming is healthy for these children.'\n\nJudge Rowley chastised Kate, 44, for trying to minimize the impact of filming on the children by suggesting the show simply records the ordinary life the family leads. He pointed out that Kate admitted that the children would never film their real birthday and instead film birthday episodes a month later. Pictured clockwise: Cara, Aaden, Mady, Joel, Alexis and Leah\n\nJon, who lives with Hannah and Collin and girlfriend Colleen (pictured) in Reading, says he wants his other teenage children to enjoy a 'normal life' away from the cameras and worries that filming causes 'mental anguish' and 'instability'\n\nAnd in further damning claims the guardian ad litem - the impartial person appointed by the court to act as a representative for the Gosselin children - noted that they feared money had been 'misappropriated' by Kate.\n\n'I know the children have a trust fund that can be used for private schooling. I do not know what is contained within that fund. I do not know how much Mother has to provide the necessities of food, shelter, and clothing. It is troublesome to me that this family has been working in this industry for at least seven (7) years but is dependent upon this contract to survive. What has happened to all the money? The inference with the refusal to provide any financial information is that it has been misappropriated.'\n\nJudge Rowley continued by chastising Kate, 44, for trying to minimize the impact of filming on the children by suggesting the show simply records the ordinary life the family leads.\n\nHe pointed out that Kate admitted that the children would never film their real birthday and instead film birthday episodes a month later.\n\n'Having a staged second birthday is hardly the normal activity that would occur absent filming,' he said.\n\nJudge Rowley concluded: 'Taken altogether, the Court was faced with limited information, failures by Mother and her counsel to provide more information, real concerns about the mental and emotional effects of filming, and no way to determine whether those concerns are offset by the financial benefits of filming. The Court, therefore, concluded filming was not in the children's best interests.'\n\nLivid Jon, who these days works as an IT manager and DJ in Reading, Pennsylvania, told DailyMailTV: 'TLC were completely aware of the court order but filmed anyway. They filmed in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n\n'Now I'm even more upset because Kate plus Eight has aired against my permission, Kate filmed my kids without written consent from me.'\n\nThe former couple rose to fame on their hit TLC show Jon & Kate Plus 8 in 2007, featuring the family's set of twins and sextuplets They split in 2009 and Kate had physical custody of their eight children\n\nJon says he didn't watch the special episode but read a show recap on DailyMail.com.\n\n'I'm not gonna give her ratings on something I'm fighting so hard against,' he said.\n\n'It's just disheartening that I have to read about it... first of all, it's called Kate Plus 8 which is absurd. There's not eight children there. Two kids live with me, Hannah and Collin, they've lived with me for over a year.\n\n'At the end of the show Kate said that kids keep leaving - kids don't keep leaving, you threw one out. Institutionalized one. So he didn't leave on free will, Collin was kicked out of your house, thrown into an institution, mentally abused by you and the institution, so he didn't leave. Let's just put that on there. My daughter Hannah, she did leave and she chose to live with me.'\n\nThe special episode of Kate Plus 8 saw Kate sending her two eldest daughters Mady and Cara, 19, to college and she struggled to come to terms with their impending absence. They left for college in August.\n\nShe said on camera that Hannah didn't join them for the family trip to North Carolina because she had decided she would rather stay home with her dad.\n\n'She's with her dad and she was not able to come, and that's sad,' Kate said. 'It's the second trip here, actually, for us, that she hasn't been with us.\n\n'They're getting older, and they're making different choices,' she added. 'It's not optimal for mom, but it's something that I support, and we just adjust and move on.'\n\nBut Jon says this was a blatant lie.\n\n'She didn't even invite her. Hannah didn't even know they were filming. So even if she wanted to come how was she supposed to know.'\n\nJon says he didn't watch the special episode but read a show recap on DailyMail.com. 'I'm not gonna give her ratings on something I'm fighting so hard against,' he said. 'It's just disheartening that I have to read about it.' Pictured: Four of the sextuplets on a special episode of Kate Plus 8\n\nJon claims Kate's 'narcissism' and 'greed' will have driven her decision to defy the order. And he claims TLC will most likely cough up the money for any fine they're hit with\n\nJon says in court he requested a filming schedule, film locations and details on whether the children were being paid for their participation.\n\nBut he says Kate failed to produce any documentation.\n\n'You just wanted my signature for something that I didn't know anything about to film my kids. And I said no,' said Jon, addressing his ex.\n\nHe added: 'It's not just me that is concerned. It's me, Berks County Courthouse, Superior Court, and the guardian ad litem.\n\n'Everyone agrees it's not in the best interest of the kids to film, they've actually taken testimony from them that it is not in their best interests.\n\nJon said: 'There is no reason my kids need to be on television anymore, it doesn't benefit them in any way. It is very confusing for them'\n\n'Kate had to prove, within a reasonable doubt, that it was beneficial to the children, other than financially, to film them and she couldn't prove anything.'\n\nJon claims Kate's 'narcissism' and 'greed' will have driven her decision to defy the order.\n\nAnd he claims TLC will most likely cough up the money for any fine they're hit with.\n\n'They literally don't care. They'll pay the fine. So what's that tell people...that big business will do whatever they want to do because they have the money to pay all the fines,' he said.\n\n'This is all about money. This is a fiduciary thing. This has nothing to do with anything else other than Kate's lifestyle, not the kids' lifestyle.\n\n'Go get a job. Support your own family. It's disgusting. My kids work for her lifestyle.\n\n'Kate does nothing. Zero. Absolutely nothing.'\n\nJon, who lives with Hannah and Collin and girlfriend Colleen in Reading, says he wants his other teenage children to enjoy a 'normal life' away from the cameras and worries that filming causes 'mental anguish' and 'instability'.\n\n'There is no reason my kids need to be on television anymore, it doesn't benefit them in any way. It is very confusing for them.\n\n'I love all my kids. I want them to grow up to have a normal life. I know Mady and Cara are in college doing what they want to do, but my young kids are in ninth grade.\n\n'I just want them to experience high school, kind of like I experienced high school - just as normal as possible.'\n\nIn an explosive interview with DailyMailTV last month, Jon revealed Kate mentally tortured her young son Collin before sending him off to a special needs institution where he was held for three years\n\nIn an explosive interview with DailyMailTV last month, Jon revealed Kate mentally tortured her young son Collin before sending him off to a special needs institution where he was held for three years.\n\nHe spoke for the first time after a decade-long gag order was finally lifted.\n\nIn a series of bombshell claims, Jon said Kate is a 'militant' mother who has abused some of her eight children for years while maintaining the glossy 'happy family' image we see on our TV screens.\n\nHe accused his ex of wrongly making his kids work to maintain her luxury lifestyle.\n\nIn his latest interview he added: 'You know what the saddest part is? Not only did she cut Collin out of her life and institutionalized him, abused him physically and mentally, she publicly cut him out of a photograph on Instagram and that picture is everywhere.\n\n'So now when he Googles it, he sees all his siblings on his mother and then him purposely cropped out of the photograph.\n\n'So now he's truly segregated from the family. And the only thing that people write about is Hannah's left the show. But what about Collin?'\n\nSources close to the show say more special episodes of Kate Plus 8 are planned.", "description": "Jon Gosselin is 'furious' after TV network\u00a0TLC defied a court order barring them from filming his and Kate's children for reality show Kate Plus 8.", "authors": ["Ryan Parry West Coast Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/14/19541114-0-image-a-28_1570714487599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
