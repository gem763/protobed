But I have no idea if that\u2019s true, since elites have never seen any of the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d movies.\n\nAD\n\nAs much as I\u2019d love to sleep soundly again knowing someone took the president\u2019s finger off the nuclear button, his Sharpie away from government maps and his Twitter pulpit away from global trade, impeachment is a bad idea. Because it supports the populists\u2019 narrative.\n\nThe main reason Trump won wasn\u2019t economic anxiety. It wasn\u2019t sexism. It wasn\u2019t racism. It was that he was anti-elitist.\n\nHillary Clinton represented Wall Street, academics, law schools, policy papers, Davos, international treaties and people who think they\u2019re better than you. People like me.\n\nAD\n\nTrump represented something far more appealing, which is beating up people like me.\n\nA poll taken a month before the 2016 election showed that only 24 percent of voters disagreed with the following statement, \u201cThe real struggle for America is not between Democrats and Republicans but between mainstream America and the ruling political elites.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that 24 percent number is even lower now.\n\nAD\n\nElites are stereotyped as self-serving and sneaky. In truth, we\u2019re mostly just sneaky. And nothing is as sneaky as impeachment. It\u2019s obscure committees issuing confusingly worded subpoenas for phone records and documents. It\u2019s politicians parsing language in hearings where they perform for political points. One of the best fights so far was the one about whether regular congresspeople \u2014 or their specially trained lawyers \u2014 would question Trump officials. For impeachment, regular elitists aren\u2019t good enough. We need elite-elitists.\n\nAD\n\nThis is why impeachment looks to a lot of folks like the ruling elite taking on mainstream America. Which is what the last election was about. Now, we\u2019re doing it over, but this time only people in Congress will get a sticker that says, \u201cI voted!\u201d Impeachment is so elitist that it\u2019s a word that means something that no one thinks it does. It is the \u201cnonplussed\u201d of political words.\n\nImpeaching Trump without a chance of convicting him in the Senate is even more likely to damage us elites. Not only does it fail to save us from a madman, but it allows him to claim exoneration, sending a message that this was all elitist theater. And if there\u2019s one thing all populists hate, it\u2019s theater.\n\nAD\n\nGiven our politics, this play will devolve until it\u2019s half about whether Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s corruption is as bad as Trump\u2019s. Trump wins when he convinces people corruption is rampant and your best bet in a totally corrupt world is to back the most openly, unapologetically corrupt politician from your tribe.\n\nAD\n\nPopulism is the demand for pure democracy. Its enemy is the republic, which removes the dangerous edges of democracy by protecting human rights from the majority\u2019s will. Our founders gave us a republic. If they had wanted a direct democracy, the Constitution would be one page. Majorities don\u2019t like republics. Majorities were sold a democratic system where they get whatever they want, right away. When they don\u2019t get what they want, they get frustrated and turn to tyranny, which gets things done faster. Plato predicted this in \u201cThe Republic.\u201d It\u2019s the job of the elitist to explain this to people without mentioning Plato\u2019s \"The Republic.\"\n\nIn these angry times, elite maneuvering over impeachment will send the voters running into Trump\u2019s flailing, tweeting, flag-hugging, populist arms. I know another year of Trump is a huge risk. But he must be unseated at the polls. Because that will be a more satisfying outcome for people who don\u2019t trust elites.\n\nAD\n\nEspecially if we do it with a big enough majority so that we don\u2019t have to explain the electoral college.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Elite maneuvering over impeachment will send the voters running into Trump\u2019s arms.", "authors": ["Joel Stein"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fSzpvfXqHah5BUTo6ezluwE_jEU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUGO5HK34I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
