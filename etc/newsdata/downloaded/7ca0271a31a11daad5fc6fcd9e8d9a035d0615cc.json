The rains are from slow-moving thunderstorms associated with tropical depression Imelda, which made landfall Tuesday as a weak tropical storm.\n\nWednesday marks day two of a three-day drenching that has the Houston and Galveston metro areas squarely in its sights, the latest in several seemingly routine hundred-year rain events to plague the region in recent years. Flash-flood watches blanket the map, and the Weather Prediction Center in Maryland has declared the region to be at \u201chigh risk\u201d for excessive rainfall.\n\nThrough daybreak Wednesday, Houston had dodged most of the heaviest rain bands, while Galveston \u2014 the coastal city 45 miles to the southeast \u2014 has been clobbered by repetitive rounds of squalls all morning - with rainfall totals topping 8 inches.\n\nWith 8.33\" of rain and counting, the streets in The Strand area of #Galveston are under water.

(NOAA)\n\nWith little storm motion expected within the next 24 hours, Houston could start to see some of the persistent, heavy rain bands on Wednesday. A widespread 2 to 5 inches, with localized 7-inch amounts, is possible within the city and northwest, though that could change, particularly in southeastern parts of the city.\n\nRadar on Wednesday morning showed the northern edge of the heavy precipitation shield backing into Houston. Moderate to heavy rainfall is likely in the city of 2.3 million by noon.\n\nFrom just east of Matagorda Bay, 60 miles southwest of Galveston, up through Port Arthur, 90 miles east of Houston, a band of 10 mile-high thunderstorms continues to drop rainfall at ridiculous rates, briefly spiking to nearly half a foot per hour. A gauge within that band in Bay City recorded 3.88 inches of rain in one hour.\n\nDoppler radar estimates a total of nearly two feet over the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge. Within the band, a general 10 to 18 inches, with isolated 2-foot amounts, can\u2019t be ruled out. The most likely spot for this would be near the Brazoria/Matagorda County line.\n\nA 20-inch total was reported near Sargent, Tex., Wednesday morning.\n\n24-hour total of just over 20 inches near Sargent, TX, per LCRA (HT @JeffLindner1) #Imelda pic.twitter.com/ApfXhZPQkA \u2014 Jonathan Erdman (@wxjerdman) September 18, 2019\n\nThis one particularly heavy band of thunderstorms exists along a sharp gradient of instability along the immediate coastline. That focuses the storms, allowing them to ride along like rail cars on a train track, which meteorologists refer to as \u201ctraining.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, extremely efficient moisture transport in the atmosphere is, in essence, pumping in a conveyor belt of fuel. It\u2019s like someone handing you a saturated sponge, you wringing it into a bucket, and then being handed another sponge.\n\nAnd another. And another.\n\nEventually that bucket\u2019s going to overflow.\n\nCell training continues across an area that has already recorded an incredible 10-20 inches in the last 24 hours...much of that falling in the last 6-12 hrs #txwx pic.twitter.com/fsgEYS8xMZ \u2014 Jeff Lindner (@JeffLindner1) September 18, 2019\n\nData suggests this band will largely remain the focus of the heaviest rainfall from this system through Wednesday afternoon, drifting slightly east throughout the course of the day. That may shift the focus away from the Lake Jackson area to the Palacios corridor in Texas this evening, while heightening the flood risk on the east side of the band near the Texas/Louisiana region.\n\nIf this scenario comes to pass, the Beaumont and Port Arthur region may become a hot spot for flooding Wednesday afternoon into early evening.\n\nIt then looks as though any holes in the radar now over Houston may start to fill in overnight into Thursday morning. Although Houston may not end up with the highest rainfall totals, dangerous flooding is possible if any rain bands target the vulnerable, concrete-blanketed city.\n\nHigh lightning flash rates associated with the extremely heavy rainfall over Matagorda County, TX from #Imelda. pic.twitter.com/k2GOBfigos \u2014 Stephanie Stevenson (@GigEm12_Steph) September 18, 2019\n\nSome models indicate the possibility of this occurring. The flood risk for Houston will increase Wednesday afternoon and remain into early Thursday morning.\n\nBy Thursday, the remnants of Imelda\u2019s circulation are likely to spin to the northeast. This could focus the heaviest rain in Port Arthur, Beaumont and Lumberton, with virtually all computer models showing the axis of heaviest rain sitting there with next to no movement Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, the system will pull away from the coast. Removed from its fuel source and conveyor belt of moisture, it will start to dissipate \u2014 but not before drenching places like Tyler, in East Texas; Shreveport, in northwest Louisiana; and Texarkana, at the Texas-Arkansas state line. The bulk of the heavy rain will largely have wound down by the time the weekend rolls around, with only remnant showers and isolated downpours over extreme eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.", "description": "A widespread 5 to 10 inches, with localized amounts closing in on or exceeding 2 feet, is likely.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Am", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
