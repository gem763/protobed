The shot came off Miguel Castro (1-3), who was charged with all six runs.\n\nGuerrero Jr. was removed in the ninth after being shaken up making a hard slide into second base.\n\n\"It was the rib,\" manager Charlie Montoyo said.\n\nGuerrero was wearing a bandage over his left rib cage, but it was unclear if he would miss any or all of Toronto's final 10 games.\n\nWATCH | Grichuk hits grand slam in 9th inning:\n\nRandal Grichuk hit a grand slam in the ninth inning, leading Toronto to a 11-10 come from behind win. 1:48\n\nBrock Stewart (4-0) worked the eighth and Derek Law finished for his fifth save, retiring Trey Mancini on a bases-loaded grounder to end a game that lasted 4 hours, 8 minutes.\n\nHomers by Jonathan Villar and Anthony Santander in the fourth inning put Baltimore ahead 7-1 and ended another disappointing outing by Buchholz. He allowed 10 hits, seven for extra bases, in 3 2/3 innings and left with a 6.48 ERA.\n\n\"Terrible,\" Buchholz said. \"It's what I told [catcher] Reese [McGuire] whenever Charlie came out and got the ball from me. I tapped him on the facemask and told him 'That's what happens when you don't execute your pitches when you need to execute them.' It's not the first time I've given up seven runs.\"\n\nThe oldest man on a team rebuilding with youth, Buchholz has spent more days on the injured list than on the active roster. The 35-year-old started on the IL with an elbow strain and was sidelined with right shoulder inflammation from May 9-Aug. 24.\n\nUncertain future for Buchholz\n\nThis was the shortest of his 10 starts this season. Buchholz missed time last year with Arizona because of elbow and oblique injuries, and in 2017 he had season-ending elbow surgery after making two starts in April.\n\nNow, 12 years after throwing a no-hitter against the Orioles for Boston in his second major league start, Buchholz faces an uncertain future after he completes the final days of a one-year deal he signed in March.\n\nSince going 81-61 with the Red Sox during a 10-year span, Buchholz is 8-8 over the past three seasons.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. walks off the field after an apparent injury during the ninth inning.

With two outs, Santander, Rio Ruiz and Austin Hays doubled in succession for a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was 4-1 in the fourth before Villar hit his 23rd homer , Trey Mancini singled and Santander sent a 1-2 pitch deep into the right-field seats.\n\nBuchholz never turned to follow the path of the ball. He simply motioned for another baseball, caught it barehanded and trudged back to the mound.\n\nAn instant after that, Montoyo went to the mound and took that ball from Buchholz.\n\nBut Baltimore couldn't hold the lead.\n\n\"Miguel Castro has been throwing the ball great the past couple months,\" manager Brandon Hyde said. \"He just had a tough night.\"", "description": "Randal Grichuk hit a grand slam with two outs in the ninth inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays rebounded from an ineffective start by Clay Buchholz to rally past the Baltimore Orioles 11-10 on Wednesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289319.1568867677!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1169386678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
