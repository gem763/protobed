In my point of view, we just have to go for it.\n\n\u201cWe definitely need to enjoy it and be full of confidence, especially with the way we\u2019ve got these points, having not had the best games but still getting the wins.\u201d\n\nCity\u2019s shock defeats to Norwich and Wolves have allowed Liverpool to surge ahead thanks to their perfect start to the season.\n\nHowever, Van Dijk remains wary of Pep Guardiola\u2019s men, who overturned a seven-point deficit to pip Liverpool to the title by a point last season.\n\n\u201cThere are so many games left, you can\u2019t really think about it (winning the title) \u2014 it\u2019s not realistic,\u201d added the Dutch captain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch Man City\u2019s games but I have family and friends who text me or say something, especially after the Wolves game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just part of life but we\u2019ve learnt from last year that we don\u2019t have to look to the others until the end of the campaign. So far, we have been doing well but Man City are definitely not going away.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Liverpool have nothing to lose in the Premier League title race despite amassing an eight-point lead after just eight games,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/fdbeca_virgil-van-dijk-expects-manchester-city-push-liverpool-all-way-in-premier-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
