It was a great job by Owen as captain.\"\n\nThree minutes into the second half, England's lead was cut to a point at 17-16 after Marika Koroibete crossed for Australia's only try of the game.\n\nBut Farrell stressed there had been no panic when England saw their lead dramatically reduced.\n\n\"The boys were calm and in control and we had clear messages about what we were going to do next. The lads ripped into that and we managed to get some points back straight away,\" he said.\n\n\"This was a good performance but we don't feel we are at our best yet.\"\n\nMay limped off shortly before full time but Jones down played down fears over the fitness of his star flyer, who has now scored an impressive 27 tries in 50 Tests, by saying: \"He just had a little bit of a twinge at the end so we took him off, but he should be fine.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones warned England to prepare for a \"better samurai round the corner\" after they knocked his native Australia out of the World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8877/a6862892e8ea47f19979e67f740d4568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
