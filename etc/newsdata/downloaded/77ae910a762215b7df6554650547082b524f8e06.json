They\u2019re not even keen on the word commune, as it happens, because of said connotations.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHere, rather, the focus is on sustainability, simplicity and stepping as lightly as possible on planet Earth.\n\nResidents produce almost all their own food, all their own power and \u2013 via a couple of compost toilets \u2013 manure. \u201cIt\u2019s why the raspberries taste so good,\u201d I was told. At nights, they enjoy communal (wood-cooked) dinners and fireside conversation.\n\nFor sure, there\u2019s plenty of beards. Undoubtedly, too, some people here know their way round a big fat doobie. But the focus is the environment; of finding a cleaner, healthier way to live; of discovering contentment outside convention.\n\nIt is, in short, wonderful.\n\nI spent two days being shown the 80-acre site\u2019s abundant woodland, snacking on fruit taken straight from the bush, and discussing the finer points of milking a goat.\n\nThe electricity \u2013 provided by solar panels and a wind turbine \u2013 went down for a while. But it hardly mattered. \u201cIt does you good to be without occasionally,\u201d said Tony Haigh, who\u2019s lived there for 21 years.\n\nBut \u2013 the big question put to me as I waved goodbye \u2013 would I ever consider moving to such a place myself?\n\nHow do you say \u201cno\u201d tactfully?\n\nI\u2019m just too much of a soft lad for that lifestyle. I struggle changing a lightbulb; the thought of having to deal with a wind turbine just to switch on the bedside lamp is essentially my worst (darkened) nightmare. Chumps like me need \u2013 and want \u2013 the city, the town or the village.\n\nBut, crucially, perhaps the city needs places like Brithdir Mawr too.\n\nAs environmental damage poses an ever more existential threat, our urbanised society needs to find better ways to become more like such communes \u2013 organic farming, renewable energies and, yes, compost toilets included.\n\nYours,\n\nColin Drury\n\nNorth of England correspondent", "description": "Like most people, perhaps, when I hear the word commune, it brings to mind a certain image: Sixties-style hippies, free love, abundant drugs and plenty of facial hair.
