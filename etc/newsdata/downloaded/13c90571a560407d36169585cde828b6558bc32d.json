Winners will be randomly selected and a free tub floaty will sail its way to their doorstep.\n\n(Image: PR Handout - Free to use)\n\nOtherwise, from October 28, fans will be given a free floaty (while stocks last) when purchasing a scoop of Moo-phoria ice cream from the Soho Scoop Shop.\n\nOne lucky ice cream fan will also be awarded an added bonus of a Ben & Jerry's 'Inside Scoop' card included within their Tub Floaty package - which gives the holder unlimited chunks and swirls from the Soho Scoop Shop for a whole year.\n\nTsega Abate, Flavour Guru at Ben & Jerry\u2019s said: \"Our Moo-phoria range is so light it can almost float\u2026 So we decided to help it along by creating the Tub Floaty!\n\n\"You know that dream you keep having where you\u2019re floating face up in the serene waters of your local bathtub whilst also simultaneously spooning into deLIGHTfully chunky ice cream as puppies start to fall softly from the skies? Well this is it, minus the puppies. Now you and your tubs can both float merrily alongside one another in an ice cream-filled haze!\"", "description": "Ice cream lovers can now easily enjoy a scoop or two of their favourite ice cream in the bath thanks to Ben & Jerry", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Pr Handout - Free To Use"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723996.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FOP_248JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
