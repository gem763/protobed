He\u2019s just going to continue to get better and better. We understand that kid is a heck of a player.\u201d\n\nBut the 19-year-old US forward\u2019s size \u2014 6-foot-7 (2.00m) and 285 pounds (129kg) \u2014 combined with his high-leaping heroics as well as speed and power, has many worrying that nagging knee injuries will continue and worsen unless he loses weight and improves his fitness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s carrying so much weight. He\u2019s so athletic. I think he\u2019s going to have to lose a little bit more weight,\u201d says retired NBA star and television analyst Paul Pierce.\n\nWilliamson will miss the Pelicans\u2019 NBA season opener Tuesday at Toronto and at least a couple of weeks as a result of a right knee injury suffered in a pre-season game. It\u2019s the same knee he famously sprained in college when his Nike shoe exploded during a game.\n\nThe shoemaker\u2019s stock fell $1.1 billion the next day but Williamson\u2019s stock has been rising since he turned high school stardom into a one-season run at Duke University \u2014 where he averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.1 steals and 1.8 blocked shots a game.\n\nHis 68 percent accuracy rate was the best ever for a freshman in major US college basketball.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too big, too strong. He\u2019s going to continue to do that hopefully over his whole career,\u201d said New York Knicks rookie R.J. Barrett, formerly Williamson\u2019s roommate at Duke.\n\nIt was enough to convince the Pelicans to select Williamson with the top pick in June\u2019s NBA Draft and trade Anthony Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for young supporting talent that figures to blend well with Williamson.\n\n\u201cFor me to be selected number one, I can\u2019t dream it no better than that,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cI think we can build something. I see myself trying to step into a leadership role. I have to understand my teammates and understand where their heads are. It\u2019s a matter of us coming together, making the same goals and just willing to win, and I think we can do something special.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll adjust very well\u2019 \u2013\n\nWilliamson played only nine minutes in the Vegas Summer League before he banged left knees in a collision and was benched for the remainder of the get-acquainted NBA games.\n\n\u201cThe physicality is a little bit different. There are more players that are a lot stronger, so you have to find more skilled ways to score,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cBut I feel like with my size, it\u2019s not going to be that big of an adjustment. I feel like I\u2019ll adjust very well.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of other lifestyle changes in the NBA, the travel and longer schedule as well as faster and more physical rivals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe grind is different. You always have to find different ways to stay ahead of your opponent.\u201d\n\nThat has proven troublesome for the Pelicans in past years. New Orleans went 33-49 last season and the team has won only two playoff series since starting in 2002, never going past the second round of the post-season.\n\nNBA general managers, however, predicted Williamson will be the 2020 NBA Rookie of the Year with 68 percent support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Zion believer and whatever he does I\u2019ll be right behind him 100 percent,\u201d said Pelicans guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker. \u201cIf he wants to shoot wide open threes and knock it down, then by all means keep doing that. It\u2019s only going to make him harder to guard and the team better.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Zion Williamson has excited NBA fans like no rookie since LeBron James, but knee injuries before his debut have also brought", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/d8e667_teen-rookie-zion-williamson-new-orleans-pelicans-has-excited-nba-fans-how-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
