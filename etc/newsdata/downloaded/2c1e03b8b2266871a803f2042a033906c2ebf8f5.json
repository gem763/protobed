(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nAs evidence mounts, the GOP defense of Trump\u2019s call is falling apart.\n\nDuring the last impeachment, the Latin expression coitus interruptus got a workout. This time, it\u2019s quid pro quo. Republicans lashed themselves to this mast when the White House\u2019s own rough transcript of the Trump\u2013Zelensky call was disclosed. That document, so damaging that one might think its release was the work of Trump\u2019s opponents rather than Trump himself, left no doubt that the president had strong-armed a besieged ally for political dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter the QPQ squad. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania allowed that the conversation was \u201cinappropriate\u201d but \u201creveals no quid pro quo.\u201d Senator David Perdue of Georgia said that the media had \u201ctalked about eight quid pro quos. I can\u2019t find one.\u201d Nor could Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it [the call] concerning,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo, you\u2019d have to have that if there was going to be anything wrong.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows (R., N.C.) tweeted repeatedly about the lack of QPQ, while Representative Doug Collins (R., Ga.) offered that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing there.\u201d But the most embarrassing declaration award must go to Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) who told National Review last month, \u201cWhat would\u2019ve been wrong is if the president had suggested to the Ukrainian government that if you don\u2019t do what I want you to do regarding the Bidens, we\u2019re not going to give you the aid. That was the accusation; that did not remotely happen.\u201d\n\nYeah, it did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Republican reliance on \u201cno QPQ\u201d was odd from the beginning. The president\u2019s own words left no doubt. Zelensky asked for military aid. Trump admonished Zelensky that the U.S. had been very generous to Ukraine but that there hadn\u2019t always been reciprocity. He then said he needed a \u201cfavor\u201d and launched into the Democratic-server garbage that he\u2019d picked up from Reddit or Alex Jones or something, followed by demands that Ukraine investigate the Bidens. You want something from me for your country? You\u2019ve gotta give me what I ask for my personal benefit. The \u201csomething,\u201d by the way, was legally appropriated by Congress. The president cannot lawfully withhold that something for any but statutorily listed reasons. The lone Republican senator who seems to have remembered how the Constitution works was Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost Republicans, far from guarding institutional prerogatives or constitutional principles, have become wind-up toys. When Mick Mulvaney gave a press conference to announce that, whaddya know, the very best place to hold the G-7 meeting was Trump\u2019s Doral resort in Miami, and he detoured to boast that of course there was a QPQ \u2014 \u201cGet over it\u201d \u2014 Republicans spoke only off the record. \u201cTotally inexplicable,\u201d a nameless lawmaker told the Washington Post.\n\nHere were Mulvaney\u2019s actual words: \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d He later tried to tell Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace that he hadn\u2019t said that and that it was a media misrepresentation. (The DNC server \u201ccorruption\u201d is also a fantasy, though that\u2019s another story.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a daily basis, evidence mounts of the QPQ (not that more was needed). Trump appointee Kurt Volker texted a Ukrainian official: \u201cHeard from White House-assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d The Ukrainians were keen for a White House meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam Taylor, a lifelong public servant (West Point, Vietnam Bronze Star, NATO, U.S. Department of State) testified under oath that military assistance to Ukraine, which is in a shooting war with Russia, was withheld on the president\u2019s orders. Trump demanded that Zelensky make a public announcement of an official Ukrainian investigation into the 2016 election and the Bidens. It was to be on CNN.\n\nGordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, told Taylor that he had been wrong to tell the Ukrainians that only a White House meeting was linked to the announcement of a formal investigation. In fact, \u201c\u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.\u201d A parade of distinguished witnesses has echoed this story. Some are career public servants. Some are leading Republicans and Trump appointees. Former energy secretary Rick Perry, though straining to help Trump\u2019s cause, admitted that he was asked to phone shadow secretary of state Rudy Giuliani about Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans used to speak movingly about the importance of liberty. They said they stood against tyranny in all its forms. Just a few years ago, they would have thought it insane if someone had handed them a time machine and told them that in 2019 they\u2019d be defending the abuse of a small country by a small man.
