On previous trips, the same C-17 was said to have made pit stops at US bases in Germany and Spain for refueling, which similar military planes traveling to and from the Middle East take on their routes.\n\nBut there were no US bases nearby the crew's stop this spring, and Trump Turnberry was 23 miles away from the closest airport.\n\nThe 176th AMS is based out of Alaska, and it specializes in combat search and rescue, and strategic airlifts.\n\nUS service members deploying to the Middle East often take civilian airliners to countries like Qatar, where they are then transported to their final destination via military aircraft.\n\nIt is unclear who was responsible for booking the flight itinerary. It was also unclear whether the crew members paid for the resort lodging themselves or if it was expensed. Military trip itineraries are typically made by junior officers and non-commissioned officers, who take into account the cheapest routes and accommodations.\n\nRead more: Trump's move to use $3.6 billion of military funds to pay for the border wall is a 'slap in the face' to US service members, Democratic leaders say\n\nA crew member expressed his reaction to the accommodations at the resort by texting someone a photo and included that their allowance could not cover the meals.\n\nThe Air National Guard and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the matter, which is part of a broader look into the military's spending near the president's resort, Politico first reported. According to a June letter addressed to then-acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's chairman, probed the Pentagon on \"potential conflicts of interests.\"\n\nRep. Cummings' letter questioned why the military spent $11 million for fuel at Pretwick Airport, nearby Trump's resort, in the last two years. US military transport planes traditionally fly from and to military bases for refueling, and are billed a premium in civilian airports, Politico said.\n\nThe committee's investigation and the Air National Guard's trips come amid increased profits for Trump Turnberry after 2017. For four consecutive years, the resort had lost $4.5 million, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post; its income increased $3 million in 2018, according to financial documents reviewed by Politico.", "description": "A crew member reportedly texted someone a photo and mentioned that their allowance could not cover the meals.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7303cc2e22af3f0a61a733-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
