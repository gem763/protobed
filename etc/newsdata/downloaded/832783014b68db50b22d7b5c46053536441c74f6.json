But the past several days have been something else: a clarifying, terrifying descent.\n\nHow low will Trump go? Leagues lower than you ever imagined, and probably several hundred feet below your current nightmares. Officials with Trump\u2019s re-election campaign apparently plan to use \u201cget over it\u201d as a slogan on merchandise, but I think that the White House\u2019s real new motto comes from Tacitus, a celebrated historian in ancient Rome: \u201cCrime, once exposed, has no refuge but in audacity.\u201d\n\nThat audacity animated Mulvaney. It was manifest when Trump publicly beseeched China to get in on the action and do its own investigation of Hunter and Joe Biden. It helps explain the planned convening of the G7 at Trump National Doral Miami, a gesture of such perverse defiance, such profound contempt, that it takes the breath away.\n\nWith the gaslighting logic that is his greatest gift, Trump is asserting that no real crook would be this nakedly, flamboyantly criminal, and he\u2019s giving anyone in America who isn\u2019t aboard the Trump train the middle finger. It, not his brain, is the body part with which he governs.\n\nThis is all about impeachment, to which he has responded \u2014 predictably \u2014 with a puerile rage. The first, second and third laws of Trumpian psychology are that for every action, there\u2019s an unequal and hysterical overreaction, and ever since impeachment took on an air of probability, he has been overreacting all over the place.\n\nHe\u2019s at his most dangerous when he\u2019s most vulnerable and impotent, because he\u2019s compelled to project command and potency. He has to convince everyone that he\u2019s unflustered and unafraid.\n\nThat, as much as any promise to voters, motivated the disastrous pullout from Syria and abandonment of Kurdish allies. Precisely because it was what might undermine the loyalty of his Republican saviors and leave him exposed, he did it. It was a pantomime of fearlessness, a pretense of invincibility.", "description": "The president is unabashed, unapologetic and out of control.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/opinion/sunday/20bruni/20bruni-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
