REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested in connection with a New York case involving campaign finance laws, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan said.\n\nThe arrests were the latest dramatic development in a political drama that threatens Trump\u2019s presidency. They come as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives conducts an impeachment inquiry into the Republican president centred on Trump\u2019s request in a July telephone call for Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nParnas is a Ukrainian businessman. Fruman is a real estate investor who was born in Belarus. Both, according to various media accounts, helped introduce Giuliani into top Ukrainian political circles.\n\nParnas and Fruman conspired to \u201cfunnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,\u201d according to a federal court filing in New York. The two men made illegal contributions using straw donors, according to the indictment.\n\nJohn Dowd, the lawyer for the two men, declined comment on the charges.\n\nThe two men had been planning to fly to Vienna on Wednesday night, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nParnas and Fruman were expected to appear in a federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Journal described the two men as donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate Biden.\n\nTwo other people who were charged in the indictment were David Correia, a U.S. businessman, and Andrey Kukushkin, a Ukrainian-born U.S. businessman.\n\nRelated Coverage Zelenskiy ready to open probe into any Ukraine meddling in Trump election\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that favors campaign finance regulation, had urged a U.S. government agency in a July 2018 complaint to investigate whether Parnas and Fruman had broken the law by using a shell company to disguise the source of a $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump political action committee.\n\nThe CLC later supplemented its complaint to the U.S. Federal Election Commission to include evidence of wire transfers showing the movement of the funds.\n\nParnas told Reuters last month he knew the FBI was investigating him but was not sure why.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the FBI wants,\u201d Parnas said at the time.\n\nParnas said that any violations of Federal Election Commission rules were unwitting and a \u201cclerical thing\u201d because he was not an experienced political donor. Parnas said he was not trying to hide the source of the $325,000 donation.\n\nHe said he gave the money to America First Action committee because \u201cwe are huge supporters of the president.\u201d\n\nFOREIGN INTERFERENCE\n\nNancy Pelosi, who as House Speaker is the top Democrat in the chamber, launched the impeachment inquiry last month after the revelation that Trump had sought foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nA whistleblower complaint to Congress also raised concerns that Trump leveraged $400 million in U.S. aid to try to secure a promise from Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has described the probe as a partisan smear.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nDemocrats are getting impatient with the administration\u2019s blocks on its investigation.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are now refusing to answer the simplest question: whether it\u2019s acceptable for a president to pressure foreign countries to undermine our elections. American elections should be decided by Americans, not by \u2018favors\u2019 from foreign governments,\u201d Pelosi tweeted on Thursday.", "description": "Two foreign-born Florida businessmen associated with U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to funnel foreign money to U.S. political candidates, officials said on Thursday.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439253229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9909C", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
