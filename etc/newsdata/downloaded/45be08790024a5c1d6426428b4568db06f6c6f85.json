A lot of things [need] to improve. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u2019\n\nMatty Longstaff\u2019s goal handed Newcastle United a 1-0 win against Manchester United on Sunday (Picture: Getty)\n\nThose comments have not gone down well with former United midfielder Ince who believes that the club\u2019s supporters have a right to be furious at De Gea over his comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I watched David de Gea\u2019s post-match interview and I was at a loss,\u2019 Ince told Paddy Power. \u2018He\u2019s meant to be one of the leaders, if that was Peter Schmeichel standing there, there\u2019s no chance you\u2019d have seen that interview.\n\n\u2018Rather than him addressing and recognising where the team were going wrong, it just felt like \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\n\u2018This is one of the top players, the leaders at Man United, who has just signed a five-year contract! And he looks like he doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re a United fan listening to your goalkeeper, one of the main leaders in the team, and that\u2019s the interview you here you\u2019d be right to be disgraced.\u2019\n\nDespite United\u2019s current problems, De Gea committed his long-term future to the club last month, signing a new four-year contract worth a reported \u00a3350,000 per week.\n\nSince De Gea pen to paper on a contract extension, United have won just once in six matches in all competitions and Ince believes the Spanish international will regret signing the deal.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d be looking thinking, Jesus, he doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on \u2013 I bet he\u2019s regretting signing that contract,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Paul Ince has criticised David De Gea for failing to address Manchester United's shortcomings after their 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United at St James' Park on Sunday.
