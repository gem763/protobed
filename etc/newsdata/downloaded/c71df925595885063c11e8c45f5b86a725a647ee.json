Let's go in the Millwall end. Hide your scarf.'\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe then explained that once the game had finished and you'd get on the tube, there'd be a roar coming from around the corner and you didn't know who it was - referring to fans of the opposite team.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nSuggs, real name Graham McPherson, said he'd hope there wasn't enough of the rival fans to be able to beat him up.\n\nThe singer also referred to the hooliganism as the Battle of Agincourt.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: EMPICS Entertainment)\n\nHe confessed: \"Then, there'd be a volley of Coca-Cola cans from the upturned hot-dog stall, knocking the coppers off their bucking horses.
