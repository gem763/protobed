It is the cause of 60 percent to 70 percent of cases of dementia. The majority of people with Alzheimer's are age 65 and older. More than five million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s. It is unknown what causes Alzheimer's. Those who have the APOE gene are more likely to develop late-onset Alzheimer's. Signs and symptoms: Difficulty remembering newly learned information\n\nDisorientation\n\nMood and behavioral changes\n\nSuspicion about family, friends and professional caregivers\n\nMore serious memory loss\n\nDifficulty with speaking, swallowing and walking Stages of Alzheimer's: Mild Alzheimer's (early-stage) - A person may be able to function independently but is having memory lapses\n\nModerate Alzheimer's (middle-stage) - Typically the longest stage, the person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, or have sudden behavioral changes\n\nSevere Alzheimer's disease (late-stage) - In the final stage, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, carry on a conversation and, eventually, control movement There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, but experts suggest physical exercise, social interaction and adding brain boosting omega-3 fats to your diet to prevent or slowdown the onset of symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe study asked questions about households' financial assets and liabilities. The data was all self-reported.\n\nThe probability of a 'large adverse change' in liquid assets increased by 3.3 per cent pre-diagnosis, according to the study.\n\nThe team also found a small amount of evidence that these households are likely to have a reduction in net wealth, such as vehicles or home value.\n\nProfessor Gresenz said the results of the study, which was published in the journal Health Economics, were concerning.\n\nShe added that the adverse financial outcomes are occurring just before the life-changing diagnosis, which can prove costly.\n\nCharities echoed the financial concerns, and warned an early diagnosis is crucial to help patients keep on top of their money.\n\nDementia patients and their families can face years of hefty costs, which has been dubbed the 'dementia tax' in the UK.\n\nAlzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, isn't usually diagnosed until symptoms are severe.\n\nTypically, the first signs include difficulty recalling conversations or misplacing items. It progresses to forgetting simple tasks such as how to cook.\n\nThere are more than 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK today, of which more than 500,000 have Alzheimer's. In the US, it's estimated there are 5.5million Alzheimer's sufferers.\n\nProfessor Martin Knapp, of the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the study, said the findings are 'really interesting'.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'I think it should cause us to stop and think about how to contact and support people with the disease quicker.\n\n'When services are a bit stretched like in the UK, services are going to be focused on people with more severe needs, like those who need daily help eating, bathing or getting around.\n\n'But there are many more important things that are effected - such as finance - which may be because the individual, or a family member, has to stop working.\n\n'As a researcher in this area, I think it's a really interesting piece of work. No-one has really looked at it before but it represents only part of the picture.'\n\nLeading charity Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK said the findings stress the importance of a speedy diagnosis.\n\nDr James Connell, research manager, said: 'Looking after money, paying the bills on time and keeping on top of finances can be challenging for someone with dementia, particularly as the condition progresses.\n\n'The diseases that cause dementia can start to cause physical changes in the brain decades before symptoms start to show.\n\n'Early diagnosis will be crucial for future treatments to have the best chance of success, but it will also allow people to access support sooner and give them more time to manage their affairs.'\n\nHelen Foster, director of operations, at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: 'It\u2019s no surprise that the early symptoms of dementia may have an impact on decision-making, including how well people are able to manage their finances.\n\n'But a decrease in your household income doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate someone is experiencing dementia - what\u2019s important is that people get an accurate and early diagnosis, so they can plan for the future.\n\n'People with dementia will need support from banks to protect their finances, help them with the services they need and, when the time comes, hand over decision-making to people they trust.'", "description": "Scientists at Georgetown University in Washington DC looked at the finances and health records of 33,000 people.
