I broke down in tears when I saw the letter. I wasn't expecting it at all, there was no prior warning, no phonecall, nothing,\" the receptionist, of Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire, said.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mail)\n\n\"It's soul destroying and a cold-hearted decision by the owners to close it. It has been awfully handled.\n\n\"We had everything sorted for the wedding but now we've got to look around again to find a place we want to get married.\n\n\"After reading the letter I called the hotel to find out more but they told me nothing. There was no sympathy for our situation and no help at all.\n\n\"We were told the owner no longer wants to do weddings, that's all we were told.\"\n\nCulcreuch's general manager Robert Reynolds wrote in the letter: \"It is therefore with great sadness that we have to inform you that we will be unable to hold your wedding here.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\"We realise that this [the closure] will come as a traumatic shock to you and your family as it is to all members of our staff.\"\n\nDeposits will be refunded but Mhairi-Claire remains crushed.\n\nShe added: \"I remember when I first saw the castle. I wanted to get married there, it's perfect - so for it to be cancelled has just ruined it.\n\n\"Culcreuch was ideal for us as it was dog friendly.\n\n\"Having my two wee boy dogs at the wedding was a big thing for me, so if I can't have them there then it will be devastating.\n\n\"We booked the venue about a year ago so we now have to look for another one.\n\n\"I have everything booked so I am now worried about suppliers because if we can't get the same date then they might be booked up already.\n\n\"We have people coming from all over so we want something close. I have started to look again.\"\n\nOther brides took to social media to express their disappointment at having their wedding cancelled.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nShelly Cox posted a picture of her letter and said: \"We are absolutely gutted! Our venue has just cancelled our wedding.\n\n\"If anyone has any recommendations for venues from your wedding or weddings you have been to we would be very grateful.\"\n\nWhile Louise Docherty posted on Facebook : \"Absolutely gutted.\n\n\"Back to square 1 we go...\"\n\nMr Reynolds, who has been general manager of the hotel for 13 years, conceded around 30 full and part-time employees will lose their jobs.\n\nThe decision to close was made by the hotel's US-based owner.\n\nThe manager said: \"The owner has decided to close the hotel for restoration.\n\n\"The estate will stay open but the hotel will close ,so it's not just the weddings affected.\n\n\"We have staff here who are pretty devastated they are losing their job.\n\n\"I have made sure the owners refunded the brides.\"", "description": "When Culcreuch Castle Hotel in Fintry, near Glasgow, said it is going to close, bride-to-be Mhairi-Claire Hunter felt \"utterly devastated\"", "authors": ["Peter Davidson", "Image", "Daily Record", "Sunday Mail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533660.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AMP_SDR_071019_WEDDING_0003JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
