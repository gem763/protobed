Sorry Scotland.), so how can parents keep the costs down? Here\u2019s how:\n\nGet a tax break on your holiday club\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nQuite often it\u2019s simply impossible to take yet more time off just two months after the big summer holiday so you may be booking holiday clubs to keep your little ones entertained.\n\nThe best way to keep the cost of a holiday club right down is to book well in advance, when providers often offer early bird discounts. Yes, it\u2019s a bit late for that now but bear it in mind next time.\n\nAnother possible way to keep the costs down is to see if the holiday club accepts tax-free childcare payments (unless you still get childcare vouchers via your employer).\n\nWhen you sign up to tax-free childcare, you can then pay money into a digital wallet that the government tops up with 20 per cent, making every \u00a38 worth \u00a310. You then pay your childcare provider from that account.\n\nIt can be used for childcare up to the age of 11 but it is a worryingly underused service and loads of money earmarked for parents has been returned to the Treasury. Sign up and get the help you deserve.\n\nUse twofers\n\nSo many of the main theme parks, zoos and other big days out have discounts and deals that it\u2019s essential to look for a voucher or code before booking.\n\nPerhaps you have a two-for-one or adults-go-free voucher saved from a cereal packet, maybe you can find a good deal online.\n\nNever pay full price without hunting for a deal first, otherwise you\u2019re subsidising the other people you see that day.\n\nOne good place to look for a bargain is the Days Out Guide with National Rail. You can often get two-for-one entry to some of the country\u2019s best attractions if you go by train (or if you buy a train ticket to the nearest station from one stop away).\n\nUse a rail discount\n\nIf you are travelling by train then consider getting a Family and Friends Railcard. It costs \u00a330 but saves you 1/3 off adult fares and up to 60 per cent off kids\u2019 tickets.\n\nEven if you\u2019re travelling with a child who is young enough to not need a ticket, it\u2019s frequently cheaper overall to use that railcard and get them a ticket anyway.\n\nBook any days out in advance\n\nIf you do decide to head to a ticketed venue then planning in advance can really save you some cash. Many of the country\u2019s big showstopping destinations offer a discount if you book online in advance and quite a few smaller ones do too.\n\nFor example, the Eden Project offers a 10 per cent discount when you book a day in advance, Legoland Windsor currently has an offer where you can book four tickets for \u00a399 on certain days, compared with \u00a347-\u00a360 normally, and Chester Zoo discounts by \u00a34 per person if you book a week in advance.\n\nQuite a lot of the best deals do require you to book in advance for the best discount so some advance planning can save you a packet.\n\nPay less with a playdate\n\nYou may feel under pressure to drop work and take the kids on a series of exciting and expensive days out but don\u2019t.\n\nAll children and teens really need to have a good half-term break is time out of their normal routines and some fun.\n\nOne of the cheapest ways to do that is with a series of playdates (just don\u2019t call it a playdate if you have teenagers). It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to fill a day with fun and break up the cabin fever a bit without spending loads of money.\n\nBest of all, their parents will either be willing to invite your offspring around or they will feel like they have to anyway, giving you some essential child-free time to put your home back together.\n\nEmbrace the inset day\n\nLook, we all know that inset days have only been added to the school calendar just to make it more likely you\u2019ll forget and show up at a closed school (yes, we know, in-service training day, staff skill development, we know).\n\nBut they are also a chance to get really good value out of a day out. If you are spending money taking the munchkins to a theme park or somewhere with a hefty ticket price then you want to be absolutely sure you get the most for your money.\n\nAnd the way to do that is to take them out on an inset day. If it\u2019s not a holiday for other schools then that can mean far fewer families are on days out \u2013 giving you a better chance of shorter queues and an easier day.", "description": "It feels like just days since the kids finally went back to school after the lo-ho-ong summer holidays but another school break is screeching towards us.
