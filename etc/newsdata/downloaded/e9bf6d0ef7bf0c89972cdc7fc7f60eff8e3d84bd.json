The unemployment rate is 5.5% versus 5.7% expected and 5.7% last. Average hourly wages (YoY) for September also increased 4.3% over August\u2019s number vs 3.8% expected. This is a breath of fresh air for the Canadian economy, which released weaker inflation data and weaker retail sales data late last month.\n\nThe Bank of Canada now has their hands full. The BoC will have their next policy meeting on Oct. 30 (which happens to be the same date as the next FOMC policy meeting) where they will release their projections for the economy as well. At the last meeting, BoC chairman Stephen Poloz stated that \u201cthe current degree of monetary policy stimulus remains appropriate.\u201d Will this still be true?\n\nA rise in employment and earnings, combined with weaker retail sales and lower inflation will make this a tough decision for Poloz and company (note that we will see inflation data one more time before the Oct. 30 meeting).\n\nLet\u2019s quickly remind ourselves of where we are on the weekly chart in . We have been in a long-term symmetrical triangle and are currently coiling at the apex. A breakout through either trendline could provide direction over the long term.\n\nOn a 240-minute chart, price failed numerous times to stay above 1.3350, and upon release of today\u2019s employment data, spiked lower through and upward sloping trendline going back to Sept. 10. For the moment, is holding previous lows near 1.3200. Next support zone is between 1.3150 and 1.3130, prior lows from mid-September.\n\nHowever, on a daily chart, we get a better picture of the horizontal support and the rising weekly trendline near that 1.3130/50 level. If price breaks through these levels, can push much lower towards the 1.2000/1.2300 levels over the lower term.\n\nResistance comes in above at the break of the trendline near 1.3240 and above that near prior lows (which now act as resistance) near 1.3270.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Joe Perry covering: USD/CAD.
