I'm feeling good for today\u2019s training,\" were the encouraging words from Jantjies on Wednesday.\n\nWith just one full season of Super Rugby and 8 Tests to his name, Jantjies' rise to the top has been meteoric and he now finds himself on the biggest stage of them all.\n\nJantjies knows that his composure will be tested.\n\n\"Japan play a fast brand of rugby, and it\u2019s important for us not to lose our cool, and keep sticking to what we do best,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can nullify their pace, and it can turn out to be a good day for us.\"\n\nThe Boks will enter the match as overwhelming favourites, but the Japanese public will be fully behind their side at Tokyo Stadium in what is sure to be an electric environment.\n\n\"It\u2019s a tough one \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can ever prepare for it, because it\u2019s going to be packed,\" Jantjies said of Japan's home advantage.\n\n\"It will be important for us to stay in the moment and not let that get to any of us.\n\n\"The difficult thing will be to communicate on the field, but I\u2019m sure we will find something to fix that.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 12:15 (SA time) and the Boks will name their side on Thursday", "description": "Springbok scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies knows the importance of keeping his cool in Sunday's World Cup quarter-final against Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9386/a9ad7cec613f47b1a7530163ae9005f5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
