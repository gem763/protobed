That\u2019s only because hardly anyone had heard about it before Snowden\u2019s publisher, Macmillan, announced in August that it would go on sale in 20 countries on September 17, Constitution Day. To keep the project covert, even from Snowden\u2019s many hard-core admirers, publishers had reportedly used code names in their internal documents, and at least one of his literary assistants traveled to visit him under a cover story.\n\nThe memoir is far from the first major project to showcase Snowden\u2019s life and work. Since fleeing the United States in 2013, he has collaborated on Glenn Green\u00adwald\u2019s tell-all book No Place to Hide. Snowden was also the subject of Laura Poitras\u2019s documentary Citizenfour, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt played him as a moody antihero in Oliver Stone\u2019s 2016 big-screen docudrama, simply titled Snowden. Yet this book stands apart, not merely because of its author, but also because of its guiding hands. Permanent Record isn\u2019t just an internet-age manifesto or a screed about government overreach. It\u2019s a bildungsroman crafted with the expert aid of a novelist.\n\nDespite Macmillan\u2019s black op to keep the book under wraps, over the past year, New York literary circles have buzzed with the news that novelist (and a contributor to The New Republic) Joshua Cohen had signed on as the famed whistle-blower\u2019s literary interlocutor, traveling to Russia over the course of eight months to help Snowden, now 36, organize and improve his narrative. As book gossip goes, it all seemed a bit amusing; to cover his tracks, Cohen took to telling friends that he was ghostwriting a memoir for Elizabeth Warren. Cohen confirmed those rumors\u2014over an encrypted phone app\u2014to The New Republic in August, not that anyone expected his participation to be much of a secret after publication: Snowden thanks Cohen in the book\u2019s acknowledgments.\n\nEnlisting a noted fiction writer to tell his life story might strike casual observers as odd, but Snowden and Cohen are both obsessed with the ways in which tech has transformed self and society. Cohen, who has published eleven books since 2005, has elicited comparisons to David Foster Wallace, Philip Roth, and Thomas Pynchon, expansive, digressive writers who, much like Snowden himself, have enjoyed praise, weathered backlashes, and garnered cult followings. Both Cohen\u2019s and Snowden\u2019s gregariousness can shade into garrulousness; their writing and speech teem with grandiosity and introspection, a combination that appeals to their admirers and grates on their critics. (Cohen\u2019s best-known work, Book of Numbers, follows an author named Joshua Cohen who has been hired to write the memoir of a Silicon Valley CEO who is also named Joshua Cohen.)", "description": "How a fiction writer transformed the NSA whistleblower into a tragic hero", "authors": ["Adam Weinstein"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/06ca33fb67dae9d8619c0133a6eed6ec5e78998c.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
