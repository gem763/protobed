We're the first major economy to pass laws to end the UK's contribution to global warming.\n\n\"Since 1990 the UK has reduced its emissions by over 40% while growing the economy by over two thirds.\"\n\nThe UK government said it had cut greenhouse gas emissions by 16 million tonnes in the last eight years.\n\nSecretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said: \"The UK government is showing great leadership on this vital issue - becoming the first major economy to pass new laws to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @RSPBScotland An exciting announcement for Scotland as we welcome confirmation that Glasgow has been chosen as the host city for a crucial international climate summit. This is an unmissable opportunity to make commitments to tackle the nature and climate crises https://t.co/NhjvTJggd0 #COP26 pic.twitter.com/6dXfx9Dwob \u2014 RSPB Scotland (@RSPBScotland) September 10, 2019 Report\n\nThe conference has been described as the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.\n\nLasting for two weeks, it would be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, with up to 200 world leaders expected to attend for the final weekend.\n\n2020's conference is seen as a major crossroads in the battle against global climate change. It will likely be held just after the next US presidential election.\n\nIt will also be the year in which governments are due to review their promises to cut carbon emissions in line with the latest science.\n\nCampaigners have said the event will give the UK the chance to set the tone for the world's future.\n\nClimate campaigner Greta Thunberg appeared at the 2018 conference in Poland.\n\nIt is expected to pose major security challenges for the Scottish government and police.\n\nSources have told BBC Scotland that police will seek additional funding from the Scottish and UK governments.\n\nDeputy chief constable Malcolm Graham said: \"Police Scotland has an enviable reputation for successfully and safely policing major events.\n\n\"We will now start the detailed process of planning, with partners, for what will be a complex and expensive policing operation to support COP26 and to ensure a safe and secure event.\"\n\nAnalysis by BBC News Science Editor David Shukman\n\nIntense, overcrowded and bewildering - a few impressions from UN climate conferences I've reported from over the years.\n\nThey're a rare chance for the world to get together to tackle climate change but because the stakes are high the atmosphere is always tense.\n\nThe negotiations are complicated - with long arguments over phrases or even individual words. They regularly drag through the night leaving delegates exhausted.\n\nIn Montreal back in 2005, at dawn on the final day, the then British environment secretary Margaret Beckett wept with relief when a deal was reached.\n\nIn Copenhagen in 2009, some environmental campaigners were so frustrated with the lack of progress that they walked out - while at the same time other campaigners, who had staged a march outside the conference centre, battled with police in an effort to get inside.\n\nThe gathering in Paris in 2015 was one of the smoothest, clever French diplomacy navigating towards a landmark deal, what's called the Paris Agreement.\n\nA system of voluntary cuts in carbon emissions, it formally comes into effect next year. The Whitehall view is that this is an extraordinary opportunity.\n\nBut it also means there's a huge responsibility now on British shoulders.", "description": "Up to 200 world leaders are expected to attend the COP26 at the Scottish Event Campus in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C7A0/production/_108740115_getty_sign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
