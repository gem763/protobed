It will start at $66,400 when sales begin early in 2020. Mark Phelan, Detroit Free Press Auto Critic\n\nWho says convertibles are dead?\n\nNot General Motors.\n\nThe automaker on late Wednesday revealed the first retractable hardtop in the history of its beloved Corvette sports car.\n\nThe 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray convertible debuted, promising what should be the quietest and most comfortable interior since the first convertible \u2018Vette debuted in 1953.\n\nPrices for the radically new convertible will start at $66,400, a $7,500 bump from the base coupe, when sales begin early in 2020.\n\nChevy started from a clean sheet of paper developing the '20 'Vette, which is the eighth generation of the vehicle. Other innovations in both the Corvette coupe and convertible include moving the engine from the nose to just behind the passenger cabin to allow ever more powerful versions of America\u2019s greatest sports car.\n\nRoof opens at up to 30 mph\n\nThe two-piece power hardtop can be opened and closed at speeds up to 30 mph in just 16 seconds.\n\nThe top stows under a body-colored panel above the engine, between the passenger compartment and the rear wheels.\n\nThat\u2019s called a mid-engined layout. Exotic sports cars like Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches use it because putting the engine\u2019s weight directly above the rear wheels allows the car to send more power to those wheels before they break loose and spin. The result: better acceleration and more usable power. The mid-engined platform also lends itself to good handling compared to often nose-heavy front-engine cars.\n\nSix electric motors open and close the top, an arrangement Chevy says is more precise than the hydraulic and hand-operated mechanisms past 'Vettes used. Stowing the roof does not reduce space in the 'Vette\u2019s rear trunk, which Chevy says can accommodate two golf bags. A second small trunk in the nose can hold an airline-spec carry-on and a laptop bag.\n\nDroptops in crisis?: Convertibles aren't quite dead yet as models hang on\n\nGoodbye, manual transmission: Redesigned C8 Corvette Stingray ditches stick shift\n\nPeekaboo engine, twin nacelles\n\nUnlike the Corvette coupe, which has a glass viewing plate over its engine, the convertible\u2019s 6.2-liter, 8-cylinder engine is not visible. GM went to great lengths to make sure the engine still gets enough air to keep it cool when the roof is stowed on top of it.\n\nThe roof is body-colored plastic, but an optional metallic black finish called Carbon Flash is available for the roof and the two \u201cnacelles\u201d that slope down from behind the occupants\u2019 heads to the rear deck.\n\nThe power rear window slides down into the Corvette\u2019s body for open-air driving, but can be raised to reduce wind noise and buffeting. It can be opened when the top is on or off. The Corvette coupe\u2019s rear window does not open.\n\nChevrolet introduced its Corvette Stingray convertible in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019.

It\u2019s the first dual clutch in Corvette history, and Chevy promises lightning fast shifts for better performance than a human-shifted manual could provide. Diehards will be able to override the electronic controls with paddle shifters, however.\n\nChevy says engineers tweaked the Corvette\u2019s chassis and used new springs and dampers \u201cto provide nearly the same performance as the coupe.\u201d There\u2019s no word yet on what the difference will be, but a rear spoiler borrowed from the Z51 performance package creates aerodynamic downforce to keep the car firmly planted on the road at high speeds.\n\nGM builds the Corvette in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Production of right-hand-drive models for sale in countries such as Australia and Ireland is planned at a later date.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray convertible features twin nacelles behind the seats that recall the design of classic Corvette research vehicles and race cars of the 1950s and '60s.
