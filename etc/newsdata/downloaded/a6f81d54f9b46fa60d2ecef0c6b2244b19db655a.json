(AP) - The Vegas Golden Knights got a measure of revenge five months removed from a controversial playoff loss that ended their season.\n\nTomas Nosek scored two goals and had an assist, Marc-Andre Fleury made 34 saves and Vegas beat the San Jose Sharks 5-1 on Friday night.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t erase what happened last spring, but we had all summer to think about (it),\u201d said Fleury, whose team blew a three-goal lead midway through the third period of a 5-4 Game 7 overtime loss in the first round of the NHL playoffs earlier this year.\n\nThe Sharks trailed 3-0 in that game when Cody Eakin was assessed a five-minute major on Joe Pavelski, who signed with Dallas in the offseason.\n\nThe Golden Knights swept the season-opening, home-and-home series with the Sharks and improved to 7-1-2 all-time against San Jose in the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good rivalry,\u201d Golden Knights coach Gerald Gallant said. \u201cWe battled hard and we came out on top for the first two.\u201d\n\nNosek and Brayden McNabb scored in a 90-second span late in the second period to break open a 2-0 game.\n\nVegas took an early lead on a goal by William Carrier at 5:01 of the first period.\n\nVegas extended its lead early in the second period when Shea Theodore intercepted an errant pass from Sharks defenseman Brent Burns and fired a shot that Jonathan Marchessault redirected to make it 2-0.\n\nMcNabb scored a short-handed goal with just under five minutes left in the second period, and Nosek scored 88 seconds later to make it 4-0.\n\nNosek added a short-handed goal midway through the third period.\n\n\u201cIt feels pretty good,\u201d Nosek said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a three-point game in the NHL, so I\u2019m happy that we win and I\u2019m happy for the three points.\u201d\n\nVegas had multiple short-handed goals for the first time in franchise history.\n\nBarclay Goodrow scored late in the third period for San Jose, which fell to 12-14-2 in home openers and has lost three straight home openers.\n\nSharks goalie Martin Jones had 19 saves and gave up four goals in two periods. He was replaced at the start of the third period by Aaron Dell, who had five saves.\n\n\u201cWe drew a very good team, maybe the best team in the West right out of the gate, and they showed us how it\u2019s supposed to look and we\u2019ve got some work to do,\u201d Sharks coach Peter DeBoer said.\n\nThe Golden Knights have three short-handed goals in two games. They had just 11 all of last season.\n\nThe Sharks were 0 for 5 on power plays, and haven\u2019t scored in 10 power plays through two games.\n\n\u201cI think right now, for me, the power play is gonna be the least of my worries,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to get four lines out there who can put pressure on the other team.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Golden Knights D Nate Schmidt is week to week with a lower body injury he suffered in Wednesday\u2019s season opener. \u2026 C Cody Eakin is day to day with an upper body injury. \u2026 G Fleury played his 800th game. \u2026 Nicolas Hague made his NHL debut. \u2026 Fleury needs one shutout to move into a tie for 20th on the all-time list with 57. He would tie Clint Benedict, who played from 1917 to 1930 with the Ottawa Senators and Montreal Maroons. \u2026 Sharks D Erik Karlsson was back in the lineup after missing Wednesday\u2019s season opener against Vegas for personal reasons. \u2026 F Kevin Labanc was in the lineup after taking a cross-check in the third period on Wednesday that knocked him out of the game. \u2026 F Evander Kane served the second of a three-game suspension issued on Tuesday. \u2026 D Jacob Middleton was recalled from the San Jose Barracuda. \u2026 The Sharks have lost 11 of their last 14 regular-season games going back to last season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSharks: At Anaheim on Saturday night.\n\nGolden Knights: Host Boston on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Vegas Golden Knights got a measure of revenge five months removed from a controversial playoff loss that ended their season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gideon Rubin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/golden_knights_sharks_hockey_37771_c0-147-3513-2195_s1770x1032.jpg?d8368546a6786f5d85109d9366fe94548babccde", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
