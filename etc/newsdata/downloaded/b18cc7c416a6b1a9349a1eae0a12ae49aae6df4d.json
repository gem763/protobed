But Democrats say they want to see the records from inside the department, particularly as the Judiciary Committee weighs the prospect of impeachment.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"The Framers did not envision the use of the presidential pardon power to encourage criminal acts at the president\u2019s direction,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement. \"As the committee continues its investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment, it is imperative that we are able to obtain information about ongoing presidential misconduct and abuses of power.\"\n\nNadler said his panel will also hold hearings in the coming months related to the issue of pardons as it continues its sweeping investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuses of power by the president.\n\nThe New York Democrat added that the \u201ctroubling pattern of obstruction of justice would represent a continuation of the misconduct identified in the Mueller report.\u201d\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller highlighted instances where Trump or his attorneys suggested he might pardon his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, in an effort to keep them from cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nHouse Democrats have also previously demanded information on Trump\u2019s alleged pardon-dangling to immigration officials.\n\nThe president reportedly told acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan in April that he would pardon him if he broke the law to deny migrants the ability to petition for asylum.\n\nLast week, The Washington Post reported that when aides have told Trump some of his orders to build a border wall violated environmental or eminent domain rules, the president encouraged them to move forward and indicated they would receive a pardon.\n\nThe subpoena, issued to McAleenan, requires a response by Sept. 17 at 10 a.m.\n\nDemocrats want documents related to meetings between Trump and DHS officials that took place on March 21 and April 5 where pardons reportedly were discussed. The subpoena also requires documents and communications referring to presidential pardons for potential violations of immigration law or the border wall.\n\n", "description": "Trump reportedly promised to pardon aides who broke the law while carrying out his immigration agenda.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/75/b97fcb3d4dd9a66ee50a5a5f9b8f/1994-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg"}
