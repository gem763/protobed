The sentences were cut to eight months on appeal.\n\nThe operation was led by Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell, a policeman who fled to Britain from Rhodesia in 1965, who was also the key prosecution witness. He was jailed in 1980 for mailbag theft.\n\nThe appeal brought by two members of the Oval Four will focus on the officer's 'integrity', and will be heard at the Court of Appeal in London in 2020.\n\nDetective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell, a policeman who fled to Britain from Rhodesia in 1965, joined the Met but was later jailed for mailbag theft\n\nMr Trew, now 69 and a lecturer in sociology, says he is 'absolutely delighted' about the news, saying his life was 'shattered' 47 years ago.\n\nHe said: 'My wife left me, I lost my confidence, I was a shell of the person I was before. The police did something wrong, so I'm going to fight the injustice.'\n\nGeorge Griffiths and Constantine 'Omar' Boucher have not been traced after leaving prison and are believed to be in the West Indies.\n\nRidgewell made a career from confronting groups of black men on the Tube and accusing them of stealing or pickpocketing - if they resisted arrest they would also be arrested for assault.\n\nBut his ploy backfired when he tried the same trick on a pair of Jesuit students from Oxford University, who became known as the Tottenham Court Road Two - their trial was stopped by Judge Gwyn Morris who told them: 'I find it terrible that here in London people using public transport should be pounced upon by police officers without a word.'\n\nRidgewell was given a backroom role investigating theft of Royal Mail bags where he plotted with criminals he knew to steal postal items - he was caught and jailed for seven years.\n\nAged 37 he suffered a heart attack in Ford Prison and died, days after admitting for the first time he was guilty and telling the jail's governor: 'I just went bent'.\n\nThe case against the Oval Four was based entirely on Ridgewell's evidence and the case at the Court of Appeal next year will focus on his 'integrity'\n\nAfter his release from jail in the 1970s Winston Trew made a complaint to the police and continued to protest his innocence but made no headway.\n\nHe wrote about his experience in book called Black for a Cause\u2026Not Just Because\u2026 which he published in 2010.\n\nThree years later Mr Trew took legal advice about the possibility of contesting his conviction but took no further action.\n\nIt was only when the Criminal Cases Review Commission contacted Mr Trew during the course of its own investigation into the case of Stephen Simmons, that he launched an appeal.\n\nMr Simmons had been arrested by DS Ridgewell in 1975 and convicted of mailbag theft on the basis of Ridgewell's evidence.\n\nThe Commission investigated Mr Simmons' case and referred it to the Court of Appeal where, in January 2018, his conviction was quashed, largely because of the misconduct of DS Ridgewell and his bogus evidence.\n\nSimmons, now 63, told The Guardian: 'That man Ridgewell ruined three lives for no reason and I am sure many, many more and if this can help someone else who was also arrested by him then at least something will have been achieved.'\n\nHow Dorking businessman convicted of stealing mailbags aged 19 cleared his name 40 years later after Googling corrupt police officer who framed him\n\nStephen Simmons with his wife Sue (right) and daughter Claire outside the Royal Courts of Justice\n\nA business man found guilty of stealing mailbags in the 1970s had his name cleared 40 years later by leading judges.\n\nBusinessman Stephen Simmons, 62, was present in court in London last year when the Court of Appeal overturned his theft convictions.\n\nHe has always protested his innocence, but his case did not reach court until after he Googled his arresting officer and discovered he was guilty of a similar crime.\n\nIn 2013 Mr Simmons, from Dorking, Surrey, called a legal phone-in on LBC Radio to ask for advice and was told to try Googling his arresting officer.\n\nWhen he searched for Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell he was shocked to discover the officer had been jailed for a similar offence just two years after his own conviction, and died in prison in 1982.\n\nHis case was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body which investigates possible miscarriages of justice.\n\nLord Chief Justice Lord Burnett announced: 'We would wish only to note our regret that it has taken so long for this injustice to be remedied.'\n\nSergeant Derek Ridgewell, pictured, died in prison in 1982 after being jailed for a similar offence to Stephen Simmons\n\nMr Simmons was sent to Borstal at the age of 20 in 1976 after his convictions in relation to the theft of mail from a train at Clapham Goods Yard in London\n\nAsked if he was relieved following the ruling, Mr Simmons replied: 'I can't tell you how relieved.\n\n'It has only taken 43 years, but I have got there at last.'\n\nMr Simmons was sent to Borstal at the age of 20 in 1976 after his convictions in relation to the theft of mail from a train at Clapham Goods Yard in London.\n\nHe said that winning his appeal was 'one of the best feelings I've ever had in my life'.", "description": "Winston Trew (pictured) and Sterling Christie were part of a group of friends who became known as the Oval Four after being jailed in controversial circumstances for muggings on the Tube.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19680136-0-image-a-2_1571040401913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
