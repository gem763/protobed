When Meyer served the diners a $92 bill, the man left her a $100 tip.\n\nMeyer was not available for comment, however the Catena sisters tell Yahoo Lifestyle that she got teary-eyed.\n\n\"He had left me a $100 tip, so I turned around, I said 'Sir, I think you made a mistake,\u2019\u201d Meyer told Fox 8. \u201cAnd he said 'No, I didn't make a mistake. You were wonderful, this place is wonderful, I'd like you to have a good night', and I got a little choked up.\u201d\n\nBefore they exited, the man decided to order a $30 bottle of wine to bring back to his hotel room. But his next gesture baffled all the employees.\n\nAn Ohio waitress was left a tip for $1,070 dollars on a $122 meal.

I just showed him the receipt and he said, 'I know, I want you to have a good night, turn around and go back inside, I'm happy to do it.' And I said, 'Who are you?' and he just shook his head and said, 'Have a good night.\u2019\u201d\n\nFran and Rina tell Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cWe have no idea who this man is, but we are so touched by this. Especially for Sam \u2014 we practically raised her.\u201d\n\nThe owners also told Fox 8 of the customer, \u201cHe's our angel, he was an angel for us and for Sam.\u201d\n\nMeyer plans to split the earnings with her coworkers. \"You have no idea. I was walking up to that table all night, thinking, 'I have so much that I have to pay in the next week\u2019 and it was like some sort of miracle when he tipped that at that time,\u201d she told Fox 8. \u201cGod works in mysterious ways, you know.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The Ohio waitress got teary-eyed when the customer left her a huge tip.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lbWJHEEbfNzgdbHrLRWH7Q--~B/aD0xNTY4O3c9Mjg0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/88c70da0-f841-11e9-afd7-2d7f314c5c51", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
