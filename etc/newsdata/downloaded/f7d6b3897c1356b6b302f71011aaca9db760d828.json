The same people who pushed the appalling lie that brightly colored plastic crap from China is going to make us happy. That company is now lecturing normal Americans, the very Americans that they have hurt, how immoral they are for daring to protect themselves with firearms,\u201d Carlson said during his monologue on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: MASS SHOOTINGS SHOULD BE A WAKE-UP CALL. INSTEAD WE GET MEDIOCRITIES LIKE BETO AND WARREN\n\n\u201cThe same people who pushed the appalling lie that brightly colored plastic crap from China is going to make us happy. That company is now lecturing normal Americans ... for daring to protect themselves with firearms.\u201d \u2014 Tucker Carlson\n\n\n\nWalmart announced Tuesday it would stop selling handgun ammunition as well as short-barrel rifle ammunition, such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber bullets used in military style weapons, after it runs out of its current inventory. The company, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., also asked customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores, even in states where laws allow it.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd everyone in Washington, New York and Los Angeles is applauding them,\u201d Carson said. He pointed out that though Walmart operates primarily in rural America, it\u2019s difficult to gauge how rural Americans feel about the store\u2019s decision to limit ammunition sales due to a lack of polling data.\n\nLiberal network news hosts on MSNBC and CNN, meanwhile, are praising Walmart for being \u201cmore enlightened than government is,\u201d Carlson said. He called this \u201ca fascinating turnaround\u201d because for years, \u201cWalmart was the target of coordinated attacks from the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cProgressives used to attack the company for destroying small town America and for exploiting workers,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWalmart hired PR consultants and union busters to push back for years, but the company never really changed the way it does business. And, yet somehow the left has mostly stopped attacking them.\u201d\n\nCarlson explained that as liberals got richer, they traded economic issues for identity issues.\n\n\u201cWalmart meanwhile realized it could buy immunity from criticism from the left by mouthing left-wing pieties. That\u2019s all it takes really. Sounding woke and they\u2019ll leave you alone,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWalmart ... realized it could buy immunity from criticism from the left by mouthing left-wing pieties. That\u2019s all it takes really. Sounding woke and they\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d \u2014 Tucker Carlson\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon called on Congress to ban many semi-automatic rifles as well to seize firearms from some Americans. The company is owned by the Walton family who are worth more than $150 billion. According to Carlson, Walmart cares only about money -- not the issue of gun control -- and got rich by \u201cselling foreign goods to domestic consumers -- cheap Chinese garbage manufactured off shore in factories that pay slave wages, wages that American manufacturers could never match.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added that the majority of Walmart employees work part time because, \u201cif Walmart keeps employees hours low enough, it can avoid paying them benefits. Meanwhile, the federal government \u2014you, taxpayers -- will subsidize their low wages with welfare benefits. In other words, 'You are working, so the Walton family won\u2019t have to pay their employees enough to live,'\u201d Carlson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about it,\" he said, \"because Walmart is now pushing gun control.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News host\u00a0Tucker Carlson ripped into Walmart\u00a0on Wednesday after it chose\u00a0to discontinue sales of certain gun ammunition, accusing the world\u2019s largest retailer of siding with urban liberals in the gun debate while simultaneously destroying the economies of small town American towns where the company mostly operates.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "Tucker Carlson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/TUCKER-CARLSON-WALMART.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
