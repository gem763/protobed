Mr. Bullard\u2019s dissent differed from the other two, however, as the leaders of the Boston and Kansas City Fed preferred to see no action taken. Those officials have believed the economy\u2019s general good health doesn\u2019t call for lower rates, and they would prefer to wait until tangible evidence of a slowdown arrives before taking action.\n\nThe triple dissent was the first since the September 2016 FOMC. All three dissents this week were expected. The Boston and Kansas City Fed leaders dissented against the July rate cut, while Mr. Bullard dissented in June when the Fed held rates steady.\n\nMr. Bullard said risks of an economic slowdown are growing, and he noted the Fed\u2019s target-rate range, which now stands at between 1.75% and 2%, is higher than other major nations. Mr. Bullard also said a bigger rate cut now would help speed a return to 2% inflation.\n\nMr. Bullard said that while his vote went against the consensus, he remains confident that his colleagues \u201cwill continue to monitor economic developments and respond accordingly as economic circumstances dictate.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets continue to expect an additional rate cut this year, although Fed officials have provided little guidance thus far on that outlook, in a time of considerable uncertainty and unpredictable events.\n\nThe wave of dissents seen at this week\u2019s Fed meeting are emblematic of the challenge Fed officials face right now in charting the right course for monetary policy.", "description": "St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard said the central bank should have lowered rates by more than it did to further ensure the economy can navigate a climate of rising risk.", "authors": ["Michael S.
