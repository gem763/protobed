I bathed her and her body still moved.\n\nJust before Mrs Sopajorn's body was about to be loaded into the incinerator, Mr Sopajorn (pictured) noticed that she was gently breathing and that her eyelids were flickering\n\n'Then during the funeral, I was the last person to touch her before the cremation. I wished for her to live a happy next life and then I saw her eyes start to move.\n\n'I am so glad that I was right about her being alive. I gave her a hug and called my children, but they thought I had a hallucination.\n\n'However, they had to believe me as my daughter-in-law who is a doctor checked and confirmed that she was alive, but her pulse was very weak.'\n\nThe doctor called the paramedics and they performed CPR on the grandmother. She was breathing and had a pulse but was not responsive or able to talk.\n\nMr Sopajorn said: 'I am so glad that I was right about her being alive. I gave her a hug and called my children, but they thought I had a hallucination'\n\nThe family are currently nursing her at home while they monitor her condition, though she is not expected to pull through.\n\nMr Sopajorn added: 'My wife's condition is severe and I don't think she can ever be cured. But she was still alive and it was not her time to die.\n\n'If she was cremated while she was still alive this would be very bad. How could we allow that? It would be the wrong thing to happen.\n\n'I am very thankful that I noticed my wife was still alive. We will continue caring for her until she has passed away.'", "description": "Phinij Sopajorn had been taken to a local temple in Thailand for a funeral and was kept in a cold coffin for three days.
