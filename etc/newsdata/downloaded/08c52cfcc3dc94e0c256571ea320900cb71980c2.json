Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump\u2019s insults of Pelosi during a \u201cnasty diatribe\u201d prompted Democratic leaders to leave.\n\nA Democratic source familiar with the discussion said the president erupted after Schumer quoted Trump\u2019s former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who said Sunday on NBC that if the U.S. doesn\u2019t keep up pressure, Islamic State \u201cwill resurge.\u201d\n\nTrump then called Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and gave himself, not the former Marine Corps general, credit for defeating Islamic State, according to the person, who asked for anonymity to give details about the conversation.\n\nSchumer confirmed Trump\u2019s comment regarding Mattis during an interview with MSNBC Thursday, but added that the \u201cgreatest insult\u201d that came during the meeting was the Trump administration\u2019s lack of an adequate policy to contain ISIS. After Democrats pressed for details on who will guard overseas camps that hold detainees, the administration said Turkey and Syria will guard the camps, Schumer said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement Wednesday that Trump \u201cwas measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi\u2019s decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising. She had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues.\u201d\n\nThe meeting blow-up punctuated a tumultuous day in Washington that began with Trump defending his decision to leave Syria and expose U.S. Kurdish allies to Turkey\u2019s forces, triggering a harsh back-and-forth between Trump and one of his usual defenders. Then came the emergence of a breezy letter from Trump to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning him \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nAs Trump recounted it at an event Wednesday evening, \u201cIt was a wild day.\u201d\n\nHe has been trying to contain the damage from what even his supporters in Congress say may be his biggest foreign policy crisis. The White House meeting, which included the leaders of both parties in the House and Senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees, was supposed to be part of that.\n\nRepublicans faulted Pelosi and Schumer for walking out of the meeting, accusing them of acting for political reasons.\n\n\u201cShe storms out of another meeting trying to make it unproductive,\u201d said House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. \u201cUnfortunately the speaker tries to make everything political.\u201d\n\nHe said the meeting did get heated on both sides. While he didn\u2019t dispute Schumer\u2019s characterization of Trump insults directed at Pelosi, he called the speaker\u2019s behavior \u201cjust unbecoming.\u201d\n\nAlthough several of the Democrats remained behind after Pelosi and Schumer left, there was little chance of anything being accomplished. And Trump continued to taunt Pelosi hours after it ended, including during a time he was supposed to be at an event honoring the Italian Republic with visiting Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nHe continued into the night, with a series of tweets attacking Pelosi.\n\nTrump is facing sharp criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum for his sudden move last week to allow Turkey to proceed with a military operation in northern Syria and pull American forces from the area. The withdrawal left exposed Kurdish fighters who had fought for several years alongside American troops against Islamic State and are now under attack from the Turkish military.\n\nThe House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution rebuking Trump for that decision.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest allies in the Senate also denounced the action. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the president\u2019s decision an \u201cutter national security disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted the U.S. shouldn\u2019t get involved in any conflict between Turkey and Syria, dismissing the region as \u201ca lot of sand.\u201d\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers fighting other people\u2019s wars,\u201d Trump said.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A White House meeting between Donald Trump and congressional leaders to contain fallout from the Syria crisis broke down abruptly Wednesday, with the president hurling insults at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who accused him of having a \u201cmeltdown.\u201dPelosi said Trump appeared to be \u201cshaken", "authors": ["Erik Wasson", "Steven T.
