warden jailed for life for murdering elderly university lecturer", "language": "en", "text": "Benjamin Field was jailed for at least 36 years for the murder of Peter Farquhar (Picture: PA)\n\nA sadistic church warden who murdered his elderly lover to inherit his house and money following a campaign of cruel manipulation has been jailed for at least 36 years.\n\nBenjamin Field, 28, seduced lonely university lecturer Peter Farquhar, 69, persuading him to write him into his will before poisoning him.\n\nHe then set his sights on another elderly neighbour, 83-year-old Ann Moore-Martin, luring her into a sexual relationship in a similar attempt to inherit her home.\n\nField \u2018gaslighted\u2019 Ms Moore-Martin, a deeply religious former headteacher, by writing messages on her mirrors purporting to be from God.\n\nJailing Field for life at Oxford Crown Court, Mr Justice Sweeney said: \u2018It has been an extraordinary case, perhaps which if written as a novel you could not believe it was true, but it was.\u2019\n\nField killed the lecturer so he could inherit his house and money (Picture: PA)\n\nHe poisoned Mr Farquhar in the hope his death woul;d like like suicide or an accident (Picture: PA)\n\nMr Farquhar, who was torn about his sexuality because of his religion, died in October 2015 while Miss Moore-Martin died in May 2017 from natural causes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nField secretly gave Mr Farquhar drugs and spiked his whisky, hoping that his eventual death at his hands would look like suicide or an accident.\n\nIt was only when the Baptist minister\u2019s son began targeting Ms Moore-Martin, in the village of Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire, that his wicked scheme began to unravel.\n\nMr Justice Sweeney said Field \u2018clearly enjoyed the cruelty\u2019 of brainwashing Mr Farquhar, best illustrated during one incident where he surreptitiously drugged the author ahead of the launch of one of his books, resulting in his \u2018complete humiliation\u2019.\n\n\u2018Your purpose in drugging him, and in what you said to those who endeavoured to treat him when, in consequence of the drugs, he was ill, was to lay the ground so that your murder of him in due course would appear to have been him having drunk himself to death whilst alone,\u2019 the judge added.\n\nField went to Mr Farquhar\u2019s home on Sunday October 25 and covertly gave him Dalmane while getting him to drink strong whiskey.\n\n\u2018I have no doubt that, if it was necessary, you then finished him off by suffocating him in a way that left no trace,\u2019 the judge said.\n\nHis plan initially worked, with Field inheriting \u00a320,000 along with a further \u00a3142,000 from his share of the proceeds of the lecturer\u2019s house before turning his attention to Ms Moore-Martin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly \u2018lonely\u2019 by the time they met, Field \u2018set about seducing her too\u2019 in a drive to inherit her \u00a3300,000 home.\n\n\u2018Before you murdered Peter Farquhar, you were delivering cards to her, giving her gifts, researching sex with the elderly on the internet, and suggesting that she watch a film that portrayed a relationship between an older woman and a younger man,\u2019 said Mr Justice Sweeney.\n\n\u2018Ultimately, in November 2015, a month after the murder, you began a sexual relationship with her.\u2019\n\nMr Farquhar was a university lecturer and author (Picture: PA)\n\nThe judge said he was satisfied that Field, if necessary, \u2018then finished him off by suffocating him in a way that left no trace\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nBy mid-September of the following year, Field began daubing messages on her mirrors, persuading her they were from God and that he was receiving them too.\n\nMs Moore-Martin eventually changed her will in early February 2017 before changing it back when Field\u2019s dishonesty was exposed and an investigation launched.\n\nShe died from natural causes later that year.\n\nDefending, David Jeremy QC cited a letter penned by Field\u2019s parents, Beverley and Baptist minister Ian, in which they described how their \u2018intelligent\u2019 and \u2018educated\u2019 son was capable of compassionate behaviour.\n\n\u2018He chose to apply those gifts towards the manipulation and humiliation of his victims, leading to the murder of Peter Farquhar, the degradation of Ann Moore-Martin and the causing of irreparable harms to the victims, their families and those who are close to them,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The real motive was to make himself feel good about himself by deceiving and debasing others by being the only one who knew what he was doing, by gaining pleasure, not by sharing as other do, but by creating a world that only he inhabited, in which he was both performer and audience \u2013 the world of interiority.\n\n\u2018It would be far too simplistic to present this case as a conflict between good and evil.\n\n\u2018It was a combination of circumstances that led him into a downward spiral of behaviour in which he progressively lost touch with any sense of decency or morality.\u2019\n\nHe added of the victims: \u2018They shared the wish to believe that they could be loved and desired by a much younger man and that wish in them was so strong that they suspended their disbelief.\u2019\n\nA message written by Field to Ms Moore-Martin reading \u2018All that you give him he will return tenfold\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nAnother read \u2018Your intentions are holy, your work\u2019s not yet done, take care and complete the task given to you by the Lord\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Your soul will proceed directly to heaven, her soul to joy, his to perfection. This good you will can never be undone, peace is your is in me, your Lord. Amen\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nMr Justice Sweeney said Field \u2018lived by deception and deceit\u2019 and had been a \u2018well-practised and able liar\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You further admitted how you could manipulate and manoeuvre people, however sceptical they may have been, to achieve your ends without ever asking them to do so directly,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018You were, you accepted, a snake talker, as you were able to build pressure on your victims to believe what you needed them the believe and then to do whatever you needed them to do.\n\n\u2018The evidence at trial clearly demonstrated grandiosity, a sense of superiority towards others, the exploitation of others to achieve personal gain, the need to belittle and humiliate others, fixation on fantasies of power and success, intelligence, a need for admiration from others, and a sense of entitlement together with an unwillingness to empathise with the feelings, needs and wishes of others.\u2019\n\nField, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, previously pleaded guilty to defrauding Ms Moore-Martin of \u00a34,000 to buy a car and \u00a327,000 for a dialysis machine.\n\nHe also admitted two burglaries and the two fraudulent relationships.\n\nThe jury cleared him of conspiracy to murder Miss Moore-Martin and the alternative charge of attempted murder. He was also found not guilty of possession of an article for the use in fraud.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
