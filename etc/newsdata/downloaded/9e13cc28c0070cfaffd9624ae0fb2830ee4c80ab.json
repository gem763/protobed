That's about 90,000 more customers affected than previously predicted.\n\nThe entire communities of Healdsburg and Windsor were ordered to evacuate ahead of severe winds that could lead to erratic fire behaviour near the blaze burning in wine country.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said it is expected to be the biggest evacuation in the county in more than 25 years.\n\nFirefighters hose down a burning house during the Tick Fire in Agua Dulce near Santa Clarita, Cali., Friday.

Cal Fire said the firefighter deployed a fire shelter, which shielded them. After the flames passed, all three were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nTwo previous power shutdowns were done amid concern that gusty winds could disrupt or knock down power lines and spark devastating wildfires.\n\nWeather forecasts called for strong winds to lash much of the region over the weekend, with some gusts hitting 137 km/h. It might be a record wind event, the National Weather Service warned.\n\nPG&E's warning came as firefighters battled flames in Northern and Southern California.\n\nA home burns at a vineyard during the Kincade fire near Geyserville, Cali., on Thursday.

The death is under investigation.\n\nThe blaze is 25 per cent contained and authorities have lifted nearly all evacuation orders. Some 50,000 people were forced to flee at the fire's height.\n\nTo the north, firefighters raced to make progress against a blaze near Geyserville in Sonoma County before ferocious diablo winds returned. The fire had burned 49 buildings, including 21 homes, and swept through nearly 104 square kilometres of the wine-growing region. It was 10 per cent contained by Saturday morning.\n\nSeveral thousand people living in small communities in neighbouring Lake County were warned to be ready to evacuate if an order is given. The area was the scene of a 2015 wildfire that killed four people and burned nearly 2,000 homes and other buildings.\n\nA wildfire approaches a residential subdivision Thursday in Santa Clarita.

We do not want to become one of those sources.\"\n\nThe possible link between the wine country fire and a PG&E transmission line contained grim parallels to a catastrophic fire last year that tore through the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying thousands of homes in the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.\n\nState officials concluded that fire was sparked by a PG&E transmission line.\n\nAsherah Davidown, 17, of Magalia and her family lost their house, two dogs and a car in the Paradise fire. She said her family was preparing for another power outage by filling the gas tank of their car and buying non-perishable foods and batteries for their flashlights.\n\nThe outages reminded her of her family's vulnerable position as they struggle to get back on their feet.\n\n\"My house doesn't have a generator so that means another weekend of sitting in the dark with no Wi-Fi, no food in the fridge and shopping in increments since we don't know how long the power may be out,\" Davidown said.\n\n\"For the most part, a lot of people feel really helpless. Their livelihoods are at the fingertips of a corporation,\" she said. \"There's still a lot of hurt and emotional recovery. Having our basic needs repeatedly taken away is really unfortunate.\"\n\nWatch: See aerial views of the California wildfires.", "description": "New evacuations were ordered Saturday for at least 50,000 people near a huge wildfire and millions of Californians will have their power cut again as the state's largest utility said it would shut off electricity because of looming strong winds and high fire danger.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336969.1572117543!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177955411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
