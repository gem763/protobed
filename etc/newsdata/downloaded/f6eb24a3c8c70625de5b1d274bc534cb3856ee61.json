However, in the face of growing evidence from experts in the field and internationally, Grahame\u2019s suggestions may act as the final push needed to implement the harm reduction method.\n\nOr, y\u2019know, Berejiklian & Co. will continue to push the mantra that the best defence against drug deaths is not taking drugs in the first place \u2013 something that has literally been trotted out for decades, and has literally no evidence of decreasing harm.\n\nThe NSW inquest into deaths at music festivals heard from medical staff, police, and experts about the deaths of six young Australian festival goers at various festivals.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the inquest that has shined a spotlight on the harm reduction methods of NSW\u2019s police and government: Greens MLC David Shoebridge has campaigned heavily against strip searches, asserting that they occur far too often.\n\nA study published by the Redfern Legal Centre in August showed strip searches in the state had increased from 277 between December 2005 and November 2006 to 5483 in 2017/18.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the figures were wrong, claiming it was only better record keeping that had resulted in an increase in documentation.\n\n\u201cIf the police say these figures are wrong it has taken them 12 years to get around to mentioning it,\u201d Shoebridge told Pedestrian.TV.\n\nIn March, just about every major medical health body in the country backed pill testing. The Australian Medical Association formally threw their hat in the ring, \u201cstrongly\u201d supporting pill testing trials that are medically supervised.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1096388846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
