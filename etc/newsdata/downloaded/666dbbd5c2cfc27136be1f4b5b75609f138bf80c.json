In October 2005, Arsenal's Thierry Henry and Robert Pires attempted a similar feat, only to find themselves red-faced as Pires failed to lay the ball off correctly for his fellow countryman.\n\nThe Shakhtar goal was scored by Georgy Sudakov and the match finished in a 2-2 draw. The 'tandem' penalty routine has been successfully carried out by other players too. Lionel Messi passed to Luis Su\u00e1rez, who scored for Barcelona in 2016; Johan Cruyff and Jesper Olsen made the routine famous by exchanging passes after a penalty for Ajax in 1982; and Belgium\u2019s Rik Coppens and Andre Piters pulled off the ruse against Iceland in 1957.", "description": "In October 2005, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires attempted a similar feat, only to find themselves red-faced", "authors": ["Source", "Fcsd.Tv"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e5f408cafc47b65f49ed81d527489ed3ec1d88/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13816ef7b54af3f86278601a73d7b7b2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
