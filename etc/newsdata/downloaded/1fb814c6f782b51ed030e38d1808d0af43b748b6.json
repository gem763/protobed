REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\nThe blue-chip and wider STOXX 600 pan-European indexes sank almost 3% on Wednesday after the World Trade Organization approved 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus (AIR.PA) planes and 25% duties on goods ranging from French wine to Scotch whisky.\n\nAfter the initial shock of the decision, however, read as threatening a new transatlantic trade war, many analysts said that the detailed list of products affected showed the actual economic impact of the tariffs should be minimal.\n\nShares of Airbus, down 2% on Wednesday, jumped 4.5% in early trade, as the list - published after European markets closed on Wednesday - showed it had exempted some Airbus parts.\n\nLuxury brands including French spirits maker Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (LVMH.PA) were also excluded and the euro zone blue-chip index .STOXX50E gained 0.4%.\n\n\u201cThe reaction this morning is just muted because you had two big days of selloff,\u201d said Claudia Panseri, a strategist at UBS.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, the total amount (of the tariffs) at this stage is very small. I don\u2019t think there will be retaliation. U.S.-China trade (tensions) definitely has more of an impact.\u201d\n\nThe broader pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.1% higher, with the food & beverage sector .SX3P leading gains with a 0.9% rise.\n\nGrowth worries continue to dog markets. Data on Thursday showed euro zone business growth stalled in September, suggesting that a contraction in manufacturing activity was increasingly spilling over to the services industry.\n\nA prolonged tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing and worsening outlook for a quarterly earnings season that is just getting underway has hurt European sentiment after a bullish September.\n\nTed Baker Plc (TED.L) plunged 35% after the British fashion retailer reported a first-half pretax loss and warned of the worst business conditions for retailers in 30 years.\n\nH&M (HMb.ST) shares, however, jumped 7.0% after the world\u2019s second-biggest fashion retailer reported its first quarterly rise in pretax profit in over two years. That helped the retail index .SXRP gain 0.3%.\n\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange will remain shut on Thursday for the Day of German Unity public holiday.", "description": "European shares steadied on Thursday after logging their worst day since last December on the slapping of U.S. tariffs on a raft of European exports, with a bounce for Airbus and luxury goods makers pushing main indexes back into the black.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436549532&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920FF"}
