And like many young Sadoans she dreamed of leaving the island to explore the world. While she was able to make her dream come true, spending her 20s in a high-flying career that took her all the way to Hollywood, a family illness reminded her of the importance of family and carrying on tradition.\n\nFrom Sado to the world\n\nRumiko says that she was inspired by Kaoru Kanetaka, a popular travel reporter during her childhood. She dreamed of becoming a journalist and seeing the world for herself. This way, she could share of other countries and cultures with audiences back in Japan. She moved to Tokyo to study political science at Keio University, but then found another way of sharing different worlds with audiences by entering the movie industry with Nippon Herald Films.\n\nFor years she lived the high-paced life of a publicist, promoting new movies every three months, meeting actors and directors, traveling to Los Angeles for business, and making the most of big city life in Tokyo.\n\nReturning to the roots of Sado\n\nRumiko says that at the time she had no plans to take over the family business.
