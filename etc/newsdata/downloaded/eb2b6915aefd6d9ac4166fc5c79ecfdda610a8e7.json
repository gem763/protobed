Located 21 kilometres from Edinburgh as the crow flies over the River Forth, the abbey\u2019s ancient vibe encourages the broody contemplation so suited to Romanesque architecture.\n\nOne of Scotland\u2019s most important cultural sites, Dunfermline Abbey was founded in 1128 by King David I of Scotland \u2013 two years before he established Edinburgh as an early royal \u201cburgh\u201d (city or town).\n\nSome of Scotland\u2019s greatest medieval monarchs were laid to rest at the Romanesque Dunfermline Abbey, which dates back to 1128. Visit Scotland\n\nWe arrive at the abbey aboard our trusty shuttle bus as the last of the thick morning fog is being splayed by a determined mid-morning sun. Wandering around the eerie, ruined refectory on a cool summer\u2019s morning, surrounded by lush Pittencrieff Park and its birdsong, is a pitch-perfect Scottish travel moment.\n\nThere are plenty of headline tombstones too, with some big names in history buried here: Saint Margaret of Scotland, laid to rest in 1093; King David I, in 1153; Robert the Bruce in 1329, although sans his heart, which was interred in the Gothic Melrose Abbey 71 kilometres to the south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom religion to industry as experienced through bricks and mortar \u2013 a mere 10-minute walk down the road is the cramped weaver\u2019s cottage where Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie spent his childhood before the family moved to the United States in 1848, when Carnegie was 13.\n\nThe cottage is chalk and cheese to the abbey, but Carnegie dreamed big. Through his interests in steel, he became one of the richest Americans in history \u2013 then gave away more than $US350 million, conservatively estimated to be worth closer to $US65 billion ($96 billion) in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nOur small Seabourn Ovation tour group is guided through his parents\u2019 house, learning how Carnegie never forgot that the owner of nearby Pittencrieff Estate refused to allow locals to roam the beautiful woodland grounds.\n\nCovering 30 hectares, Pittencrief Park surrounds Dunfermline Abbey. Visit Scotland\n\nIn 1902, aged 67, Carnegie purchased Pittencrief from Colonel James Maitland Hunt, and handed it over to the people of Dunfermline, for everyone to enjoy. The park stretches across 30 hectares with three playgrounds, an orchard and peacocks. It brings to life one of Carnegie\u2019s most popular quotes: \u201cThere is little success where there is little laughter.\u201d\n\nA 20-minute bus ride down the road delivers our group to an entirely different architectural masterpiece, in the form of Culross: Scotland\u2019s best example of an intact burgh dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nTelevision box-set aficionados will recognise Culross from Outlander seasons 1, 2 and 4, and the Biscuit Cafe atop the Culross Pottery and Gallery provides a pleasant spot to survey this fascinating little village, population: 395 souls.\n\nThe white-harled houses have the rough-cast finish of this region, consisting of a mix of lime and aggregate, finished with bright-red tiled roofs. Steep, cobbled streets run from the market cross in the middle of town, up to the hilltop abbey.\n\nYellow-walled Culross Palace overlooks the Firth of Forth. Visit Scotland\n\nIn the centre of town sits Culross Palace, a distinctive yellow-coloured villa built in the 16th century by coal baron George Bruce and featuring a reconstructed original garden roamed by rare Scots Dumpy hens, known for their extremely short legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCulross is counted as among the most picturesque villages in Scotland, but our next stop, Inverness, is the cultural capital of the highlands. It\u2019s a lovely spot, but the day is all drizzle. Most of the ship\u2019s passengers are off on Loch Ness monster-themed tours, given this is where the River Ness meets the Moray Firth.\n\n\"Bright fishing trawlers appear over-optimistic sitting way out here\": Lerwick in the Shetlands is Scotland's most northerly and easterly town. Visit Scotland\n\nI stick to my theme, ticking off the 19th-century Inverness Cathedral, the Victorian Gothic-style Town House, Leakey\u2019s Bookshop (housed in a Gaelic church dating to 1793) and Inverness Castle. Then I wander the banks of the River Ness, admiring the stately homes along the river and the West Highland Terriers tearing around their yards.\n\nPushing ever north, by the time we reach Scrabster Harbour, three kilometres from Thurso, our eyes are adjusting to the landscape, both natural and built. The further north you go, the smaller the houses get, until they seem almost tucked into the landscape, slung low and neat.\n\nOur now semi-official \u201cSeabourn Ovation amateur Scottish architecture society\u201d gathers in Thurso to catch the local Number 80 bus out to John O\u2019Groats via a stop-off at the late Queen Mother\u2019s glorious Castle of Mey, parts of which date back to the mid-1500s, and which she bought in 1952.\n\nJohn O\u2019Groats is the northernmost village of the UK mainland, and is named after Jan de Groot, a Dutchman who held the first ferry contract between this village and the Orkney Islands.\n\nVirtually the only attraction at John O\u2019Groats (once named Scotland\u2019s most dismal town) is the signpost pointing to Lands End, the westernmost (and almost southernmost) point of the UK mainland, in Cornwall. But the bus ride, with its spectacular coastal scenery, is well worth the trip there.\n\nBy the time we arrive at Lerwick \u2013 the main town of the Shetland Islands, with a population of 7000 \u2013 the landscape is so desolate that the small settlement and bright fishing trawlers appear over-optimistic sitting way out here, \u201cthe full stop at the end of Britain\u201d.\n\nShetland ponies roam the hills on Foula, Shetland. Visit Scotland\n\nEverything that lasts up here is built for cold and wind, be it houses, animals or people. During a morning tour of Carol\u2019s Shetland Ponies (highly recommended), Carol informs us the native ponies stand between only 70 and 107 centimetres tall because \u201cit\u2019s much better to have short legs on these islands, especially when you get a winter hurricane. There\u2019s always a breeze, so you want to stay close to the ground.\u201d Well that also explains those dumpy hens and Westies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter an afternoon tour of mournful Scalloway Castle \u2013 an important tower house and gathering spot dating to the 1600s \u2013 we board Ovation. The group is feeling extremely grateful not only for a warm bed tonight, but also the early evening Scottish oysters with caviar and champagne to which we\u2019ve grown hopelessly accustomed.\n\nThe writer was a guest of Seabourn.\n\nAt a glance\n\nThe ship Seabourn Ovation debuted in May 2018. It accommodates 600 passengers in 300 suites with a crew-to-passenger ratio of almost 1:1.\n\nItinerary Try the 28-day British Isles & Northern Gems cruise from August 29, 2020. A verandah suite is priced from $19,499 per person.\n\nPack Smart casual with a couple of elegant evening options, including suit or black tie for him and cocktail dress or gown for her.\n\nThe 68-page bumper Grand Journeys issue of Sophisticated Traveller is out on Friday, October 18 inside The Australian Financial Review.
