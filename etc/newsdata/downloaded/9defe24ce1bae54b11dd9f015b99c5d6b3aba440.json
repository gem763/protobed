AFP/Getty Images 2/24 Ederson - 8.5/10 Staked his claim to be the Premier League\u2019s best goalkeeper with an impressive second season. Distribution always highlighted, but does the basics of goalkeeping brilliantly too. Getty 3/24 Aro Muric - 7/10 Stepped into Ederson\u2019s shoes for the majority of the victorious EFL Cup campaign and proved to be an able deputy. Getty 4/24 Kyle Walker - 6/10 Not as impressive as last season and, being almost 29-years-old, he is at risk of competition from a fresher, younger model next season. Getty 5/24 Danilo - 6/10 Dependable when called upon, the full-back\u2019s ability to play on either side of defence is also a useful attribute. Getty 6/24 Aymeric Laporte - 9.5/10 Superb. A near ever-present who fits the profile of a Guardiola centre-half perfectly and was adept at filling in a left-back if required. Even scored a number of important goals. Getty 7/24 Vincent Kompany - 8/10 A fine farewell from the club captain. What better note to end 11 years of service on than that goal against Leicester? Impressed during the run-in too. Getty 8/24 John Stones - 6/10 Began the campaign as Laporte\u2019s first-choice partner, yet slipped down the pecking order and was not even in the squad for the Old Trafford derby. Getty 9/24 Nicolas Otamendi - 6/10 Did well last year but lost his regular starting place this season, playing just no more than four consecutive league games. Could return to Spain in the summer. Getty 10/24 Benjamin Mendy - 4/10 A second season spoiled by injury, but whereas Mendy had credit in the bank this time last year, disciplinary issues and questions over his attitude mean he is out of favour. Getty 11/24 Oleksandr Zinchenko - 8/10 Deserves immense credit for stepping in at left-back in Mendy\u2019s absence and rarely letting City down. Guardiola is delighted with the Ukrainian\u2019s dedication. Getty 12/24 Fabian Delph - 5/10 After filling in at left-back so well last season, seemed to lose Guardiola\u2019s trust this year. Seemed to make a costly mistake on the rare occasions he was given an opportunity. Getty 13/24 Fernandinho - 8.5/10 Older than Kompany and deployed in a more demanding role but still consistently excellent. Missed while injured over difficult December. Performance in win over Liverpool a highlight. Getty 14/24 Ilkay Gundogan - 8/10 Easily underappreciated but chipped in with several excellent performances during the title run-in.

Getty 20/24 Raheem Sterling - 9/10 A shining light on and off the pitch, Sterling built on the massive strides he made last season. With Guardiola\u2019s help, he has become one of the deadliest in front of goal in Europe. Getty 21/24 Riyad Mahrez - 6/10 A difficult first year at the club for City\u2019s record signing. The Anfield penalty miss could have proved costly but a goal at Brighton on the final day made up for it. Getty 22/24 Sergio Aguero - 9/10 32 goals in all competitions tells it all. Aguero may now be the wrong side of 30 but he is also more attuned to what Guardiola wants than ever before. Getty 23/24 Gabriel Jesus - 5/10 Previously a rival to Aguero for a starting spot, he is now most certainly an understudy. Difficulties settling down in Manchester may have contributed to patchy form. Getty 24/24 Pep Guardiola - 9/10 Emerged out from a difficult Christmas period to win 14 striaght league matches and win the title. 198 points over two seasons is extraordinary.

EPA\n\nGuardiola defended his player once again on Friday, reiterating his belief that the images were \u201csimilar\u201d.\n\n\u201cRegarding Bernardo I was incredibly clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they believe, if the people believe, that Bernardo is this type of player they are completely wrong. They judged one joke, I judge three years every single day with him and how he is and his friendship. Nothing more to add.\n\n\u201cWe judge intentions and I know the intention of Bernardo... It was just a joke. Benjamin is like a brother to Bernardo. And Bernardo is like a brother to Benjamin. It is the same, it was what I see every day in training.\n\n\u201cIf someone is affected or feels bad about that tweet or any comments, so it can happen. People judging Bernardo don\u2019t know him. He is an exceptional person. Exceptional. He likes to be involved in different situations.\n\n\u201cFocus on other issues, not Bernardo because is not absolutely guilty because his intention.. It was incredible\u2026 it was just a joke. It\u2019s a cartoon and the face is quite similar. The same happened a thousand million times with white people. It\u2019s the same.\n\n\u201cSometimes you feel and.. it was a cartoon. It was just a joke and that\u2019s all. But if the people in the FAI (FA) think it\u2019s the opposite then Bernardo and City are open to listen and to say an opinion. That is all.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is. It happened many times and you have to condemn. Fight for it. What happened in the stadiums just because you have more money or different skin colour, or where you were born, you feel better than the other one, that is ridiculous.\n\n\u201cI was born in Catalonia because my mum and dad were there. I have no influence over that. I speak for myself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m something special because of my colour of my position. I\u2019ve understood that for a long time.\n\n\u201cBernardo too, I spoke many times with him over three years with him, he is that type of person. Put the focus on other things, not Bernardo. It was a simple joke but if someone is offended I can understand it. Bernardo is maybe going to take a lesson and it\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201d\n\nBernardo has submitted a personal letter to the FA expressing regret at any unintentional offence his deleted tweet caused.\n\nMendy has also submitted a supporting statement saying he did not take offence from the tweet. The FA are set to reach a decision on the case in due course.", "description": "Pep Guardiola has doubled down on his belief that Bernardo Silva is an \u201cexceptional\u201d person and that his deleted tweet was \u201cjust a joke\u201d, though promised that it will not happen again.
