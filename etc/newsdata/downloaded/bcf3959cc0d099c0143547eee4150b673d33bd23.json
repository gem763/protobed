FOREX-Sterling on backfoot as political turmoil dogs Brexit process\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n* Sterling limps into Asian trading after big fall\n\n* Weak data knocks euro lower\n\n* Brexit vote could set tone for global financial markets\n\n\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Sterling wallowed near a more than\n\ntwo-year low on Tuesday on growing investor worries about a\n\n\"no-deal Brexit\" as rival British lawmakers fought for control\n\nover negotiations to leave the European Union.\n\nThe euro fell to the lowest in more than two years as weak\n\neconomic data from the EU underscored expectations for the\n\nEuropean Central Bank to ease monetary policy at a meeting next\n\nweek.\n\nThe yuan will come into focus during Asian trading after it\n\nslipped to a record low versus the dollar in offshore trade due\n\nto fading hopes for a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe pound is likely to remain under pressure ahead of a vote\n\nin Britain's parliament about Brexit later on Tuesday, the\n\noutcome of which could trigger an early election and Britain's\n\nexit from the EU without trading agreements.\n\nA messy exit from the EU is certain to weaken the pound, but\n\nit could roil other currencies as investors adjust their\n\npositions to exit trades in riskier assets.\n\n\"The pound is being sold all over the place, because the\n\npolitical risk has forced us to recognise that a no-deal Brexit\n\nis possible,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange\n\nstrategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\"At this point, I see no reason to stay long in sterling.\"\n\nSterling traded at $1.2063 GBP=D3 , flat so far in Asian\n\ntrading but close to the lowest in more than two years. The\n\npound tumbled 0.8% on Monday, its biggest decline in more than\n\nthree weeks.\n\nThe euro was flat at 90.91 pence EURGBP=D3 , holding onto a\n\n0.7% gain on Monday.\n\nA group of lawmakers will put forward a vote on Tuesday on\n\nwhether to seize control of the parliamentary agenda to try to\n\nforce a three-month delay to Britain's EU exit deadline of Oct.\n\n31. Johnson raised the stakes on Monday, however, effectively\n\nturning it into a confidence vote by making it clear that if the\n\ngovernment was defeated, it would hold a vote on Wednesday to\n\napprove an early election, most likely to be held on Oct. 14.\n\nSome politicians have warned that a no-deal Brexit should be\n\navoided at all costs, because leaving the EU without trading\n\nagreements in place could cause economic turmoil.\n\nElsewhere in currency markets, the dollar index =USD rose\n\n0.27% on Tuesday to 99.082, reflecting weakness in other major\n\ncurrencies. U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday for a\n\npublic holiday.\n\nIn the offshore market, the yuan CNH=D3 traded at 7.1940\n\nper dollar, close to its weakest since international trading in\n\nthe currency began in 2010.\n\nThe yuan weakened after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese\n\nand U.S. officials are struggling to agree a schedule for a\n\nround of trade negotiations that were expected this month.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in a bitter\n\ntrade dispute for more than a year, which is causing the global\n\neconomy to slow.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0954 in Asia on Tuesday, which is\n\nthe lowest since May 2017. The common currency fell 0.2% on\n\nMonday. Sentiment for the euro had already weakened after it\n\nbroke below the key $1.1000 level last week.\n\nThe euro weakened further after a survey on Monday showed\n\nEuropean manufacturing contracted for seven straight months.\n\nThe Australian dollar fetched $0.6712 AUD=34 , down 0.07%\n\nin early trade.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep its cash\n\nrate at a record low of 1% on Tuesday, though it will likely cut\n\nagain two more times to boost inflation and support a stuttering\n\neconomy, a Reuters poll showed.", "description": "FOREX-Sterling on backfoot as political turmoil dogs Brexit process", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7I0RU_L.jpg"}
