The English champion will face Shakhtar Donetsk, Dinamo Zagreb and Atalanta, which is making its debut in the competition.\n\nPep Guardiola is aiming to win the Champions League with Manchester City.

For Slavia Prague, it may prove nigh on impossible to qualify from the group.\n\nParis-Saint Germain and Real Madrid should provide two entertaining games in Group A, while the contests between Bayern Munich vs Tottenham in Group B are also likely to provide some drama.\n\nIn Group D, Juventus will renew acquaintance with Atletico Madrid, the team it defeated last year in the round of 16.\n\nAjax will be hoping for another good run in the competition this year after reaching the final four last time around. It's going to be tough for the Dutch side though after being grouped with Europa League winner Chelsea, Spanish side Valencia and French club Lille.", "description": "View the latest news and breaking news today for U.S., world, weather, entertainment, politics and health at CNN.com.", "authors": ["James Masters", "Matias Grez"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190601230117-clf-team-victory-super-tease.jpg"}
