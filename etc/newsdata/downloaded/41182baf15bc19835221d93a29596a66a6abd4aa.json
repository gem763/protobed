We had a long debate over whether to start Leigh in the first place and move Liam to the wing.\"\n\nSpringbok coach Rassie Erasmus brought S'Bu Nkosi in for Kolbe, one of the stand-out players of this World Cup.\n\n\"It's a big blow because everybody knows his quality and the contribution he makes,\" Erasmus said, also quick to point out that Nkosi was no slouch, with eight tries in 10 tests to his name.\n\nErasmus has transformed South Africa since taking over last year, turning around a terrible set of results and also naming the first black Springbok captain in Siya Kolisi.\n\n\"We've been under pressure in the last couple of years to redeem ourselves,\" he said, with the Boks having lost their pool opener in Japan to New Zealand before hammering Italy to advance as runners-up.\n\n\"We were number five, six, seven in the world since 2015 and had some proper hidings -- some people lost faith in us and we're trying to get that respect back. That's a different kind of pressure. People are starting to believe in us again as a team.\"\n\nBoth coaches predicted a kicking-heavy game based around forward domination, with Erasmus again naming a replacements' bench including six huge forwards and two backs.\n\nThat tactic worked well in the quarters as the South Africans effectively outmuscled hosts Japan for a comprehensive 26-3 win.\n\n\"Lately, we've struggled against Wales. They know what they are good at, and focus on that,\" Pollard said. \"They starve you of possession and territory, and enforce their kicking game on you.\n\n\"They take away your set piece. It's not a game plan or rugby with a lot of flair in it, but it's suffocating. If you fall into that trap, they will enforce their game plan on you for 80 minutes, and you will probably not win that match.\"\n\nThe winners on Sunday face either defending champions New Zealand or England -- who play on Saturday -- in the final on Nov 2, also in Yokohama.\n\n\"We feel we have as good a chance as the other three teams,\" Erasmus said of South Africa, champions in 1995 and 2007.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Six Nations champions Wales will be out for revenge in their Rugby World Cup semifinal against Rugby Championship title-holders South Africa in Yokohama on Sunday.
