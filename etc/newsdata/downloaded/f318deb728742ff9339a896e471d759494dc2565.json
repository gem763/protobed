And they can apply for a Tesco Bank credit card with no foreign exchange fees.\n\nTesco said Clubcard Plus holders could save more than 400 pounds a year.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays said Clubcard Plus should theoretically appeal to many shoppers. \"In practice it's hard to judge the deterrent effect of the monthly fee, but early membership numbers from Casino's <CASP.PA> similar French scheme seem promising,\" they said.\n\nThey estimate Clubcard Plus could deliver a 2.5 percentage point sales boost, but said the impact on profit is harder to judge.\n\nTesco's biggest rival Sainsbury's recently overhauled its no-fee Nectar scheme, allowing shoppers to boost loyalty points by pre-selecting offers on certain products.\n\nClothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer <MKS.L> also plans to re-launch its underperforming Sparks program.\n\nDiscounters, which focus on low prices, regard loyalty programs as a costly waste of time and have used their advertising to lampoon previous schemes as over-complicated.\n\nBut the Barclays analysts said the fact that mainstream grocers have re-committed to their schemes, despite paring back unproductive costs in other areas in recent years, suggests they pay off through higher sales and valuable consumer data.\n\nEarlier this month Tesco said its CEO Dave Lewis will step down next summer after six years in the job.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by David Holmes)", "description": "Tesco  will next week become the first major British supermarket group to offer a subscription customer loyalty scheme, the latest weapon in its fight to stem the market share gains of German-owned discounters.
