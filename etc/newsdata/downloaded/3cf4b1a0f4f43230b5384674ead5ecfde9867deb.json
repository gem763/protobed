Our universities are good. But we are not good on TAFE. There is more than one version of the higher education song sheet.\"\n\nLifting their game\n\nThe current five categories of university, which most people hadn't heard of, should be reduced to two: Australian Universities and Overseas Universities in Australia.\n\nTo stay in their category, universities would have to achieve at least 30 per cent of their research at \"world-class\" level.\n\nThis would be difficult for at least four of 37 public universities.\n\nDr Coaldrake said the idea was not for any university to lose its status, but the weak ones would be encouraged to lift their activity to stay in the group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeparately, the large number of organisations that fall in the category Higher Education Provider would be divided into two: Institutes of Higher Education or National Institutes of Higher Education, which could be almost like universities.\n\nThat would give them the incentive to lift their performance and improve their offerings to students.\n\nDr Coaldrake agreed the title of his report, Review of the Higher Education Provider Category Standards, would not mean much to most people, but said it was all about giving a \"clear line of sight\" to school leavers.\n\n\"It's about reputation, performance, teaching standards, quality assurance for students. But the key is that parents and students see that there is more than one choice.\"\n\nReform was urgently needed to make the training sector more attractive, he said. Most job growth would be in non-university areas. For example, two out of three new jobs in the coming decade will be in the caring profession which relied on training.", "description": "A report has gone to government paving the way for change in higher education.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3041%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_298%2C$y_155/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/118ac9eebe064ede56b913e6215f718032988c21", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
