U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude fell 86 cents to $54.95.\n\n\u201cDoubts about OPEC+\u201d are weighing on prices, said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch, referring to the future of a supply-cutting pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other nations including Russia.\n\nBrent has gained 13% in 2019, supported by the OPEC+ deal, which for now calls for a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day until March. The producers meet on Dec. 5-6 to decide whether to extend or adjust the pact.\n\nWhile OPEC officials have said a deeper supply cut is an option, news agency TASS on Monday cited Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin as saying such talk was premature.\n\nLast week, Brent rose more than 4%, supported by a drop in U.S. inventories and signs of an easing in the U.S.-China trade dispute.
