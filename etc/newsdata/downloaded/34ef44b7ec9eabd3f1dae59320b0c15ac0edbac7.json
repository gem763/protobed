He specifically noted that \u2014 after the transition to PoS \u2014 higher cost of a potential attack would make Ethereum the safer network of the two.\n\nSome men just want to watch the blockchain burn\n\nButerin started his presentation by talking about Bitcoin and paying homage to its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, noting that he created crypto economics to motivate people to maintain the network.\n\nThe way the system was designed ensured that attackers would need to spend a great amount of money to successfully compromise the blockchain. Still, Buterin claimed that there was a problem with this architecture, explaining:\n\n\u201cWhat about attackers who have a really large, extra protocol incentive, or just want to watch the world burn? Could be a government. Or hackers that want to have some fun. The critique here says we\u2019re assuming we have these participants motivated by economic incentives. What if there are people who just want to break the thing regardless?\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s stake-based security\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s PoS implementation, users would lock their Ether in smart contracts to be allowed to validate new blocks, instead of investing great amounts of computing power \u2014 and electricity \u2014 as they do in PoW systems. If stakers (users who lock their coins) misbehave, their stake (the coins they locked) is slashed.\n\nThe more Ether staked, the higher are the probabilities that they would end up validating a block. Just like the more hashrate (computing power) a miner has, the higher the likelihood that he mines a block. In the PoS system envisioned by Buterin, there\u2019s a period of time after a validator creates a new block, during which this block can be challenged and potentially proven to contain illegitimate data.\n\nAttackers would risk losing large amounts of ETH\n\nIf sufficient proof is provided, the stake of the dishonest validator is slashed and the challenger is compensated. Buterin explained:\n\n\u201cThe challenger can submit a transaction that points to [the block in question]. That calculation runs on the blockchain. The blockchain\u2019s like, \u2018wait the actual answer is 256 and this guy submitted 250 so this guy\u2019s wrong.\u2019 The original guy\u2019s deposit is destroyed and part is given to the challenger.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, a successful attack on the network will need multiple malicious blocks to be validated, which in turn would require an enormous Ether stake that could be slashed if someone were to successfully challenge the transaction. This makes a potential attack more expensive to carry out and is an improvement over PoW, stated Buterin.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously, an Ethereum 2.0 PoS testnet beacon blockchain wet live on May 8.", "description": "After the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is implemented, Ethereum will be more costly to attack than Bitcoin, says Vitalik Buterin", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNThkYTk0OTNkNDQ2ZTJhNWQ4YTM5N2JkMmZmNWJmODcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
