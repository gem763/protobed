Whether it\u2019s glossy peach lips paired with glossy eyelids or just one of the two, it\u2019s easy to get this runway look.\n\n\u201cPeople think it\u2019s dramatic, but simply focusing on one feature shortens the amount of time you spend doing your make-up,\u201d says Tauber.\n\nThis is good news for those who don\u2019t love spending hours perfecting their pout. You can achieve this look by simply adding lip gloss or lip balm to whatever eyeshadow palette you normally use in your beauty regiment.\n\nThe folks at L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris and Maybelline New York agree. Shades of pinks and pastels will make their way from the runway to the streets with pops of electric pink on the lips, eyes and cheeks. They suggest dusting your eyelids with soft shades of pink eyeshadow for a playful yet boldly feminine look, or pair shades of coral eyeshadow with more muted shades of lipstick and blush for a soft, naturally flushed look.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlitter\n\nIt may seem jarring at first, but a glittery eyeliner may be what the beauty gods have in mind to elevate your look from bland to bold.\n\nTauber says: \u201cI\u2019ve had a lifelong love affair with glitter. As corny as it may seem, glitter embellishments go a long way towards gearing you up for the holiday season.\u201d\n\nMetallic and glittery eyeliner is a trend that many beauty brands have jumped on this season.\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighter hues\n\nInstead of applying highlighter the traditional way, switch things up by using holographic hues, heavy metal or pink tones.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al experts say that these \u201cshining shades shift colours in the light, so one minute your highlight may appear blue, but when the sun hits your face, it becomes purple. The best part is that this highlighter look can be worn subtly or as a statement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dark vampy lip\n\nWhen in doubt, instead of going red, go vampy. David Tlale\u2019s runway looks wowed the crowd with his enchanting use of deep eyeshadow. His models\u2019 eyelashes were topped with feathers to complement the pop of colour on the lips.\n\nThe streets can be your runway and you don\u2019t need to be a supermodel with a flawless face to pull it off. Although many will opt for the minimal dewy look this summer, beauty expert Raine Tauber encourages you to take more risks with your make-up.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkincare is self-care\n\nThe L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Maybelline teams emphasised the importance of staying hydrated and using sunscreen this summer.\n\n\u201cA really basic routine would be to cleanse, tone and moisturise twice a day, but a great routine would include the use of a serum packed with active ingredients to plump fine lines and wrinkles, or reduce the appearance of dull skin and dark marks, depending on your skin needs.\u201d\n\nThe experts went on to encourage exfoliation at least twice a week to remove the dead cells that make your skin look dull to brighten up the skin and add a glow. For those who do not have serum, adding a sheet mask at least once a week is a good alternative. Instead of harsh rubbing and rinsing, gently use micellar water to remove your make-up.\n\nLastly, be informed about the ingredients in the products you\u2019re purchasing. Hyaluronic acid, retinol, salicylic acid and vitamin C are some of the key ingredients that promote healthier, moisturised and suppler skin.", "description": "Fashion week has come and gone, but the glamour will live on.
