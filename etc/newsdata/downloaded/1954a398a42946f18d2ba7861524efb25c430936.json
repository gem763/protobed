Others dislike his threat to defy the law over Brexit. And some fear conflicts of interest in his personal life.\n\nBut for this woman, the mere mention of the Prime Minister's name was enough to send her flying into a grump.\n\nThe unknown woman was approached by Sky News in the Tory leader's own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\n\nInterviewer Sophy Ridge didn't even have the chance to finish her question before the woman scowled: \"Don't you ever mention that name in front of me, that filthy piece of toerag!\"\n\nAnd then she stomped off.\n\n(Image: SKY)\n\nAs is expected these days, the unknown woman was of course instantly hailed as a hero by some on social media.\n\nThe comedian and writer Mark Steel said: \"Oh someone give that lady a series on BBC1 and a Netflix special.\"\n\nJournalist Charles McLellan added: \"When you're expecting a typical gammony 'get it done' vox pop, and you get this. Brilliant.\"\n\nTwitter user \"ifartinbed\" declared: \"I imagine the Queen says exactly the same.\"\n\n(Image: SKY)\n\n(Image: SKY)\n\nTwitter user Gareth Thomas added: \"He\u2019s not even the whole toe-rag. Brilliant!\"\n\nOf course, it's not the first time the Prime Minister has inspired strong emotions among the public.\n\nLast month a man in Morley, Leeds, shook the Prime Minister's hand and politely asked him: \"Please leave my town.\" He replied: \"I will. Very soon.\"\n\nBoris Johnson was also confronted in Whipps Cross Hospital, north London, by furious dad Omar Salem who said his daughter had nearly died due to an understaffed NHS.\n\nBut it's still not a patch on the best political vox pop of all time, Brenda from Bristol - who was asked for her views on the 2017 snap election.\n\nTo be fair to the PM, it wasn't all bad for him on Sky News' trip to Uxbridge town centre.\n\nOne woman said he was the \"right person for the job\" in an \"impossible situation\".\n\nAnother voter said: \"I think he's doing alright. I voted for him last election and I'll probably do it again this year.\"\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nBut another voter said even her six-year-old has recognised the flaws of the PM. She told Sky News: \"I don't think much but I know what my daughter thinks - that he's a silly man.\"\n\nLeft-wing Labour campaign group Momentum have launched a local bid to oust the Prime Minister from his seat in any snap election.\n\nHe won a majority of just 5,034 in 2017, unusually small for a Prime Minister, after Labour's vote in Uxbridge and South Ruislip surged by nearly 14%.", "description": "The mystery woman spoke for one side of a divided nation as she scowled the PM is a \"filthy piece of toerag\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Sky", "Pa Wire Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20514450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bo-Jo-toerag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
