It\u2019s Impeachment Week here in Washington \u2014 which is like Shark Week, except that the sharks all work in and around federal buildings. They\u2019re primarily identifiable not by their fins but by the multiple security lanyards around their necks.\n\nThe Commentary\n\nWhile the sharks are circling the White House, it\u2019s possible that Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign may end up an incidental casualty. Biden\u2019s son Hunter may not have done anything wrong, but in politics, reality is comparatively unimportant; what matters is appearance. Whatever the underlying truth, it doesn\u2019t really look good when your family name keeps getting repeated in the same sentence as the word \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nWe can be sure President Trump will mention it just that way, over and over and over in the coming weeks. He\u2019ll be trying to paint himself as the good guy who was just trying to keep Democrats on the straight and narrow. Even before this story broke, Biden must have seen Elizabeth Warren coming up uncomfortably close on his heels. This could be the stumbling block that lets her overtake him.\n\nAlternatively, Democrats might decide to venerate Biden as St. Joseph of Ukrainegate, the first true martyr of the #Resistance. This seems, I confess, somewhat less likely than the first scenario, but it\u2019s certainly not impossible. Warren\u2019s presidential ambitions probably hang in the balance.\n\n\u201cBut what about \u2026 everyone else?\u201d I hear you cry. Aren\u2019t there going to be a dozen contenders on the Democratic debate stage in October?\n\nAt this point, the field of true possibles is down to no more than five. Yes, a sudden breakout performance is theoretically possible, but with the primaries just months away, I am reminded of the wise words of Adelaide, Nathan Detroit\u2019s long-suffering fiancee in \u201cGuys and Dolls,\u201d when told they would get married \u201csooner or later\u201d: \u201cIt is already too late to be sooner. And if it gets much later, soon it will be too late even to be later.\u201d\n\nFor most of the Democratic field, potentially including a knocked-down Biden, it\u2019s already later than they think.\n\n\u2014 Megan McArdle\n\nThe Ranking\n\nPosition Challenger Change Over Last Ranking 1. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 2. Joe Biden \u2014 3. Bernie Sanders \u2014 4. (TIE) Pete Buttigieg UP 1 4. (TIE) Kamala D. Harris \u2014 6. Cory Booker \u2014 7. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 8.

Marianne Williamson \u2014\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: Round 33 | The recipe for Warren\u2019s secret sauce\n\nFrom the Annotations\n\nI have finally come to grips with the fact that Warren is the rebooted version of John McCain 2008 \u2014 the back-from-the-dead-in-the-primaries candidate who just gritted it through. If Biden would recognize the inevitable and move aside (ditto Bernie), then we\u2019d have a pay-per-view show of her vs. Trump underway, but like NBA stars on long-term contracts after debilitating injuries, they just sit there absorbing cap space. Hugh Hewitt, on Elizabeth Warren\n\nHis aides and surrogates have been going after Warren on Twitter, much to the consternation of, well, her aides and surrogates. On the one hand, Sanders is running a campaign, so of course his team wants to go after a rival. On the other, the left coalition may need to unite at some point during the race, perhaps post-New Hampshire, if it\u2019s to have any hope of knocking Biden out.

Until then, if you\u2019re so inclined, light a votive for a little protection for Holy Joe.\n\nRead more on 2020:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Impeachment may scramble the Democratic primary\n\nKaren Tumulty: Impeachment will define the 2020 election\n\nDavid Von Drehle: Democrats seem set on destroying Biden\u2019s chances to beat Trump", "description": "Unless Democrats decide to venerate Biden as St. Joseph of Ukrainegate.", "authors": ["The Ranking Committee", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fBUldKaiPsGwzCgQc_A17oqHpzI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K4LZGNU2IFE5HIMP4EAWEZ2E6M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
