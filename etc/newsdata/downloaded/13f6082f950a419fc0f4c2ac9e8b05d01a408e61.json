(Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, in a harsh warning letter Monday, criticized Juul Labs for illegally marketing its e-cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes and ordered the company to correct the violations immediately or face tougher enforcement actions.\n\nThe agency said it acted after reviewing testimony from a recent investigation by a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee into Juul\u2019s marketing and promotion practices. The economic and consumer policy panel, in July hearings, accused Juul of \u201cdeploying a sophisticated program\u201d to target children and teenagers, including at schools and summer camps, as part of an effort to become the nation\u2019s largest seller of e-cigarettes.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s warning letter said the testimony showed that Juul marketed its vaping products as \u201cmodified risk tobacco products\u201d \u2014 meaning the company included claims that the products \u201cpresent a lower risk of tobacco-related disease or are less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products.\u201c\n\nUnder federal regulations, such \u201cmodified-risk claims\u201d must be authorized by the FDA. Juul\u2019s failure to get such authorization, the FDA said, means that the company sold and marketed \u201cadulterated\u201d products.\n\nThe FDA noted the testimony at the congressional hearing indicated that a Juul representative, speaking at a school, said Juul \u201cwas much safer than cigarettes\u201d and that the \u201cFDA would approve it any day.\u201d The panel\u2019s investigation \u2014 based on about 55,000 documents \u2014 was detailed in a hearing and a memo compiled by subcommittee staff members. Juul officials who testified said they had ended the school programs and that the company no longer sold many types of e-flavored cigarettes in retail stores.\n\nA Juul spokesman said the company \u201cwill fully cooperate\u201d with the FDA.\n\nThe FDA action comes as federal health authorities investigate five deaths from a mysterious lung illness tied to vaping. There are now 450 possible cases in 33 states and one territory, including five deaths, they said.\n\nAlthough officials said the definitive cause of the illnesses remains unknown, \u201cthe severity of the illness and the recent increase in the incidence of this clinical syndrome indicates that these cases represent a new or newly recognized and worrisome cluster of pulmonary disease related to vaping,\u201d according to a report by health officials in Wisconsin and Illinois. A large number of the victims seem to have used marijuana products, though a small number said they used nicotine vapes. Many of the samples contain vitamin E acetate that experts said could cause lung injury.\n\nThe FDA, in a second letter sent to Kevin Burns, Juul chief executive officer, on Monday, asked the company for documents and information about several marketing and outreach practices detailed in the July congressional hearing. It said that despite Juul\u2019s commitment to address the surge in youth use, the company\u2019s products continue to represent \u201ca significant proportion\u201d of the overall use of e-cigarette products by children. \u201cSome of this youth use appears to have been a direct result of JUUL\u2019s product design and promotional activities and outreach efforts,\u201d the FDA said.\n\nThe FDA is also raising questions about Juul\u2019s \u201cMake the Switch\u201d campaign, which the agency worries presents Juul as \u201ca safer alternative to cigarettes\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that the FDA has not authorized such a message.\n\nIn addition, the agency asked Juul to explain why it uses nicotine-salt e-liquids and a high concentration of nicotine in its Juul pods, which officials said could increase the products\u2019 addictiveness.\n\nThe agency wants answers to those questions within 30 days.\n\nThe FDA, in the letter to Burns, also said that in April 2018 it had asked the company for documents relating to marketing practices and research into marketing, effects of product design, public health impact and adverse experiences. But it said the company apparently provided Congress more documents than it gave the FDA.\n\nIn a statement, acting FDA commissioner Norman \u201cNed\u201d Sharpless said \u201ccompanies must demonstrate with scientific evidence that their specific product does in fact pose less risk or is less harmful\u201d than conventional cigarettes. \u201cJUUL has ignored the law, and very concerningly, has made some of these statements in school to our nation\u2019s youth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FDA on Monday gave the company 15 working days to respond to the warning letter, and demanded a description of corrective actions and a plan for maintaining compliance with the law. The inability to ensure compliance \u201cmay result in the FDA initiating further action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction,\u201d the agency said.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn the \u2018Juul room\u2019: E-cigarettes spawn a form of teen addiction that worries doctors, parents and schools\n\nMichigan becomes first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes\n\nAs vaping-related lung illnesses spike, investigators eye contaminants", "description": "Agency slams e-cigarette maker following House subcommittee investigation into the vaping giant.", "authors": ["Laurie Mcginley", "Reporter Covering Health", "September At Pm", "Laurie Mcginley Covers Health", "Medicine For The Washington Post.
