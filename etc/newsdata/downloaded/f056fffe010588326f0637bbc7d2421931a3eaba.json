Under questioning from Republicans during last Friday\u2019s impeachment inquiry interview with Atkinson, the inspector general revealed that the whistleblower\u2019s possible bias was not that he was simply a registered Democrat. It was that he had a significant tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates currently vying to challenge President Trump in next year\u2019s election. \u201cThe IG said [the whistleblower] worked or had some type of professional relationship with one of the Democratic candidates,\u201d said one person with knowledge of what was said\u2026 \u201cWhat [Atkinson] said was that the whistleblower self-disclosed that he was a registered Democrat and that he had a prior working relationship with a current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate,\u201d said a third person with knowledge of what was said.\n\nOne obvious possibility is that the unnamed Democratic presidential candidate is Joe Biden himself. If you think this matter is a clusterfark now, imagine if it turns out that the guy who complained to the IG about Trump trying to jumpstart an investigation of the Bidens once \u2026 worked for Biden. That\u2019s the most likely bet too, no? Biden spent decades in the Senate and eight years as VP, when he would have interacted with all sorts of intelligence personnel. There\u2019s no one in the Democratic field (at least the top tier) who\u2019s more likely to have had a \u201cprofessional connection\u201d to someone in the intel bureaucracy than Grandpa Joe.\n\nThere\u2019s a less obvious possibility but one with similarly interesting political consequences. What if the whistleblower worked with or for one of Biden\u2019s chief rivals, whether Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? A \u201cregistered Democrat\u201d (as the whistleblower reportedly is) would have a partisan reason to damage Trump no matter what, but offering Biden as the victim in a story about Trump leaning on a foreign government to investigate an opponent would risk creating sympathy for Joe among Democratic voters. Not an obvious move if you\u2019re a Warren or Sanders supporter.\n\nQuestion: Unless the unnamed candidate is one of the big three, in which case the question of bias sharpens up, does the whistleblower\u2019s relationship with someone in the field matter? It matters potentially, I think, if it turns out the whistleblower was working in a political role for that person, e.g., if they volunteered for Cory Booker\u2019s Senate campaign, say. That would suggest that they\u2019re not just a registered Democrat, they\u2019re passionate about politics. Passionate people are more prone to bias. But if it turns out the whistleblower was some sort of CIA liaison to Booker\u2019s Senate office or whatever, well, so what? What do we glean from that? Remember, for what it\u2019s worth, Atkinson says his investigation of the complaint confirmed that the allegations are credible. Being a member of the wrong party doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re necessarily lying.\n\nThere\u2019s other whistleblower news this afternoon. Hmmmm:\n\nA White House official who listened to President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader described it as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d and \u201ccompletely lacking in substance related to national security,\u201d according to a memo written by the whistle-blower at the center of the Ukraine scandal, a C.I.A. officer who spoke to the White House official. The White House official was \u201cvisibly shaken by what had transpired,\u201d the C.I.A. officer wrote in his memo, one day after Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a July 25 phone call to open investigations that would benefit him politically\u2026 \u201cThe official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official\u2019s view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own re-election bid in 2020,\u201d the C.I.A. officer wrote.\n\nIs it John Bolton? Please say it\u2019s John Bolton.\n\nA few obvious questions about this. One: Is the \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d White House official the same person who\u2019s now come forward as the second whistleblower? Whistleblower #2 is alleged to have firsthand knowledge of some of Trump\u2019s conduct towards Ukraine. Listening in on the call would fit the bill.\n\nTwo: How high up in the food chain is this person? Not just everyone gets to listen in on the president\u2019s calls, especially a call in which POTUS intended to lean on the president of Ukraine for help with investigating the Bidens.\n\nThree: Was there more to the call than what was relayed by the official White House quasi-transcript? Questions have been raised about the use of ellipses at key points in that document. Did Trump say something to \u201cfrighten\u201d this official that didn\u2019t make it into the transcript?\n\nFour: How many other White House officials, lawyers included, came to the conclusion that the president might have broken the law with what he said to Zelensky? A key Republican defense of Trump during an impeachment trial will be that, however shady his behavior may be, it simply doesn\u2019t amount to \u201chigh crime or misdemeanor\u201d \u2014 or even a crime of any kind. If there are people in the White House itself who know what was said and who disagree with that judgment, that\u2019s hugely helpful to Democrats. \u201cTrump did commit a crime,\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cJust ask his own advisors who were there.\u201d\n\nThis also helps show, though, why it doesn\u2019t matter *that* much who the whistleblower is. No one\u2019s removing Trump from office based on something some guy heard secondhand from someone else. The point of the Democratic investigation is to find out who this \u201cfrightened\u201d White House official is and convince that person to testify. Senate Republicans aren\u2019t ousting the president over hearsay but there\u2019s at least a hypothetical chance they\u2019d oust him if they heard from a primary witness who said, \u201cI was there, I heard the whole thing, and it was worse than you can imagine.\u201d", "description": "Plus: \"Visibly shaken\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/as-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
