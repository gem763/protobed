So did a separate survey that projects the next six months.\n\nThe so-called expectations index dropped to 95.8 from 106.4, the lowest reading since January.\n\nThose who said jobs are \u201cplentiful\u201d also fell to 44.8% from 50.3%.\n\nBig picture: The trade fight with China has contributed to a sharp slowdown in the global economy, the effects of which have spread to the U.S.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has tried to help by cutting interest rates, but business leaders say the uncertainly is unlikely to go away unless the U.S. and China strike a deal or tamp down tensions while they negotiate.\n\nWhat\u2019s kept the U.S. economy steaming ahead is robust household spending, aided by the strongest jobs market in decades. Consumer confidence is still quite high by historical standards, but it continues to erode the economy could be in trouble.\n\n\u201cWith business investment and trade both weighing on the economy, the importance of consumer spending at this juncture can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.\n\nWhat they are saying: \u201cThe escalation in trade and tariff tensions in late August appears to have rattled consumers,\u201d said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the board. \u201cWhile confidence could continue hovering around current levels for months to come, at some point this continued uncertainty will begin to diminish consumers\u2019 confidence in the expansion.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% and S&P 500 index SPX, +0.10% rose modestly in Tuesday trades and closed in on record highs.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.60% fell slightly to 1.68%. The yield has sunk from a seven-year high of 3.23% last October.", "description": "Escalating trade tensions with China undermined consumer confidence in September, underscoring the dangers of a conflict that has harmed key business sectors...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR941_consum_ZG_20190924095205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
