His Seven Seconds or Less Phoenix Suns teams of the past decade were groundbreaking, and perhaps even a bit before their time.\n\nNow in Houston with the Rockets, D\u2019antoni sees an opportunity for his team to move with even more Pace. Houston was the 26th team In terms of pace last season according to Basketball-Reference, but now they have Russell Westbrook and D\u2019Antoni says that that could be the spark plug that pushes them back into the land of pace.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nMike D\u2019Antoni on the Rockets\u2019 pace with Russell Westbrook: \u201cSix seconds or less, baby. We\u2019re working on it.\u201d Houston had 27 fast break points in the opener, matching their most in any game last season. \u2014 Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nHouston is already the number one team in terms of pace this year, and question about how Westbrook will fit with James Harden has not yet been answered. But it does make sense that the team could get out on the break more often: Westbrook is a monster in that regard, and Harden is one of the best passing guards in NBA history off of rebounds.\n\nDo the Rockets have a real chance of winning the championship? It\u2019s hard to say, but if they can run a quick pace, D\u2019Antoni could at least help Westbrook and Harden rewrite the narrative around each of their playing styles, and change their legacy for the better in the eyes of the public.", "description": "Houston was the 26th team In terms of pace last season.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XAf4xtDXnd_e2yIyXoaLHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j.SobLARHW1YcMbRwkX8CQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/9b595416c97a7b08a6cdc743b34c5be9", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
