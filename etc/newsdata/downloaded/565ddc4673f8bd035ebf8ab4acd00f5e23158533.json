But like other shows from Murphy, \"The Politician\" also has plenty of heart, especially after a tragic death shakes up Saint Sebastian's.\n\nTheo Germaine and Ben Platt on \"The Politician.\" Netflix\n\nWhy you should care: It's the newest show from Ryan Murphy, creator of 'Pose' and 'American Horror Story'\n\nMurphy is pretty prolific, even if he seems to have trouble writing second seasons, and \"The Politician\" is his latest show to hit streaming services. While it lacks the obvious horror of shows like \"Scream Queens\" or \"American Horror Story,\" Murphy's newest project, like others of his, features cutting humor, flawless costumes and scenery, and the occasional musical number.\n\nJessica Lange stars on \"The Politician.\" Netflix\n\nWhat's hot: The show's storyline and pacing are spot-on, and Ben Platt gives a sensitive but show-stopping performance as Payton\n\n\"The Politician\" is, first and foremost, a high school drama, but it also satirizes the American political system and tackles big issues like suicide and gun control. And although the show is largely plot-based, that doesn't mean the characters get left in the dust. Even minor plot points (although there aren't that many) are handled with just as much care and respect as major character developments.\n\nEach episode is carefully crafted to pack the maximum emotional punch, and the first episode alone is pretty tear-inducing. But the emotional curveballs the show throws don't ever feel gratuitous, due to the mostly-effective pacing and Platt's grounding performance.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow plays Ben Platt's mother on \"The Politician.\" Netflix\n\nPlatt shines as Payton, am ambitious but vulnerable high schooler who's focused on his dream school (Harvard) and his dream accomplishment (getting elected president), and won't let anyone get in his way.\n\nThe adopted child of an extremely wealthy family whose wealth is played for laughs in many scenes \u2014 including when Payton's mother (Gwyneth Paltrow) eats dinner opposite her husband at the other end of a miles-long dining table \u2014 Payton is the grounding force of the show, and Platt does an excellent job portraying his volatile journey to the high school's presidency, and subsequent downfall.\n\nRounding out the stellar cast are Jessica Lange, who plays a conniving grandmother of Platt's frail running mate Infinity (Zoey Deutch), and Lucy Boynton who plays the girlfriend of Payton's ex-lover who's out for revenge.\n\nBen Platt and Zoey Deutch play running mates on \"The Politician.\" Netflix\n\nWhat's not: A major plot point involving a character with Munchausen's by proxy seems a little unoriginal\n\nWithout revealing too much, one of the major plot points in the show's first season revolves around a character who appears to have Munchausen's by proxy, a mental illness that causes someone to lie about or cause symptoms in another person under their care to make them appear sick.\n\nThe development has serious ramifications for Payton's campaign, and is definitely an important part of the show.\n\nBut considering that two major shows from the last two years have also centered on a character with Munchausen's by proxy \u2014 Adora Crellin from HBO's \"Sharp Objects\" was poisoning her daughter Amma, and Dee Dee Blanchard, recently portrayed on Hulu's \"The Act,\" purposefully made her daughter Gypsy Rose appear ill \u2014 it feels a bit stale when \"The Politician\" tackles the condition.\n\nIt's possible that the script was written before (or while) these shows were available to watch, but overall, it felt a little unoriginal \u2014 although not unnecessary \u2014 to include this plot in the show.\n\nBen Platt plays a high schooler in \"The Politician.\" Netflix\n\nThe bottom line: 'The Politician' is one of the best new comedies on Netflix \u2014 and is Murphy's best show to date\n\nMunchausen's aside, \"The Politician\" is a funny and moving portrait of one high school student's quest to make a name for himself. Anyone who's ever wanted to better their situation, regardless of upbringing, will instantly relate to Payton, and the show-stealing performances from Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow really make it a fun watch.\n\nFor a high-school comedy, \"The Politician\" packs an emotional punch \u2014 but one that hits you in all the right places.\n\nGrade: A\n\n\"The Politician\" premieres on Netflix Friday.
