He ran the 26.2-mile distance in 1:59:40, but the mark is not a world record because the run didn\u2019t occur in an open event. Kipchoge\u2019s run at what he called an \u201calmost superhuman\u201d feat was held on a closed six-mile course in a park, featured three-dozen \u201crabbit\u201d runners who rotated in and out to keep Kipchoge on pace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKosgei had no such problem with a world record, even if she was somewhat surprised.\n\n\u201cI am feeling good, and I am happy because I was not expecting this,\u201d the 25-year-old runner said (via the Guardian), \u201cbut I felt my body was moving, moving, moving so I went for it.\u201d\n\nAbabel Yeshaneh of Ethiopia was second, finishing 6:47 behind Kosgei, whose time was faster than all but 22 runners in the men\u2019s division, and Ethiopa\u2019s Gelete Burka was third in 2:20:51. Kosgei\u2019s time would have been a men\u2019s world record in 1964.\n\nRadcliffe was on hand for the accomplishment and posed for photos with Kosgei.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me when I set it in 2003, that it would last that long I wouldn\u2019t have believed it,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I always knew this time would come \u2014 and when I saw how fast Brigid was running today I knew the record would go if she could maintain her pace.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, Kosgei became the youngest female winner of the London Marathon, with a time of 2:18:20. She won the 2018 Chicago Marathon (with a time of 2:18:35) and finished second there in 2017.\n\nIn the Chicago Marathon men\u2019s division, Kenya\u2019s Lawrence Cherono, the reigning Boston Marathon champion, outlasted a pack of four runners at the finish line, winning in an unofficial time of 2:05:45, edging Ethiopia\u2019s Dejene Debela (2:05:46) and Asefa Mengstu (2:05:48).\n\nDaniel Romanchuk and Manuela Sch\u00e4r were repeat winners in the wheelchair division.\n\nRead more Sports coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The runner broke the 2003 mark set by Paula Radcliffe by more than a minute.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6WjQdqhcYdyb4IZ2WShyDLbHHTI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T5TE44HNZMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
