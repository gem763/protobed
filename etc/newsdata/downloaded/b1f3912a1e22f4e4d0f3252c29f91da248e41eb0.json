He has strongly pushed back against the president's allegations that Biden pressed the Ukrainian government to oust its top prosecutor to derail an investigation into an energy company that had hired his youngest son, Hunter.\n\nThe former vice president and longtime senator from Delaware said the nation could not allow Mr. Trump to \"get away with shredding\" the U.S. Constitution, which he said would last forever.\n\n\"It's an abuse of power,\" Biden said Tuesday. \"It undermines our national security. It violates his oath of office. And it strikes at the heart of the sworn responsibility a president has to put national interest before personal interest.\"\n\nTrump slams impeachment inquiry as \"presidential harassment\"\n\nThat position is in line with what the former vice president said Saturday in Iowa, when he stated the president \"could be impeached\" depending on the findings of congressional investigations. \"I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president,\" Biden said in Iowa. \"Depending on what the House finds [Trump] could be impeached. But I'm not making that judgment now. The House should investigate.\"\n\nBiden's comments on Tuesday come as Democratic leadership in Congress prepares to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump after a group of previously hesitant Democrats vouched their support for the move, citing allegations that the president repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter during a call in July. The conversation between the two leaders is said to be at the center of the whistleblower complaint a member of the intelligence community made last month.\n\nMr. Trump admitted over the weekend that he discussed the Bidens with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, but he has denied any wrongdoing. On Tuesday, he said he would release an unredacted transcript of his call with Zelensky, but his administration has so far refused to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress.", "description": "\"If he continues to obstruct Congress, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,\" Biden said", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/24/26317de5-dbb7-4537-a494-bc2c7dd44a29/thumbnail/1200x630/59f674ee7a29e14074f8ce8115749373/gettyimages-1170806265.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
