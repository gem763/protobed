We look at his career highs and lows\n\nFor good or ill, after 32 years serving on the frontline of radio news presentation for the Today programme, John Humphrys has become an emblem of BBC journalism. One of the corporation\u2019s journalistic attack dogs, he has been the interviewer that political leaders, notably Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, are keenest to dodge.\n\nThis week, Humphrys is finally to bow out in the company of a former prime minister. David Cameron will brave an interview on the eve of the publication of his memoir \u2013 and it promises to be a vintage encounter.\n\nThe avowedly impartial BBC, which Humphrys joined in 1966, regularly deploys the defence that it must be doing something right because it is equally unpopular with Remainers and Brexiters, with one-nation Tories and radical socialists, and with feminist activists and reactionary misogynists. And as Humphrys leaves Radio 4\u2019s flagship news show at the age of 76, he could certainly make a similar claim.\n\nSince February, when his decision to step down was announced, public criticism of his performances has cranked up a gear. It is as if Today listeners are racing to fit in their complaints now that time is short. As a result, 2019 has brought a series of fevered reactions, for instance, to an antagonistic interview with the Labour MP Andy McDonald, to an inappropriate quip about domestic abuse shared with the Conservative MP David Davis and to a traditionalist suggestion that women \u201cdo a better job\u201d of caring for babies.\n\nAssailed on all sides, Humphrys nevertheless has remained, like Auntie, a venerated feature of Britain\u2019s media culture.\n\nMaking the news\n\nAndrew Gilligan\u2019s report, 2003\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr David Kelly was named as the source of Andrew Gilligan\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier story.\n\nBBC correspondent Gilligan told Humphrys he had been informed by a reliable source that a dossier warning the government of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein had been deliberately \u201csexed up\u201d. The exchange, Humphrys later said, \u201cnearly brought down the BBC\u201d. And it also shook the nation. The suicide of the story\u2019s secret source, Dr David Kelly, followed, as did the resignation of the BBC\u2019s director-general, Greg Dyke, and its chairman, Gavyn Davies. The Hutton inquiry and, latterly, the Chilcot inquiry into the war in Iraq, came in its wake.\n\nJulian Assange, 2010\n\nOnce the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, had been freed on bail by the high court, he had to face questions about his sexual experiences from Humphrys. The presenter did not hold back, repeating the claims of two Swedish women that Assange was a sexual predator who preferred having sex with young women without a condom. Assange famously replied: \u201cA gentleman does not discuss his private life.\u201d Asked how many women he had slept with, he answered: \u201cA gentleman does not count.\u201d\n\nGeorge Entwistle, 2012\n\nAs BBC director-general, Entwistle survived only 54 days in the role due in part to the grilling he received from Humphrys after revelations about the crimes of the late Jimmy Savile. Dubbed by the Guardian as the \u201cdead-man-walking interview\u201d, in it Entwistle revealed his lack of knowledge about a Newsnight report that wrongly implicated a Tory peer in other allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to see somebody facing that sort of interview \u2026 I didn\u2019t set out to humiliate him, of course I didn\u2019t\n\nPart of the interview ran like this: Humphrys: \u201cThe Guardian yesterday carried a front-page story, which we now know was right, that cast doubt, serious doubt, on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme \u2026 You didn\u2019t know that actually happened?\u201d\n\nEntwistle: \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t.\u201d Entwistle resigned 12 hours later.\n\nHumphrys later told Radio 4\u2019s Broadcasting House show: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment, and not just because he was a colleague, which of course he was, and I both like and respect him, but you don\u2019t want to see somebody facing that sort of interview \u2026 I didn\u2019t set out to humiliate him, of course I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMixed emotions\n\nReturn to Cardiff, 2010\n\nAn assignment on the streets of his home city, Cardiff, shocked the broadcaster. Humphrys was upset to hear from pub clientele that the \u201cwhole point of the evening is to get drunk \u2013 on cheap booze\u201d. He said: \u201cIn my local a pint of bitter is well over \u00a33. In these hideous places, guarded by bouncers, it can be less than \u00a31.\u201d Four years previously, he had admitted drinking too much during his 20s and early 30s. \u201cI got hugely fat and was on the verge of becoming an alcoholic,\u201d he had said.\n\nGlastonbury, 2013\n\nAs a festival first-timer, Humphrys received a VIP tour from Worthy Farm\u2019s owner and music impresario, Michael Eavis, and he met the Rolling Stones. A reluctant convert to music-festival culture, the euphoric veteran reporter said he found the experience \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mick Jagger at Glastonbury 2013 \u2013 the first music festival John Humphrys had experienced. Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer\n\nClare Hollingworth, 2015\n\nIn a piece celebrating the life of the influential and groundbreaking foreign correspondent, Humphrys admitted she had scared him when they worked together, saying: \u201cShe absolutely terrified me.\u201d Her abrasive style was clearly an influence.\n\nSnubs and clangers\n\nThe Queen, 2013\n\nHumphrys\u2019s efforts to \u201cdoorstep the Queen\u201d with an impromptu question when she visited the BBC went down badly with some. He ventured a bland comment about Prince Philip \u201clooking well yesterday\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s not ill,\u201d Her Majesty replied curtly. Later, offering the monarch a digital radio as a gift, he was told: \u201cI don\u2019t get an awful lot of chance to listen to the radio.\u201d\n\nMichael Gove, 2017\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Gove caused a backlash by suggesting that being interviewed by John Humphrys was like \u2018going into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s bedroom\u2019.\n\nThe broadcaster\u2019s apparent enjoyment of an ill-judged joke made by guest Michael Gove about the behaviour of the serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein was one of Today\u2019s least edifying moments \u2013 and it was supposed to be marking the show\u2019s 60th anniversary. The then-environment secretary later admitted he had made a \u201cclumsy attempt at humour\u201d. Coming into a studio with Humphrys, Gove had said, \u201cis a bit like going into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s bedroom. You hope to emerge with your dignity intact.\u201d\n\nBarry Gardiner, 2018\n\nThe presenter faced a barrage of criticism after a combative interview with Labour\u2019s shadow energy minister, Gardiner, in which Humphrys appeared to muddle degrees of temperature with percentages. The Green party\u2019s co-leader Jonathan Bartley later said:\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that the Today programme didn\u2019t think to have a Green voice on to help John Humphrys get his facts right this morning: a 1.5% increase is not the same as a 1.5 degree increase.\u201d A spokesperson for Today later pushed back: \u201cAt no point did John Humphrys challenge or undermine the suggestion that action was needed.\u201d\n\nOffice wars\n\nTemperature-gate, 2015\n\nSometimes a comparatively innocuous comment has rebounded on the Today presenter. Coverage of a report that suggested women in offices often have to put up with low temperatures because men prefer it that way led his co-presenter, Sarah Montague, to hint she had a running battle with Humphrys over the setting on the studio thermostat. The public response to their altercation ran on through the following week.\n\nGender pay scandal, 2018\n\nFollowing the revelation that Humphrys had a salary of \u00a3600,000-\u00a3649,000 and that Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, earned \u00a3200,000-\u00a3249,999, an off-air bit of joshing between the two was made embarrassingly public. The former China editor Carrie Gracie had recently complained that her salary was not comparable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carrie Gracie, the BBC journalist at the centre of the gender pay row.\n\nHumphrys joked that his first question would be about how much of Sopel\u2019s salary he was prepared to hand over to Gracie. Sopel replied: \u201cI mean, obviously if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I\u2019ll have to come back and say: \u2018Well yes Mr Humphrys, but \u2026 \u201d\n\nI\u2019ve handed over already more than you fucking earn but I\u2019m still left with more than anybody else\n\nHumphrys responded: \u201cAnd I could save you the trouble as I could volunteer that I\u2019ve handed over already more than you fucking earn but I\u2019m still left with more than anybody else and that seems to me to be entirely just \u2013 something like that would do it?\u201d\n\nHumphrys subsequently took another salary cut.\n\nDavid Dimbleby, 2018\n\nThe former Question Time host David Dimbleby guest edited the Today programme last December and argued with Humphrys over who was the \u201cposhest\u201d when Humphrys claimed Dimbleby was \u201cquite posh\u201d. \u201cSorry John, there\u2019s a typical sneer in that question. You\u2019re quite posh, I\u2019m about as posh as you are. I come from Wales, you do. I\u2019m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time,\u201d the former Question Time presenter said. Rival definitions of poshness gripped the nation.\n\nBruising encounters\n\nBrian Redhead, 1987\n\nEarly in his Today career, a young Humphrys presented alongside Brian Redhead, a broadcasting titan who Humphrys said \u201cexpected everyone to be as sharp and clever as he was. All the time.\u201d According to the junior presenter, the two almost came to blows on air. \u201cI had foolishly tried to defend myself against his latest (probably well deserved) \u2026 criticism by daring to suggest that one of his own recent foreign reports was unlikely to trouble the Sony Award judges either. How we got through the rest of the programme is still a mystery to me. But afterwards he put his arm around my shoulders and all was well.\u201d\n\nGeorge Osborne, 2016\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former chancellor George Osborne clashed with Humphrys on the Today programme.\n\nWhen bleak public finances were made public, Osborne, the then-chancellor, was asked to explain how he had missed two of his three key economic targets. Humphrys repeatedly asked why the debt had not gone down as a share of GDP, and he wanted the reasons behind a decision to break Osborne\u2019s own cap on welfare spending. \u201cI suppose what I\u2019m asking is \u2013 what\u2019s a bloke got to do in your job to get the sack?\u201d he concluded.\n\nAlexandra Shulman, 2017\n\nThe outgoing Vogue editor Shulman, while being interviewed about her views on fashion, was given a far from easy ride. \u201cI unexpectedly found myself having to defend the fashion industry from all manner of evil, such as promoting anorexia among young girls,\u201d said Shulman, adding: \u201cSuddenly I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.\u201d\n\nHumphrys later claimed he was right to ask about Shulman\u2019s influential role in promoting certain images of beauty: \u201cIt was massively interesting, and actually a rather important subject, particularly if you advance the proposition, which I did, that magazines like Vogue and the fashionistas in general, pushed the idea for many years, and are still pushing it, though they deny it, that in order to look nice you\u2019ve got to be stick-thin.\u201d\n\nEd Miliband, 2019\n\nIn the spring of this year, the former Labour leader hoped to draw attention to the growing climate emergency but was asked to account for his views at every point. \u201cDuring the war, we had rationing, we couldn\u2019t go anywhere because there was no fuel and so on \u2013 are you telling us we shouldn\u2019t fly, we shouldn\u2019t drive, we should change the way we eat?\u201d asked Humphrys. Miliband listed new ways to heat homes, but was challenged again by Humphrys: \u201cWhere are we gonna get that gas from? We\u2019re not going to get it from fracking because that\u2019s not going to be allowed any longer.\u201d", "description": "The veteran presenter, feared and respected by all sides, is hanging up his mic.
