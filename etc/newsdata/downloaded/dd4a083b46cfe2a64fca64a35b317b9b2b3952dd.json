House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff pressed Ukraine \u2018Amigo\u2019 Kurt Volker to admit knowledge of an explicit quid pro quo demand from Donald Trump for dirt on the Bidens in exchange for suspended military aid. The State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine insisted that it didn\u2019t happen, in part because the Ukrainians didn\u2019t know until later that the aid had been suspended at all (via Jeff Dunetz):\n\n\u201c[The Ukrainians] didn\u2019t want to be drawn into investigating a Democratic candidate for president, which would mean only peril for Ukraine, is that fair to say?\u201d Schiff asked Volker. \u201cThat may be true,\u201d Volker said. \u201cThat may be true. They didn\u2019t express that to me, and, of course, I didn\u2019t know that was the context at the time.\u201d (Volker has said he did not know that Trump had mentioned the Bidens on the July 25 call with Zelensky until the rough transcript of the call was released on Sept. 25.) \u201cPart of the other context is vital military support is being withheld from the Ukraine during this period, right?\u201d Schiff asked. \u201cThat was not part of the context at the time,\u201d Volker said. \u201cAt least to my knowledge, they [Ukrainian leaders] were not aware of that.\u201d\n\nThis did not sit well with Schiff, who wanted to connect dots through Volker. If the Ukrainians didn\u2019t know that the aid had been withheld, of course, then it\u2019s impossible for it to have been used in a quid pro quo by Trump, especially in the Zelensky phone call. That puts a serious dent in the impeachment hypothesis under which House Democrats have been operating since the exposure of the whistleblower complaint, and it leaves Schiff in particular out on a very shaky limb, having curated the complaint in the first place.\n\nAt one point, an exasperated Schiff remarked at Volker, \u201cyou\u2019re making this much more complicated than it has to be.\u201d That might be a case of projection, considering the box in which Schiff found himself in this exchange.\n\nMaking the problem worse, Volker testified that the idea of pursuing the Bidens had been dropped by both sides by the time the Ukrainians read that the aid had been held up. Schiff argued that the timing didn\u2019t matter, but Volker said that the context of the US-Ukrainian relationship had shifted fundamentally by that time:\n\n\u201cCongressman, this is why I\u2019m trying to say the context is different, because at the time they learned that, if we assume it\u2019s Aug. 29, they had just had a visit from the national security adviser, John Bolton. That\u2019s a high-level meeting already. He was recommending and working on scheduling the visit of President Zelensky to Washington. We were also working on a bilateral meeting to take place in Warsaw on the margins of a commemoration on the beginning of World War II. And in that context, I think the Ukrainians felt like things are going the right direction, and they had not done anything on \u2014 they had not done anything on an investigation, they had not done anything on a statement, and things were ramping up in terms of their engagement with the administration. So I think they were actually feeling pretty good then.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Schiff\u2019s point is still hypothetically valid. If the Ukrainians thought things were going well, the news that the aid had been suspended might have been rather shocking. At that point, might they not have thought that reopening the Burisma probe would help get the aid unstuck? Republican Rep. Scott Perry revisited this with Volker, who said no one in Ukraine connected one to the other \u2014 and that he would have known if they did:\n\n\u201cIn your conversation with Rep. Schiff, he kind of implied and wanted you to intimate that there was an agreement based on that conversation that: If you do the investigation, then you can have a meeting [with Trump] and maybe we\u2019ll consider this military aid. If that were the case from the call, do you feel, because they had some trust in you, that they would have come to you and said, \u2018Hey how do we handle this? Is this what the President of the United States is asking?\u2019 Would they confide \u2014 would they ask you that?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Volker. \u201cThey would have asked me exactly that, you know. How do we handle this?\u201d\n\nBefore calling this path to a quid pro quo entirely closed, though, remember that Volker made a surprise appearance yesterday while Michael McKinley testified in order to review his own testimony. That sometimes happens when witnesses need to correct their testimony in order to avoid perjury charges, although there may be other reasons to do it as well. If Volker does change this testimony, then perhaps Schiff might find some bread crumbs through Volker to the elusive QPQ. If it stands as York presents it, though, Schiff\u2019s still way out on that limb.\n\nSpeaking of McKinley, it doesn\u2019t sound like Schiff got much there either. The 37-year State veteran decried the Trump administration\u2019s politicization of the department but apparently had little to do with Ukraine. He resigned because Pompeo refused to defend Marie Yovanovitch, but all he knew about Ukraine and quid pro quos is what he\u2019s read in the paper:\n\nMichael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told House impeachment investigators Wednesday that he quit his job last week out of concern about the mistreatment of career U.S. diplomats and the alarming allegations related to efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president into investigating President Trump\u2019s political rivals. \u201cI was disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\u201d McKinley said, according to portions of his testimony obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cI was convinced that this would also have a serious impact on Foreign Service morale and the integrity of our work overseas.\u201d \u2026 McKinley came to Capitol Hill with an intimate understanding of how Pompeo wielded power in the highest echelons of the State Department, but he said he was not particularly involved in Ukraine-related issues.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 decision to hold these hearings behind closed doors is becoming more clear, Brit Hume snarked last night:\n\nRead this and you may have an inkling why Schiff & Pelosi want these interviews to be held behind closed doors. https://t.co/bPBIyM0wys \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) October 17, 2019\n\nYeah, well, don\u2019t get cocky. Still, Schiff\u2019s looking more and more like a buffoon, and Nancy Pelosi may need to rethink her strategy about getting a full House vote. She needs to peel Schiff and Jerrold Nadler away from the impeachment effort and find a more credible manager who won\u2019t get laughed out of a Republican-controlled Senate. Elijah Cummings might have been a good choice, which makes his passing last night even more of a blow to Pelosi. Eliot Engel at Foreign Affairs might be the best option she has left.", "description": "\"Ambassador, you're making this much more complicated than it has to be.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/schiff-stare.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
