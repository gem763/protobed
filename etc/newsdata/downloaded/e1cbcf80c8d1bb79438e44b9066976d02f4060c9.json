In the film, which follows the sexual-harassment allegations that led to Roger Ailes\u2019s exit from the network, Charlize Theron uses Technicolor sheath dresses, a deep voice, and specious politics to transform into Kelly. It\u2019s a surprising, excellent performance, one that Theron was hesitant to take on. After a screening of the movie, Theron \u2014 along with her co-star John Lithgow, writer Charles Randolph, and director Jay Roach \u2014 discussed her decision to play Kelly with CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota. \u201c[Megyn Kelly is] incredibly well-known, and I\u2019ve never played anybody that\u2019s on that level. I\u2019ve played real people, but people that nobody knows about. There was less pressure when I did those,\u201d Theron said. \u201cI was just really scared, too, because I honestly knew her so superficially. She\u2019s conflicting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in that process,\u201d Camerota said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve played a serial killer.\u201d Theron, not missing a beat, joked, \u201cThis was harder. You forget sometimes \u2014 all of us do this \u2014 we think we know people, we have our preconceived ideas of them. As an actor you have to have that ability to put all of that aside and do research, and to actually find out about somebody.\u201d Theron said that Bombshell isn\u2019t a biopic, or a movie only about Kelly. \u201cI admit fully that there were some things that bothered me that I had to really work on through getting to know her through research. I could understand that what the story was was really just the year at Fox. We weren\u2019t making a biopic. This wasn\u2019t the Megyn Kelly story. Once I got past that, that year in her life was incredibly interesting, and felt to me like a story worth telling.\u201d", "description": "Charlize Theron has played supervillains and serial killers, but after a screening of \u201cBombshell\u201d on Sunday night, Theron said playing former Fox anchor Megyn Kelly was harder than anything she\u2019s done.", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/21/21-charlize-theron.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
