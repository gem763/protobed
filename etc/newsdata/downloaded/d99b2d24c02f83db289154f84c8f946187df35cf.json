Elijah Cummings, in Congress\u2019s Statuary Hall, a ceremony held just before his burial back in Baltimore.\n\nI want to get beyond the merely sentimental. Everyone seems to have liked him a lot; I knew him slightly and liked him too. I would only add to his enumerated virtues the power of his warmth. I met him at an event five or so years ago and when we were introduced I went to shake his hand. He\u2019d have none of that and enveloped me in a hug.\n\nI don\u2019t remember what we talked about but it seemed important to the two of us, in one of those nice moments that sometimes happen, that we show a mutual appreciation for who the other was. We did, and held hands. I just found to my shock that remembering this leaves me a little choked.\n\nANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: FAREWELL REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS -- WELL DONE THOU GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT\n\nThere was something not sentimental but poignant and half-grasped in the tribute to him. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke movingly about how Cummings came to Washington not to be a big man but to do big things.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \u201cHe was strong, very strong when necessary. ... His voice could ... stir the most cynical hearts.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCummings\u2019s friend Republican Rep. Mark Meadows said he had \u201ceyes that would pierce through anybody standing in his way,\u201d and like the others read Scripture. It was nice to hear the Bible read in Statuary Hall; the religiosity had a great sweetness to it. \u201cIn my father\u2019s house are many mansions,\u201d Meadows read, and suggested the Baltimore boy was in a grand new home.\n\nWhat was poignant was how much the speakers enjoyed being their best selves. Congress knows how hapless it looks, how riven by partisanship and skins-vs.-shirts dumbness. For many of them it takes the tang out of things. They know it lowers their standing in America. They grieve it. It embarrasses them. They\u2019d like to be part of something that works, something respected.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PEGGY NOONAN", "description": "Congress knows how hapless it looks, how riven by partisanship and skins-vs.-shirts dumbness.
