From Cherbourg, for instance, they can sail to Rosslare or Dublin, and from there on to Holyhead.\n\nSome 280,000 lorries go through the port in North Wales each year but that is almost a tenth of the number going through Dover which, police say, remains the single largest site for people smuggling operations.", "description": "People smugglers are picking new routes into the UK after a security drive at Dover and the Channel Tunnel.", "authors": ["Mark Easton", "Home Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1BE8/production/_109344170_afpgettyimages.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
