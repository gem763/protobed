Over thousands of games a year, for more than 100 years, everything that can happen pretty much has. That makes it particularly special when America\u2019s oldest professional team sport spits out something truly novel, like the Cardinals putting up 10 runs in the top of the first inning of Game 5 of the NLDS, en route to a decisive 13-1 win and series victory.\n\nEven by the standards of the dramatic first week of the 2019 playoffs, the Braves-Cardinals NLDS had been particularly close: a combined margin of victory of seven runs in the first four games, with three of those contests decided by a comeback in the eighth inning or later. The one exception was Atlanta\u2019s 3-0 win in Game 2, which featured a phenomenal pitching duel between resurgent Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz and Cardinals youngster Jack Flaherty, who\u2019d been the best pitcher in the National League over the last two months of the regular season.\n\nGame 5 was supposed to be a similarly cagey affair, and Cardinals manager Mike Shildt testified to that belief when he ordered second baseman Kolten Wong to lay down a sacrifice bunt on just the second play of the game. Little did anyone know at the time that the next nine Cardinals would reach base, and St. Louis would end the top of the first inning up 10 runs, the most ever scored in the first inning of an MLB postseason game and the joint-most scored in any inning of a postseason game.\n\nThe Braves were never really that close to being out of danger, but time after time they spurned opportunities to wrench the malfunctioning spigot closed. Freddie Freeman booted a ground ball to load the bases down 1-0, then Foltynewicz walked Matt Carpenter to force in a run. Tommy Edman\u2019s double swerved just inside the first base bag like a Roger Federer forehand to score two more runs, and with one out and a four-run hole, Braves manager Brian Snitker called on Foltynewicz to walk eight-hole hitter Paul DeJong to load the bases, then called on lefty reliever Max Fried to face Flaherty in the hopes of preserving some chance of a comeback.\n\nA four-run first-inning deficit, one that forces the visiting starting pitcher to pick up a bat before throwing a pitch, is a body blow, but not necessarily a fatal one, even against a pitcher like Flaherty. Fried, who played his high school ball at California\u2019s Harvard-Westlake with Flaherty and White Sox righty Lucas Giolito, won 17 games out of the rotation this year and has been Snitker\u2019s first arm out of the bullpen this series, with scoreless appearances to his name in the first three games of the NLDS.\n\nBut on Wednesday afternoon, Fried walked his old schoolmate on five pitches to force in another run, and the severe-but-survivable opening kick in the teeth turned into a genuine last-days-of-the-republic panic.\n\nDexter Fowler and Wong both doubled, and when Fried finally struck out Marcell Ozuna with two outs, the ball squirted away from catcher Brian McCann, who was, as it turns out, playing in his final MLB game. It took Ozuna a few beats to remember that he could run to first base in that situation. Even after that hesitation, McCann\u2014who\u2019s never been blessed with great quickness and at age 35 and with more than 13,000 career innings at catcher on his odometer has the get-up-and-go of a Victorian masonry structure\u2014could not retrieve the baseball in time to throw Ozuna out and euthanize the inning. The Braves didn\u2019t get out of it until the score was 10-0.\n\nThe entire ordeal took 26 minutes, which turns out to be more than enough time to appreciate how ironic it is that the Braves\u2019 postseason social media hashtag is (or was, now) #RELENTLESS.\n\nAfter the first inning, FanGraphs gave Atlanta about one chance in 50 of coming back for a win, which seems awfully generous. In MLB history, no team has ever overhauled a deficit of more than eight runs in a postseason game, and Flaherty had given up nine earned runs total since August 23.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the next few innings weren\u2019t eventful in their own right. Carpenter might as well have left his glove at home\u2014Shildt brought in late-inning defensive replacement Harrison Bader for the bottom of the first. The Cardinals eventually stretched their lead to 13-0, thanks to a second-inning double off the right field wall that left Nick Markakis splayed against the fence like an outline of Bugs Bunny, and a botched third-inning double play turn by Ozzie Albies. Flaherty batted and made outs with runners in scoring position in both the second and third innings, as for reasons passing understanding Shildt let his ace throw six innings and 104 pitches, all of them after the Cardinals offense put the game out of reach. One of those pitches hit Braves star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. in the back, perhaps by accident, perhaps as a final stinger on the feud between Acu\u00f1a and Cardinals closer Carlos Mart\u00ednez.\n\nBut none of it mattered. After the top of the first, TBS could\u2019ve gone back to airing reruns of American Dad! for all the drama that was left in what had to that point been the postseason\u2019s closest series. Dark times for lovers of the Braves and garlic knots alike. Neutral fans looked on with a mixture of pity, fascination, and worry that the TBS scoreboard had somehow malfunctioned. The Cardinals, for their part, not only advanced but exacted revenge for the 1996 NLCS, in which they built up a 3-1 lead over Atlanta but couldn\u2019t close it out, culminating in a 15-0 defeat in Game 7, the most lopsided postseason game in MLB history.\n\nBut the error, the walks, and the wild pitches made it clear that the Braves had lost this game more than the Cardinals had won it, insofar as that matters when the season ends on a 12-run loss. The disparity between preamble and performance was a shambles somewhere between the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII and Tenenbaum\u2019s loss to Gandhi at Windswept Fields.
