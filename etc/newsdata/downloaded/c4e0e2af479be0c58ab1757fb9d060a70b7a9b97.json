The shelter also has \"cuddle rooms,\" set up like living rooms, where women can spend time with their pets.\n\nWhat inspired her: Alonso was serving on the board of a women's shelter in 2004 when she discovered that women fleeing domestic abuse often had nowhere to go because shelters wouldn't accept their pets. \"My two dogs ... were my rock and my reinforcement,\" Alonso said. \"I couldn't imagine being in that type of situation, finding the courage to leave and having to leave them behind.\" Alonso was also shocked to learn that in many cases, women would go back to their abusive situation to remain with their beloved pet.\n\nNajah Bazzy: Helping Detroit's impoverished women and children\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Najah Bazzy Replay More Videos ...

They absolutely had nothing,\" she said. \"I was so devastated by that. ... I decided that this wasn't going to happen on my watch.\"\n\nThat day, Bazzy and her family gathered all the furniture and household items that they could -- including a crib -- and delivered everything to the family.

So, in 2005, Freweini Mebrahtu designed and patented a reusable menstrual pad. Today, she and her team produce 750,000 pads a year at her Mariam Seba Sanitary Products Factory, named for her daughter. Mebrahtu works in partnership with the nonprofit Dignity Period , which has conducted educational workshops for more than 300,000 students, teaching girls and boys that menstruation is natural, not shameful. Mebrahtu speaks at these events occasionally and enjoys seeing thousands of students receiving this message.\n\nWhat inspired her: When Freweini Mebrahtu got her period at age 13, she panicked. \"I remembered (hearing) that it's actually a curse to have a period,\" she said. \"Or that it meant I am ready to be married, or (that) I'm being bad.\"\n\nLike most girls in northern Ethiopia, she suffered in silence, never mentioning it to her mother or sisters. With no access to sanitary products, she coped by using rags. \"One time I had an accident in class and I was so scared and ashamed,\" she said. \"Even today I remember how I felt.\"\n\nMebrahtu went on to study in the United States, and remembers her first trip to an American drugstore.\n\n\"I saw overwhelming choices of sanitary pads,\" she said. \"I started thinking ...

They named the donkey Izzy.\n\n\"We fell in love with her,\" Meyers said. \"She opened our eyes to the donkey problem. We started noticing donkeys in need everywhere.\" By 2005, Meyers and his wife had 250 donkeys on their land.\n\n\"We decided that either we have a problem or we're going to have to find a way to find homes for these donkeys,\" he said.

The world was totally different.\"\n\nFor two years, Miles struggled to get back on his feet. Ultimately, he found a job, a home, and today is married with a child.

Afterwards, Montoya was inspired to bring the healing power of the arts to local children. Seeing young people grow, as artists and as people, gives Montoya great satisfaction.\n\n\"You can feel when they have that sense of pride and confidence,\" he said. \"It's a little fire in there and we just feed it every day a little more.\"\n\nMary Robinson: Helping kids learn how to mourn\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Mary Robinson Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Mary Robinson 03:19\n\nHer cause: Mary Robinson founded the nonprofit Mary Robinson founded the nonprofit Imagine, A Center for Coping with Loss in 2011 to help children deal with all the emotions that come from the death of a loved one. At the center, kids learn how to deal with their grief with other children who have lost a parent, brother or sister.\n\nThrough games or arts and crafts activities, children and teens are encouraged to open up and share with the volunteer facilitators. A realistic hospital room gives children whose parents suffered long-term illnesses a unique way to work through their feelings, while others let off some steam in the \"Volcano Room\" with its padded walls, pillows for punching and books for ripping.\n\nWhat inspired her: Robinson founded the center to create what she didn't have after her father died from cancer when she was 14. As a result, her grades dropped, she quit her activities and became withdrawn.\n\n\"It looked like bad behavior ... But it was a textbook example of a grieving child,\" Robinson said. \"I wasn't a bad kid. I was a sad kid.\"\n\nRobinson struggled until she got help in her late 20s. Eventually, she began volunteering at a children's grief support group and nearly two decades ago, she quit her job to devote herself to the work full-time.\n\n\"I really do this work to make sure other kids don't lose years of their life to unresolved grief,\" she said. \"The death of a parent is really a trauma for a child. But it doesn't have to leave a child traumatized if they get support.\"\n\nAfroz Shah: Keeping plastic out of the ocean\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Afroz Shah Replay More Videos ...

Shah, a Mumbai lawyer, launched the Afroz Shah Foundation to help spread his mission to save the world's oceans from plastic pollution. More than 8 million tons of plastic ends up in the oceans each year -- the equivalent of a garbage truck dumped every minute. It's predicted that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.\n\nWhat inspired him: In 2015, Shah began picking up trash from Mumbai's Versova Beach every Sunday morning. He had played there as a child and was upset to see that the sand was no longer visible because it was covered by a layer of garbage more than five feet thick. \"The whole beach was like a carpet of plastic,\" he said. \"It repulsed me.\"\n\nAt first, it was just him and a neighbor, and then he began recruiting others to join in. Word spread and with help from social media, more volunteers got involved.\n\nShah hasn't stopped since. He's now spent more than 200 weekends dedicated to the mission, inspiring more than 200,000 volunteers to join him in what's been called the world's biggest beach cleanup. By October 2018, Versova Beach was finally clean and Shah's cleanups expanded to another beach as well as a stretch of the Mithi River and other regions of India.\n\nZach Wigal: Bringing video games to hospitalized kids\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Zach Wigal Replay More Videos ...

Wigal is the founder of Gamers Outreach which makes sure that children who can't leave their hospital rooms during long-term medical treatment can play video games while they recuperate. He helped design \"GoKarts,\" portable carts equipped with a gaming console and an array of video games that are easily rolled into a patient's room. The carts are now in more than 150 hospitals across the country.\n\nWhat inspired him: As a junior in high school, Wigal organized a Halo 2 tournament in his high school cafeteria. It was shut down \"by a police officer who believed that games like Halo were, in his words, corrupting the minds of America's youth,\" Wigal said.\n\nThe cancellation sparked an idea: Wigal wanted to show authorities that gamers weren't all bad or lazy kids -- and they could do something good with their gaming skills.\n\nIn 2008, Wigal and his friends held an event called Gamers for Giving and raised money for the Autism Society of America. The event continued year after year, and as it grew in popularity, Wigal's team branched out and started working with local hospitals.\n\n\"We noticed that a lot of the video games (at the hospitals) were getting stuck in playrooms,\" said Wigal. \"And because of that, there was a whole segment of the hospital population that was, sort of, limited to whatever it was they had access to their bedside environment.\"", "description": "Prepare to be inspired: CNN has revealed the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2019 -- 10 men and women who are making the world a better place by helping families affected by tragedy, cleaning up the environment, protecting neglected animals, and so much more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191022141449-cnnheroes-update-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
