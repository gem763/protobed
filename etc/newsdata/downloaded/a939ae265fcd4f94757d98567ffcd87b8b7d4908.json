Salmon said in a statement. \u201cWe see the changes that we are making as a substantive improvement over the current objectives and frameworks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSalmon said state officials would work with Maryland\u2019s 24 school systems to make sure teachers had the chance for training opportunities to provide \u201cthe tools necessary to teach the Holocaust with confidence.\u201d\n\nSeveral elected leaders and advocates lauded the state\u2019s plans, citing a critical need for greater awareness and education. Some pointed to an increase in hate crimes, incidents and threats at schools.\n\n\u201cWe thought the state curriculum guidelines were lacking and fell short of the depth of instruction in the Holocaust and its causes necessary to ensure our children learn about it and that our society never repeats it again,\u201d said Howard Libit, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council.\n\nAD\n\nLibit said the timing of the state announcement was resonant \u2014 nearing the first anniversary of a shooting rampage that claimed the lives of 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that this weekend, as Jews across this state go to synagogue \u2014 and think about what happened a year ago in Pittsburgh \u2014 knowing that our state\u2019s education leaders made such a strong statement to require more intensive education about the Holocaust will be very meaningful,\u201d he said.\n\nOther leaders said the move was also important given findings about a lack of knowledge among the young about the genocide of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nA recent survey found that two-thirds of U.S. millennials could not identify Auschwitz, among the most notorious concentration camps built by the Nazis during World War II.\n\nAD\n\nThe same poll, released last year by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, found that 22 percent of millennials said they had not heard of the Holocaust or are not sure whether they\u2019ve heard of it \u2014 twice the percentage of U.S. adults overall.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf there is a gap in awareness when Holocaust survivors are still here and living, it\u2019s really hard to imagine how difficult it will be when they are no longer here to tell their stories,\u201d said Meredith Weisel, director of Maryland government and community relations with the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington.\n\nA network of survivors speak to students in schools, recalling their experiences in powerful firsthand accounts, she said.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier in the fall, the Jewish Community Relations Council, the Baltimore Jewish Council and state lawmakers wrote to the state asking for greater clarity on requirements for Holocaust education. Their request followed legislation on Holocaust education earlier this year that was unsuccessful but sparked the broader idea of going to state education officials.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were very happy that the State Department of Education acknowledged some deficiencies in the way they were teaching it.\u201d said Del. Shelly L. Hettleman (D-Baltimore County). \u201cIt\u2019s great news that they are going to alter and beef up the curriculum.\u201d\n\nState officials said Maryland\u2019s middle school social studies \u201cframework\u201d \u2014 which provides guidance for school systems as they develop curriculum and teacher training \u2014 will be revised in 2020 and that the state will advocate to include study of the roots of anti-Semitism to \u201ccontextualize the study of the Holocaust when they get to high school.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt the high school level, the U.S. history framework is in the process of being expanded to help students understand the origins of the Holocaust before they examine the American response to it.\n\nSimilarly, in modern world history, an existing objective about the study of atrocities will be expanded so that students specifically \u201cevaluate the cause, course, and consequences of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchool system officials in Prince George\u2019s County said their social studies curriculum includes Holocaust history at the high school level and that they are ready to embrace the impending state changes.\n\nA spokesman from Montgomery County\u2019s school system said the district believes it is critically important for students to learn about the Holocaust and other genocides as part of their public education.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is essential that students not only understand the Holocaust, but also the conditions that allowed for the Holocaust to occur and the need for society to remain vigilant about preventing discrimination and prejudice,\u201d spokesman Derek Turner said.\n\nTurner noted that the Holocaust is already included in the county\u2019s modern world history curriculum, along with Advanced Placement World History and the state\u2019s curriculum for world history.\n\nAD", "description": "The announcement came days before the anniversary of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.", "authors": ["Donna St. George", "Reporter Covering Education"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HV0X6Pn3nlNSUGGmV9SnoclZ46k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7Q6VGGHV44I6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
