YouTube (48 per cent) and Netflix (65 per cent) reached more viewers in that age bracket weekly than BBC iPlayer, which has just 26 per cent of youths saying they view it at least once a week \u2014 down two points from last year.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation is commercial-free and is funded by the licence fee, payment of which is legally required from all those who watch live television, even if they do not watch the BBC, or iPlayer.\n\nFailure to pay the licence fee can result in a \u00a31,000 fine, a court appearance, prosecution, and even imprisonment.\n\nOfcom fears that if younger people do not watch the BBC, they may challenge the premise of paying the licence.\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t consider the BBC as a core part of their viewing, then it will be hard to encourage them to pay the licence fee in years to come, and public support for the licence fee could become eroded,\u201d Ofcom said in comments reported by The Times.\n\nThe reported concluded that the \u201cBBC may not be sustainable in its current form\u201d.\n\nFormer BBC Broadcaster: #Brexit Voters Should Be Deprived of Medicine, Left to 'Starve and Die' https://t.co/00SyImALzV \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 31, 2019\n\nLast year, media reported that the BBC\u2019s radio stations were also losing listeners as Britons dial into digital and commercial alternatives.\n\nThe broadcaster is facing criticism for scrapping free licences for over-75s from June 2020 despite agreeing in 2015 to take over the responsibility for providing them from the government.\n\nIn July, a BBC representative told a House of Commons committee that it plans to send \u201coutreach\u201d officers to elderly viewers to remind them that they will now have to pay to watch TV. MPs raised parallels between the \u201coutreach\u201d officers and enforcement officers who check whether people are illegally watching television, expressing concerns that such home visits would upset senior citizens.\n\nThe following month, it was revealed that the BBC had handed out pay raises to 1,000 staff at a cost of \u00a37.9 million \u2014 the equivalent of 51,000 TV licences for pensioners.\n\nBBC Asian Network Plays Rap Song About Pimping \u2018White Girls\u2019 for Money https://t.co/f5ssoQoN6L \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 4, 2019", "description": "Ofcom has warned that the mandatory TV tax is at risk of being undermined because young people are \"tuning out\" of the BBC.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/BBC-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
