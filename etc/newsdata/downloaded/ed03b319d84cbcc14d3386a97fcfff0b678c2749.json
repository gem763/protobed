Plus: A Mind-Bending History of Gender Rules", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m confused.\n\nI can\u2019t quite make out what\u2019s happening.\n\nFirst, we were told calling out someone\u2019s gender is wrong \u2014 waitress, waiter, etc. Then we were told gender doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 it\u2019s a social construct. Then we were told gender is inherent, therefore people can legally change theirs with medical confirmation. Then we were told that gender isn\u2019t really gender at all \u2014 despite the antiquated notion of female and male \u2014 and despite the fact that the very notion of gender comes from the existence of binary biological sex \u2014 there are actually limitless genders (here).\n\nAnd though gender was initially described as a social construct and eventually fluid \u2014 therefore, meaningless \u2014 then we were told it\u2019s punishingly important. Literally punishingly \u2014 California passed a law doling out fines and/or jail time to senior care workers who \u201cmisgender\u201d their patients. In New York, you can be fined up to $250,000 in the misgendering department.\n\nNow here\u2019s something even more confusing: If you strip everybody nekkid, then suddenly we\u2019re back to just men and women.\n\nWill there ever be a transgender nudist colony? How will you know?\n\nAnd all of the above edicts, though listed serially, are somehow concurrently true.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: While it\u2019s wrong for a restaurant to force women to wear skirts and men to wear pants\u2026and while, because gender is a social construct, who\u2019s to say a man wears slacks and a woman dresses\u2026at the core of someone declaring themselves transgender \u2014 a medical idea \u2014 is the changing of clothing to that gender\u2019s \u201csocially constructed\u201d version.\n\nSo the people who are no slaves to society are slaves to society.\n\nThough a bra isn\u2019t for girls and a jock strap isn\u2019t for guys, a guy identifying as a girl will put on a bra to live his truth. But if you combine all the rules, it should be true for a man to identify as a woman who doesn\u2019t conform to the social construct. So you should be able to be a naturally-born guy and change literally nothing about your clothes or body or appearance\u2026you should be able to still have a hairy chest and a penis and wear men\u2019s clothes and sport a beard\u2026and now be a woman.\n\nTo be clear, none of this is meant to be at all humorous; I\u2019m genuinely confused, because it\u2019s extremely complicated.\n\nAnd how does all that play into Portland doing away with urinals? And what does that have to do with gender vs. sex?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a man; I\u2019m a woman.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a woman or a man; I\u2019m a banana slug.\u201d Okay, but speaking words doesn\u2019t change the way your pee comes out.\n\nNevertheless, the hipster town sent out an email to city employees last February regarding the remodeled public Portland Building:\n\nWe will continue to have gender-specific (male and female) multi-stall restrooms that are readily available to any employee that prefers to use one. But, there will be no urinals in any restroom in the building. This will give us the flexibility we need for any future changes in signage.\n\nTherefore, urinals are banned, even in the Men\u2019s room. (Paris has the opposite idea \u2014 see here.)\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be so, but we all know it\u2019s true: Prepare to have a whoooole lot more urine on the toilet seats.\n\nAnd how\u2019s that lookin\u2019 for the impending destruction of the world, and the woke fight against it (here)?\n\nAs noted by talk show host Lars Larson:\n\nFinally, in a place constantly lecturing us about protecting the environment (you know, plastic straws etc) this will waste a tremendous amount of water I checked and most urinals take as little as a pint of water per flush (1/8 gallon). Even \u201cmodern\u201d toilets flush with more than a gallon of water. Some \u201cno flush\u201d urinals use no water at all. Multiply this by hundreds of thousands of flushes a year. Figure out how this makes sense.\n\nHere\u2019s more on the Portland Building: As reported by KGW 8, every floor will have at least one any-gender restroom.\n\nThe 1st, 34th, and 15th floors will sport multi-stall bathrooms so men and women can take dumps together.\n\n\u2018Cause that\u2019s what everybody wants, apparently.\n\nChief Administrative Officer Tom Rinehart, who wrote the February email, is convinced:\n\nI am convinced that this is the right way to ensure success as your employer, remove arbitrary barriers in our community, and provide leadership that is reflective of our shared values.\n\nThe total remodel will cost taxpayers $195,000,000.\n\n-ALEX\n\nRelevant RedState links in this article: here, here, and here.\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nThe Far Left Is Making Teens Miserable Over The Imminent Destruction Of The World\n\nThink You\u2019ve Heard The Stupidest Thing Ever?
