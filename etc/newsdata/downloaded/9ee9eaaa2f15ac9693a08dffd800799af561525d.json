The company said the app, HKmap.live, was used to target the police.\n\nCook had defended the removal in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland China, telling Apple workers that \"this decision best protects our users.\"\n\nChina's State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on its website that its chief, Xiao Yaqing, and Cook discussed topics including Apple expanding investment in China, consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility. It did not give more details.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "China's State Administration for Market Regulation says its chief met Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss Apple expanding investment in China, consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106180712-1571080275731gettyimages-1155309818.jpeg?v=1571376065", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
