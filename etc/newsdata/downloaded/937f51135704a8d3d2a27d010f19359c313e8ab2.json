The spread between the U.S. 2-year and 10-year note yields turned negative for the first time in over a decade, sparking concerns the U.S. economy is heading for a recession. Such an event has occurred ahead of the last seven recessions, spanning more than 50 years, but sometimes preceding one by as much as 24 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, an inverted yield curve shouldn\u2019t necessarily spook investors.\n\nKeith Fitz-Gerald, chief investment strategist at the Baltimore-based Money Map Press, told FOX Business\u2019 \u201cCavuto Coast to Coast\u201d he thinks the yield curve is artificially depressed due to negative interest rates around the world and that it\u2019s not the \u201charbinger of doom that everyone used to think it was.\u201d\n\nEven if a recession is coming, the stock market can still go higher over the near term. In fact, dating back to 1967, the S&P 500 has averaged a post-inversion gain of 13.2 percent.\n\nStock-market investors who are looking for yield should consider the telecom (4.6 percent), energy (3.9 percent), utilities (3 percent), REITs (2.9 percent) and staples (2.7 percent), which are the sectors with the highest dividend yield, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cStocks are almost a no brainer here, David Dietze told FOX Business\u2019 \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d on Friday. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 70 percent of the S&P 500 trading with a higher yield than 10-year Treasury. That\u2019s very rare.
