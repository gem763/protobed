How do I know? I interviewed 20 of them for my new book, \u201cNever Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur\u2019s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life.\u201d\n\nSomething else I learned about these startup founders: their five secrets of success.\n\nSome of these risk takers started their businesses from a passion or hobby. Others paired up with someone younger. A few started ventures as social entrepreneurs. They range from a gin distiller to a movie maker to an interior designer and packaging manufacturer. If you\u2019re thinking about starting a business after 50 or already have, you\u2019ll want to hear what some of these entrepreneurs did and what they recommend for succeeding.\n\nOne more thing about the women and men I talked with for \u201cNever Too Old to Get Rich,\u201d their paths to riches \u2014 financial and internal \u2014 were lined with challenges. But these go-getters didn\u2019t let naysayers get in their way. Now, onto their five secrets of success:\n\n1. Sales skills are nonnegotiable\n\nWhen I asked the entrepreneurs about their biggest challenges in starting a venture, their blunt response was frequently the same: sales.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a natural salesperson,\u201d says Paul Tasner, 73, who five years ago founded Pulpworks, a San Francisco-based firm that designs and manufactures sustainable packaging for the consumer products industry. \u201cBeing successful at sales is very difficult. I have a whole new admiration for good salespeople. It\u2019s an art \u2014 and a science.\u201d\n\nSales skills were often either overlooked or considered a lower priority as the entrepreneurs hatched their plans. Yet, nearly everyone I talked to quickly realized that the ability to sell their product, service or just their idea was crucial. Selling, they said, can help you raise capital and convince those close to you that you\u2019re not headed off a cliff with a pure leap of faith.\n\nSometimes, the entrepreneurs had a sales background, which proved a huge help. Take Linda LaMagna, 54, of Fort Mill, S.C, the owner of 341 Interior Design.\n\nFor more than 25 years, LaMagna\u2019s career had been a whirlwind trajectory, including living in Germany and the Netherlands and working in marketing and strategic planning for Spiracur, a medical device startup, and for the medical device company, ConvaTec, Says LaMagna: \u201cIt really was my passion to be in the corporate world working on the sales and marketing side.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: The best industries for starting your own business\n\nSo what does a background in sales and marketing in the medical device industry have to do with a starting an interior design business? \u201cI was a marketer and had to understand what the customer was thinking and what their needs were,\u201d says LaMagna.\n\n2. Insider industry knowledge provides an edge\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to view the launch of a new business as a time to take your career in an entirely new direction. But that\u2019s often not the wisest strategy. The best way to leverage decades of experience and many business contacts, entrepreneurs I interviewed said, is to continue to do work related to what you\u2019ve been doing.\n\nTasner said the network he\u2019d developed in a career handling supply chains at corporations like Clorox and California Closets was a big benefit. \u201cWe don\u2019t always have the perfect person to sit down with,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we always have someone I know who can at least open the door to us and point us in the right direction.\u201d\n\nI heard a similar story from Michele Meloy Burchfield. Before she started her beverage company Blume Honey Water in her 50s, she was a director of national accounts for the Boston Beer Company and ran the MBM Group consulting firm, catering to clients such as Fiji Water and Sierra Nevada Brewing Company.\n\nAnother example: Mike Kravinsky, now 65. When he went to work as a video editor at ABC News in 1981, he figured he\u2019d spend a year there and then head to Los Angeles to become a filmmaker. It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. Over 29 years, Kravinsky worked as an editor and technical director for news broadcasts like \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d and \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and news magazine shows like \u201c20/20\u201d and \u201cPrimetime Live.\u201d After retiring in 2010, Kravinsky followed his dream to be a filmmaker, but in his hometown of Arlington, Va. And he credits his previous work as critical to his success.\n\nKravinsky has now completed three feature films with his independent film company, Nextnik Films, and is writing his fourth. \u201cWorking in TV prepared me to be very exacting in my preparation of a production,\u201d Kravinsky says. \u201cMuch of what I learned creatively, technically and running on deadlines on shows was movable to narrative films.\u201d\n\n3. You must love the nitty-gritty of operating a business\n\nAlthough Ginny Corbett, 56, founder of Sal\u00fad Juicery, in Sewickley, Pa, loves her juices and quaffs them regularly, the art of preparing a perfect juice or smoothie isn\u2019t what drives her. \u201cI enjoy talking to the customers, but the truth is I\u2019m in my business office every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I\u2019m at the store too much, I\u2019m not doing my job \u2014 making sure we have the product and dealing with food costs and payroll. It\u2019s not just the product you need to love. You have to love running a business to have a business.\u201d\n\nFor Corbett, the business has also had a family affair flair, with all three of her children (ages 29, 25 and 19) habitually sampling juices, working the sales counter or helping design marketing materials, including coaching her on how to build an Instagram following to communicate with customers and post free beverage offers. She now has over 9,300 followers.\n\n4. A career coach can smooth the move to entrepreneurship\n\n\u201cI was fortunate to have a career coach to work with as I was making the transition,\u201d LaMagna says. \u201cMuch of the work we did was understanding: \u2018What am I carrying with me through my experiences that is beneficial and supportive of this new set of skills that I want to do? How do I actually make that transition to change corporate speak to design speak? How do I introduce myself differently now that I\u2019m not in the corporate world?\u2019\n\nSEE: You\u2019re likely to be out of a job in your 50s \u2014 4 ways to prepare and minimize the pain\n\nAnd, LaMagna adds, \u201cOften someone\u2019s identity is tied to what they have done for so long, so to start something new has all those challenges with the new career, new role, new skill set \u2014 but it is also shifting your identity. How do you position yourself the first time you walk through the door into a cocktail party and someone asks, \u2018What do you do?\u2019\u201d\n\n5. Consider starting your venture as a side gig\n\nIn 2013, Bergen Giordani and her daughter, Morgen Giordani Reamer, launched their dessert shop, One Hot Cookie, in their hometown of Youngstown, Ohio. The two eased into the business by initially sharing cookies they made with friends and family to get feedback. Giordani also took an executive-MBA-type program offered by the Small Business Administration \u2013 the SBA Emerging Leaders Initiative.\n\n\u201cThe idea for the business came from our desire to do something together,\u201d says Giordani, president of the company and a single mom. \u201cWe both love hot, gooey desserts and sweets, and since Morgen [now vice president of the operation] was a child, we would go out and get a dessert somewhere and have that special time together.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it was an opportunity for Bergen to find work she loved and a chance to combine that with baking cookies alongside her then-teenage daughter, an activity they\u2019d relished doing together since Morgen was tiny.\n\nALSO SEE: Advice for weaning your grown kids off your credit cards\n\nWhile waiting to see if the side gig would gain traction and become profitable, Bergen worked as development director at the Rich Center for Autism, on the campus of Youngstown State University. And initially she worked part time as a bartender, too.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure Morgen \u2014 who was 16 when we started \u2014 and I were provided for. And I attribute a lot of our ability to grow to that work ethic of working really hard on our business while I was still working outside of the business,\u201d Giordani says.\n\nNEXT UP: Avoid these 7 exercises if you\u2019re over 50\n\nOne final reflection from me: The freedom to determine their own future was the seductive siren song for most of these small-business owners, and not a dangerous one. \u201cI now have the freedom to take on projects and execute them in my own vision,\u201d Kravinsky says. \u201cEach film that I do is like starting a new business. It is a new crew, new actors, new locations. That\u2019s liberating.\u201d\n\nAmy Bass, owner of Nota Bene, a fine paper boutique in Pittsburgh, agreed. For her, \u201cIt meant the ability to own and create something of my own and then being directly rewarded for my hard work.\u201d", "description": "If you\u2019re thinking about starting a business after 50, you\u2019ll want to hear what some of these entrepreneurs did.", "authors": ["Kerry Hannon"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP443_na_suc_ZG_20190814144509.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
