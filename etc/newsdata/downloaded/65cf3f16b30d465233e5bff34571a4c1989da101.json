This is the year 2019: our automated vacuum robots need to have a memorable brand to go with their ability to perform chores like something out of post-war science fiction.\n\n\n\nEnter \u201cThe Roomba That Screams When It Bumps Into Stuff,\u201d an invention that handily solves this problem by allowing us to pretend every cleaning machine in service today is in nearly constant agony.\n\n\n\nThe poor Roomba in question was created by Michael Reeves, a YouTuber whose channel is filled with incredible engineering feats like a machine that forces its wearer to dab by electrocuting their muscles. The premise of his latest invention is simple: It\u2019s a Roomba that curses in torment when it bumps into things.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll that you really need to know is that when a collision gets detected by the sensors,\u201d Reeves explains at the beginning, \u201cSound gets played from [a] Raspberry Pi to [a] Bluetooth speaker.\u201d\n\nAfter showing off some computer voices, Reeves says that \u201cthe point of the screaming is so that it doesn\u2019t feel like a robot\u201d but instead \u201ca living creature ... that\u2019s in pain.\u201d He calls up some other YouTubers and uses their foul mouths to craft more organic samples. The end result is a machine that yells in agony, roaring \u201cWhy was I created this way?\u201d or \u201cGod-fucking-damn it!\u201d when it bumps into chairs or counters.\n\n\n\nTo cap off his demonstration, Reeves brings the Roomba to a nearby Target so average shoppers can witness the beautiful machine, too. While there are good reviews, he concludes that \u201cit appears as though our invention is simply too far ahead of its time.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow that there\u2019s a swearing, miserable Roomba, the sky\u2019s the limit with what we kind of features we can expect to see brought to the machines that fill our homes. Perhaps a car that explains the effects of climate change every time it senses a newly-filled gas tank or a smart thermostat that calls you a wimp for being too cold or hot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Great Job, Internet tips to gji@theonion.com", "description": "As incredible an invention as the Roomba may be, it doesn\u2019t have nearly enough personality.
