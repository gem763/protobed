I can\u2019t reach him any more.\u201d\n\nBalliet \u201cwasn\u2019t at peace with himself or the world, he always blamed others\u201d, he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Total loser\u2019 \u2013\n\nThroughout a video the shooter made of his actions using a helmet-mounted smartphone, his rage bubbles to the surface.\n\nIn the earliest minutes he berates his laptop as it takes too long to load programmes and find a wireless signal, while later he curses as his homemade weapons fail to fire.\n\nUnable to breach the entrance of the Jewish cemetery outside the synagogue, he shoots a passing woman, later firing another burst into her lifeless body and shouting \u201cPig!\u201d.\n\nBut he reserves his harshest language for himself, calling himself a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d, a \u201cfailure\u201d and a \u201closer\u201d.\n\nBleeding after a gunfight with police as he flees town in his crippled vehicle, he apologises to the imagined audience watching online.\n\n\u201cThat was it guys. A total loser,\u201d he says into the lens before hurling the phone out of the car.\n\nAround 2,200 people are believed to have watched his blundering, violent rampage on games streaming platform Twitch, the Amazon-owned company said \u2014 only five of them live.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Global radical right\u2019 \u2013\n\nBalliet\u2019s repeated addresses to watching \u201cguys\u201d \u2014 and invitation to \u201cbe my friend\u201d at the end of a political diatribe against Jews at the start of the video \u2014 point to a self-identification with a wider movement, extremism researcher Matthias Quent told DPA.\n\nThe use of English and transmission of conspiracy theories targeted at Jews and feminism \u201care themes of the global radical and populist right\u201d, Quent said.\n\nIt was \u201csignificant\u201d that he had written and published a \u201cmanifesto\u201d in English, tweeted Peter Neumann, a terrorism expert at King\u2019s College London.\n\nThe choice \u201cclearly shows that he wasn\u2019t trying to impress local neo-Nazis, but that his \u2018audience\u2019 was on message forums\u201d online that have previously cheered on far-right killers.\n\nBalliet\u2019s alleged document, which has not been authenticated by the authorities, was filled with racist and anti-Semitic slurs and references to message board in-jokes.", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 The German suspect in a deadly anti-Semitic attack targeting a synagogue and a kebab shop in the east of the country was a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/10c842_suspect-in-deadly-anti-semitic-attack-served-in-german-army-german-gunman-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
