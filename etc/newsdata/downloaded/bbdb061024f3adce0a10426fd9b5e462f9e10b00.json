After a delay of around four hours, Cooper began her testimony.\n\nIn a dramatic confrontation during the escalating probe that threatens Trump\u2019s presidency even as he seeks re-election next year, the Republican lawmakers caused a standoff with the three Democratic-led House committees leading the inquiry before finally leaving the room, allowing Cooper to begin her testimony.\n\nThe Department of Defense had directed Cooper, who had agreed to testify voluntarily, not to appear for her scheduled deposition. The House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed her early Wednesday and she complied, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe impeachment probe focuses on Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate a domestic rival - former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination - for his personal political benefit.\n\nBy having Republican lawmakers barge into the hearing room, Trump\u2019s allies sought to put the focus on what they portray as unfair Democratic tactics rather than on the president\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cThe American people have a voice in this process. They have a right to know. It should be in the sunlight,\u201d House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters.\n\nAlthough the Republicans complained of a lack of transparency in the inquiry, the U.S. Constitution gives the House wide latitude in how to conduct the impeachment process and set rules for the probe. The inquiry is being conducted in a secure room used to brief lawmakers about confidential or sensitive material.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re freaked out. They\u2019re trying to stop this investigation,\u201d Democratic Representative Ted Lieu said of the Republicans. \u201cThey know more facts are going to be delivered which are absolutely damning to the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nA witness inside the room said the Republicans brought cellphones into the facility even though electronic devices are forbidden. An Intelligence Committee official said some Republicans refused to remove their phones. The House parliamentarian ruled that the Republican lawmakers violated House rules, the official added.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters that the witnesses testifying in the inquiry have defied the White House efforts to keep them silent and that \u201cthe president has urged his acolytes in Congress to use other means to try to prevent their testimony. But they won\u2019t be successful.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday told reporters that \u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight\u201d the impeachment, saying the Democrats are \u201cvicious and they stick together.\u201d\n\nTrump also criticized his Republican critics on Twitter, writing: \u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d\n\nBefore the hearing room was stormed, dozens of House Republicans appeared before reporters with some denouncing the impeachment process as a \u201cjoke,\u201d a \u201crailroad job,\u201d a \u201ccharade\u201d and \u201cSoviet-style.\u201d They complained that testimony was being taken privately rather than in public hearings and that the House did not hold a vote formally authorizing the investigation.\n\nRepublicans who are members of the three committees have taken part in the process throughout.\n\nU.S. House Republicans speak to reporters after Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper arrived to testify at a closed-door deposition as part of the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Trump led by the House Intelligence, House Foreign Affairs and House Oversight and Reform Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso T\n\nWITNESS TESTIFIES\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, began testifying on Wednesday afternoon after the standoff ended, an Intelligence Committee official said. Cooper was expected to face questions about Trump\u2019s decision this year to withhold $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine approved by Congress.\n\nIn testimony to the inquiry on Tuesday, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, said Trump had made the aid contingent on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announcing he would conduct politically motivated investigations that Trump demanded.\n\nTaylor said he was told by the U.S. envoy to the European Union that Trump had linked the aid\u2019s release to public declarations by Zelenskiy that he would investigate Biden, his son Hunter Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nSo far, few Republicans have appeared inclined toward Trump\u2019s removal, though there have been some cracks in their support. Senator John Thune, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, told reporters that the picture painted by Taylor\u2019s testimony \u201cbased on the reporting that we\u2019ve seen is not a good one.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges known as articles of impeachment, prompting a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers hope to complete the impeachment inquiry by year\u2019s end and are coalescing around two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction, lawmakers and aides told Reuters.\n\nDemocratic Representative David Cicilline told reporters that holding the depositions in private protects the integrity of the inquiry.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons you do these in private is because you want to prevent witnesses from attempting to align their testimony to the testimony of another witness by watching it or reading a transcript. It\u2019s how you protect the integrity of any investigation,\u201d Cicilline said.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nDemocratic Representative Eric Swalwell added, \u201cWe see this as an effort not only to intimidate this witness but also to intimidate future witnesses from coming forward. It\u2019s not going to work. We\u2019re not going to be deterred.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, triggered by a whistleblower complaint against Trump by a person within the U.S. intelligence community, focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to carry out those two investigations. Zelenskiy agreed during the call. The aid was later provided.\n\nFederal election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.", "description": "A U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry devolved into chaos on Wednesday as Republican lawmakers, encouraged by President Donald Trump to get tougher in fighting Democratic efforts to impeach him, stormed into a high-security hearing room and delayed testimony by a key Pentagon witness.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444186525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1NZ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
