It\u2019s not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.\u201d\n\nIt is the third time in 40 years in which warming halted ozone depletion, as similar weather patterns led to unusually small ozone holes between 1988 and 2002, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rare event that we\u2019re still trying to understand,\u201d Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with the Universities Space Research Association, said in a statement. \u201cIf the warming hadn\u2019t happened, we\u2019d likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole.\u201d\n\nBut researchers added that these scientific events are not linked to climate change.\n\nThe weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole, known as \u201csudden stratospheric warming\u201d events, were 29 degrees higher than average. NASA said this weather event also helped to weaken the Antarctic polar vortex \u2014 a high speed of air which circles around the South Pole.", "description": "The hole in the ozone has reached its smallest size since 1982 due to unusual weather patterns in the upper atmosphere above Antarctica.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ozone-map-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
