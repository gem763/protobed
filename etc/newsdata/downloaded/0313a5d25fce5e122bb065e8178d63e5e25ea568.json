The election is about Trump, period.\"\n\nTrump hasn't responded often to his Republican primary challengers, but in a tweet back in August, he called Walsh \"a one-time BAD Congressman from Illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide, then failed in radio.\"\n\nSEN. RON JOHNSON: JAMES COMEY, JOHN BRENNAN HAVE CORRUPTED FBI AND CIA\n\nWalsh called Trump a \"traitor\" earlier in the segment and said he would vote to impeach the commander-in-chief if he were still in Congress, following Trump's call for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Walsh also said he didn't think Trump was guilty of treason.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This president betrayed his country again this week,\" Walsh said. \"Would I vote if I were in Congress on the [impeachment] inquiry?... He stood on the White House lawn... and told two additional foreign governments to interfere in our election. That alone is impeachable. This is a strong term I\u2019m going to use, but I\u2019m going to say it on purpose: Donald Trump is a traitor.\n\n\"Now, I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about treason. Right? People on both sides... have been irresponsible using that word, treason,\" he continued. \"I\u2019m not accusing this president of treason. Our founders were very specific as to what treason is. But, when you look at 'traitor' more broadly defined, this president betrayed our country again this week, and it\u2019s not the first time he did it.\"", "description": "President Trump represents a traitorous threat to the security of the United States and isn't\u00a0worth voting for next November, according to 2020 presidential candidate and former Congressman, Joe Walsh.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
