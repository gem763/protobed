The sloth of credit rating agencies and the laziness of bank credit committees allowed Turkey to struggle on a year or two longer than it should have, but the collapse of the Turkish lira this week after a long, sickening decline surprised no-one.\n\nTurkey\u2019s volatile president Recep Tayyip Erdogan might have put off the crisis, but instead decided to butt heads with US President Trump over the arrest of an American Protestant minister for alleged terrorism.\n\nAt 9:20 am Eastern time, Turkey\u2019s lira was trading at 6.5 to the US dollar, or less than a third of what the currency was worth in 2014. Turkey\u2019s economy is headed for extreme levels of inflation as the price of imports jumps, amid a severe contraction of output as the cost of production inputs rises out of the reach of Turkish businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey will end up as \u201can economic satrapy of China,\u201d as I predicted last November . President Erdogan in effect threw himself on the mercy of China in a barely-coherent speech earlier today.\n\nTurkey\u2019s economy is likely to shrink by 10% to 20% before the bleeding stops, as I predicted June 12. Erdogan\u2019s supposed economic miracle followed the old formula of Third World kleptocracies of the past, namely massive domestic credit issuance supported by massive foreign borrowing. Turks bought foreign consumer goods with the proceeds and the country\u2019s current account deficit swelled to 6.5% of national output. That\u2019s close to where the Greek current account deficit stood in early 2012 when the country\u2019s economy imploded.\n\nTurkish companies have borrowed roughly US$300 billion in foreign currency, and now have to repay it in devalued Turkish lira. Most of the debt was issued when the Turkish lira traded at less than 2 to the dollar. It now trades at more than 6 to the dollar, so the cost of debt service has tripled for Turkish borrowers with local-currency earnings.\n\nSome of the lending was financed by Turkish banks who borrowed dollars or euro from other banks in the short-term interbank market and lent them to their customers. If Turkish banks can\u2019t roll over their interbank exposure, the Turkish banking system will collapse. That won\u2019t happen because Spain\u2019s BBVA owns Turkey\u2019s largest bank, Garanti.\n\nClick here to view the chart.\n\nThe last time the Turkish lira blew up back in 2001, the country went to the International Monetary Fund for a loan and accepted strict austerity conditions in return for the bailout. Erdogan is unlikely to do so. In a rambling speech to supporters today, he said that Turkey was exploring alternatives with China, Russia, and Iran. Earlier in the week, Erdogan said that Turkey would issue so-called panda bonds in China\u2019s local-currency market.\n\nThat\u2019s just the door prize, judging from commentary on China\u2019s English-language television channel CGTN. The Chinese broadcaster quoted Turkish economist Emre Alkin: \u201cStability for the Turkish Lira will come from cooperation with valuable countries like China. It\u2019s impossible for the Central Bank to do something alone, resources are needed. If this resource will come from China, then it will come from China, but the important thing is to make use of this resource. It is clear we need the wisdom, the ideas and the suggestions of countries like China.\u201d\n\nTurkey will have to sell some of the state\u2019s most important assets. With the Turkish lira trading at 6.26 to the dollar, the whole of the Istanbul 100 equity index is worth just US$35 billion. If Chinese investors were to buy every share of every company on the stock index, Turkey would raise enough foreign exchange to cover just seven months of its current account deficit. Turkey will have to sell a great deal more than its publicly traded companies to raise the money it requires, and it will also have to tighten its belt drastically.\n\nAltay Atli, a Turkish economist and past contributor to Asia Times, told the Chinese television station that Turkey will offer China more partnerships in its ports and other transportation infrastructure. China\u2019s state-owned shipping company COSCO Pacific already owns 65% of Turkey\u2019s third largest port. Atli said, \u201cI believe Turkey and China could also expand their partnerships in Turkey\u2019s other ports, in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Aegean Sea, and at the Black Sea. And a critical move is not just to combine these ports with railway projects and extend the lines, but to create a logistical network.\u201d\n\nChina has the opportunity to undertake the Sinification of Turkey at low cost. China\u2019s largest telecom equipment company Huawei already is working on 5G Internet with Turk Telecom, in a deal covering cloud computing, the Internet of Things and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 public security. Alibaba, China\u2019s answer to Amazon and Google, invested earlier this year in Turkey\u2019s e-commerce platform Trendyol.\n\nThe combination of mobile broadband, rail and sea logistics, e-commerce and e-finance will absorb Turkey into the greater Chinese economy. Not long from now containers of Chinese-made parts will arrive by rail in Anatolia for assembly into finished products to be sold in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nPresident Erdogan will be able to shake his fist at Washington and talk of Turkish national pride, while turning his country into a satrapy of China.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Asia Times.", "description": "Like the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War .09/28/2019 20:17:29PM EST.", "authors": ["David P.
