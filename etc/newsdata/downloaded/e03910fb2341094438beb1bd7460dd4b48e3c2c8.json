It's time for them to act. Time is up. They're on the clock.\"\n\nThe problem has been acute. Over the weekend, Ohio's most populous county reported 10 deaths from drug overdoses in just a 26-hour period that ended Sunday morning. Fentanyl use was suspected.\n\nWorse, it's been part of a shocking trend, with overdose deaths related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids up over 800 percent since 2013.\n\nAt home and abroad, President Trump has targeted the fight against fentanyl as one of his administration's most important goals, even giving the Department of Health and Human Services $1.8 billion to help states and communities fight the crisis.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"This is like a war-like situation,\" Trump said at a rally in New Mexico in September.\n\nA situation unlike any other, where the drugs come from all over the globe and the casualties come from all walks of life here at home.", "description": "Director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy Jim Carroll told Fox News on Tuesday\u00a0the Trump administration expects China to do more to help fight the fentanyl epidemic.", "authors": ["Kevin Corke"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/01/694940094001_6091073945001_6091075122001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
