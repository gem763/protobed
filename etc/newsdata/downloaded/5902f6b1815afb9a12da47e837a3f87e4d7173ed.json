Here are cities with high working poor populations", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Steve Gadsby, owner of FurnaceUSA, a heating and cooling installation company, shares his top tricks to keep your home warm and your heating bill down. USA TODAY\n\nThough the U.S. unemployment rate reached 3.6% in April 2019, its lowest point since December 1969, many full-time workers in America struggle to stay out of poverty. Nationwide, about 3.1 million full-time workers, or 3% of all full-time workers, are working poor \u2013 individuals who work full-time, year-round jobs and earn incomes below the poverty line.\n\nThough having a full-time job lowers the likelihood of living in poverty, it is no guarantee. For reference, the general poverty rate is 14.6%.\n\nTo determine the cities where having a job does not keep you out of poverty, 24/7 Wall St. measured the ratio of the official poverty rate in each metro area to that area\u2019s poverty rate among full-time, year-round workers ages 16 to 64. Nationwide, Americans with a full-time, year-round job are 4.9 times less likely than the general public to live in poverty.\n\nAmong cities on this list, having a job is less advantageous, and full-time workers are 3.6 times less likely to twice as likely to stay out of poverty as the general public.\n\nOf the 20 cities on this list, five are in Texas and three are in Louisiana.\n\nUber expands helicopter service: All users with iPhones in New York City\n\nStates with the highest and lowest household income: Maryland leads the way, data shows\n\nBakersfield, Calif. (Photo: DenisTangneyJr / Getty Images)\n\n20. Bakersfield, California\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 6.3%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 22.6% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 8% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 39 hours (top 40%)\n\nNationwide, Americans who work full-time, year-round are 4.9 times less likely to be in poverty than the general public. In Bakersfield, full-time workers are 3.6 times less likely to live below the poverty line. One reason for the relatively high rate of working poverty in the city may be the large number of low-wage agricultural jobs.\n\nAbout 19.1% of workers in Bakersfield are employed in agriculture, the fifth-largest share in the nation. The average agricultural worker earns $562 a week, among the least of any metropolitan agricultural sector and less than half the $1,101 average weekly wage for all U.S. workers.\n\n19. Dalton, Georgia\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 5.3%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 18.9% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 4.6% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 38.7 hours (top 40%)\n\nDalton is one of many manufacturing-dependent metro areas in the South with a large share of working adults living in poverty. About 43.6% of workers in Dalton are employed in the manufacturing sector, the fifth-largest share of any U.S. city. The average wage for manufacturing workers in Dalton is $850 a week, far less than both the average of $1,318 for the sector nationwide and the average of $1,101 for all U.S. workers.\n\nAbout 5.3% of Dalton residents who work full-time live in poverty, about one-fourth the 18.9% poverty rate for all residents. Nationwide, the 3% working poverty rate is roughly one-fifth the 14.6% official poverty rate.\n\n18. Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, South Carolina\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 3.8%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 13.4% (bottom 40%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3.2% (bottom 30%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 39.9 hours (top 10%)\n\nA vacation destination for roughly 2.7 million visitors every year, the Hilton Head Island metro area is one of several tourist hubs where a relatively large share of full-time workers live in poverty because of low-wage jobs. About 15.6% of the Hilton Head workforce is employed in the leisure and hospitality sector, the seventh-largest share of any metro area. The average worker in leisure and hospitality earns $430 a week, less than half the $1,101 average weekly wage for workers across all industries nationwide. Leisure and hospitality is another sector that can pay full-time workers poverty wages.\n\nNationwide, Americans who work full-time year-round are 4.9 times less likely to be in poverty than the general public. In Hilton Head, full-time workers are 3.5 times less likely to live below the poverty line.\n\n17. Lake Charles, Louisiana\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 4.7%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 16.5% (top 40%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3.5% (bottom 50%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 39.7 hours (top 20%)\n\nFull- and part-time workers in Lake Charles work for an average of 39.7 hours a week \u2013 a full hour longer than the national figure. Despite the longer workweek, 4.7% of full-time, year-round workers in Lake Charles live in poverty, far more than the 3% national working poverty rate.\n\nOne factor contributing to the relatively large share of working poor in Lake Charles may be the population's low educational attainment. Areas with low educational attainment are less likely to attract advanced industries and often have relatively few high-wage jobs available. In Lake Charles, 21.4% of adults have a bachelor's degree, far less than the 30.9% national rate.\n\n16. Coeur d'Alene, Idaho\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 3.6%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 12.6% (bottom 30%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3.5% (bottom 50%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 37.9 hours (bottom 40%)\n\nSituated on the northern shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Coeur d'Alene metro area is one of several resort towns where low-wage jobs keep a relatively large share of full-time workers in poverty. About 8.8% of the Coeur d'Alene workforce is employed in the leisure and hospitality sector, far more than the 5.5% national figure. The average wage of hospitality workers is $355 a week, far less than the weekly average wage of $1,101 for workers across all industries nationwide and a poverty wage for a family of three.\n\nNationwide, Americans who work full-time, year-round jobs are 4.9 times less likely to be in poverty than the general population. In Coeur d'Alene, full-time workers are 3.5 times less likely to live below the poverty line.\n\nGoldsboro, North Carolina (Photo: 39955793@N07 / Flickr)\n\n15. Goldsboro, North Carolina\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 6.1%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 21.2% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 4.4% (top 30%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 39.5 hours (top 20%)\n\nIn Goldsboro, 19.7% of adults have a bachelor's degree, far less than the 30.9% national college attainment rate. Individuals without a college degree are less likely to have high-paying jobs, and areas with low educational attainment tend to have fewer high-paying industries such as information and finance. In Goldsboro, just 0.6% of the workforce is employed in the information sector, a fraction of the 4.5% national share. About 5.3% of workers are employed in finance, less than half the 11.0% national figure.\n\nThe average worker in Goldsboro earns $720 a week, $381 less than the average earnings for all U.S. workers. About 6.1% of full-time, year-round workers live in poverty, more than twice the 3% national working poverty rate.\n\n14. Alexandria, Louisiana\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 5.7%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 19.6% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 4.7% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 40.1 hours (top 10%)\n\nTwo factors contributing to the large share of working poor in Alexandria may be low educational attainment and a lack of advanced, high-paying industry. In Alexandria, 18.3% of adults have a bachelor's degree, far less than the 30.9% national college attainment rate. In Alexandria, 1% of the workforce is employed in information, far less than the 4.5% national share. About 5.2% of workers have jobs in the financial activities sector, less than half the 11% national figure.\n\n13. Monroe, Louisiana\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 7.1%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 24.2% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 4.9% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 38.6 hours (top 50%)\n\nIn Monroe, 22.8% of adults have a bachelor's degree, far less than the 30.9% national rate. Because of the presence of low-wage industries, the average worker in Monroe earns $766 a week, $335 less than the U.S. average.\n\nOf the estimated 20,097 adults with a full-time, year-round job in Monroe, 7.1% live in poverty \u2013 the fifth-highest working poverty rate of any U.S. metro area.\n\n12. Decatur, Alabama\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 4.9%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 16.6% (top 40%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3.1% (bottom 30%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 38.4 hours (bottom 50%)\n\nIn Decatur, 18.5% of adults have a bachelor's degree, far less than the 30.9% national college attainment rate. In Decatur, 0.6% of workers are employed in the information sector, a fraction of the 4.5% national share. About 4.8% work in finance, less than half the 11% of U.S. workers employed in the sector nationwide.\n\nThe lack of high-wage industries may diminish the advantage of having a full-time job in the struggle to stay out of poverty. Nationwide, having a full-time, year-round job makes one 4.9 times more likely to live above the poverty line than the general population. In Decatur, full-time workers are 3.4 times as likely to not live in poverty.\n\n11. Sebring, Florida\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 5.7%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 18.7% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 5.1% (top 20%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 37.8 hours (bottom 30%)\n\nIn south central Florida, Sebring is one of America's poorest cities. The typical household earns $36,374 a year, the second-lowest median household income of any U.S. metro area. About 5.1% of the workforce is unemployed, and 18.7% of residents live in poverty \u2013 each among the highest such figures of any city.\n\nEven those fortunate enough to have a full-time job struggle to stay out of poverty. About 5.7% of workers with full-time, year-round jobs in Sebring live below the poverty line, the 11th-highest working poverty rate of any city.\n\nAmarillo, Texas (Photo: RoschetzkyIstockPhoto / Getty Images)\n\n10. Amarillo, Texas\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 4.6%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 15% (bottom 50%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 2.5% (bottom 10%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 40 hours (top 10%)\n\nHaving a job increases the likelihood of living above the poverty line by 4.9 times nationwide. In Amarillo, a full-time job increases the likelihood of not being poor by 3.3 times. About 4.6% of the full-time workforce in Amarillo lives in poverty, compared with the 15% poverty rate for all residents of the metro area. Nationwide, 3% of the full-time workforce lives in poverty, and the national poverty rate is 14.6%.\n\nOne factor that may contribute to the relatively small difference between the working and official poverty rates in Amarillo may be the low educational attainment. Areas with low educational attainment are less likely to attract advanced industries and often have few high-wage jobs available. About 23.5% of adults in Amarillo have a college degree, far less than the 30.9% national rate.\n\n9. Gainesville, Georgia\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 5.2%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 16.1% (top 40%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3% (bottom 20%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 39.8 hours (top 10%)\n\nGainesville is one of many manufacturing-dependent metro areas in the South where a large share of working adults live in poverty. About 25.1% of workers in Gainesville are employed in the manufacturing sector, more than twice the 12.2% national share. The average manufacturing worker in Gainesville earns $879 a week, far less than the $1,318 average for the sector nationwide and the $1,101 average for all U.S. workers.\n\nAbout 5.2% of Gainesville residents who work full-time live in poverty, about one-third the 16.1% poverty rate for all residents. Nationwide, the 3% working poverty rate is nearly one-fifth the 14.6% official poverty rate.\n\n8. Laredo, Texas\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 10.2%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 31.5% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3.6% (bottom 50%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 38.8 hours (top 40%)\n\nIn Laredo, full-time workers are 3.1 times as likely to not live in poverty.\n\nOne factor diminishing the advantage of having a full-time job is the abundance of low-wage jobs. Along the U.S.-Mexican border, Laredo is the nation's busiest inland trade port in terms of the total value of goods imported and exported. About 43.5% of workers are employed in the trade, transportation and utilities sector \u2013 the largest share of any city. Workers in the sector earn an average wage of $690 a week, $411 less than the average wage for all workers nationwide.\n\n7. Las Cruces, New Mexico\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 9.2%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 27.9% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 5.6% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 37.2 hours (bottom 20%)\n\nLas Cruces is one of the poorest metro areas in the country. The typical Las Cruces household earns $18,538 less a year than the U.S. median, and 27.9% of residents live in poverty \u2013 the fourth-highest poverty rate of any city. About 5.6% of the workforce is unemployed, far more than the 3.7% national unemployment rate.\n\nEven those with a job in Las Cruces struggle more than the average U.S. worker to stay out of poverty. Among the 55,160 adults with a full-time, year-round job in Las Cruces, 9.2% live below the poverty line \u2013 more than three times the national working poverty rate.\n\n6. St. George, Utah\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 4.7%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 14.2% (bottom 40%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 3.1% (bottom 30%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 36.3 hours (bottom 10%)\n\nThough increased tourist activity in St. George fueled economic growth in the metro area in recent years, low-wage jobs in the industry may be one reason why full-time workers in the metro area live in poverty. About 8% of the St. George workforce is employed in leisure and hospitality, far more than the 5.5% national figure and one of the largest shares of any city. The average hospitality worker in St. George earns $341 a week, less than one-third the $1,101 average earnings for all workers nationwide.\n\nOverall, about 4.7% of full-time, year-round workers in St. George live in poverty, about a third of the official poverty rate of 14.2% in the city.\n\nSan Angelo, Texas (Photo: DenisTangneyJr / Getty Images)\n\n5.

Despite the long hours, 4.4% of full-time, year-round workers live in poverty.\n\nOne factor contributing to the large share of working poor may be the lack of high-paying job opportunities in the metro area. Though San Angelo is adjacent to the Permian Basin and has one of the largest natural resources and mining sectors of any city, relatively few workers are employed in other high-wage industries. Just 8.3% of workers have jobs in professional and business services, less than half the 22% national share.\n\n4. Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 10.8%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 31.2% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 5.4% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 38.1 hours (bottom 40%)\n\nOn the southern tip of Texas along the U.S.-Mexican border, the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area is one of the poorest cities in the country. The typical household earns $36,374 a year, the lowest median household income of any metro. About 5.4% of the labor force is unemployed, and 31.2% of residents live in poverty \u2013 each among the highest such figures of any city.\n\nEven residents with full-time jobs struggle with poverty. Of the estimated 103,936 adults with full-time, year-round jobs in Brownsville, 10.8% live below the poverty line \u2013 more than three times the 3% national working poverty rate.\n\n3. Idaho Falls, Idaho\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 4%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 11.5% (bottom 20%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 2.3% (bottom 10%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 38 hours (bottom 40%)\n\nAlong the Snake River between Grand Teton National Park and Sawtooth National Forest, Idaho Falls is one of several small, tourist-friendly metro areas with low income inequality, where the difference in the likelihood of living in poverty between those with and without a job is relatively small. Full-time workers are 2.9 times as likely to not live in poverty.\n\nNationwide, individuals with a college degree are 5.9 times as likely as those who did not graduate from high school to not live in poverty. In Idaho Falls, college graduates are 3.1 times as likely to not be in poverty \u2013 the fifth-smallest difference of any city.\n\n2. McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas\n\n\u2022 Poverty rate of full-time workforce: 11.3%\n\n\u2022 Official poverty rate: 31.8% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 June unemployment rate: 5.9% (top 10%)\n\n\u2022 Avg. workweek: 39.2 hours (top 30%)\n\nOn the U.S.-Mexican border, the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metro area is a major port of trade. About 28.5% of workers are employed in the trade, transportation and utilities sector, the 12th-largest share of any city. The average trade worker in the metro area earns $649 a week, $267 below the average for the sector nationwide and $452 below the average earnings for all U.S. workers.\n\nThe prevalence of low-wage industries and other poor economic conditions leave many full-time workers in McAllen struggling to stay out of poverty. Of the 203,360 workers with full-time, year-round jobs in McAllen, 11.3% live below the poverty line \u2013 more than three times the 3% national working poverty rate.\n\nBoston, Seattle: Cities with the most college graduates in every state\n\nThe Villages, Florida (Photo: Michael Warren / Getty Images)\n\n1.

About 25% of workers are employed in education and health services, and 9.5% are employed in leisure and hospitality \u2013 each among the largest share of any city. The average wage for workers in the education and health services and leisure and hospitality sectors are $835 and $405 a week, respectively, far less than the $1,101 average pay for all workers nationwide.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the cities where having a job does not keep you out of poverty, 24/7 Wall St. measured the ratio of the official poverty rate to the poverty rate among full-time, year-round workers ages 16 to 64 in metropolitan areas using five-year data for 2013 to 2017 from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. The cities on this list are those where the ratio is the smallest.\n\nData on the mean hours worked per week, median household income and the share of adults age 25 and over with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree also came from the ACS. Data on unemployment came from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are seasonally adjusted for June. Data on employment and average weekly wage by industry came from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program of the BLS and are for 2018.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
