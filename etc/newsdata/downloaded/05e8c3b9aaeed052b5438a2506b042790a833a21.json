Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStephanie Grisham has been the White House press secretary for nearly three months. In that time, she has held the same number of press briefings that Sarah Sanders held in the three months before she gave up the job. That number is zero.\n\nGrisham may not talk to the media, but she will talk to the hosts of Fox & Friends. She appeared Monday on President Trump\u2019s favorite show and said the press briefing will remain dead, at least until Trump decides to revive it. \u201cI mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it\u2019s something we should do, we can do that, but right now he\u2019s doing just fine,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the press briefings under Sean Spicer and Sanders had become \u201ctheater,\u201d with reporters using the opportunity to ask questions of the government as a chance to become \u201cfamous.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox\u2019s Brian Kilmeade asked Grisham if Trump \u201ctook it personal\u201d when the press was combative with her predecessors, she confirmed it. Spicer and Sanders were not able to \u201cget his message out there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t being good to his people. And he doesn\u2019t like that. He is very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary: Trump ended press briefings because reporters \"weren't being good to his people. He doesn't like that.

It\u2019s not the American public, which benefits from the media\u2019s ability to interrogate the White House. They\u2019re Trump\u2019s lackeys, who he\u2019s is unfailingly loyal to, right up until the moment he\u2019s not.", "description": "On Fox News, White House Press Secretary Stefanie Grisham said press briefings ended because the media was not \u201cgood\u201d to Trump\u2019s people.", "authors": ["Adam K.
