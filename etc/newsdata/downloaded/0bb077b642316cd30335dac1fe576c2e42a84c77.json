Satisfactory is the second best category after \u201cgood\u201d.\n\nSouth Africa is on par in the \u201csatisfactory\u201d category with countries like Australia, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, the UK, Austria and Uruguay. In Africa it joins the ranks of Namibia, Burkina Faso and Ghana.\n\nThe index was released ahead of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May.\n\nThe World Press Freedom Index looks at several factors in ranking countries. It examines whether and how many journalists were killed in a particular country and if journalists have been jailed. It also considers countries\u2019 legislative framework as well as national debates about the media.\n\nIn South Africa\u2019s case the researchers would have taken into account comments made by the country\u2019s head of state President Cyril Ramaphosa as well as those made by the leader of second largest opposition party, Julius Malema. Malema has a chequered history with the media, openly attacking it at times and threatening journalists on social media.\n\nThis could be one of the reasons why South Africa was put in the category of \u201csatisfactory\u201d. While there has been hostility towards the media, no journalists have been killed or jailed. Nor has Ramaphosa used vitriolic expletives against journalists \u2013 as US President Donald Trump has done \u2013 when challenged.\n\nI believe South Africa is in the category it deserves, though there are some worrying trends that need to be watched closely. These might explain why the country has dropped three places since last year. Hints of these emerged recently with the deputy secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC) attacked a journalist for asking a questions she didn\u2019t like. The other worrying trend has been a rise in misogyny on social media directed at women journalists.\n\nThere is an obvious and direct relationship between democracy, freedom of the press, diversity of media, freedom of expression. When democracy gets squeezed, journalists get the backlash. When journalists get the backlash democracy itself is squeezed.\n\nThe categories\n\nThe index has five categories.\n\nThe first is \u201cgood\u201d. Only a few countries are listed here, and most are in Europe.\n\nThe second category is \u201csatisfactory\u201d. Again, the list isn\u2019t very long. Along with South Africa it includes Australia, Canada and the UK.\n\nThe third category is \u201cproblematic\u201d. The US, as well as Brazil, Mongolia and Niger, appear on this list.\n\nThe fourth category is \u201cdifficult\u201d. Countries included here are Russia, India, Mexico, Venezuela, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.\n\nThe fifth category is \u201cvery serious\u201d. This list includes countries that have been the worst culprits over the past decade when it comes to the mistreatment of journalists. Among them are China, Turkmenistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Egypt and Libya.\n\nIn terms of first and last out of 180 countries: Norway is number one, Finland is two, Netherlands is number 3. At the bottom end of the list is Turkmenistan, with North Korea second last.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, but not surprising, that the US is down from the last index. When Trump took power he labelled any journalist who challenged him as \u201cfake news\u201d and as \u201cfakery\u201d.\n\nVenezuela and Russia also lost points on the index from the previous year.\n\nThe countries at the bottom \u2013 for example, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Vietnam, China, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan \u2013 have all variously and to different degrees made it impossible for journalists to do their jobs freely. Journalists have been under surveillance, arrested, jailed, killed and harassed.\n\nAfrican situation\n\nIn Africa, Namibia holds its number one place, and makes it to 23 in the world index.\n\nEthiopia deserves a huge mention for making a 40-place jump up the index.\n\nAfrica\u2019s two really poor performers are Sudan, which stands at 175 out of 180 countries in the world, and Somalia, which is regarded as the deadliest country in Africa for killings.\n\nIn the case of South Africa, the report attached to the index notes that the country\u2019s 1996 Constitution protects the freedom of its very diverse media. But, it notes, apartheid-era legislation and new terrorism laws passed in 2004 are used to limit coverage of governments institutions when \u201cnational interest\u201d is supposedly at stake.\n\nThe report also notes that the state security agency spies on some journalists and taps their phones. Others are harassed and subjected to intimidation campaigns if they try to cover certain subjects involving the governing ANC, government finances, the redistribution of land to the black population or corruption.\n\nIt notes that an increase in abusive language and hate speech against journalists by an opposition leader in 2018 confirmed that press freedom has yet to be consolidated in South Africa.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed\n\nFor democracy to work, the press has to be free \u2013 both independent of political party interference as well as free from commercial conflicts of interests as far as possible. Journalists must serve the interests of the public and be conduits of reliable information.\n\nThis is an important function. The free flow of information is vital, particularly on the eve of a national election.\n\n- Glenda Daniels is associate professor in Media Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
