REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nThe deal, structured to give SoftBank an 80% stake in - but not control of - WeWork, takes its total investment to more than $13 billion, with the money-losing startup now valued at just $8 billion.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s shares have fallen 30% from their July peak as investor scepticism grows over the path to profitability for its cash-burning marquee investments like WeWork and publicly listed Uber Technologies Inc.\n\n(For a graphic on 'SoftBank Group stock price' click tmsnrt.rs/35XXuS3)\n\nThe deal adds to the financial strains at the highly leveraged group, which is structured to avoid having to consolidate WeWork on its books or take responsibility for WeWork\u2019s onerous lease obligations.\n\nAlthough SoftBank has an army of retail investors in yield-strapped Japan willing to buy its junk bonds, it already holds about 5 trillion yen ($46 billion) of net debt on its balance sheet - more than half its 9 trillion yen market capitalization.\n\nThe cost of default protection on SoftBank Group has risen, with the 5-year credit default swap jumping 17.7 points in a week to the highest level since January.\n\nThe disarray at WeWork, which is scrambling for cash following a flopped IPO attempt, comes as SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son struggles to raise money for a successor to his $100 billion Vision Fund, sources told Reuters this month.\n\nSon has often spoken of his strategy of betting on ambitious founders, who will use SoftBank\u2019s generous cash injections to push for rapid growth - an approach that come under scrutiny from skeptical investors.\n\nAt WeWork, SoftBank has acted to remove co-founder and face of the company Adam Neumann, first as chief executive and now from the board of WeWork\u2019s parent, following the botched IPO and concerns over corporate governance.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, will become WeWork\u2019s executive chairman, adding to his hodgepodge of roles including heading a $5 billion Latin America-focused fund and getting the tie-up between Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc through regulators.\n\nWeWork is \u201ca searing indictment of SoftBank\u2019s valuation and screening methodology, which needs to shift towards being based on fundamentals,\u201d independent analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a blog post.\n\nSoftBank, which argues its valuation methods are based on standard industry practice, faces chunky writedowns on many of its tech bets when it reports second-quarter earnings next month.\n\nJapan\u2019s benchmark index was flat on Wednesday as trading restarted following a public holiday.", "description": "Shares of SoftBank Group Corp fell 3% in morning trade on Wednesday as the tech conglomerate agreed to spend more than $10 billion to take over beleaguered office-space sharing startup WeWork, adding to its financial pressures.", "authors": ["Sam Nussey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443966486&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M01R", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
