He arrived on the red carpet brandishing a bag of everything bagels like an Olympic torch, which he brought to the viewing in response to fan\u2019s request on Twitter.\n\nChalamet is a regular at Tompkins Square Bagels in the East Village, and has been spotted there on several occasions, most recently with his paramour Lily-Rose Depp. Depp plays Chalemet\u2019s movie wife, Catherine of Valois; Limoth\u00e9e were both present at last night\u2019s premier, the latter in massive Chanel diamonds.\n\nEarlier I asked \u201cdo you think timothee chalamet pregamed this with Tompkins Square Bagels\u201d? and then he came and hANDED US BAGELS and said \u201cEVERYBODY EATS\u201d like ok manifest energy come THRU @RealChalamet pic.twitter.com/udkomzNgtF \u2014 Shar\u00f2ne (@sharonnkimm) October 1, 2019\n\nThe bagel offering was charming, but its worth noting the 23-year-old has been a red-carpet fixture for some time now; a sartorial boundary pusher, he stepped up his already excellent suit game this past year with the aforementioned bib at the Golden Globes, and again with a cinched lavender suit at Venice.\n\nThis is likely Chalamet\u2019s final red carpet for The King, Netflix\u2019s big period piece play for awards this season. The actor, sporting a divisive bowlcut, plays the young King Henry V, a departure (somewhat) from his usual role as a confused, modern-day teen. The film also stars Robert Pattinson, also with questionable hair, and Joel Edgerton, who co-wrote the script. So far, critical reception has been mixed. The King premiers in theaters on October 11 and hits Netflix November 1:", "description": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet brought a bag of Tompkin\u2019s Square Bagel\u2019s to the red carpet of \u201cThe King\u201d in New York.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-timothee-chalamet.w1200.h630.jpg"}
