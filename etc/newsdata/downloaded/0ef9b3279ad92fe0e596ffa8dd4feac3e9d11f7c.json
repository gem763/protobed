(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nSome Trump-CNN watershed moments:\n\nNow the president is adding a fresh bullet point:\n\nGreat news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN, perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible \u201canchors.\u201d Also, I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me, \u201cWhy does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much?\u201d It is a fraudulent shame, & all comes from the top! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nThe tweets reference a news story that surfaced Monday morning, regarding the move by activist hedge fund Elliott Management to secure a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T. The objective, stated the activist outfit, was to boost AT&T\u2019s stock price with improved \u201cstrategic focus\u201d and other principles of good business. Does that mean selling off Time Warner and CNN? \u201cWhile it is too soon to tell whether AT&T can create value with Time Warner, we remain cautious on the benefits of this combination. AT&T has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT&T needs to own Time Warner,\u201d reads a letter from Elliott Management.\n\nAs New York Times reporter Ken Vogel pointed out on Twitter, Elliott Management isn\u2019t just some faceless finance outfit:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The \"activist investor\" in question here is GOP mega-donor PAUL SINGER, who donated $1M to TRUMP's inauguration, & has met with the president multiple times since.\n\n\n\n* A Singer-backed group previously funded the Fusion GPS research that became the Russia dossier. https://t.co/fy1oerWeSQ \u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 9, 2019\n\nAs CNN\u2019s own report on the Elliott stake points out, this power move gives the company just a bit more than a 1 percent stake in AT&T, ranking it as the sixth-largest institutional owner. It would have to rally other stakeholders to force a restructuring of the company\u2019s assets. A company spokesman spoke up:\n\nIn case you hear differently, CNN is having its most profitable year in history. Last month the network delivered its highest August ratings on record and won the prime time demo - beating both Fox and MSNBC. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Matt Dornic (@mdornic) September 9, 2019\n\nIn other news, CNN reported Monday morning that the United States in 2017 extracted from Russia a top covert source in the Russian government. Key detail: \u201cA person directly involved in the discussions said that the removal of the Russian was driven, in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.\u201d\n\nIt was a reminder that CNN, whatever you may think of it, isn\u2019t going away. Cable news, for all its repetitive programming and deadening panel discussions, remains a great business. According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2019 report on the news media, profits in this sector were projected to increase in 2018 by 4 percent to $2.8 billion. Though Fox News accounts for the lion\u2019s share of that figure, its competitors are by no means paupers.\n\nPerhaps with those considerations in mind, AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said the following before the merger: \u201cWe\u2019re paying a premium to get Time Warner, and when you pay a big premium, the priority is to not screw it up. CNN\u2019s doing quite well, and the priority is to keep management teams in place.\u201d Upending cable-news formulas is a risky proposition, one that explains why CNN continues behaving like CNN, MSNBC like MSNBC and Fox News, lamentably, like Fox News.\n\nWatch:\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: A shocking CNN scoop confirms: Officials are defending our country from Trump\n\nErik Wemple: CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta cites access threat from White House\u2019s Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nErik Wemple: What can CNN do to stop Trump\u2019s abuse?\n\nErik Wemple: Speak up, April Ryan.
