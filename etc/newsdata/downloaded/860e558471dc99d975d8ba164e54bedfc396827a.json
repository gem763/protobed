Yet, many works on the war in Afghanistan cover the accounts of military members and their tactical engagements. Sharifullah Dorani has written a short history of high-level U.S. policy making in Afghanistan, entitled America in Afghanistan: Foreign Policy and Decision Making from Bush to Obama to Trump. The book reviews the major decisions of the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations. Dorani covers this well-tilled ground in an interesting, locally informed way and, unlike other works, brings it together in a single volume.\n\nDorani grew up in Kabul, living through the Soviet-Afghan war and then the civil war that followed. He and his family finally fled the country in 1994 because of the violence wracking Kabul. After the fall of the Taliban, he returned to work for several years. He then earned his doctorate at Durham University, going back and forth to Afghanistan over ten years to complete his research. America in Afghanistan is based on his doctoral dissertation.\n\nDorani brings an Afghan perspective to the debates that have played out in Washington. The major question he explores is: How did U.S. policy fail in stabilizing Afghanistan? He examines the decisions of each administration, describing how personality, domestic politics, economic factors, regional power politics, and ideology shaped the outcome. If he has a common criticism, it is that U.S. presidential administrations suffered from a lack of understanding and a narrow point of view: \u201cThe policy assumptions made by the Bush and Obama Administrations were ill-informed, misjudged and derived from rigid ideologies rather than realities on the ground.\u201d[1] The criticism is perhaps a tad harsh, but he performs a service in reminding outsiders to question how much they understand foreign lands.\n\nFor Dorani, Afghanistan could have been stabilized if the United States had done much more. Instead, the United States put in place a weak government that let Afghans fall prey to warlords and criminals. Dorani embraces the view that Afghanistan can only be peaceful if run by a \u201ca strong Afghan state\u201d with a strong army and police \u201cequipped with the necessary air and artillery power to defend itself\u2026deal effectively with the causes of the \u2018evil forces\u2019\u2026and instead install peace and security in the minds of ordinary Afghans.\u201d[2] His specific recommendations are that the United States should support the National Unity Government, strengthen the Afghan police and army capabilities, sustain support to civil society, and \u201cprovide concrete assistance and tangible backing to Ghani with his revolutionary reforms, especially his willingness to deal with corrupt elements in the Afghan state and his readiness to ensure the rule of law applies to everyone equally.\u201d[3] This last point is the most important. Dorani stresses that by far the greatest mistake of three U.S. administrations is that they \u201cdid not and would not support Hamid Karzai and later Ashraf Ghani against the criminality\u201d of warlords and power brokers \u201cwho fought the U.S. anti-terrorism war.\u201d[4]\n\nDorani differs from various other Afghans in not laying blame squarely at the feet of Pakistan. Though Pakistan is not let off the hook, Dorani is sober in recognizing the limitations of what the United States could do. He writes that the Bush and Obama Administrations were simply unable to stop \u201cPakistan supporting a host of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India as an instrument of its foreign policy.\u201d[5] His moderate recommendation is that the United States should \u201ccreate conditions in which the risks of the Pakistani Army\u2019s support of terrorism outweigh the benefits.\u201d[6] He especially advises against punishing ordinary Pakistanis, whom he compliments as having always been generous toward Afghans.", "description": "America in Afghanistan: Foreign Policy and Decision Making from Bush to Obama to Trump.
