ANZ, Westpac and NAB are scheduled to deliver full-year results over the next two weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty widely understood the major profit pools of the big four are under pressure, particularly with the capital impositions and the major bank levy and so on. Maybe short term it plugs the gap but over the longer term, consumers will take matters into their own hands,\u201d Mr Hyman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe RBA has cut rates three times since June as it looks to stimulate investment against a backdrop of sluggish growth. As the cash rate approaches zero, banks are increasingly unable to pass the full cuts through without damaging profitability.\n\nThe data has been collected from the online mortgage platform\u2019s user base of owner-occupier borrowers paying principal and interest with a loan-to-valuation ratio of less than 80 per cent.\n\nOn Lendi\u2019s data, a borrower with a $760,000 mortgage is being slugged with an additional $328 a month in repayments, or close to $4,000 a year. Mr Hyman said customers needed to be aware of the premium they were paying for loyalty to their bank.\n\n\u201cCustomers need to be aware of their options because, quite frankly, many cannot afford to keep paying a loyalty premium in the current economic climate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s these cost pressures on everyday households which are helping fuel demand for loans from the newer digital lenders who are passing on rate cuts quickly and in full.\u201d", "description": "The margin between what banks charge loyal customers and what they use to entice new business has soared since the RBA started cutting rates in June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb1a1f08b925e6a9c3b87ff3e6a51bfeb0b3e600", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
