Matthew O. Williams of Texas, who still serves in the Army.\n\nMr. Trump noted that it\u2019s \u201cvery rare\u201d for an active-duty soldier to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\n\u201cWe salute your unyielding service, your unbreakable resolve and your untiring devotion to our great nation,\u201d the president told Sgt. Williams. \u201cWe are forever grateful for your life of service and your outstanding courage.\u201d\n\nSgt. Williams was serving Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha when the firefight occurred on a mountainside of the Shok Valley in Afghanistan in April 2008.\n\nHis team was searching for a terrorist leader when the group of American soldiers and Afghan commandos took fire from \u201cintense enemy machine guns, snipers and rocket-propelled grenades,\u201d the Army said.\n\nThe president said the enemy had advantages in holding the higher ground, having superior numbers and using the element of surprise.\n\n\u201cBut they had one major disadvantage \u2014 they were facing the toughest, strongest, and best-trained soldiers anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNo adversary on earth stands a chance against the American Green Berets.\u201d\n\nSgt. Williams evacuated four wounded U.S. soldiers under heavy fire from insurgents. He also \u201cprevented the lead element of the assault force from being overrun by the enemy,\u201d the White House said.\n\nHe organized several Afghan commandos and braved enemy fire to lead a counterattack.\n\n\u201cAs the terrorists continued to try to overrun their position, Matt raced back into battle,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe fought for several more hours, valiantly protecting the wounded and putting his own life in great peril to save his comrades. Matt\u2019s incredible heroism helped ensure that not a single American soldier died in the Battle of Shok Valley.\u201d\n\nSgt. Williams told reporters, \u201cAt no point did I ever say, \u2018This is it, this is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe military initially awarded Sgt. Williams the Silver Star for his actions. The award was upgraded after a review of valor awards that began under then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter in 2016.\n\nAnother member of his unit, Staff Sgt. Ronald Shurer II, also received the Medal of Honor for the operation. Several members of their team were in attendance at the White House ceremony, as was Sgt. Williams\u2018 family.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
