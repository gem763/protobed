John Mokrzycki\n\nASX-listed Emeco is understood to have been in the data room in recent weeks, keen to work out exactly how buying one of its big customers could help its own financial situation. Sources told this column on Tuesday that while Emeco had not withdrawn, its interest had cooled with the company particularly worried about BGC Contracting's construction arm.\n\nAlso around the auction is fellow listed contractor NRW Holdings, although its interest is from outside the process. Sources said NRW was cut from the auction after the indicative bid phase last month, told its offer wasn't high enough.\n\nHowever, it has made it clear to BGC and its advisers that it continues to see logic in acquiring at least parts of BGC Contracting. Similarly it's understood Macquarie is keeping NRW at close call on the basis it could be re-engaged if other indicative offers aren't firmed up.", "description": "There's two Australian companies hanging around at up-for-sale mining and construction contractor BGC Contracting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6464%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ddcfcc72015864446ca04d22cad759b0525160b5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
