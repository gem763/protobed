The two ventures are struggling to agree on the terms for processing Browse gas at the North West Shelf venture plant near Karratha, which is running out of its own gas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Browse is the largest undeveloped gas resource in Australia,\" said Mr Ismayilov, who also noted his experience in working within \"complicated\" ventures such as the North West Shelf from his previous role in the huge and complex Shah Deniz Stage 2 project in Azerbaijan, which involves six partners and crosses seven countries.\n\n\"As part of the Browse JV, BP is working with its partners and government to bring that gas down to Karratha and help keep the North West Shelf facilities full.\"\n\nWhile BP walked away from the controversial Great Australian Bight exploration project off South Australia in 2016 it is continuing to explore and pursue developments off WA.\n\nMr Ismayilov pointed in particular to the Ironbark offshore prospect in the Carnarvon Basin, saying BP was \"very excited\" about the opportunity, where it is partnered by Cue Energy Resources, Beach Energy and New Zealand Oil and Gas.\n\nThe prospect, where an exploration well is targeted for late 2020, is close to North West Shelf offshore infrastructure.\n\n\"We are hopeful that it, too, will play a part in Australia\u2019s ongoing natural gas prosperity,\" he said.", "description": "The British oil and gas major is also exploring hydrogen, solar and more gas development opportunities in line with its emissions reductions effort.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1661%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_56/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c32708a40b6f13d5514c11dc7707be69d1421142", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
