They yelled, \u201cTake off your masks!\u201d One person was arrested.\n\nPolice later fired multiple rounds of tear gas into a crowd who were jeering and chanting slogans of the pro-democracy movement. They cleared the streets before retreating into the station, which had been closed to commuters.\n\nViolence also broke out in Tuen Mun, in the New Territories, police said, where protesters built barricades and damaged government offices.\n\nUSE OF FORCE\n\nLocal media Now TV and Cable TV reported the changes to the police procedures manual took effect on Sept. 30, the day before Tuesday\u2019s violence at widespread protests on China\u2019s National Day, during which the student was shot.\n\nReuters could not confirm when the changes were made, but has seen police documents that showed changes to some guidelines on how officers could act when considering force.\n\nThe updated guidelines also removed a line that said \u201cofficers will be accountable for their own actions\u201d, stating only that \u201cofficers on the ground should exercise their own discretion to determine what level of force is justified in a given situation\u201d.\n\nPolice declined to comment when asked if amendments had been made to the manual.\n\nA riot police officer fires pepper-spray projectile toward anti-government protesters demonstrating near the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong, China, September 29, 2019.

It may affect the normal and effective operation of the police force and work of police on crime prevention if details are made public,\u201d police said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s police have long been admired for their professionalism compared with some forces elsewhere in Asia.\n\nBut the public has become increasingly hostile towards the force over past weeks amid accusations of heavy-handed tactics. Police say they have shown restraint.\n\nThe unrest, which began over opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, shows no sign of letting up.\n\nTony Tsang, the 18-year-old who was shot at close range as he fought an officer with what appeared to be a white pole, has since been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting a police officer.\n\nTsang is in hospital in a stable condition and was not able to attend a court session on Thursday, but his lawyer appeared on his behalf. About 200 supporters turned up to watch the proceedings.\n\n\u201cHEINOUS CRIMES\u201d\n\nElizabeth Quat, a lawmaker for a pro-Beijing political party, told a news conference the looming ban on face masks under a law giving police broad emergency powers was aimed at stopping \u201cillegal assemblies\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis law is not targeting peaceful protesters. It is focused on targeting those rioters who have committed heinous crimes,\u201d she said.\n\nBut pro-democracy lawmakers fear the emergency powers could be used to further curtail freedoms.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cTo impose an anti-mask law in the current social condition is to further infuriate the people and will definitely be met with escalating violence,\u201d lawmaker Fernando Cheung told Reuters. \u201cThis is no different than adding fuel to fire. The result will be riots.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs estimated this week that the city might have lost as much as $4 billion in deposits to rival banking center Singapore between June and August.\n\nOn Thursday, Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers Association, urged the city\u2019s leader to impose a curfew to maintain public order.\n\n\u201cWe cannot work alone - clapping only with one hand - without appropriate measures and support from top level,\u201d Lam said.", "description": "Hong Kong's government is expected to discuss sweeping emergency laws on Friday that would include banning face masks at protests, two sources told Reuters, as the Chinese-ruled territory grapples with an escalating cycle of violence.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436573622&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920LG"}
