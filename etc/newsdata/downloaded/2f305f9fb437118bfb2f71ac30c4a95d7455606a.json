In the first half of the 20th century, rivalry helped fuel two world wars. Today, thanks to the common market, differences between countries are no longer seen as destructive, but as driving the effectiveness of the European economy.\n\nThis is of particular importance to people in countries that joined the Union at the beginning of this century. EU funding, foreign investment and access to the single market have helped us modernize our economies and create new jobs. The single market has allowed us to use hard work and flexibility to compensate for a lack of capital. This has led to success in parts of the European economy \u2014 including international road transport.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still areas where we do not have much say. In the streets of Warsaw, Bucharest, Vilnius and Sofia, we see numerous offices of French, German and Dutch banks. Yet you will not see the offices of Bulgarian, Romanian or Lithuanian banks in Western European capitals. We\u2019re not happy about this, but when we joined the Union, we accepted its principles allowing the free movement of goods, services, capital, people and business.\n\nThese freedoms benefit everyone. They allow European capital, labor, innovation and natural resources to be used more efficiently. The resulting competition is like a bitter pill for the economy: It tastes bad, but it allows us to enjoy a long period of health. Protectionism, on the other hand, is like a narcotic, as one politician said. It improves the mood momentarily, but quickly becomes addictive, leads to depression and destroys the body.\n\nEven from a purely business standpoint, it is clear that inaction in this area will exacerbate the shortage of drivers in the labor market.\n\nNow it seems like these market freedoms were seen as beneficial, until our region became a major player in the market for goods and services from Western Europe. Just as we gain a foothold, suddenly there are proposals to change the rules. This is particularly true for road transport, where our success has become a pretext for stirring emotions and drawing attention from real problems. And such an outburst of emotions leads to lobbying for protectionism into EU law.\n\nThis is evident from negotiations over the European Commission\u2019s package of policies for the mobility sector, released in May 2017. We have not questioned the initiative, because we are well aware of many of the existing problems and accept that the main objective of the package is to improve the conditions for drivers. Even from a purely business standpoint, it is clear that inaction in this area will exacerbate the shortage of drivers in the labor market.\n\nBut unfortunately, social issues have been superseded by a new objective during work on the proposals \u2013 the protection of national transport markets. A number of the adopted proposals would radically restrict the export of transport services, in favor of bilateral services related to the carrier\u2019s home country. Cross-trade and cabotage, which account for 33 percent of international transport work, are to become marginal operations. This will destabilize EU trade in goods and reduce the availability of transport services.\n\nVehicle routes will be determined by political rather than economic criteria.\n\nThe political consequences of adopting protectionist measures could be very serious. How can we explain to concerned EU citizens that the single market rules remain in place when they give advantage stronger countries, but are restricted when they benefit others? This may encourage a spiral of protectionism, an increase in populism and centrifugal tendencies across the EU.\n\nThe potential economic impacts are equally important. Digitalization and e-commerce are spreading wide. Consumers expect fast and cheap deliveries, monitored in real time, and this trend is penetrating business-to-business relations too. The only form of transport that can meet the market\u2019s expectations is road \u2014 which means we need to use our resources more efficiently.\n\nEfficient transport will also help tackle global warming. Every journey made by an empty or partially loaded carbon-emitting vehicle contributes to climate change. Yet the mobility package on the table will cause lorries to leave their delivery destinations and drive empty for several hundred kilometers more, where the regulations allow them to be loaded again. Vehicle routes will be determined by political rather than economic criteria.\n\nThose who were supposed to be protected by the new policies will suffer from them.\n\nComplicated rules, stringent administrative obligations and the imprecise nature of the new regulations all entail economic risk and will hit small and medium-sized enterprises the hardest, regardless of where they come from. Those who were supposed to be protected by the new policies will suffer from them. A significant proportion of drivers from Central Europe will lose their jobs, or be forced to take up positions in other countries, far from their previous centers of life and family.\n\nThese risks and consequences show that the industry is poorly understood and is plagued by a gap between economic rationality and political decisions. We are naturally aware that our assessment may be perceived as biased. Like most parties debating the mobility package, we are not completely free from emotions that could distort our view. And like most, we are interested in the final outcome.\n\nTo make the discussion objective, improve its quality and bring the facts to the fore, the employers\u2019 association Transport and Logistics Poland asked Professor Peter Klaus, recognized in the world of science and logistics, to assess the impact of the mobility package on European road transport. The effect of this work, confirming a significant part of our concerns, will be published as a sponsored content in the September 19 print issue of POLITICO.\n\nWe believe there is still room for fact-based discussion. From the moment the report is published, we will no longer be able to plead ignorance. Let us remember, however, that at the end of the day it is always the average EU citizen who pays for regulatory errors.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "New proposals will harm the very workers they are meant to protect \u2014 and stoke European protectionism", "authors": ["Maciej Wro\u0144ski", "President Of The Employers Association", "Transport", "Logistics Poland", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MainImageforMaciejWronsk-iStock-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
