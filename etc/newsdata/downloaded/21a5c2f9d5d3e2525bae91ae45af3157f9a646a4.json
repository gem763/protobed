Guyger thought Jean had broken into her apartment. It turns out she mistakenly was in his apartment.\n\nThe victim\u2019s brother (Brandt Jean) publicly and emotionally forgave Guyger in court because of the love of Jesus, which he said he hopes the ex-police officer will find. Judge Kemp gave Guyger a Bible and read to her John 3:16: \u201cFor God so loved the world\u2026.\u201d And for that, the Freedom From Religion Foundation wants to throw the book, so to speak, at the judge.\n\nOthers on the left have also thrown a fit against the judge\u2014and even against the victim\u2019s brother\u2014for offering forgiveness. But forgiveness is a great healer, cutting even through the racial barriers that so divide us.\n\nEvery day, as a spiritual discipline, I review in my mind a list of Scriptural truths, including: \u201cGod has forgiven me. I forgive others. I walk in forgiveness.\u201d\n\nYet thoughts of revenge come naturally to us\u2014so naturally that they\u2019re even a point of humor:\n\n\u2022\"I have never killed a man, but I have read many obituaries with great pleasure.\"\n\n- Clarence Darrow\n\n\u2022\"I didn't attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it.\"\n\n- Mark Twain\n\n\u2022And then there is the famous dialogue between Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Member of Parliament Lady Astor. She said, \"If you were my husband I'd poison your tea!\" He shot back, \"Madam, If you were my wife, I'd drink it.\"\n\nAll humor aside, in His classic Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), Jesus taught His followers to pray using what we call \u201cthe Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d or the \u201cOur Father.\u201d Many churches, including mine, use this prayer week after week.\n\nIt includes this petition, \u201cForgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\u201d or \u201cForgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.\u201d\n\nJesus elaborated on this particular petition: \u201cFor if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\u201d\n\nThe forgiveness of sins by God is based on the fact that Jesus died on behalf of sinners. Those who believe in Him are forgiven and receive eternal life.\n\nForgiving others isn\u2019t just good spiritual living. The late Lewis Smedes of Fuller Theological Seminary once said, \u201cTo forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover the prisoner was you.\u201d His 1984 book, Forgive and Forget, according to Psychology Today (10/7/19) \u201chas been credited as the catalyst for modern forgiveness research.\"\n\nA study reported in the UK Telegraph (7/8/19) compared the difference between those who forgive as opposed to these who hold a grudge. Forgiving is better for your mental and physical health than is \u201cgrudge-holding.\u201d\n\nGeorgia psychotherapist, Angela Buttimer observes, \u201cWhen we hold onto grudges and resentment, it\u2019s like drinking poison and expecting the other person to get sick.\u201d\n\nI find all this fascinating because I maintain that the Bible beat modern psychology by 2000 years when it comes to the importance of forgiving, of letting it go.\n\nThere is a fantastic quote in an old book by two psychiatrists. In 1951, J. T. Fisher and L. S. Hawley, wrote A Few Buttons Missing, in which they praised the good psychological principles taught by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount.\n\nWrote Fisher and Hawley: \u201cIf you were to take the sum total of all authoritative articles ever written by the most qualified of psychologists and psychiatrists on the subject of mental hygiene\u2014if you were to combine them and refine them and cleave out the excess verbiage\u2014if you were to take the whole of the meat and none of the parsley, and if you were to have these unadulterated bits of pure scientific knowledge concisely expressed by the most capable of living poets, you would have an awkward and incomplete summation of the sermon on the mount. And it would suffer immeasurably through comparison.\u201d\n\nAnd they add, \u201cFor nearly two thousand years, the Christian world has been holding in its hands the complete answer to its restless and fruitless yearnings. Here...rests the blueprints for successful human life with optimum mental health and contentment.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, included in that blueprint is to experience God\u2019s forgiveness and in turn to forgive others. The brother of the shooting victim and the judge are showing far more healthy behavior than their detractors are.\n\nJerry Newcombe, D.Min., is the senior producer and an on-air host for D.
