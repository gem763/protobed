That\u2019s kind of how I feel.\u201d\n\nThe wide receiver was cut from the Patriots on Friday, after a second allegation of sexual misconduct was made against him. The previous week, a federal lawsuit was filed which claimed Brown, 31, had sexually assaulted his former trainer. Brown\u2019s lawyer has denied the allegations.\n\nAs the interview continued, Brady shared some general thoughts on how he chooses to approach the game and his fellow teammates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of human elements. As a player, as a person, I care deeply about my teammates. I want everyone to be the best they can possibly be,\u201d he said. \u201cYou try to provide whatever you think you can to help them reach their highest potential \u2014 whatever situation it is and I\u2019ve had a lot of teammates over the years. You invest not just your head, but your heart. You invest your soul. That\u2019s what makes a great team. That\u2019s what makes a great brotherhood.\u201d\n\nAntonio Brown | Michael Reaves/Getty More\n\nBrady went on to share that he always believes \u201cin the good in people and good intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very optimistic. People who know me, I think know how optimistic I am and my belief that positivity and optimism can overcome a lot of things. There\u2019s a lot of things that get in the way of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a culture that we want to pass judgment so quickly on people. We want to disparage people so quickly. It speaks to me that a lot of people are probably hurting because when you\u2019re not feeling great you want other people to know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSports has a great way of bringing a lot of people together and I believe the more you care for people, the more you love people, the more you find joy in your life, the better our society is, the better our communities are, the better our teams are, the better our families are. That\u2019s how I feel,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED: Antonio Brown Shares Message About \u2018Faith\u2019 After Second Woman Accuses Him of Sexual Misconduct\n\nOn Friday, the wide receiver confirmed he has been released in a statement on social media. \u201cThanks for the opportunity appreciate @Patriots,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe New England Patriots are releasing Antonio Brown.
