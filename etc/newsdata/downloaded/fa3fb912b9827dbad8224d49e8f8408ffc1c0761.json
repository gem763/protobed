So, if this is not corrupt, nothing is corrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what he wants and it seems to be exactly what the United States Senate is determined to have be the case.\u201d\n\nShaub on Thursday claimed the decision to host the event at the resort was \u201cso overtly corrupt that it can\u2019t be viewed as anything but a loyalty test for Senators.\u201d \u201cIf they are corrupt enough to look the other way, Trump will know he can do anything. In that case, he will do everything,\u201d he added.\n\nCheck out the interview above.", "description": "\"And that\u2019s exactly what he wants,\" said Walter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daadaad210000551aad348e.jpeg?cache=nf0ydo3ofq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
