Cahill will be 34 in December and was considered too old at Chelsea last season, starting only two league matches.\n\nHodgson admitted Cahill was not immediately on his radar, but when it became clear that neither James Tomkins nor Mamadou Sakho would be ready for the start of the season, Hodgson had no hesitation in making a move.\n\n'He has been good, as I knew he would be,' said Hodgson. 'A great professional.' Here, Cahill looked as fresh and as commanding as ever. Age may not be in his favour but experience is. He was made captain in the absence of Luka Milivojevic and made it clear that he still has much to offer.\n\n'He has been good, as I knew he would be,' said boss Roy Hodgson.

'It was a fantastic result against a team who is doing well.\n\n'I am in good form and good shape and I have many years left in me. I did not play for a few months but looked after myself and came back in good condition. The most important thing is that the team is doing well.'\n\nWest Ham defender Ryan Fredericks did not blame VAR for Ayew's late winner. 'It is the right decision at the end of the day, but a tight one,' he said. 'You are talking about two inches. It cost us the game so we are gutted.'", "description": "Cahill will be 34 in December and was considered too old at Chelsea last season, starting only two league matches.
