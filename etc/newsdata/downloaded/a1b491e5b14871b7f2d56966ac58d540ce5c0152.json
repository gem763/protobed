While her cause of death has yet to be confirmed, police are working off the assumption that the popstar took her own life.\n\nHer passing comes just four months after she made her solo debut and premiered as an MC on JTBC\u2019s Night of the Hate Comments \u2013 a show which now takes on a much darker meaning after Sulli\u2019s death.\n\nThroughout her career, Sulli was inundated with abuse from trolls who thought she was too outspoken and too sexy to be K-pop idol.\n\nOn recent pictures of Sulli not wearing a bra \u2013 like a 25 year old girl is within her right to do \u2013 comments read \u2018This isn\u2019t free spirited, this is promiscuous\u2019; \u2018Gross, she looks like she smells\u2019; and \u2018It looks sad, she\u2019s begging for attention\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on a video where Sulli appeared afraid when a male fan jumped at her with a camera while out with her friends: \u2018If you\u2019re that scared, just retire\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019re drinking alcohol at a cart bar and couldn\u2019t predict that something like that would happen\u2019.\n\nPolice are working off the assumption that Sulli took her own life (Picture: EPA/YONHAP)\n\nThe trolling got so much for Sulli that in 2014 \u2013 five years after she debuted with Amber, Victoria, Luna and Krystal in f(x) \u2013 she went on hiatus from the band, citing the malicious comments she was receiving online as the reason. Sulli quit f(x) a year later.\n\nSince then, Sulli had continued to be abused online, with a video of an Instagram live circulating after her death showing her ask: \u2018I\u2019m not a bad person. Why are [they] talking bad about me? Tell me one thing I did to deserve this.\u2019\n\nSo synonymous with abuse was Sulli\u2019s career that she was selected as one of the four MCs on Night of Hate Comments \u2013 where celebrities address the cruel tweets and comments made about them.\n\nNow, we don\u2019t know for sure if Sulli\u2019s death was by suicide, and if it was, we will not know all of the factors. But netizens (net citizens) on social media sites have now replaced the cruel comments about Sulli with heartbroken tweets about her passing. When somebody dies, it\u2019s like all of the cruelty targeting them throughout their life via the same channels is forgotten by the same people who were responsible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the cycle has started again. Just hours after Sulli\u2019s death, a troll asked Girl\u2019s Day star Minah \u2018do you want to go next, you b****\u2019.\n\nWe saw the same cycle after Mike\u2019s death (Picture: Ricky Vigil M/GC Images)\n\nWe have seen this time and time again. When Love Island\u2019s Mike Thalassitis took his own life earlier this year social media was flooded with posts saying \u2018we need to be kinder\u2019 and calling for people to be more open about mental health and less vicious on social media.\n\nFast forward to Love Island 2019, and Amy Hart is mocked about her looks, Amber Gill receives death threats and Molly-Mae Hague is even trolled by high-profile celebrities.\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good saying that we need to be kinder to people when the worst happens, but the real action needs to be taken when people are alive.\n\nRegardless of how Sulli died, she spent the last 10 years seeing the worst comments about herself, from people she didn\u2019t even know, spread all over the internet. She repeatedly asked for the trolls to stop, asked why she deserved such hatred, and was forced out of her band because of those people.\n\nNow that she has passed away, everybody is rightly calling for more to be done about mental health \u2013 but we need to stop this constant cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, celebrities may have more money and followers than you and I, but they\u2019re still real people with real feelings. A comment under their picture will affect them just as much as it would you and I. Now imagine that comment multiplied by 1,000, happening every day. It would be unbearable.\n\nI\u2019m not blaming any one person for what happens to these musicians and reality stars, but to act like trolling isn\u2019t part of the problem is foolish. If we want to stop losing young stars, we need to be kinder, more understanding, better.\n\nRemember Sulli for her music, her acting roles, her feminism and her refreshing individuality. And remember her by being better.\n\nNeed support?
