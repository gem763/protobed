With every passing day, and every new headline, it seems less likely that Libra will ever launch, let alone on time.\n\nWell, if you\u2019re skeptical and think Libra is going to be delayed, you can take a shot at making some money at it by betting that it won\u2019t launch \u2013 just like I told you to do already.\n\nWhile you could probably go down to a bookies and place a bet, that\u2019s not something you\u2019d want, is it? Because you actually know about Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. What you want is a derivatives future, for no other reason than it sounding cool.\n\nJoking aside though, CoinFLEX, a cryptocurrency-futures exchange is now offering derivatives that pay out based on the likelihood that Libra will actually launch and be operational by the end of next year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nCoinFLEX\u2019s physically-settled futures will pay out Libra tokens if the \u2018cryptocurrency\u2018 is live by December 30, 2020. If Libra isn\u2019t operational though, investors will get nothing and will lose their initial investment. Users will also be able to bet against Libra launching in 2020.\n\nAccording to the report, the futures will be available from October 24, with each Libra token being set at $0.30. After the initial futures are offered, contracts can be traded. It\u2019s believed the prices of the contracts will vary depending on how Libra\u2019s development is going.\n\n*This is not investment advice. Do not gamble, ever. You will not win, probably.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
