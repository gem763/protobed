But for the people out there around the track, it is not nice to be sitting there with rain going sideways.\"\n\nThe blank Saturday will be a huge disappointment to thousands of fanatical supporters at one of the best-attended races on the circuit.", "description": "The Japanese Grand Prix's entire Saturday track programme, including qualifying, has been cancelled as Typhoon Hagibis bears down on the Suzuka circuit, race organisers announced Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2863/1610a04cdb9a436cab2b91c711f69256.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
