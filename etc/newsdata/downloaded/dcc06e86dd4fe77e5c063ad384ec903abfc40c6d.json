Some 52 percent said images that frightened them as children still scare them today, and 47 percent said horror films have contributed to nightmares, according to the Post.\n\nStill, nearly two-thirds say getting frightened can be fun.\n\n\u201cPeople enjoy getting scared, especially at Halloween,\u201d a spokesperson for Tubi told the Post. \u201cA classic horror movie can make for a spooky but fun night in.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nClassic horror films that induced chills for minors include: \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street,\u201d \u201cHalloween,\u201d \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\u201d \u201cPsycho,\u201d \u201cThe Shining,\u201d \u201cEvil Dead,\u201d \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d and \u201cAlien.\u201d\n\nOthers reported being spooked by iconic villains such as Lord Voldemort from \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d Darth Vader from \u201cStar Wars,\u201d the Wicked Witch of the West from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and Jigsaw from \u201cSaw.\u201d\n\nDespite being fearful, many people think they would fare well if they were living in a horror movie plot. In fact, 46 percent were bold enough to say they would survive, the Post reported. Respondents weren\u2019t afraid to get morbid when theorizing about how they might perish, however.\n\nThree in 10 said they might die from suffocation. Some 29 percent believe they would be stabbed, trip or fall on something strong enough to kill them or suffer a fatal car crash. Twenty-five percent suggested they would be decapitated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Some 47 percent\u00a0of survey participants said horror films have contributed to nightmares.", "authors": ["Cortney Moore"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/0dcc7cd0-fd53b3810c08a510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-scary.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
