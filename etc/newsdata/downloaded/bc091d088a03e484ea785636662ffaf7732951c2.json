Condemning these elephants to a life of captivity in Chinese zoos is a tragedy.\n\n\u201cWe and others have been working for months to try and stop these elephants being shipped because all that awaits them in China is a life of monotonous deprivation in zoos or circuses.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAs an elephant biologist used to observing these magnificent animals in their natural wild habitat, I am devastated by this outcome. These animals should be roaming in the wild with their families but, instead, they have been ripped away from their mothers for more than a year and now sold off for lifelong captivity\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
