We\u2019ll provide either an estimated trade-in value or a simple way to recycle it.\n\nIf you\u2019re trading in online, we\u2019ll calculate your estimated trade-in value during the purchase of your new iPad. Then we\u2019ll send you a trade-in kit (at no cost to you) so you can send us your device. Once we receive your trade-in device, a team will inspect it and verify its condition. If the condition matches what you described, we\u2019ll credit the trade-in value to your purchase. If it doesn\u2019t match, we\u2019ll notify you of the revised value and confirm if you still want to move forward with the trade-in.\n\nIf you accept the trade-in estimate in the store, we\u2019ll give you instant credit toward a purchase.\n\nAnd if you choose to recycle your device, we\u2019ll either handle it in the store or provide a prepaid shipping label so you can send your device to our accredited recycling partner.", "description": "The new iPad mini is less than 1lb., comes with all-day battery life in a brilliant 7.9-inch retina display.
