Biden, or any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, amid attacks from President Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThe DNC in 2020 is running a campaign process to make sure that every single person has an opportunity to demonstrate that they are most qualified to be president, and I don\u2019t believe it would be our role to be airing ads every time there is misinformation,\u201d Mr. Perez said in an interview for C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing forcefully, and [what we\u2019ll] continue to do forcefully, is to call out misinformation [and] make sure that networks aren\u2019t aiding and abetting in the dissemination of misinformation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a critically important role.\u201d\n\nHe said Friday that they \u201cimmediately\u201d went to former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign when reports surfaced that the El Paso, Texas, shooter had an O\u2019Rourke bumper sticker.\n\n\u201cWe were off and running to make sure that that lie didn\u2019t get out there,\u201d he said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re going to continue to be exceedingly aggressive for the vice president, who\u2019s been the victim of a smear campaign here, and for any other candidate who is the victim of similar smear campaigns. We will be consistent, and we will be vigilant.\u201d\n\nMr. Perez faces a tough balancing act in 2020, after a 2016 presidential campaign where leaked emails appeared to show the DNC putting its thumb on the scale for eventual nominee Hillary Clinton during the primary process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve defended every candidate,\u201d Mr. Perez said on Friday when asked about the notion of repeating something similar for Mr. Biden. \u201cWe will call out anything that is attacking any of our candidates based on lies.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign has complained about a 30-second ad from the Trump campaign that says the former vice president promised Ukraine $1 billion in aid if they fired a prosecutor who was reportedly looking into a company with ties to his son Hunter.\n\nFacebook has rejected the Biden campaign\u2019s request to stop running it, saying it doesn\u2019t violate company policies, while the campaign says it\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d for a social media company to knowingly allow misleading material onto its platform.\n\nThough he has denied wrongdoing, Mr. Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine have become an issue for him on the campaign trail in recent weeks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
