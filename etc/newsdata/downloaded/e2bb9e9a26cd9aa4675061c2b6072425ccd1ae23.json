But with the backing of the Arab parties, Gantz gained a slight advantage. He could have as many as 57 backers, compared with Netanyahu\u2019s 55.\n\nMaverick politician Avigdor Lieberman, head of the mid-size Yisrael Beitenu party, controls the final eight seats, making him the key powerbroker. But he announced Sunday that he isn\u2019t endorsing either candidate.\n\nThe endorsement by the Joint List, a bloc of four small Arab parties that controls 13 seats, marked a turning point in Israeli politics. Arab parties have traditionally refrained from endorsing a candidate for prime minister, and they have never sat in a coalition government, not wanting to be seen as legitimizing Israeli policies.\n\nAlthough many Israeli Arabs remain angry at Gantz for leading the military\u2019s devastating war against Gaza militants in 2014, their fury toward Netanyahu runs much deeper. Netanyahu\u2019s campaign repeatedly accused the Arabs of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election, drawing accusations of racism and incitement.\n\nThere is also deep-seated anger over a law passed by Netanyahu\u2019s government in 2018 that declared Israel to be the nation-state of the Jewish people. Arabs believe the law codifies discrimination.\n\nThough the Arab parties are still expected to stay out of Gantz\u2019s future government, their endorsement reflects a growing desire of Israel\u2019s large Arab minority to take a more active role in shaping the country.\n\nIn an op-ed piece in The New York Times, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, argued that his move should end Netanyahu\u2019s political career and provide a watershed moment for Israel\u2019s Arab minority.\n\n\u201cIf the center-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Arab Palestinian citizens.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu reacted by saying: \u201cAs we warned, the Arab parties that oppose Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists recommended Gantz for prime minister.\u201d\n\nThe Arab parties\u2019 decision does not guarantee Gantz will be prime minister. The president usually appoints the candidate with the most supporters, but not necessarily. Rivlin has wide discretion.\n\nIn last week\u2019s vote, Blue and White won 33 seats, while Likud took 31.\n\nThe deciding factor looks to be Lieberman, who is demanding a broad unity government with the two major parties that will be secular and exclude the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and Arabs. That appears to be the compromise emerging between Blue and White and Likud, though both are insisting upon leading it.\n\nComplicating matters is Blue and White\u2019s refusal to sit with Netanyahu because he faces a likely indictment on corruption charges.\n\nOdeh said he is planning on becoming opposition leader in the case of a unity government. As the leader of the largest party in opposition, he would be entitled to the position, which includes meetings with visiting world leaders and access to sensitive security information.\n\nRivlin has not indicated which way he is leading. But he said he interpreted the will of the people as yearning for a \u201cstable\u201d government. \u201cAnd there can\u2019t be a stable government without the two big parties,\u201d the 80-year-old president said.\n\nLast week\u2019s vote was Israel\u2019s second election in five months. Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition after April\u2019s balloting.\n\nIn calling a new election, Netanyahu had hoped to secure a narrow majority of hard-line and religious parties that would grant him immunity from prosecution on charges that could include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. But now that possibility appears to be off the table.\n\nIsraeli law does not require a sitting premier to resign if indicted. But if he is charged, as is widely expected, he will come under heavy pressure to step down.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The Arab bloc in Israel's parliament has abandoned its usual hands-off stance and endorsed former military chief Benny Gantz.", "authors": ["Aron Heller"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/israel-benny-gantz-arab-block-endorsement.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C4px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
