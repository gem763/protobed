REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/Illustration\n\nSantiago-based Cornershop operates in Mexico, Chile, Canada and Peru, but Chief Executive Oskar Hjertonsson said the deal would allow it to deliver groceries \u201cin many more countries around the world.\u201d\n\nHe retweeted the news of the deal as it broke, adding: \u201cThis will be fun!\u201d\n\nThe app provides delivery of \u201cgroceries to your front door in one hour\u201d from retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Mexico\u2019s Chedraui (CHDRAUIB.MX). It charges retail chains and customers a commission for its services.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s getting a ride, ordering food from your favorite restaurant, or soon, getting groceries delivered, we want Uber to be the operating system for your everyday life,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.\n\nNo valuation was disclosed for the deal. Uber said it expected to close the deal in early 2020, \u201csubject to regulatory approval.\u201d\n\nMexican antitrust officials earlier this year blocked a $225 million bid by Walmart (WMT.N) to buy Cornershop, citing concerns the retail giant could not guarantee a level playing field for rival retailers.\n\nCornershop would continue to operate under its current leadership, which would report to a board with majority Uber representation, Uber said in a statement.\n\nCornershop has rapidly gained popularity in local markets, including Chile, where its shoppers are a common sight scrambling down the aisles of grocery stores as they hunt down orders for customers.\n\nThe company has also diversified rapidly, moving from food to stores selling clothes, toys, home decor, books, electronic goods and pharmaceutical products.\n\nThe news of the deal comes amid a flurry of similar announcements from Uber, as it seeks to expand beyond its core taxi app.\n\nThis week it launched a boat service in Nigeria\u2019s populous Lagos, expanded a helicopter taxi service in New York\u2019s JFK airport and began an app in Chicago to connect workers with businesses needing to fill available shifts.\n\nThe move to diversify comes at a time when Uber\u2019s main ride hailing operations face competition in Asia, while the U.S. company is also facing regulatory scrutiny for classifying its drivers as independent contractors.\n\nIn Chile, Uber remains technically illegal, with a bill to regulate ride-sharing digital applications making its way slowly through Chile\u2019s congress amid challenges from traditional taxi firms and drivers\u2019 unions, which want tighter labor regulations.", "description": "Uber said on Friday it would buy a majority stake in online grocery provider Cornershop as the ride-hailing giant moves to expand its fast-growing delivery service into the grocery store market.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439739049&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1JW", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
