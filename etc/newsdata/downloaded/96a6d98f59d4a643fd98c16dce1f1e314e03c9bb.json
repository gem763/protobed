Kurdish officials said they needed to divert fighters and logistics to the front line to ward off the Turkish offensive. Turkey moved troops into areas along the border, while Syrian border guards were deployed in others.\n\nA shaky cease-fire is in place and an agreement to redeploy Kurdish forces away from the borders.\n\nWhile news of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death had not been announced in the camps on Monday, many of his supporters living in detention facilities and camps in Syria have telephones and they most likely heard the news.\n\n\u201cIf our men are in prison, we are the soldiers of the Caliphate,\u201d some of the women held in al-Hol, the largest holding camp in northern Syria chanted Monday, according to a security official with the Kurdish-led internal security agency. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to talk to journalists and spoke anonymously.\n\nThe camp is home to 70,000, most of them women and children including about 11,000 foreigners. More than 10,000 prisoners, including 2,000 foreigners, are in detention facilities in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe nighttime raid by U.S. special operations forces was a blow to the militant group that became a global organization under his leadership. His demise only few months after losing the group\u2019s territorial hold ushers in a new phase for IS amid uncertainty over the new leadership as thousands of its supporters and members languish in prisons.\n\nThe decentralized group, with members estimated anywhere between 14,000 or 30,000, has already pivoted toward insurgency after losing its territory in the last couple of years. But its branches abroad and the number of those who pledged their allegiance have increased.\n\nWho the next leader is will likely determine whether the group will dig in to consolidate its hold on Syria and Iraq \u2014 or focus on global outreach.\n\nThe group has not officially announced al-Baghdadi\u2019s death or named a new leader. In public, followers and supporters have not eulogized the 48-year old. But social media posts by groups affiliated with IS note that the death of a leader doesn\u2019t spell the end of an ideology.\n\n\u201cJihad has not stopped with the death of a leader or Emir,\u201d said a post on Shmoukh al-Islam page, or glory of Islam. It added: \u201cWhat if the leader of the Believers is martyred, we will stay the course and to whoever follows we renew the pledge.\u201d\n\nExperts and security officials say one of al-Baghdadi\u2019s close aides will likely succeed him. But the shadowy head of IS was security-obsessed and known for turning on members of his close circle. One possible favorite is Abdullah Qardash, an Iraqi Turkman from Talafar and a former officer in Saddam Hussein\u2019s army. The two met in a U.S. prison in 2003 and Qardash became al-Baghdadi\u2019s top security henchman.\n\nThe IS Shura council, the shadowy group\u2019s leadership of 10 or so people, is supposed to choose the next leader if al-Baghdadi had designated a successor. But it\u2019s not clear how many of them are still alive.\n\nAnother of al-Baghdadi\u2019s close aides, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, was killed in a joint U.S. operation with Kurdish forces in Jarablus on Sunday, hours after al-Baghdadi blew himself up during a U.S. raid. Little is known about al-Muhajir, who was appointed spokesman in 2016 and is believed to be a foreigner given his nom de guerre, the migrant.\n\nSyrian Kurdish forces spokesman Mustafa Bali said his fighters believe al-Muhajir was in Jarablus to facilitate al-Baghdadi\u2019s travel to the area, which is administered by Turkey-backed fighters.\n\n\u201cMore (IS figures) remain hiding in the area,\u201d Bali said Sunday.\n\nThe new leader\u2019s priority, experts say, will likely be prison breaks. The group\u2019s previous incarnation organized some of the most spectacular prison escapes in Iraq in a year-long operation called \u201cBreaking the Walls.\u201d It was responsible for at least eight different prison breaks, freeing nearly 500 people between 2012 and 2013.\n\n\u201cIt has almost always been a priority (for the group), the question is whether it\u2019ll be able to pull it off, \u201d said Hassan Hassan, an IS expert and an analyst at the Center for Global Policy.\n\nForces from the Kurdish-led internal security agency were \u201con high alert\u201d in anticipation of possible riots in the camps, attacks on the prisons and an increase in \u201crevenge attacks\u201d in northeastern Syria where most of the group\u2019s members and supporters are, the official with the agency said.\n\nKurdish officials said there have seen an uptick in IS activities in recent weeks, attacking checkpoints and patrols with roadside and remotely detonated bombs.\n\nJennifer Cafarella, a Syria expert with the DC-based Institute for the Study of War, said it wasn\u2019t yet clear whether IS would pick an Iraqi leader.\n\n\u201cISIS has become a global organization and if it hopes to remain so, it will need a leader that can convincingly fill the role of an international commander and cleric. ISIS\u2019s Iraqi heritage could actually become a liability for the organization,\u201d she said using another acronym for IS.\n\nHassan said the organization will probably pick an Iraqi as the majority of its members are from Iraq and given the group\u2019s focus on religious and operational credentials.\n\nHe added: Whoever \u201che is, he\u2019ll have to start from scratch. To build his legacy and prove himself.\u201d", "description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 One of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's last audio messages was an appeal for his followers to do everything in their power to free Islamic State", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/7bf8a7_aptopix-syria-baghdadi-74257-people-destroyed-houses-village-barisha-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
