Officials handed out ice cubes and ice scarves to families waiting in the sun. At some of the rest stops officials said they also planned to give out plastic hand-held fans.\n\nRunners were optimistic that the athletes would be able to deal with the heat during next year\u2019s Olympics, but some spectators expressed concerns about cheering runners in sweltering conditions.\n\n\u201cYesterday it was cool, but near the end (of the race) the sun came out,\u201d said Rei Ohara, who collapsed after finishing third in the women\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cThen I felt the heat but the organizers gave us ice and water so I think it was a race that was easy to run for everyone.\u201d\n\nOrganisers have been sweating over how to protect athletes from heat stroke and keep spectators cool during Tokyo\u2019s notoriously hot and muggy summers.\n\nTemperatures in Tokyo during July and August, when the city will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games, commonly exceed 30 degrees Celsius (86\u00b0F), with high humidity adding to people\u2019s discomfort.\n\nOn Sunday, temperatures were as high as 30 degrees, but hovered around 22 degrees in shaded tents next to the road.\n\n\u201cWe will analyse all of the know-how and measurements we were able to gain today to improve our measures to combat heat,\u201d Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters.\n\nOrganizers plan to start the marathons at 6 a.m. next year to avoid midday heat, with major roads on much of the 26-mile (42 km) course painted with a resin that the organizer say will reflect infrared rays to cut temperatures as much as eight degrees Celsius.\n\nSunday\u2019s test race began at around 8:50 a.m. for men and 9:10 a.m. for women.\n\nLast month, heat concerns prompted the International Triathlon Union to shorten the distance of the run segment in a qualifying event in Tokyo for the July 24-Aug. 9 Olympics.\n\nHideo Nakatani and his wife Kuniko had travelled from their neighbourhood in Machida in Tokyo to cheer on the runners in the marathon Sunday morning.\n\nBoth are avid runners and worried that Tokyo\u2019s summer temperatures might affect the runners next year.\n\n\u201cI know the actual event will be held earlier in the day next year but it\u2019s still going to be humid and really hot,\u201d said 66-year-old Hideo, who wore a hat, sunglasses and iced scarf around his neck.\n\n\u201cWe will probably have to be really prepared for the sun when we come as spectators next year.\u201d\n\nHeat was not a problem last time Tokyo hosted the games in 1964 because it opened in October. Since 1976, however, most summer games in the northern hemisphere have been held in the middle of summer to fit with global broadcasting schedules.\n\nAt a beach volleyball test event in July the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which factors in temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, as rising as high as 31.7, exceeded 31, a threshold at which authorities urge citizens against exercise.\n\nThe top two finishers in Sunday\u2019s race won spots at next year\u2019s Summer Games. In the men\u2019s race Shogo Nakamura came first ahead of Yuma Hattori. Honami Maeda won the women\u2019s race with Ayuko Suzuki coming in second.", "description": "Tokyo held a marathon on Sunday as a test case for whether organisers, athletes, and spectators can cope with sweltering temperatures expected during next year's Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.", "authors": ["Mari Saito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
