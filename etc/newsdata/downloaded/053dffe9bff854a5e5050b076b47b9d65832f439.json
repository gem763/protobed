Sign up here.\n\nThe World Trade Organization will authorize the U.S. to impose tariffs on nearly $8 billion of European goods due to illegal state aid provided to aircraft maker Airbus SE, according to people familiar with the decision, a move that will likely trigger retaliatory measures from the European Union.\n\nThe U.S. duties, which could hit as soon as October, will target planes and parts as well as luxury products, such as wine and spirits like Dom Perignon and Moet & Chandon -- and leather goods under labels such as Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, according to a list published by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office.\n\nWTO spokesman Keith Rockwell and a spokesperson for Boeing (NYSE: ) both declined requests from Bloomberg for comment.\n\nThe people who spoke of the ruling asked not to be identified because the confidential WTO decision isn\u2019t due to be published until Sept. 30.\n\nThe verdict marks the latest chapter in the WTO\u2019s longest-running dispute and will further test transatlantic relations, which have deteriorated under Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy. And while the scope of this conflict is limited, Washington is separately mulling tariffs on auto imports, which would dramatically increase Europe\u2019s stake in the American trade war.\n\nThe EU is pursuing a similar case at the WTO over illegal subsidies the U.S. provided to Boeing Co ., and has published a preliminary list of U.S. goods -- from ketchup to video-game consoles -- it will target in a $12 billion plan for retaliatory levies. A decision in that case is expected from the Geneva-based trade organization in the first half of 2020.\n\nBoeing Shares Rise\n\nBoeing climbed 1.6% to $387.70 at 12:59 p.m. in New York, hovering near the highest intraday mark in more than five months. Airbus advanced 1.8% to 120.96 euros at the close in Paris.\n\nA spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe WTO award is lower than the Trump administration\u2019s request to impose tariffs on up to $11.2 billion worth of European exports stemming from the nearly 15-year-old dispute. The U.S. hasn\u2019t finalized which goods it will hit, but the preliminary list also includes whiskey, motorcycles, leather handbags, cheese and wine.\n\nThe proposed list could damage the sustainability of Airbus\u2019 U.S.-based operations -- like the A320 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama -- because it targets more than $9 billion worth of American-bound exports of European aircraft, helicopters and parts.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs may also hit products made by Europe\u2019s producers of luxury brands -- like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Christian Dior SE and Hermes International (PA: ).\n\nNew Approach\n\nThe new U.S. tariffs mark a significant escalation in tensions with the EU, which has implemented retaliatory duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of U.S. imports following Trump\u2019s trade restrictions on foreign steel and aluminum.\n\nThe EU has also said it\u2019s prepared to hit 20 billion euros of U.S. goods with tariffs if Trump follows through on the threat to impose duties on European cars and car parts.\n\nSeparately, the EU is weighing an aggressive new approach to its trade dispute with the U.S., and is considering imposing tariffs on more than $4 billion of U.S. exports, citing as justification a 22-year-old World Trade Organization dispute over prohibited subsidies, according to people familiar with the plan. This is despite the fact that the two sides reached a \u201cmutually acceptable solution\u201d to the claim in 2006.\n\nEuropean Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she advocated for a settlement that would avoid the tit-for-tat aircraft tariffs, but said that the U.S. never responded to the bloc\u2019s offers.\n\n\u201cOur view is that we have enough tariffs in the world as it is, so imposing tariffs on each other, which strictly speaking we are allowed to do according to the World Trade Organization, would not be a good solution to this,\u201d Malmstrom said Sept. 16.\n\n\u201cWe have made a quite detailed proposal,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, unfortunately, the U.S. has not said that they are willing to negotiate.\u201d\n\n(Updates with requests for comment in third paragraph)", "description": "U.S. Can Tariff About $8 Billion of EU Goods Over Airbus Aid", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic590f66af6a1e2f789c759e074518ba21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
