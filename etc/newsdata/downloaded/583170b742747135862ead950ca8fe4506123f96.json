Companies such as DBS Bank and the Robertsons Solicitors law firm have office space there.\n\nCheung had owned four of the 400 available spaces at The Center, and had previously sold the other three for six-figure sums.\n\nRelated content 11 of Hong Kong's most insane hotel suites\n\nAs one of the world's most densely populated islands, Hong Kong has long held space at a premium. The previous record-holder for most expensive parking space in the city was a $760,000 spot in front of a Kowloon luxury apartment building in 2018.\n\nAnd it's not only parking that comes at a high price in the city.\n\nThe Center is Hong Kong's fifth-tallest building.

With anti-government protests taking place in Hong Kong enter their fifth month, there have been questions about whether the city's reputation as a financial center is at risk.", "description": "Businessman Johnny Cheung has reportedly sold a 135-square-foot parking space in Hong Kong for a whopping $969,000 to an as-yet-undentified buyer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191024144650-hong-kong-traffic-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
