And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t,\u201d Biden said.\n\nVice President Joe Biden upon his arrival for a meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko Kyiv on Jan. 16, 2017.

I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to\u2014or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said\u2014I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a [expletive]. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nBiden did not mention that the prosecutor was probing Burisma or that his son, Hunter Biden, was on Burisma\u2019s board.\n\nIn the newly published affidavit, Shokin, the prosecutor, said that the official reason stated for his dismissal was allegedly failing to secure the public trust. He asserted that neither Poroshenko, other state officials, or officials in the Obama administration had previously complained about his work.\n\nHunter Biden waits for the start of his father\u2019s, Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s, debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 11, 2012.

When I did not, he said that the U.S. (via Biden) were refusing to release the USD$ 1 billion promised to Ukraine. He said that he had no choice.\u201d\n\nShokin said that he agreed to resign because he wanted to do what was best for Ukraine but changed his mind after the fact after Biden bragged about getting him removed in 2018.", "description": "Newly Published Ukrainian Prosecutor's Sworn Affidavit: I Was Forced Out in 2016 Because of Joe Biden", "authors": ["Follow Zachary On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2019/09/27/joe-biden-2-1200x800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
