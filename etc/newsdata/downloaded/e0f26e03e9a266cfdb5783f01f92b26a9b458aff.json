Ryan Reavis, 36, has been charged with possession of marijuana and prescription drugs, Havasu City police said Tuesday.\n\nReavis was also charged with two weapons counts and he is being held on $50,000 bail. A 9 mm pistol, two shotguns, a home-made firearm suppressor, ammunition and a physician's prescription pad were found in Reavis' home, according to CBS affiliate KPHO-TV.\n\nHe has not entered a plea, and police did not know if he has hired an attorney who could be asked for comment.\n\nPolice gave no details on the connection, but said the arrest was the result of the investigation into the overdose death of Miller, who died one year ago in his Los Angeles home.\n\nEarlier this month, Cameron Pettit, 28, was charged with selling Miller drugs before his death. He has not yet entered a plea in the case.\n\nIn this October 2, 2016, file photo, Mac Miller performs in Flushing, New York.

Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.\n\nMatthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016 and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.", "description": "Ryan Reavis, 36, has been charged with possession of marijuana and prescription drugs and is also facing two weapons counts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/5b2fd510-f573-40f7-8c59-25c8f7a06008/thumbnail/1200x630/0d517c6fa6a9d5b8f3999126f9939c35/ap-19268627435049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
