Trans women of color particularly are at steep risk of marginalization, violence and erasure.\n\nAt least 18 transgender people have been killed this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The group tracked 29 killings in 2018, the most it ever recorded in a year.\n\nSince 2013, HRC has tracked at least 145 transgender deaths due to violence, with most victims being black transgender women. But the organization said the violence is hard to track due to misgendering -- incorrectly applying gender labels -- and transphobia.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn June Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke invoked the names of two trans women of color killed in his home state of Texas. He named them while leading a Pride run in New York City, just as he unveiled his proposal for achieving equality for LGBTQ Americans.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has also called attention to the issue, speaking out about the violence against, and the obstacles faced by trans women of color. Friday night at the GLAAD-hosted forum, he also spoke about his experiences facing discrimination as a gay man. Former Vice President Joe Biden has also addressed the five African American transgender women who had at that time already been killed in 2019, and Senator Cory Booker, D-NJ., also spoke clearly about the need for trans-specific protections.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren named the 18 transgender women of color who have been killed this year at the LGBTQ forum in Iowa.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/warren-01-as-gty-190921_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
