Ball\u2019s agency, the Sports & Entertainment Group in Washington, D.C., confirmed his death to The Associated Press.\n\nBall\u2019s death came nearly a year after he suffered a brain aneurysm and was placed in a medically induced coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. In late July, the Ball family announced that the Georgia native was out of the coma but was a quadriplegic.\n\nA GoFundMe effort raised nearly $137,000 to help cover his medical expenses. Former Florida teammates and current NFL players Jon Bullard, Jaylen Watkins, Max Garcia, Keanu Neal and Jordan Reed gave between $1,000 and $10,000 each. Chicago Bears All-Pro linebacker Khalil Mack, who played with Ball in Oakland, gave $7,000.\n\n\u201cThe Ball family is grateful for the prayers, donations and immense support of Neiron and his recovery,\u201d Myricks said in her statement. \u201cNeiron was a very special and loving father, brother and teammate. Neiron has transitioned to a place of peace.\u201d\n\nAdded the Sports & Entertainment Group: \u201cNeiron was a rare and special spirit with the ability to touch anyone he met. His talent was met with relentless drive, no matter the obstacle. \u2026 Neiron was a loving and cherished father, brother, and teammate. He will be missed dearly.\u201d\n\nBall sat out his sophomore season at Florida in 2011 because of a congenital condition called arteriovenous malformation, which causes the brain\u2019s blood vessels to get tangled and rupture. He recovered after a year away and played in 33 games - with 16 starts - during his final three seasons in Gainesville.\n\nThe Raiders selected Ball in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL draft. He played in six games as a rookie before landing on injured reserve. He was on IR again in 2016 and then waived with a non-football injury designation in July 2017.\n\n\u201cAnybody that came in contact with Neiron Ball liked him,\u201d former Florida coach and current South Carolina coach Will Muschamp told the Orlando Sentinel last month. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could find anybody on earth that did not like Neiron Ball. He\u2019s just one of those people that just has that certain personality that is just electric with people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really a sad situation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former Oakland Raiders linebacker Neiron Ball, who played college football at Florida after recovering from brain surgery, has died at age 27.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/obit-neiron_ball_football_87065_c0-889-2694-2459_s1770x1032.jpg?6b013170d855fe6de8987b34343604b517cc4500", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
