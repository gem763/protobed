Max Rose Got to Impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP/Shutterstock\n\nBecause this is a story about Max Rose, it has to at some point find him at Jody\u2019s Club Forest, a Staten Island bar he famously frequents, drinking pitchers of Bud Light. And because Max Rose is who he is, a five-foot-six freshman congressman, a graduate of Wesleyan and the London School of Economics who joined the Army when the rest of his friends were getting jobs on Wall Street, and who was nearly blown-up by an IED in Afghanistan, a bald bottle rocket with a wrestler\u2019s build and a deep Brooklyn accent of dem, dees, and dos who flipped a deeply red congressional district Democratic in 2018, there have been a lot of stories about Max Rose. More than a few of them feature a scene at Jody\u2019s.\n\nIf some politicians (and to be honest, vanishingly few of them these days) may occasionally sneak out for a cigarette, and, if confronted, ask that it be kept off the record, Rose keeps a pack of silver Marlboro Ultra Lights in his glove compartment, and instead of turning around to ask if he should roll down the windows, turns around to ask if you want to bum one as he gets ferried in his car across his district, which covers all of Staten Island and a thin wedge of South Brooklyn.\n\nInstead of political pablum, Rose calls the three Republicans running against him \u201ca fake Republican, a lobbyist, and a mouth-pisser.\u201d When he attends an anti-bullying walk hosted by Michael McMahon, Staten Island\u2019s district attorney and its senior-most Democrat, he tells a voter who asks who he is, \u201cIf you like me, my name is Max Rose. If you don\u2019t like me, my name is Michael McMahon.\u201d That rising generation of a millennial activists rattling the cages of the body politic? A few \u201cprivileged hipster socialists living in gentrified neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving a Federation of Italian-American Organizations fundraising brunch at a catering hall in Dyker Heights, he asks, \u201cHave you ever seen so many men kissing other men before?\u201d When an aide makes an off-color joke that doesn\u2019t land, Rose chastises him, \u201cListen fucknuts, you have to say \u2018off the record\u2019 first, do you know that? Otherwise you are going to end up like Anthony Scaramucci.\u201d\n\nAnd if Rose got a lot of attention in his first ten months or so in office \u2014 as an envoy to Trump country; as a 32-year-old centrist counterpart to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (she is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, he is the youngest man currently serving) \u2014 the last several weeks have turned him into a minor political celebrity in his own right, after he became one of the last Democrats in the country to come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry. He announced the decision at a Staten Island town hall that was ostensibly about the borough\u2019s gridlocked traffic. \u201cIf I had hair, I\u2019d want to rip it out,\u201d he said, while blasting Democrats for coming out in favor of impeachment before any of the facts were known, and Republicans for going \u201cdeaf, mute, and blind whenever allegations against the president are brought up.\u201d So he blasted both sides \u2014 but he also came down off the fence on an issue that\u2019s very difficult to navigate for Democrats who need Republican support to win.\n\nIt is also part of Rose\u2019s skills as a politician that he doesn\u2019t come down from his coiled, bleeding-from-the-eyeballs intensity whether he is talking about defending the Constitution, the brothers he served with in Afghanistan, or split tolling on the Verrazano. At the town hall, he told the audience that he wouldn\u2019t let them or his fellow vets down while pursuing grave constitutional matters in Washington, and that nothing would distract from his fight with the Port Authority and \u201ctheir outrageous proposal to eviscerate the resident discount on our outer bridges.\u201d\n\nAs we drive around in his smoke-filled car, Rose at first announces he didn\u2019t want to go to Jody\u2019s, since if he keeps taking reporters there eventually it will start to look like a setup. But as we go past, he sees swarms of drunken revelers on the street in front of the bar. There is an Oktoberfest celebration \u2014 and so the congressman jumps out of the car and dives into the crowd.\n\nTo call Rose\u2019s district a swing seat is to understate the case. In 2013, Bill de Blasio beat his Republican opponent by 49 points citywide, but he lost in Staten Island. In 2014, a Republican facing a 20-count federal indictment who had been abandoned by the national party beat his vastly better-funded Democratic challenger by 12 points. Obama won the district twice, but Republicans have had a lock on the borough president\u2019s office and held Rose\u2019s congressional seat for 38 years, with only a single two-year interruption, until Rose won it with relative ease last November.\n\nIt is hard to imagine being pro-impeachment will help Rose on Staten Island. Donald Trump has an underwater approval rating there at 47-52 \u2014 but that is still a bit higher than his national average. It is also hard to imagine any of the likely Democratic nominees helping him much, including Joe Biden, from whom Rose distanced himself after this latest fracas over Ukraine.\n\nRose had been hedging on impeachment for months. During the campaign against incumbent Republican Dan Donovan, he promised that it wasn\u2019t something he would pursue, even as he said that the Russia inquiry should continue apace. On Face the Nation soon after being sworn in, he rebuked fellow freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib\u2019s call to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker,\u201d even as he made plain he had no objection to the profanity. As late as last month, he wrote an op-ed in which he urged Democrats to focus on their agenda: \u201cWe are in danger of losing the trust of the American people if we choose partisan warfare over improving the lives of hardworking families.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the wrong decision for Hunter Biden to be on that board. In no way shape or form should someone\u2019s public service benefit their family,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut if we are going to question Hunter Biden, we should also question Donald Trump Jr. and the way his companies have benefited, and not just Donald Trump Jr., but the other guy \u2014 the one who is even less impressive. What\u2019s his name again? Eric! That\u2019s right, Eric.\u201d\n\nThe local Republican Party is hoping to capitalize on Rose\u2019s shift on impeachment. \u201cStaten Island is Trump country,\u201d said Jessica Proud, a top GOP operative in New York who worked for Rose\u2019s opponent in 2018. \u201cThey are very resistant to the notion of leftist elitists in Washington who are perpetually offended by everything. They view this as just an attempt to get Trump out, and I don\u2019t see how it is going to serve Rose. It cuts right to the heart of the brand he is trying to create for himself, that is going to go to Washington and not join the partisan fray. It puts him squarely in the Democratic camp.\u201d\n\nWest Brighton is the Ohio of Rose\u2019s Staten Island district, the neighborhood that the eventual winner must carry if they hope to win the seat. And among these Oktoberfest-goers, the support for Rose\u2019s support for an impeachment inquiry appears very strong. \u201cThank you, thank you, just thank you,\u201d says one young woman who raced over when she spotted the young congressman. Teenage girls pose for selfies. An older woman rushes out of her car to tell him he is defending the Constitution. \u201cYou know what we say now,\u201d said another woman putting down her Pinot momentarily. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018You\u2019re fired!\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018You\u2019re impeached!\u2019\u201d\n\nRose brushes past these encomiums. \u201cI do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u201d he said when he at last made his way through the crowd and settled in at a back table at Jody\u2019s. \u201cBut no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is prove it. But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nTrump himself raised the stakes for Rose when he retweeted a grainy GOP attack ad against him, one that sandwiched Rose\u2019s face in between Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWill happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts. We will win big!\u201d the president wrote.\n\nRose hasn\u2019t committed to voting for impeachment, since it would mean the outcome is predetermined. And he is critical of colleagues who have been calling for it, or even fundraising for it, since the day this new Congress was sworn in. \u201cThis is a national tragedy. It is nothing to cheer on, it is nothing to sell T-shirts over.\u201d\n\nRose should be a goner when he runs for reelection, his victory the product of a Democratic wave and a Republican who had lost his taste for the work. This is Staten Island, after all. Donald Trump won this district by a larger margin than he won in Texas. Rose is banking on being saved by forging a new kind of politics, one that makes an authentic connection with voters that enables them to look past his party label, that convinces voters he is on their side. Trump won, in Rose\u2019s estimation, by convincing voters that he was on their side on infrastructure, on preserving Social Security, and draining the Washington swamp. Obama won the district two years earlier by promising pretty much the same thing, and painting his opponent as an out-of-touch plutocrat. In this context, supporting an impeachment probe seems like it could be a good gamble \u2014 he\u2019s not promising anything, but he\u2019s also establishing himself as an independent, discerning agent for his constituents.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has been completely subsumed by this \u2018What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas,\u2019 mantra,\u201d he added, his voice turning into a pleading and effeminate version of Rose\u2019s Brooklyn patois. \u201c\u2018Oooh, I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t vote for us? Why can\u2019t they be smarter? Don\u2019t they know all we are doing for them?\u2019 It\u2019s the most offensive, patronizing thing imaginable. And it\u2019s taken over the party. A better question would be: Why don\u2019t they trust us?\u201d\n\nRose calls his approach \u201ccentrist populism.\u201d It\u2019s not the populism of the right, which promises to be on the side of Staten Island cops and firefighters and gives tax breaks to millionaires, tossing in a side of racism to keep their voters\u2019 suspicions at bay. And it\u2019s not the populism of the left, either, which is unrealistic, wants to turn America into Europe, and is overly concerned with banning plastic straws. And it is not the centrism as we have come to know it \u2014 a Mike Bloomberg/Howard Schulz/Third Way approach which, Rose said, \u201cbelieves there is no problem that can\u2019t be solved by a public-private partnership.\u201d\n\nRather, he wants to double the number of people in unions, wants Apollo-sized infrastructure and energy investments, wants to kick the opioid crisis in the ass. And he wants to name names: the drug companies that keep your prescription-drug costs too high; the carried interest loophole that keeps venture capitalists paying less taxes than nurses; the feckless Democrats, who among other things, pledged in 2018 to not vote for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker, but then cowed to pressure and did so on their first day in office. Rose didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd it took me four months to get the five-inch heel out of my ass,\u201d he says.\n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s about winning \u2014 especially winning elections in Trump-loving places. Today that means keeping your powder dry for the impeachment inquiry so that more people will trust that it is carried out faithfully.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think losing is cool. I want the Democratic Party to be the party of Kyrsten Sinema and not the party of Beto O\u2019Rourke,\u201d he continues, referring to the congresswoman who in 2018 became the first Democratic senator from Arizona in 30 years, and the congressman who parlayed a losing race in Texas into celebrity.\n\n\u201cLosing is not as cool as he thinks it is,\u201d Rose says. \u201cWhen you win you get to help people, and when you lose you get to be a social-media rock star. So I don\u2019t think Beto is cool, and I don\u2019t think losing is cool. If we don\u2019t win, we can\u2019t do a fucking thing for anybody in a union, anybody in public housing, anybody that can\u2019t reunite with their family because of a fucking racist Muslim ban. This is where it begins and ends for me, so fucking figure it out.\u201d\n\nRose wants to be a political lifer. He doesn\u2019t see why \u201ccareer politician\u201d should register any different than \u201ccareer social worker\u201d or \u201ccareer teacher.\u201d None of this is difficult. \u201cWhat is difficult is what our teachers are going through, what our nurses are going through, what our cops and soldiers are going through. This? This is fun.\u201d\n\nHe gets back in the car. He has National Guard duty this weekend and has to get home.\n\n\u201cI did not go to Washington to become everybody\u2019s buddy,\u201d Rose says. \u201cI am not down there to be a part of the system. What I am down there for is to wage war on the entire political class.\u201d", "description": "Staten Island Democratic Congressman Max Rose discusses why his \u201ccentrist populism\u201d \u2014 pro-union, anti-Trump \u2014 is the next big thing in American politics, and why he was skeptical of an impeachment inquiry regarding Donald Trump\u2019s activity in Ukraine.", "authors": ["David Freedlander"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/10/10-max-rose.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
