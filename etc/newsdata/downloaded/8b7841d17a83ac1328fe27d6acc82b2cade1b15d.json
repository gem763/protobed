In fact, Biden had said: \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\u201d\n\nThe attack backfired as others onstage sided with Biden. \u201cCome on, guys,\u201d said entrepreneur Andrew Yang. \u201cA house divided cannot stand,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d said Mayor Pete Buttigieg, \u201cbecause this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\u201d Castro was uncowed. \u201cYeah, that's called the Democratic primary election, Pete,\u201d he shot back. \u201cThat's called an election!\u201d\n\nAfter last night\u2019s debate, Castro told ABC: \u201cI wasn\u2019t taking a shot at his age.\u201d But, of course, he was. Castro insisted to reporters in the spin room that he was simply \u201cfact-checking\u201d Biden. \u201cThe vice president and I were having a disagreement about health-care policy,\u201d the secretary said matter-of-factly.\n\nCastro follows in the footsteps of Eric Swalwell, who ripped into Biden and told him to \u201cpass the torch\u201d during the first debate only to get nowhere. The California congressman dropped out days later. Castro certainly won\u2019t. This isn\u2019t fatal. But the exchange illustrated Biden\u2019s underappreciated strengths. While he\u2019s widely perceived as having a tenuous lead in the early polls, Biden\u2019s support has thus far proven remarkably durable. At the same time, however, Castro broached an issue that is of genuine concern among many Democratic leaders and may have foreshadowed what\u2019s to come as the field winnows and lower-performing candidates become desperate to break through.\n\nSen. Cory Booker said after the debate that \"tone and tenor are important,\u201d but then he played footsie with a similar message. \u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now because there's a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling, and I think that Castro has some really legitimate concerns,\u201d the senator from New Jersey said on CNN. \u201cAnd he has every right to call that out.\u201d When Dana Bash asked if he was saying Biden is too old to be president, Booker said no. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to Joe Biden over the years and often felt like there were times that he is going on or meandering in his speech,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Cory Booker on Juli\u00e1n Castro's jab at former VP Joe Biden's memory: \"Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out.\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rMvlolVf0j \u2014 OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 13, 2019\n\nWhile flawed in some memorable ways, Biden performed better last night than in the previous two debates. He sounded more like the candidate who fared well as an underdog in 2008 Democratic primary debates against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cMy time is up,\u201d Biden said in June, abruptly cutting himself off during the first debate in Miami. He\u2019d been urged by advisers not to drone on and to keep his answers tight. But it sounded like an allegory.\n\nLast night, Biden brushed aside a moderator who tried to cut him off. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do! Twice over, okay?\u201d The crowd applauded.\n\nAs he prepared to deliver his final answer of the night, Biden was interrupted by hecklers who want to preserve DACA and abolish ICE but not until the very end of the debate, long after the immigration discussion. It was just as he began to talk about losing his wife and young daughter in a 1972 car crash. It was the worst possible timing for activists to draw attention to their cause, and it also made Biden a more sympathetic figure to the audience watching at home.\n\nEven the director of rapid response for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign came to Biden\u2019s defense:\n\nTo be fair to Biden, he was about to talk about the loss of his family in a car accident when those protesters broke out to interrupt him.\n\n\n\nYou had 140 minutes before this, protesters. Not a good look. Not a good a look. \u2014 Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cI lost my faith for a while,\u201d Biden said during the answer that followed. Referring to the death of his son Beau to brain cancer in 2015, Biden explained that he only got through it by \u201cfinding purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there's a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another, without the help I had. There are real heroes out there.\u201d\n\nHere are six other takeaways from the nearly three-hour debate:\n\n1) Biden benefited from the presence of fewer moderates onstage.\n\nHe came out swinging at the liberal senators on both sides of him, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, over their Medicare-for-all plan. Biden noted that union members took pay cuts to get better health benefits, and Medicare-for-all would take away private insurance they bargained for. He asked if Sanders thinks companies are going to make up for it. Sanders said they would under his plan. \u201cFor a socialist,\u201d Biden quipped, \u201cyou\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate Americn than I do.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar also fared better because other more moderate candidates did not qualify for the debate, including Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. There was also no John Delaney, the former congressman from Maryland, or John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who is now running for Senate.\n\nDemocrats have spent two-and-a-half years attacking Trump for using executive power to enact his agenda, but several of them promise in the next breath to use executive power to advance their own agenda. Biden called this out on the issue of an assault weapons ban. Sen. Kamala Harris has proposed banning the importation of assault weapons via executive action, something the Obama administration opted not to try after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cI would say, Joe, instead of saying \u2018No, we can\u2019t,\u2019 let\u2019s say \u2018Yes, we can,\u2019\u201d said Harris, delivering one of several lines that sounded overly rehearsed. \u201cLet\u2019s be constitutional,\u201d Biden replied.\n\n2) But, but, but: Biden, seeking the presidency for a third time, still cannot figure out how to speak effectively about racial issues.\n\nDuring a rambling answer about racial inequality in schools, Biden focused on class. He said one way to help educate impoverished children in bad schools is to \u201cmake sure the record player is on at night.\u201d His point was that this is a way for them to pick up new words they might not hear otherwise.\n\n\u201cPlay the radio, make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have a record player on at night,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMake sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school, or a very poor background, will hear four million fewer words spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nThere were related gaffes and malapropisms, \u201cNobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime,\u201d he declared at one point. In the spin room, Biden clarified that he meant \u201cnonviolent drug offenses.\u201d\n\n3) After the surprising Obama pile-on at the Detroit debate in July, several of the candidates recalibrated on the former president. They love him again. But Castro was right in one respect: Biden is still trying to have it both ways.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Obama\u2019s name was invoked 29 times onstage at the historically black college that hosted the debate.\n\nBiden sought to use Obama as a cudgel. He attacked Warren for supporting the Medicare-for-all bill that was written by Sanders. \u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far,\u201d Warren replied, praising his courage, talent and will \u201cto see us this far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to do what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, which is a public option,\u201d Klobuchar said of her approach to health care.\n\nCastro even said he\u2019s the rightful heir to Obama. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not,\u201d he told Biden. \u201cThat\u2019d be a surprise to him,\u201d replied Biden.\n\nWhen Univision anchor Jorge Ramos pressed Biden on whether he supported the deportation policies carried out by the Obama administration, Biden grew uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nCastro said Biden always tries to take credit for popular actions Obama took but distances himself from the unpopular. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent,\u201d Biden insisted. \u201cI did not say I did not stand with him.\u201d\n\nLater in the night, however, Biden volunteered that he opposed Obama\u2019s surge in Afghanistan a decade ago. \u201cIt's an open secret,\u201d he said.\n\n4) A striking split screen: Democrats praised John McCain in Houston as Trump criticized him in Baltimore.\n\nAs Harris explained why the Affordable Care Act remains in danger so long as Trump is president, she said: \u201cThe late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o'clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country.\u201d The crowd applauded McCain.\n\nAs Warren answered a question about Afghanistan, she told a story about traveling to Afghanistan with McCain two summers ago. \u201cI think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I talked to people \u2014 we did \u2014 we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders, we talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: Show me what winning looks like. Tell me what it looks like. And what you hear is a lot of, \u2018Uh,\u2019 because no one can describe it. And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.\u201d\n\nIt's inconceivable that McCain, if he was alive, would say that the problems in Afghanistan cannot be solved with a military. For his part, though, Trump singled out McCain, though not by name, for thwarting his effort to repeal Obamacare while he spoke last night at the House Republican retreat in Baltimore. Colby Itkowitz noticed that the president was criticizing McCain at almost the same time as the Democrats were praising him. Who would have foreseen this 11 years ago when McCain was the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer?\n\n5) Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Hail Mary means he\u2019ll never be able to run for Senate in Texas again.\n\nThe former Texas congressman touted his plan for a mandatory government buyback of assault weapons, a position he took after the Aug. 3 massacre in El Paso. \u201cHell yes,\u201d he said when a moderator asked if he\u2019s confiscating guns. \u201cWe're going to take your AR-15 [and] your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow them to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nIn a reflection of the degree to which his rivals have concluded that he lacks a viable path to the nomination, a bunch of the Democrats onstage praised him effusively. \u201cThe way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBeto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy,\u201d said Harris. \u201cI so appreciate what the congressman\u2019s been doing,\u201d said Klobuchar, even as she said she doesn\u2019t support a mandatory buyback.\n\n6) Buttigieg would have benefitted from more speaking time. He had two poignant moments that captured why he raised so much money this spring.\n\nThe mayor of South Bend, Ind., got 11.4 minutes of speaking time. That was sixth-most of the 10 candidates. Biden got the most, with 17.4 minutes. He was perhaps the most polished candidate on stage.\n\nIn lieu of closing statements, all the candidates were asked about the most significant professional setback they\u2019ve faced. Buttigieg reflected on his decision to come out of the closet as gay, even though he was up for reelection in the \u201csocially conservative community\u201d that is home to Notre Dame, a Catholic school.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that, when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80 percent of the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he also used that same frame to criticize Sanders and Warren over Medicare-for-all. \u201cThe problem, Sen. Sanders, with the \u2018damn bill\u2019 that he wrote, and that Sen. Warren backs, is that it doesn\u2019t trust the American people,\u201d Buttigieg said during the round on health care. \u201cI trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has tried to straddle the fence by endorsing a plan he calls \u201cMedicare-for-all who want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them,\u201d Buttigieg said, using the language of the abortion rights community. Turning toward Sanders and Warren, he asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nMORE TEAM COVERAGE:\n\n-- A reality check: \u201cThe lengthy discussion appeared to do little to change the overall contours of the Democratic primary, with few standout moments or major missteps during the course of the nearly three-hour event,\u201d Toluse Olorunnipa, Annie Linskey and Matt Viser write in our lead story. \u201cWarren, who has been ascendant in the polls in recent months, spent long stretches without speaking Thursday, and did not end up challenging Biden directly during her first face-to-face debate with the former vice president.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cBiden was aided as much by the fact that neither Warren nor Sanders was the dominant force on Thursday as by his own performance,\u201d Dan Balz writes. \u201cBiden did not dominate from start to finish and did not make it through the evening mistake free. But on balance this was the kind of evening he needed, after two previous debates in which he drew mixed to negative reviews\u2026\u201d\n\n-- Our Fact Checker team scrutinizes eight statements made by candidates onstage. Three examples from Glenn Kessler, Sal Rizzo and Meg Kelly: \u201cContrary to Biden\u2019s claim, the Obama administration did use caged enclosures beginning in 2014 to hold families apprehended along the southern border by U.S. authorities.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s claim that there are more African Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850 is false: \u201cThe 1850 Census counted 3.6 million slaves. That\u2019s compared to African Americans constituting 2.3 million [in prison] \u2026 Moreover, even if the black men comparison is correct in terms of raw numbers, it\u2019s still misleading because the U.S. population has soared since 1850.\u201d\u201cCampaigning for universal health care, Sanders claims 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical bills or illness. \u2026 Sanders\u2019s claim is based on a study published by the American Journal of Public Health in March. But the study doesn\u2019t establish that \u2026 The lead researcher behind the study says Sanders\u2019s claim might be on target when measuring only the share of respondents who said medical bills or illness \u2018very much\u2019 contributed to their bankruptcies. But those estimates are not in the study itself. \u2026 The research team Sanders cited once included [Warren], who contributed to earlier versions of their study when she was a Harvard professor. Interestingly, though, Warren doesn\u2019t appear to make the same claim\u2026\u201d\n\n-- The focus on health care, which was the top topic in the previous debates, left other topics uncovered. Philip Bump created charts of how much time ABC devoted to each issue and which issues the candidates got to talk about:\n\n-- Our graphics team made this chart to illustrate which candidates went on the attack. By their tally, Castro leveled more attacks than anyone else:\n\n-- And here's who talked the most:\n\n-- What 10 pundits are saying about who won and lost:\n\nJoe Biden, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Andrew Yang talk after the debate. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\n-- More coverage and takes this morning from across the media ecosystem:\n\n-- Correction: The original version of this story mischaracterized Harris\u2019s proposed executive action on guns. She is proposing banning the importation of assault weapons, not a full ban, through executive action.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nTrump speaks to House Republicans on Thursday night in Baltimore. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- The Trump administration said it would seek to open up the entire coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin report: \u201cIn filing a final environmental impact statement, the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management took a key step closer to holding an oil and gas lease sale for the nearly 1.6 million-acre coastal plain, which is part of the 19.3 million-acre ANWR. The administration said its preferred plan would call for the construction of as many as four places for airstrips and well pads, 175 miles of roads, vertical supports for pipelines, a seawater treatment plant and a barge landing and storage site.\u201d\n\n-- The White House is moving forward with its plan to strip California of its authority to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas standards. From Reuters: \u201cTrump met with senior officials on Thursday at the White House to discuss the administration\u2019s plan to divide its August 2018 proposal to rollback Obama era standards through 2025 and revoke California\u2019s waiver under the Clean Air Act to set state requirements for vehicles. \u2026 Following the meeting, sources said the administration plans to move ahead in coming weeks to divide the final regulation and finalize first the portion dealing with preempting states before issuing the new yearly standards.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s proposal to tackle California\u2019s homelessness faces local and legal obstacles. Scott Wilson reports: \u201cThe White House effort has taken state officials by surprise, as the president has shifted from criticizing California\u2019s management of homelessness on social media to proposals that would insert the federal government directly into the crisis, including relocating homeless people living on the street and in tent camps to a federal facility. But the state\u2019s growing homeless problem hasn\u2019t been contained by similar policy initiatives in the past. It is an unusual crisis stemming in part from the state\u2019s economic success and one where the lack of political will, rather than a lack of public resources, is often the primary obstacle to resolving it. \u2026 Angry local politics has also emerged around the issue. In recent months, residents have organized against plans for neighborhood homeless shelters, from once-solidly conservative Orange County to the liberal Bay Area. Local ballot measures approved in recent years to raise money to address homelessness have become tangled in legal challenges. \u2026 Even with the additional shelter space the FAA building might provide, city officials would face the challenge of getting homeless residents to use it. One Trump administration official said Wednesday, \u2018We\u2019re not rounding up anyone or anything yet.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The federal deficit increased to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the first time that year-to-date deficits have topped that amount in seven years. From the Wall Street Journal: \u201cHigher spending on the military, rising interest expenses on government debt and weak revenues early in the fiscal year combined to push the deficit up 19% from October through August, compared with the same period a year earlier. Government spending climbed 7%, to $4.1 trillion, outpacing higher federal tax receipts, which grew 3%, to $3.1 trillion. That brought the total deficit to $1.07 trillion so far in fiscal 2019, which started Oct. 1, or 4.4% as a share of gross domestic product. The last time the U.S. recorded a budget gap of that magnitude in the first 11 months of the fiscal year was in August 2012, when the deficit totaled $1.16 trillion, a period when the U.S. was still climbing out of a deep recession.\"\n\n-- Trump is, indeed, the king of debt, writes Philip Bump: \u201cOne of the things he talked about a lot during the campaign was the federal budget deficit and the long-term federal debt. By my count, he talked about the debt or the deficit on 190 distinct days from 2011 to 2016\u2026 As a businessman, Trump relied on debt. At one point during the campaign, he called himself the \u2018king of debt,\u2019 a bit of bragging about how he had increased his wealth. As it turns out, though, that bit of bragging was a better predictor of his presidency than his pledges to keep the debt under control. \u2026 Trump stands out, not only as having overseen numerous months of increasing deficits but also in the scale of those deficits. Since 1992, there have been 11 months in which the deficit topped $200 billion. Seven of those have happened under Trump.\u201d\n\n-- Chief Justice John Roberts changed his vote to block Trump\u2019s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. From CNN's Joan Bikuspic, a biographer of Roberts: \u201cFor the most part, Roberts' opinion in the census case laid out why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had significant latitude to add a new question. He was joined by his four conservative brethren on that point. But then the chief justice swerved, and joined by the four liberal justices, said Ross' justification for the citizenship question, tied to enforcing the Voting Rights Act, was contrived. After the justices heard arguments in late April, Roberts was ready to rule for Ross and the administration. But sometime in the weeks that followed, sources said, Roberts began to waver. He began to believe that Ross' rationale for the citizenship question had been invented, and that, despite the deference he would normally give an executive branch official, Ross' claim had to matter in the court's final judgment, which Roberts announced on June 27.\u201d\n\nAndrew McCabe, former acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, listens during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nTRUMP'S WASHINGTON:\n\n-- The Justice Department authorized prosecutors to charge former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, alleging that he lied to investigators. Matt Zapotosky and Spencer S. Hsu report: \u201cA top official in Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s office notified McCabe\u2019s team that his appeal to Rosen to abandon the case had failed. \u2026 McCabe\u2019s team had been told last month that line prosecutors recommended charges and later that U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District of Columbia had endorsed that decision ... McCabe\u2019s team had then appealed to Rosen in what was considered one of his final chances to persuade officials not to move forward and seek an indictment from a grand jury. The legal team had been waiting for a response. The notification was notable in its own right but particularly suggestive that charges were imminent, because a federal grand jury investigating McCabe was suddenly recalled this week after a months-long hiatus. But the panel was released Thursday with no immediate signs of an indictment.\"\n\n-- Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo) traded insults as they tried to prove their alignment with Trump. John Wagner reports: \u201cWhat began as an exchange of different views on Afghanistan policy moved on to other subjects during several tweets and an afternoon television appearance by Paul. During a CNN interview, he questioned the allegiance of both Cheney and her father, the former Republican vice president Richard B. Cheney, to Trump. \u2018I guess the problem with the Cheneys, both Dick and Liz, is that they\u2019ve always been Never Trumpers. They hate President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, they want to stay in Afghanistan forever,\u2019 [Paul said]. \u2026 Cheney responded shortly afterward on Twitter, referring to Paul\u2019s Republican bid for president in which he was eclipsed by Trump in the primaries.\u201d\n\n-- Trump kicked off the House GOP\u2019s retreat with a speech bashing Democrats and the media. Rachael Bade and Paul Kane report: \"He started his speech an hour later than planned, but in so doing managed to take the stage in Charm City at the exact minute that the 2020 Democratic presidential debate got underway. \u2026 In Trump\u2019s speech and in a GOP leadership news conference launching the event, Republicans introduced their new colleague, Rep.-elect Dan Bishop, the North Carolina state lawmaker who narrowly won a special election in a strong GOP district. ...\n\n\u201cAt one point, Trump veered off script to take a shot at the Democrats onstage in Texas at that moment, calling Biden \u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019 and Sanders \u2018Crazy Bernie.\u2019 \u2018I hit Pocahontas way too early,\u2019 he said, referring to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2018I thought she was gone. She\u2019s emerged from the ashes and now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe, he\u2019s falling asleep. He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s doing or saying.\u2019 Trump, who just weeks ago endorsed stronger background checks for gun owners, made no mention of gun control at all. The president has since rescinded that position. \u2026 Despite the [House] Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote earlier Thursday, Trump steered clear of impeachment until the one-hour mark of the speech, mocking their investigations briefly and then quickly moving on.\u201d\n\n-- Baltimore residents welcomed Trump with protests and (inflatable) rodents. Erin Cox and Ovetta Wiggins report: \u201cThe visit by the president \u2014 who maligned Baltimore as a \u2018disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u2019 where \u2018no human being would want to live\u2019 \u2014 was limited to a dinnertime speech kicking off the GOP retreat at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront Hotel in Harbor East. In a small park a few blocks away, more than 100 protesters strongly embraced the rat motif. Signs likened the president and the GOP to rodents, and people donned masks, petted stuffed vermin, or wore them on their heads. \u2018Trump is the real rat!\u2019 the crowd chanted. Evening commuters leaned on their horns in support.\u201d\n\n-- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) said he wants to run for president again \u2013 in 2024. \u201cWe came very, very close in 2016. And it\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d he told the Christian Science Monitor.\n\n-- Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said doesn\u2019t plan on endorsing anyone in 2020. (CNN)\n\n-- The man Trump once called \u201cmy African American\u201d at a rally is leaving the GOP. He explained why to PBS: \u201cGregory Cheadle \u2026 is fed up. After two years of frustration with the president\u2019s rhetoric on race and the lack of diversity in the administration, Cheadle [said] he has decided to leave the Republican party and run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as an independent in 2020. Now, the 62-year-old real estate broker, who supported the Republican approach to the economy, said he sees the party as pursuing a \u2018pro-white\u2019 agenda and using black people like him as \u2019political pawns.\u2019 The final straw for Cheadle came when he watched many Republicans defend Trump\u2019s tweets telling four congresswomen of color, who are all American citizens, to go back to their countries, as well as defend the president\u2019s attacks on Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and his comments that Cummings\u2019 hometown of Baltimore is \u2018infested.'\"\n\n-- A new Republican PAC ran an ad during last night's debate comparing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Tim Elfrink reports: The ad compares the congresswoman\u2019s support of democratic socialism to the communist Khmer Rouge regime that killed an estimated 1.7 million people in the 1970s. \u201cThe spot, funded by a newly formed Republican PAC and narrated by a recently defeated California GOP candidate, left Ocasio-Cortez accusing its producers of racism and critics to question why ABC approved the ad. (The network didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages on Thursday night.) \u2018Know that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2014 that was the pretense,\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u2018What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case.\u2019 The ad was produced by New Faces GOP, a PAC that aims to bring \u2018candidate from all races, ethnicities, gender, or geography\u2019 to the Republican Party. The Fresno-based organization is fronted by Elizabeth Heng, who lost in November to Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) in a 16th Congressional District race; he received 54 percent of the vote to her 46 percent. Heng narrates the ad by highlighting her family\u2019s story. Her parents, Chieu Heng and Siv Khoeu, survived the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot, during which roughly a quarter of the country\u2019s population died from summary executions, famine, disease and overwork from 1975 to 1979.\u201d\n\n-- A man honored by Trump for his heroic actions during the El Paso shooting made up his story, police claim. From ABC News: \u201cChris Grant was supposed to receive an honor this week from the White House for heroically distracting the gunman \u2026 and possibly saving lives. Instead, he was detained by the Secret Service in Washington ahead of the visit and his story has been called into question. \u2026 Grant, who sustained bullet wounds during the shooting, gave an interview from his hospital bed in which he said he threw soda bottles at the gunman to distract him from shooting others, prompting the gunman to turn his weapon on Grant. The White House event went ahead as planned despite Grant being detained. His mother, who was in attendance, was given a certificate of commendation on her son's behalf, and Trump praised Grant's actions. \u2026 However, El Paso police have since reviewed video surveillance that they say contradicts Grant's story. But they declined to describe what action, if any, Grant took, or comment on any interaction he might have had with the gunman.\u201d\n\n-- A conservative group paid to rent Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel ballrooms for events headlined by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. David A. Fahrenthold reports: \u201cPence spoke Thursday night at the hotel, during a gala put on by the Concerned Women for America, a 40-year-old conservative nonprofit organization that says it promotes \u2018Biblical values and Constitutional principles.\u2019 Tickets to that event cost at least $99, according to the group\u2019s website. Pompeo will speak at a separate event at the Trump hotel on Friday, a \u2018celebration luncheon\u2019 held by the same conservative group, his staff said. \u2026 Spokespeople for Pence and Pompeo defended the speeches, saying the appearances did not steer this business to the president\u2019s hotel, as the nonprofit had already chosen the venue before inviting the two officials. They said the appearances had been vetted for ethical or legal concerns and approved by others in the White House and the State Department.\u201d\n\n-- An examination of the military layovers at Trump\u2019s resort in Turnberry, Scotland, paints a complicated picture. From the Times: \u201cThere is little evidence of a systematic scheme to enrich Mr. Trump. But the military bookings at Turnberry are the latest in a series of episodes in which the president\u2019s private businesses have intersected with his public position in ways that he can profit from. The pattern also raises questions about how military officials failed to anticipate the questions that would accompany a large number of American military personnel marching into the opulent halls of one of the president\u2019s golf resorts at public expense. \u2026 The military says the vast majority of American military personnel who have passed through since 2016 have stayed at other area hotels, not Mr. Trump\u2019s. On Thursday, the Air Force said in a statement that it had found 659 instances when its flight crews stayed overnight in the area in the past four years. Of those stays, the Air Force estimated that 6 percent, or about 40 \u2014 far more than had previously been identified publicly \u2014 went to Mr. Trump\u2019s property.\u201d\n\n-- The inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development cleared Secretary Ben Carson of misconduct for ordering a $31,000 dining room set for his office. Tracy Jan reports: \u201cThe investigation was launched more than a year ago following accusations that Carson had violated federal law in 2017 by ordering furniture above the $5,000 legal limit for office redecorating without notifying congressional appropriators. \u2026 The investigation concluded that the purchase order was initiated after HUD staff determined that the 30-year-old furniture in Carson\u2019s suite was in poor condition and should be replaced. Staff also told Carson that departmental funds were available and that the money would be lost if not spent by a certain date, the report said. The evidence showed that Carson was \u2018fine\u2019 with replacing the furniture but left the details to his staff and his wife, Candy Carson, who provided \u2018stylistic input.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The father of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was found guilty of illegally funneling contributions to his daughter\u2019s 2014 race against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cJerry Lundergan, former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party, and Democratic consultant Dale Emmons were convicted on 10 and six counts, respectively. Prosecutors said the two had carried out a scheme to direct more than $200,000 in corporate contributions to Grimes\u2019s campaign in violation of federal election laws, the Herald-Leader reported. \u2026 The Lundergans are one of the most prominent families in Kentucky Democratic politics. In addition to serving twice as state Democratic Party chairman, Lundergan also served in the Kentucky state House. He has had a long-standing political rivalry with another Kentucky Democratic stalwart, former governor Steve Beshear. Thursday\u2019s verdict is the latest political setback for Grimes, who had been viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party even after her 2014 loss to McConnell. She was among the speakers at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and sharply criticized Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for running for reelection at the same time that he pursued a presidential bid.\u201d\n\n\u00ad-- Harvard is reviewing millions of dollars it received in donations from Jeffrey Epstein. From CNBC: \u201c\u2018Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible,\u2019 Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote. \u2018I profoundly regret Harvard\u2019s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society.\u2019 Bacow said the review is ongoing, and that it has already found that wealthy financier Epstein made several gifts to the school between 1998 and 2007, including a $6.5 million gift to Harvard\u2019s Program of Evolutionary Dynamics. The president also said that the review has not found any donation from Epstein after he pleaded guilty to a sex crime in 2008.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- The rise of nationalism around the globe may be reflected in the outcome of the Israeli elections on Tuesday, explains foreign affairs columnist Robert Kagan: \u201cIn the growing confrontation between the liberal world order and its anti-liberal nationalist and authoritarian opponents, which side does Israel want to be on? The question would have been absurd even a decade ago, when Israelis still regarded themselves as members in good standing in the liberal world. But in recent years, Israeli foreign policy has been trending in a decidedly anti-liberal direction. Since about the middle of 2015, the Israeli government has: embraced Hungary\u2019s avowedly \u2018illiberal\u2019 Prime Minister Viktor Orban \u2026 warmly embraced Brazil\u2019s right-wing nationalist leader Jair Bolsonaro; provided a state visit for President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who once likened himself to Adolf Hitler; worked consistently to woo Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2026 [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, who faces a difficult reelection vote next Tuesday, insists he is only leading Israel out of international isolation, but the common denominator among all these new partners has been an avowed hostility toward liberalism and the liberal world order, and the prime minister himself has become something of a \u2018central figure in the global non-liberal camp,\u2019 as Israeli commentators have noted.\u201d\n\n-- Facebook suspended a chatbot operated by Netanyahu\u2019s official account for violating hate speech rules after it sent a message saying that Israel\u2019s Arab politicians \u201cwant to destroy us all.\u201d The New York Times's Isabel Kershner reports: \u201cThe message, which went out in the name of a Netanyahu campaign volunteer, was trying to rally right-wing support for Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud party in next Tuesday\u2019s election. \u2026 It urged supporters to come out to the polls to prevent the advent of \u2018a dangerous left-wing government,\u2019 whose Jewish leaders, it said, would rely on the support of Arab politicians \u2018who want to destroy us all \u2014 women, children and men \u2014 and enable a nuclear Iran that would wipe us out.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- China said it would call off planned tariff hikes on soybeans and pork and \u201csupport purchases\u201d as a conciliatory gesture toward the United States days after Trump delayed tariff increases of his own. \u201cThe move, announced by state media, adds to a sense that momentum is building in lower-level negotiations ahead of the next round of high-level meetings in Washington sometime next month,\u201d Gerry Shih reports from Beijing.\n\n-- In the Bahamas, Hurricane Dorian exposed one of the world\u2019s great faultlines of inequality. Kevin Sieff reports: \u201cFor years, wealthy visitors to Baker\u2019s Bay could ignore the precarious living conditions in the Mudd. But now, in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, that\u2019s no longer possible. The shantytown has been destroyed. Many people were killed; the rest are homeless. The devastating human toll has exposed an economic dependency \u2014 there\u2019s no one to repair the mansions. The inequality between rich and poor, tourist and worker, was laid bare as the storm approached. When Dorian made landfall on Great Abaco Island as a Category 5 hurricane, the people of Baker\u2019s Bay had cleared out. Its homeowners, almost all seasonal residents with primary homes in the United States or Europe, hired local workers to put up hurricane shutters and prepare for the storm while they tracked it from afar. But the Mudd was full. Some residents wanted to stay to guard their homes and belongings. Others \u2014 many of them undocumented Haitians \u2014 fled to local churches for shelter. They said there was little opportunity to leave the island ahead of the storm. Within hours, the entire community was flattened. Homes were blown to rubble. At least dozens were killed \u2014 the number climbs as more bodies are found.\u201d\n\n-- Thousands of migrants fleeing persecution, most from Central America, line up daily at the southern border hoping for asylum. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling makes almost all of them not eligible for asylum. From the Times: \u201cThe Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the Trump administration to enforce new rules that bar asylum applications from anyone who has not already been denied asylum in one of the countries they traveled through on their way to the United States. The rule is among the most stringent measures taken by this administration in its battle to halt migration, upending decades of asylum and humanitarian norms. It is likely to affect hundreds of thousands of migrants traveling through Mexico to reach the United States: Eritreans and Cameroonians fleeing political violence. Nicaraguans and Venezuelans fleeing repression. And the largest group of all: Hondurans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans escaping the twin scourges of poverty and gangs. \u2018This takes away all hope,\u2019 said Eddie Leonardo Caliz, 34, who left San Pedro Sula in Honduras with his wife and two kids three months ago to try to escape gang violence, and spoke from a shelter in southern Mexico. With measures like this, he said, the Trump administration \u2018is depriving us of the opportunity to be safe.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump wants Honduras to accept more asylum seekers. Claudia Mendoza and Mary Beth Sheridan report: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the poorest and most violent nations in the hemisphere. Anti-government protests have swept the capital. Its president is fending off allegations by U.S. prosecutors that he financed his campaign with narco cash. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have fled. And now, the Trump administration wants it to sign a migration deal that could require it to take in U.S.-bound asylum seekers. American officials are seeking to establish \u2018safe third country\u2019 deals throughout the region, to diminish the crush of asylum seekers at the U.S. border. Authorities already have pressed Panama and Guatemala to reach such accords. Honduran officials have confirmed talks on migration but have been guarded about the details. \u2026 The closed-door talks have alarmed activists, analysts and opposition politicians in this Central American nation.\"\n\n-- Millions of refugees from Venezuela are straining their neighbors\u2019 generosity. From the Economist: \u201cThe exodus could exceed 8 [million], a quarter of the population, by the end of 2020 unless democracy and stability return, predicts the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u2026 Until now, the largest displacement of people in Latin America\u2019s history has occurred without much international fuss. In part that is because it has taken place mostly by land, unprompted by war or natural disaster. \u2026 But as Venezuela\u2019s crisis has dragged on, destination countries are withdrawing their initial warm welcome. Recent refugees are poorer than those in earlier waves. They are arriving in countries where economic growth is slow, good jobs are scarce and budgets for health and education are stretched. Early promises to co-operate in dealing with the flow of migrants are being broken. Door-slamming adds to the number of unlawful migrants, who are vulnerable to exploitation by employers and recruitment by criminal groups.\u201d\n\n-- The speaker of the U.K. parliament promised \u201ccreativity\u201d to ensure Prime Minister Boris Johnson obeys the new Brexit delay law preventing him from taking Britain out of the E.U. without a deal at the end of October. From Reuters: House of Commons speaker John Bercow \u201cwho has been accused by the government of breaking parliamentary rules to help lawmakers try to force a delay to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, said it was \u2018astonishing\u2019 that anyone was entertaining the idea of not obeying the law. \u2018If we come close to being there I would imagine that parliament would want to cut off such a possibility and to do so forcefully,\u2019 he said in a lecture to lawyers late on Thursday.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nOne of the 2020 candidates who didn't qualify for the debate opined from home:\n\nAn hour in: Nice people.
