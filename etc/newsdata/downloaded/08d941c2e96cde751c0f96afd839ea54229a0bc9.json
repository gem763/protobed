They are on a par with these New Zealand superheroes.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWorld Cup-winning coach from 2003 Woodward added: \"That was totally complete. They strangled the All Blacks to death, not just the first two minutes, but the whole game.\n\n\"The physicality, 1-15, was fantastic. It was huge and totally deserved. They absolutely smashed them.\"\n\nEngland will face either South Africa or Wales in next Saturday's final and having crushed the odds-on favourites to win the Webb Ellis Trophy, they will be expected to repeat their solitary triumph of 2003.", "description": "England produced one of their greatest-ever displays to storm into the 2019 Rugby World Cup final", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728770.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RUGBYU-WC-2019-MATCH45-ENG-NZL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
