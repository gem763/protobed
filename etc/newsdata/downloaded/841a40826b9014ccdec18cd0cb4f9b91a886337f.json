Covering Costs? Not So Easy.", "language": "en", "text": "Britta Vander Linden is one of many lymphedema patients who struggles to get health insurers to pay for compression garments. (Lynne Shallcross/KHN)\n\nEvery morning, Britta Vander Linden dons compression stockings, a cumbersome process she calls \u201cputting on my legs.\u201d\n\nShe relies on the garments to stand and walk without intense leg pain and swelling. That\u2019s because Vander Linden, 44, was born with lymphedema.\n\nThe condition affects the lymphatic system, a network of lymph nodes and vessels that move infection-fighting liquid through the body. When that network is damaged, fluid can build up and cause limbs to swell well beyond their normal size and make them susceptible to harmful infections.\n\nLymphedema is incurable, but specialized compression stockings, sleeves and gloves help prevent complications such as tissue damage, more swelling and infection.\n\nThey\u2019re also expensive.\n\nVander Linden\u2019s insurance coverage, which she gets through her job as a senior director of communications at a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization, covers about half the annual cost of her stockings, she said. For the rest of the year, she added, she pays out of pocket \u2015 between $2,500 and $3,500 annually.\n\nRelated:\u200b Why My Insurance Company\u2019s Treatment of My Lymphedema Means I\u2019m Suffering\n\n\u201cI guess they\u2019re thinking I don\u2019t have to stand up\u201d for half the year, she said.\n\nView photos Britta Vander Linden uses compression stockings to help prevent complications from her lymphedema.

Coverage varies among private insurance plans, and for many patients it is limited. Although Medicaid programs cover some of these expenses, Medicare does not.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for legislation to change that. \u201cRight now there is a patch quilt across the country to navigate to get the care that you need,\u201d said William Repicci, CEO of the Lymphatic Education & Research Network, a patient advocacy group.\n\nLymphedema affects as many as 5 million people in the United States. The majority develop the condition after undergoing cancer treatment, especially if they had surgery that required removing lymph nodes to stop the spread of disease. Breast cancer patients are particularly affected by the condition.\n\nPeople generally wear the garments daily, said Dr. Stanley Rockson, a professor of lymphatic research and medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. Depending on the severity of the disease, some people also require them at night.\n\nRelated:\u200b Why I've Become an Advocate for Primary Lymphedema\n\nPrices for garments vary considerably. A standard-fit arm sleeve costs $81, but a custom-made equivalent can run $202, according to the Lymphedema Advocacy Group, a patient volunteer organization seeking a federal mandate for insurance coverage. One pair of waist-high stockings costs $159 off the shelf. When made to order, the price can jump to $960.\n\nSome patients need custom garments because the standard size cannot adequately accommodate the affected area.\n\nGarments should be replaced two to four times a year, Rockson said. The 1998 federal Women\u2019s Health and Cancer Rights Act has helped some patients get insurers to cover their compression garments. The law requires insurers that provide coverage for mastectomies to also cover complications related to the procedure, including these socks and sleeves. It applies to employer-based plans, as well as those that people buy on the individual market.\n\nA handful of states, including Maryland and Virginia, have laws requiring health plans subject to state regulation to cover lymphedema treatment, including supplies such as compression garments. Virginia\u2019s law, from 2004, was the nation\u2019s first. Maryland\u2019s took effect this year.\n\nAt least three other states \u2015 California, Massachusetts and North Carolina \u2015 require health insurers to pay some of the costs, according to an analysis from the Maryland Department of Legislative Services.\n\nBut many people aren\u2019t covered by these laws because large-employer health plans are generally regulated by the federal government. In Maryland, approximately 25% of residents have plans that may be affected, state officials estimated.", "description": "KHN reports on how insurance companies rarely cover the costs of compression garments, an effective treatment for managing lymphedema symptoms.", "authors": ["Kaiser Health News", "Carmen Heredia Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/91ZGLf3O02JfdAgVh9yRgA--~B/aD0yMTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_mighty_beauty_225/4bb764e5f726c8bdee3ccde3c8fe3804", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
