Ilhan Omar Is Divorcing Her Husband After Years of 'Speculation and Innuendo' Took Their Toll", "language": "en", "text": "Freshman Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who burst into the national spotlight last fall as part of a wave of trailblazing lawmakers in Congress, has filed for divorce from her husband, Ahmed Hirsi, PEOPLE confirms.\n\nThe divorce petition, which was first reported by TMZ, was filed on Friday (which was coincidentally Omar\u2019s birthday).\n\nA hearing is scheduled for Oct. 29, court records show.\n\nOmar, 37, cited \u201cirretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship,\u201d according to TMZ, and is seeking joint custody of her three children with Hirsi, 39.\n\nA spokeswoman for Omar did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. Hirsi could not be reached.\n\n\u201cAs with all marriages, this is intensely personal and a difficult time for their family,\u201d a spokesperson for Omar told TMZ, adding, \u201cJust like any other family navigating this kind of transition, Ilhan wishes to have their privacy respected for themselves and their children and will not be commenting any further.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson also cited what they called years of \u201cspeculation and innuendo from political opponents and the media\u201d which had \u201ctaken a significant toll on Ilhan, Ahmed, and their three children.\u201d\n\nThey were apparently referring, in part, to reports this year in mostly conservative media based on court documents from a political consultant\u2019s estranged wife alleging that Omar had an affair with the consultant. The consultant reportedly denied this, charging the accusation was part of a smear campaign.\n\nSeparately, in 2016, Omar shot down the baseless claim \u2014 which she called \u201cabsurd and offensive\u201d \u2014 that her previous husband, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, was actually her brother and the two had really wed to advance his own immigration case.\n\nRELATED: Meet \u2018the Squad\u2019 \u2014 The Four Democratic Congresswomen of Color Trump Blasted in Racist Tweets\n\nFrom left: Ahmed Hirsi and Rep.
