Bernie Sanders as \u201cthe senator on my left,\u201d or \u201cmy friend from Vermont,\u201d and \u201cthe senator\u201d when speaking of Elizabeth Warren, who was standing to his right.\n\nHe called Beto O\u2019Rourke by his first name, then apologized for being too informal, leading O\u2019Rourke to answer \u201cBeto\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nAnd when thanking Pete Buttigieg for his military service he seemed to stumble for a moment before calling him simply \u201cmy friend.\u201d\n\nIn part it was likely a throwback to the traditions of the Senate, where Biden spent more than 30 years, where members refer to each other as \u201cthe gentlewoman from Massachusetts\u201d or \u201cthe gentleman from Texas.\u201d\n\nThat would not, however, explain why he at one point referred to Sanders as \u201cthe president\u201d before correcting himself to say \u201cmy friend from Vermont.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden (Photo: Mike Blake/Reuters) More\n\nAll this risked appearing to voters as though he is mired in the old traditions, while raising questions of memory and age which have plagued the 76-year-old candidate. Former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro obliquely referred to those concerns when arguing a detail of Biden\u2019s health care plan.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro goaded, touting his own plan, which automatically enrolls patients. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\nThe transcript doesn\u2019t entirely support Castro\u2019s point. Biden had said people who needed health insurance \u201ccan join immediately.\u201d\n\nSeveral minutes later, Biden called him \u201cmy colleague.\u201d\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "\u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?", "authors": ["Lisa Belkin", "Chief National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8_gpYx7yNZTm8hGhJeq9Xg--~B/aD0yMTg2O3c9MzIwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c486eea0-d5cd-11e9-9fdf-a6b3f086678d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
