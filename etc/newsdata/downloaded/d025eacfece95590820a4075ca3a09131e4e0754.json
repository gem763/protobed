(AP) - Russell Wilson is proof that a mobile quarterback who is slightly undersized by NFL standards can have a long and successful career in the league.\n\nArizona rookie Kyler Murray would love to follow Wilson\u2019s path - especially when it comes to winning.\n\nThe Cardinals (0-2-1) are still looking for their first win of the season when they host the Seahawks (2-1) on Sunday at State Farm Stadium. Murray, the No. 1 overall draft pick in April, is just 5-foot-10 but has already shown flashes of potential stardom through three games.\n\n\u201cIt was good to see a guy my size doing it. I think that helps any kid,\u201d Murray said of watching Wilson. \u201cWe kind of have the same stature, so being able to see him do it in the league, winning Super Bowls, that gives you a confidence boost.\u201d\n\nMurray and the Cardinals could use another boost of confidence after a discouraging 38-20 loss to Carolina last week. Arizona led 17-14 in the third quarter, but collapsed down the stretch. The Panthers got rolling - especially after a 76-yard touchdown run by Christian McCaffrey - and Murray threw two interceptions while trying to keep up.\n\nArizona has played from behind for much of the season. Coach Kliff Kingsbury says that\u2019s a big reason the running game hasn\u2019t been great and Murray has been sacked 16 times.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to learn, when the party\u2019s over, to get rid of it,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cYou appreciate the fact that he wants to make every play and bring us back, but there\u2019s no 21-point touchdown passes. It\u2019s just a learning curve that we\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\nSeattle won its first two games of the season before a 33-27 setback to New Orleans last weekend. The 5-11 Wilson has been dominant through three games, throwing for 901 yards, seven touchdowns and no interceptions while completing more than 71 percent of his throws.\n\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll can certainly see why Murray is compared to Wilson.\n\n\u201cKyler\u2019s a really good ballplayer,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that he belongs, and he\u2019s part of it and fits and all that. Maybe had Russell Wilson not come along, it would have been much harder for Kyler to be the first pick in the draft, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nFUMBLE TROUBLE\n\nSeattle starting running back Chris Carson may not hold his job much longer if he continues to give away the football.\n\nCarson has three lost fumbles in three games, including last Sunday when one was returned for a touchdown by the Saints. It\u2019s a tough spot for the Seahawks as Carson personifies how Seattle wants to play offensively and control the game by running the ball. But turnovers are at the top of Carroll\u2019s importance list and Carson may not get many more chances, especially if backup Rashaad Penny is healthy after missing last week with a hamstring strain.\n\nFor his part, Carroll is remaining supportive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see absolute support for our guy. He\u2019s a great football player. We love him. You\u2019re going to see what that looks like,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of players over the years, through the ages that have had issues at times. They put it to rest and it\u2019s behind them and all that. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here.\u201d\n\nSTOPPING A TIGHT END\n\nSeattle tight end Will Dissly has already caught three touchdown passes this season. That number might jump against a defense that has struggled to contain that position all season.\n\nDetroit\u2019s T.J. Hockenson, Baltimore\u2019s Mark Andrews and Carolina\u2019s Greg Olsen have all had big numbers against Arizona. Olsen caught two touchdown passes last week.\n\nKingsbury said the loss of both starting cornerbacks - Patrick Peterson (suspension) and Robert Alford (injury) - has created a bit of a domino effect in the secondary.\n\n\u201cThere are not as many bodies that you feel comfortable with covering guys as you\u2019d like,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest issue, who can you put on the tight end and feel comfortable with him covering him? That\u2019s what we have to answer.\u201d\n\nALL-TIME GREAT\n\nArizona\u2019s Larry Fitzgerald continues to be a very productive option for the team\u2019s offense, even at 36 years old.\n\nHe has 18 catches through his first three games, giving him 1,321 in his career, and needs five more to pass Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonzalez for second place behind Jerry Rice with 1,549.\n\nMORE NICKEL?\n\nSeattle has bucked the trend by playing base defense more often than not in the first three weeks. That\u2019s meant keeping linebacker Mychal Kendricks on the field more often and in only select circumstances adding an extra defensive back. Last week against New Orleans, the Seahawks stayed in their base defense on 73 percent of the plays.\n\nBut can they do that against Arizona\u2019s pass-happy offense? The Seahawks seem to think so because of the abilities of Kendricks and K.J. Wright to cover running backs and in some cases wide receivers in the slot.\n\n\u201cWe can play against anything if we put our mind to it,\u201d linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \u201cI think, no matter who we have on the field, base, nickel, whatever you want. We\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nSECOND HOME\n\nTake away the Super Bowl loss to New England, and trips to Arizona have been mostly successful. Seattle has won five of its past six trips to the desert, with the other game finishing in a 6-6 tie. Of course the games have come with some oddity, too. Kam Chancellor (neck), Richard Sherman (Achilles tendon) and Earl Thomas (leg) all played their final games for the Seahawks in Arizona as each suffered major injuries that ended their last seasons with Seattle, or in the case of Chancellor the final game of his career.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth in Seattle contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russell Wilson is proof that a mobile quarterback who is slightly undersized by NFL standards can have a long and successful career in the league.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/saints_seahawks_football_20489_c0-160-3828-2391_s1770x1032.jpg?beb87faff13892e1315fd46b2fbd807c0ec61bd9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
