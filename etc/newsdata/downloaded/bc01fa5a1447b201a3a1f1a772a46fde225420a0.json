The fact that I have to draw attention to the fact that we are pretty absent from literature is a real problem because I think a lot of people don\u2019t notice that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stories of the 12 characters featured in the book may yet reach an even broader audience.\n\nEvaristo said discussions were \u201cpretty far along\u201d regarding film and theatre rights, both of which began when the book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\nTalks over the film rights were with a UK production house, said the author. \u201cNetflix hasn\u2019t come calling yet,\u201d she added, laughing.\n\n\u201cI think this would be great in the theatre. Twelve women on stage would be amazing,\u201d added Evaristo, a former actor who co-founded a theatre company in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to run it or write it. The company who took it would take care of the writing. I might work with the writer but not writing it myself,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile the prize has been jointly awarded twice previously, the rules changed in 1993 limiting the award to one author. The judges defied those rules this year, saying they could not agree on a winner between the books by Evaristo and Atwood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to get the Booker Prize. I\u2019m happy to share it with Margaret Atwood. It\u2019s all good,\u201d Evaristo told the audience during a panel discussion at the Ake festival, with a smile.", "description": "Author Bernardine Evaristo hopes her Booker Prize-winning novel will help to alter perceptions of black British people among African readers and Britons she sees as grappling with heightened racial tension.", "authors": ["Alexis Akwagyiram", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445435715&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q07D", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
