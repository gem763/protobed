BAT already sells Vuse e-cigarettes and the Glo heated-tobacco product.\n\nBut these new categories require investment and quicker decision-making to respond to fast-changing consumer tastes, growing competition and emerging regulation.\n\nBAT on Thursday said reducing management layers and moving to fewer, larger business units would make it more agile, eliminate duplication and generate cost savings that could be reinvested in new products. In total it said 2,300 roles would be cut, affecting more than 20% of the senior positions at the company. BAT has over 55,000 employees.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nNew Chief Executive Jack Bowles, who took the helm five months ago, said the streamlining was necessary to boost growth in new products and simplify the company\u2019s operations. As a result, he said the company would be in a better position to achieve its goal of generating \u00a35 billion (about $6.16 billion) of revenue from new categories by the financial year ending 2024. Last year, adjusted revenue from vapor and heated-tobacco products rose 95% to \u00a3901 million.\n\nThe company, the No. 2 U.S. cigarette maker behind Altria Group Inc., declined to disclose how much it would save from the restructuring. It said the process would be substantially complete by January 2020.\n\nA BAT spokeswoman said the move was unrelated to coming regulation of vaping products in the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump said Wednesday the U.S. plans to pull most vaping products from the market, citing growing concerns about health hazards and rising use by teenagers. BAT has said it doesn\u2019t sell flavors that mimic children\u2019s food or appeal to youth.\n\nShares in BAT were up 1.5% in morning trading in London.\n\nWrite to Peter Stiff at peter.stiff@wsj.com", "description": "The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes will cut more than 20% of senior positions at the company as it seeks to boost the growth of new products amid declining traditional cigarette volumes.", "authors": ["Peter Stiff", "Peter.Stiff Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106484/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
