(AP) - Arizona State came away from its opening victory against Kent State with numerous areas to get better.\n\nAfter a lackluster win over an FCS opponent, the list got even longer.\n\nTheir offense stuck in neutral most of the game, the Sun Devils turned what should have been a walkover against Sacramento State into a closer-than-expected 19-7 victory - and heard about it from the home fans.\n\n\u201cI heard boos,\u201d Arizona State offensive coordinator Rob Likens said on Monday. \u201cI booed myself, but it\u2019s not going to be a quick fix.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Devils (2-0) better get something figured out this week. Coming up Saturday is a tough road game against No. 18 Michigan State.\n\nThe Spartans (2-0) are big, physical and are typically one of the nation\u2019s best defenses.\n\nFor a team with a freshman quarterback and a young offensive line, playing at Michigan State is as big a test as the Sun Devils can get.\n\n\u201cThis is our first test with a lot of young guys,\u201d Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how they react, because we\u2019ve been at home for the first two games, and now we got to go on the road.\u201d\n\nArizona State beat Michigan State 16-13 a year ago in Tempe, the first attention-grabbing win in Edwards\u2019 first season.\n\nThe Sun Devils went on to finish 7-6 and played in the Las Vegas Bowl, ratcheting up expectations for the second season of the Edwards era.\n\nArizona State opened the 2019 season with a 30-7 win over Kent State, but had trouble protecting quarterback Jayden Daniels, who was sacked five times and chased numerous others.\n\nInstead of taking a step forward against Sac State, the Sun Devils\u2019 young offensive line seemed to regress.\n\nArizona State had communication breakdowns on zone blocks and at times let defenders go at the point of attack, allowing Sac State to blow up plays before they even got started.\n\nThe biggest concern: scoring in the red zone.\n\nArizona State took the ball inside the Hornets\u2019 10-yard line five times Friday night and scored one touchdown, Eno Benjamin\u2019s 72-yard catch-and-run from Daniels with 4:42 left in the game. The Sun Devils lost a fumble and settled for field goals the other red-zone trips.\n\n\u201cThe thing that bothered me the most, that gives you sleepless nights is our inability to punch it in inside the 10-yard line,\u201d Likens said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you have 5-year-olds out there, how young you are, we\u2019ve got to find a way to punch the dang football in inside the 10-yard line. If we do that just two times, it\u2019s a whole different attitude and everything this week as you watch the game.\u201d\n\nArizona State\u2019s offensive line issues started before the season.\n\nSenior Zach Robertson, expected to start at left tackle, was away from the team all summer for personal reasons. The week of the Kent State game, senior center Cade Cote broke his foot in practice.\n\nThe losses forced Arizona State to shuffle players to new positions and move freshman center Dohnavan West in the starting lineup.\n\nAnd, with anything new, it\u2019s going to take time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a quick fix. It\u2019s just not. I know people don\u2019t want to hear that, fans don\u2019t want to hear that, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Likens said. \u201cOffensive linemen, honestly, in developed programs where you want them to be, you don\u2019t see those guys until they\u2019re redshirt juniors. Offensive linemen, it takes them longer to develop than any other position. You can get away with young receivers, a young running back, you can even get away at times with a young quarterback, but offensive linemen, it just takes time. We\u2019re going to have to develop those guys. We\u2019re going to have to protect them in what we do and it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nIt certainly won\u2019t be Saturday against Michigan State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona State came away from its opening victory against Kent State with numerous areas to get better.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/sacramento_st_arizona_st_football_02739_c0-160-3816-2384_s1770x1032.jpg?aeb6319540bfef66ad17b00f7c8e7adb109023df", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
