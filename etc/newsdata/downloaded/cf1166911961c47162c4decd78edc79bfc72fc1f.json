Kron Gracie at UFC on ESPN+ 19: Best photos view 41 images\n\nKron Gracie has a world-class jiu-jitsu game. But they call this game mixed martial arts for a reason.\n\nThe son of Rickson Gracie took a big step up in competition in the featherweight co-feature bout of UFC on ESPN+ 19 on Saturday night, where he met a veteran who mixes the aspects of the sport as well as anyone in Cub Swanson.\n\nAnd while Gracie (5-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC) proved himself plenty tough, Swanson (26-11 MMA, 11-7 UFC) showed Gracie\u2019s standup game still needs work, as he pieced up his opponent in a grueling unanimous-decision victory. The judges\u2019 scores at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., were 30-27 across the board in favor of the Palm Springs, Calif., native.\n\nGracie, who had won all five of his previous MMA fights via submission inside of two rounds, attempted to push the pace and stalk forward, but he was met with a wide variety of strikes by the veteran Swanson. Swanson swiftly mixed combos to the head and body, threw in kicks to the calf and body, and kept his foe off-balance.\n\nTo his credit, Gracie took everything Swanson dished out and kept coming back for more. Swanson\u2019s pace slowed toward the end of the second, but he had the presence of mind not to engage Gracie when he tried to take it to the ground.\n\nA riveting third round saw two tired fighters push through exhaustion, including a sequence in which Swanson willingly went into Gracie\u2019s guard in the final minute and lived to tell about it. The fight ended with both men throwing bombs.\n\nWith the win, 11th career decision victory, Swanson snapped a four-fight losing streak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Swanson said with a laugh in his post-fight interview. \u201cIt takes two to make a fight, my hat\u2019s off to him, he tried to stand with me. There was some talk before the fight but I have so much respect for the Gracie family.\u201d\n\nUp-to-the-minute UFC on ESPN+ 19 results include:", "description": "Cub Swanson defeated Kron Gracie at UFC Tampa.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cub-swanson-kron-gracie-ufc-on-espn-plus-19-14.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
