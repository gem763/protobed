A Florida man who lent his car to a friend, who then used it to commit a felony. A pregnant Alabama woman whose fetus died after a woman shot her in the stomach during an escalating fight.\n\nNone of them pulled the trigger, but each was charged in the deaths that occurred through a longstanding, and increasingly controversial, legal principle called the felony-murder rule.\n\nThe rule, centuries old and in place in 46 states, allows authorities to file murder charges when someone is killed during the commission of a felony, regardless of whether the death was intentional.\n\nProsecutors who support the rule say it discourages people from participating in serious or dangerous felonies and decreases the likelihood of violence during commission of a felony. They also argue that an added level of culpability should apply when someone is killed during the crime.\n\nBut the rule is now being challenged as part of a broader push for criminal-justice reform in the U.S. Critics say overly zealous application of the rule has led to over-incarceration and unnecessarily harsh punishments, especially among for the young and minorities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the danger of these statutes, that they\u2019re so broad that they allow all kinds of odd scenarios,\u201d said Pamela Pierson, emeritus professor of law at the University of Alabama.\n\nThe issue came up prominently last December in a case involving Marshae Jones, the pregnant Alabama woman.\n\nFollowing a dayslong dispute, Ms. Jones encountered Ebony Jemison in the parking lot of a Dollar General in Pleasant Grove, Ala., according to Ms. Jones\u2019 attorneys. After the two exchanged words, Ms. Jones, who was 27 years old and five months pregnant at the time, initiated a fight with the other woman. Ms. Jemison then shot Ms. Jones in the stomach, causing the death of Ms. Jones\u2019 unborn baby.\n\nA grand jury indicted Ms. Jones on a manslaughter charge under the state\u2019s felony-murder statute. Prosecutors said that by starting and escalating the fight, Ms. Jones engaged in a dangerous crime that was likely to cause a death.\n\nThe charge against Ms. Jones was dropped over the summer. But they rekindled a national discussion over the longstanding rule that Lucius Outlaw III, a criminal justice professor at Howard University School of Law, called an anomaly.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the crime that you\u2019re charged with and the punishment are supposed to match what your intent is,\u201d he said. \u201cWith felony murder, someone doesn\u2019t have the intent to kill.\u201d\n\nRyan Holle was 20 years old in 2003 when he let his housemate, William Allen Jr. , borrow his car. Mr. Allen and three other men used the car to drive to the home of a marijuana dealer to steal drugs and money. The burglary turned violent and ended in the death of 18-year-old Jessica Snyder.\n\nMr. Holle said he didn\u2019t know the men were going to commit the crime\u2014and believed the men were using the car to get food.\n\nHe was offered a 10-year plea deal in exchange for pleading guilty to second-degree murder, but Mr. Holle declined it as he felt he had no involvement in Ms. Snyder\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe connection between Mr. Holle and the offense was so remote,\u201d said Barry Beroset, one of Mr. Holle\u2019s attorneys. \u201cI felt an injustice had been done,\u201d said Mr. Beroset.\n\nProsecutor David Rimmer thought otherwise. \u201cNo car, no crime,\u201d Mr. Rimmer told the jury. \u201cNo car, no murder.\u201d\n\nMr. Holle was found guilty of first-degree murder and other charges, and sentenced to life in prison. The sentence was later commuted to 25 years in prison.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Should people who were an accessory to murder be prosecuted for the murder themselves? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nFelony-murder statues have long been contentious.\n\nBoth Hawaii and Kentucky abolished felony murder in the 1970s. In 1980, Michigan\u2019s supreme court struck it down, referring to it as \u201ca historic survivor for which there is no logical or practical basis for existence in modern law.\u201d\n\nOther states now generally restrict its application to either inherently dangerous felonies, like robbery, or individually dangerous acts committed during a felony, said David Crump, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center who has studied the rule extensively.\n\nStill, critics say, it is too often applied unfairly.\n\nMasonique Saunders was charged with the murder of her boyfriend, Julius Tate, after he was shot and killed by a police officer in a botched robbery last December in Columbus, Ohio. Ms. Saunders, 16 years old at the time, and Mr. Tate had set up the robbery, unaware that their intended victim was a police officer involved in an undercover operation.\n\nThe state sought to try Ms. Saunders as an adult, which would have made her eligible to receive a life sentence without parole. But it withdrew the motion in May, when she accepted a deal in juvenile court to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter and two aggravated robberies. She was sentenced to three years last month.\n\nLocal activists formed the Coalition to Free Masonique, demanding that Ms. Saunders be released and that the shooter, Officer Eric Richard, be held accountable. \u201cThe felony-murder law is very similar to a lot of other laws that seem to target and disenfranchise black communities and communities of color,\u201d said Dkeama Alexis, an activist involved with the Coalition to Free Masonique.\n\nChristy McCreary, spokeswoman for the Franklin County prosecutor\u2019s office, said there was no question of Ms. Saunders\u2019s guilt because she admitted her involvement in the robbery. \u201cAll states and the federal government have laws that make an accomplice, an accessory or co-conspirator as guilty as a principal or primary offender,\u201d she said\n\nMs. Saunders is completing high-school coursework while in the juvenile detention center.\n\nHer attorney, Jonathan Tyack, said Ms. Saunders is fortunate that she was given a chance to be rehabilitated in the juvenile-justice system rather than being tried as an adult. \u201cThe prosecution recognized that she was a young kid and made a mistake,\u201d he said.", "description": "Recent cases, including one involving a pregnant Alabama woman, have renewed criticism of a legal principle that allows murder charges to be filed when someone is killed during the commission of a felony, regardless of whether the death was intentional.", "authors": ["Daja Henry"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-95270/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
