From her \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 proposal to combat climate change to her clapbacks against Trump and her critics, here\u2019s how AOC danced her way into the spotlight. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got real in an interview with the Huffington Post about the toll of sudden fame.\n\nThe 30-year-old arrived in the national spotlight in 2018 after defeating a well-known and powerful incumbent in New York's 14th congressional district while working as a waitress. At 29, she became the youngest congresswoman, ever. She has 5.5 million Twitter followers, is consistently targeted by President Donald Trump, and repeatedly makes national headlines and appearances on television.\n\nShe told HuffPo, \u201cSometimes I just want to be a human being. And you don\u2019t get to be a human anymore. Everything you do from wearing sweatpants to the bodega to getting a haircut \u2015 every personal decision you make for yourself is never going to be yours anymore.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, AOC shot back after a story in the conservative Washington Times criticized her for a \"high-dollar hairdo,\" after spending $300 on her haircut, lowlights, and the tip.\n\n'The halls of Congress are no joke': AOC reflects on Congress as she endorses Sanders\n\nThe interview from AOC comes just days after American-born Duchess Meghan Markle of Sussex gave a raw interview on British television about the hardships of fame that went viral.\n\nAOC had responded to the interview via tweet, \u201cSudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience. There\u2019s a part of your life that you lose, & it later dawns on you that you\u2019ll never get it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people who treat you like a human make all the difference,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cThank you for asking, bc not many people have asked if I\u2019m ok.\u201d\n\n\n\nSudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience. There\u2019s a part of your life that you lose, & it later dawns on you that you\u2019ll never get it back.\n\n\n\nThe people who treat you like a human make all the difference. https://t.co/w0XUI4O3bD \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 18, 2019\n\nAOC told HuffPo that while she has accepted her privacy will never return to normal, she added, \u201cYou kind of grieve for that. It has its highs and it has its lows. A lot of people look at the highs, but sometimes it feels like you got a tattoo on your face that you didn\u2019t ask for. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very hard. Sometimes you just want to get a drink or eat a hamburger.\u201d\n\nDespite mixed feelings about all the attention, AOC said, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to be hidden away. In order for me to do my job, I need to be connected to people. My job is to love people. And that\u2019s very difficult sometimes given the amount of barriers.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/23/aoc-sudden-fame-sometimes-just-want-human-being/4079643002/", "description": "New York congresswoman\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become one of the Democratic Party's most recognizable faces since her 2018 election.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
