It Took 5 Months for Him to Get Fired.", "language": "en", "text": "The Phoenix cop who held a black family at gunpoint this past May \u2014 caught in a viral video where you can hear him yelling \u201cYou\u2019re going to fucking get shot\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to put a fucking cap in your fucking head\u201d \u2014 was fired Tuesday after the city\u2019s police chief decided an unpaid suspension wasn\u2019t enough punishment.\n\nChristopher Meyer had been with the police department for more than two decades when he was called on May 27 to respond to an allegation that a toddler had shoplifted a cheap doll.\n\nDravon Ames and his pregnant fiancee, Iesha Harper, had just finished shopping at a local dollar store and were dropping off their kids, a 4-year-old and 1-year-old, at a babysitter\u2019s apartment when officers swarmed their vehicle and began screaming at them to put their hands up. Concerned residents from the nearby apartment captured the interaction on video, which quickly went viral.\n\nThroughout the interaction, Meyer repeatedly threatened to shoot Ames and attempted to pull Harper\u2019s 1-year-old from her arms. Meyer eventually found a \u201cbox with a doll in it in the back seat,\u201d according to the Phoenix New Times. The family said the doll was taken by the 4-year-old on accident, according to the Arizona Republic. They were never charged with any crime in connection to the doll.\n\nImmediately after the incident, Meyer and the officer he was with, who hasn\u2019t been identified, were placed on \u201cnon-enforcement assignments\u201d and the department announced it would conduct an internal investigation. The Phoenix Police Department\u2019s Disciplinary Review Board ultimately recommended that Meyer receive a six-week unpaid suspension for the incident, which Police Chief Jeri Williams said she found insufficient.\n\n\u201cThe decision on discipline is mine,\u201d Williams said during a news conference Tuesday. \u201cAnd after meeting the officer Chris Meyer personally, and considering all the facts of the case, I have notified him of my intention to terminate his employment. A 240-hour suspension is just not sufficient to reverse the adverse effects of his actions on our department and on our community.\u201d\n\nThe second officer received a written reprimand, according to the Arizona Republic. Meyer will have the opportunity to appeal his firing.\n\nThe family has filed a $10 million lawsuit against Phoenix, seeking damages for an incident they\u2019ve said traumatized them. In a news conference responding to the firing, Ames said he was pleased Meyer would be leaving the department.\n\n\u201cIt gives us hope, you know, it gives us a little hope that they are moving in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, Williams announced Tuesday that she fired another cop not involved with the May incident, Clinton Swick, because he had made offensive posts about Muslims on Facebook. A police sergeant, Daniel Beau Jones, was also fired, but Williams didn\u2019t say why.\n\nCover: Rev.
