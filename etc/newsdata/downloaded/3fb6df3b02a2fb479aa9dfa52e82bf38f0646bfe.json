And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world.\"\n\nMorey has apologised for the now-deleted tweet, which included the lines \"Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong\".\n\nBusiness links\n\nSome Chinese businesses have cut ties with the NBA amid the furore, including smartphone maker Vivo, which was a key sponsor for the upcoming exhibition games to be played in Shanghai and Shenzhen later this week by the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nA major sports retailer and a news site have also halted their partnerships with the NBA.\n\n\"How can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China's public opinion?\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"NBA's cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's Rob Matheson, reporting from Beijing, said the response from Chinese social media users has been overwhelmingly one of patriotism.\n\n\"They love the NBA, they love basketball but they love China more,\" he said.\n\nBasketball is the number one sport in China, which hosted the sport's World Cup earlier this year.\n\nThe Rockets have a large following in the country from the years when Chinese basketball star Yao Ming played for the team.", "description": "NBA boss says league will not regulate what its players, employees and members say, prompting fury in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/a0274eb96620457e82604247391dd0c0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
