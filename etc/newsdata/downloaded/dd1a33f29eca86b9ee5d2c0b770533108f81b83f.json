It was what was buried underneath.\n\nDavid Cimperman Handout\n\nThere they found forms featuring the mayor\u2019s apparently forged signature that David Cimperman used to add more than 30 officers to the town\u2019s police roster \u2013 one for every 16 residents. Many never did any paid police work for the town, logging hours instead for a private security business that state investigators say Cimperman ran on the side. He tried to outfit them with high-end radios. The riot gear and other surplus military equipment he bought with taxpayer money are missing.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t find was evidence that the police force built out of fear of being without help in an emergency did much actual police work.\n\nEven now, the people who hired Cimperman don\u2019t know the depth of what went wrong in the part-time police force of this small town in the hills of northeastern Ohio. The new chief says he\u2019s consulted with state criminal investigators to help figure it out.\n\nWhat they know is that they could have prevented it all with a single phone call. They hired a chief without knowing he\u2019d been fired for perjury, quit a job as his bosses started investigating missing police equipment and was charged with a felony for tampering with police radios to make untraceable phone calls.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it. No one calls me,\u201d says one of his former bosses, Michael Goodwin, the chief of police in nearby New Philadelphia.\n\nCimperman\u2019s journey from disgraced police officer to police chief is a surprisingly common one, a USA TODAY Network investigation found.\n\nMisconduct that might disqualify someone from being hired as a rookie cop hasn\u2019t stopped officers from taking the top jobs at law enforcement agencies throughout the USA.\n\nMany ended up running small forces in places without the inclination to do basic background checks or without the wherewithal to penetrate the secretive and haphazard systems that can hide police misconduct even from the police.\n\n\u201cI blame myself, I really do,\u201d Amsterdam Mayor Gary Pepperling says of his former police chief. \u201cHe really looked good on paper, and I\u2019m a trusting guy. I didn\u2019t really check.\n\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI hope to see him behind bars.\u201d\n\nDisgraced officer becomes police chief. It happens more than you think. USA TODAY\n\nThe face of law enforcement\n\nPolice forces \u2013 and the officers they employ \u2013 have come under intense public scrutiny in recent years after a succession of high-profile scandals including questionable shootings and commanders who have themselves become criminals. The USA TODAY Network gathered misconduct records from hundreds of police departments and state licensing boards in nearly every state to shed light on the profession, amassing one of the largest stores of information on police wrongdoing.\n\nPolice chiefs occupy a unique place in law enforcement. The job can be less glamorous than the title makes it seem \u2013 some chiefs work part-time, for minimum-wage or both. Chiefs hold a position of public trust that makes them the face of law enforcement and puts them in command of other officers. If they can outrun misconduct, experts say, imagine what can happen among the lower-ranking officers they employ.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s entirely fair or not, a police chief or sheriff is really considered a role model for the community,\u201d says Arizona State University criminology and criminal justice professor Michael Scott, a former police chief. \u201cIf it\u2019s understood the chief has violated the law ... it more or less is a signal to the officers or deputies that you don\u2019t have to be any better.\u201d\n\nThe USA TODAY Network identified 32 people who became police chiefs or sheriffs despite a finding of serious misconduct, usually at another department. At least eight of them were found guilty of a crime. Others amassed records of domestic violence, improperly withholding evidence, falsifying records or other conduct that could impact the public they swore to serve.\n\nHe hid evidence of his son\u2019s crime. He was hired as a police chief in Washington state. Show Hide Hired in August 2017 to run the police department in the tiny Washington town of Winthrop, Daniel Tindall brought a history that included a top commendation from the Washington State Patrol and service in the governor\u2019s protective detail. He also brought a misdemeanor conviction from a case in which police said he tampered with evidence and withheld information from investigators in his son\u2019s arson case. In April 2015, Tindall\u2019s teenage son was caught on video attempting to set fire to a vehicle at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house while wearing a mask. The boy told police that his parents confronted him about the video, and then found the mask and jacket he was seen wearing. The son told police that he admitted the crime to his parents, and he told a friend via Facebook message that his dad wanted to go to the police, but his mom convinced him not to, an investigator wrote in an affidavit filed with the charges against Tindall. The three then decided to take the clothes to the family\u2019s second home in Winthrop. Police found clothing matching that on the video where the boy said it would be, along with \u201cpossible remnants\u201d of the mask burned in a wood stove, the affidavit said. Tindall, who left the state patrol while under investigation in 2015, was sentenced in June 2016 to five days in jail after pleading guilty to misdemeanor rendering criminal assistance as part of a plea deal. But he initially retained his law enforcement certification due to a paperwork error, said Tisha Jones, peace officer certification manager with the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission. The commission wasn\u2019t aware of the extent of Tindall\u2019s actions until February 2018 and moved to take his certification, a process that concluded with Tindall being decertified in October 2018. The commission ruled Tindall had \u201cmade false and/or misleading statements\u201d to officers investigating his son. In an interview while still serving as Winthrop chief, Tindall denied burning anything or knowingly moving evidence. Addressing the boy\u2019s comments that his father knew of the crime and helped cover it up, Tindall said the son is autistic and has a \u201cvivid imagination.\u201d Court records show Tindall admitted to investigators that he saw the video and confronted his son about it but never contacted law enforcement. Then-Mayor Rick Northcott told The Methow Valley News he was aware of Tindall\u2019s criminal conviction when he hired him. Hide\n\nIn North Dakota, officials picked as their sheriff a man who\u2019d led his co-workers on a 100 mph chase after drinking. A dispatcher summoned him to assist in his own pursuit. In Georgia, an officer fired from the state police after investigators found he\u2019d carried out numerous on-duty affairs and lied about it landed a job as a small-town chief. A Washington trooper who was convicted of rendering criminal assistance in a case involving his son found work leading a small department in that state.\n\nThose chiefs almost certainly represent only a small glimpse at the larger issue, because the records reporters were able to examine cover a small fraction of U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n\nFleeing police at 125 mph didn\u2019t keep him from becoming a sheriff in North Dakota. Show Hide Lawmakers appointed Robert Hook as sheriff of Griggs County, North Dakota, not long after he was convicted of two crimes for a high-speed chase. Hook was then the county\u2019s chief deputy, the second in command to the sheriff. The pursuit began when Hook, with a friend in the passenger seat, was clocked by a state trooper at 96 mph, according to a North Dakota State Patrol report. As the trooper reached speeds of 125 mph trying to catch up, Hook evaded his pursuer with a series of turns before careening through a T-intersection into a field. Hook fled the scene on foot, as did his passenger, who bloodied his face on the dashboard as the car bottomed out. Hook confessed the next day to leading the chase, according to police records. He told investigators he had four or five beers in a one-hour span shortly before crash, but he said in an interview this year that he was not intoxicated. Hook had been among the officers paged by dispatchers to assist in his own pursuit. \u201cI suppose just a panic situation. Just panicked,\u201d Hook said when asked why he fled. \u201cI\u2019ve regretted that moment ever since.\u201d Hooks was convicted of misdemeanor fleeing and reckless driving and sentenced to one year of court-ordered probation. The North Dakota Peace Officer Standards and Training Board suspended Hook\u2019s law enforcement license for 30 days but let him keep it. The sheriff\u2019s department suspended him for a week and demoted him from chief deputy to deputy but let him keep his job. Undeterred, Hook ran for sheriff in 2006. He lost the election, but when the newly elected sheriff resigned soon after, the county board appointed Hook to replace him. Hook went on to win reelection unopposed in 2010 and with 59% of the vote in 2014. He retired in August 2017. Hide\n\nThey are high-ranking examples of how easy it can be for police officers in the USA to escape records of misconduct when departments big and small have struggled to attract recruits and information about how police officers carry out their jobs remains largely scattered in files held by thousands of different agencies.\n\nWhat happens when they do is that places like Amsterdam, Ohio \u2013 a struggling former steel town in the hills west of Pittsburgh where the boarded-up businesses outnumber the open ones \u2013 end up with police chiefs like David Cimperman.\n\n'He just seemed to break everything\u2019\n\nCimperman had been a policeman in the U.S. Army and the low-income housing projects of Cleveland. In the early 1990s, he settled into a quieter job in New Philadelphia, a small city about 90 miles away.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network left Cimperman repeated emails and voicemails and visited his home in Akron. All went unanswered.\n\nInstead, reporters documented his career through dozens of interviews and hundreds of documents, some of which the USA TODAY Network sued to obtain. The picture they paint isn\u2019t all bad. He rescued a toddler from a truck that had driven into a lake while off-duty in 2013. Former co-workers speak of his loyalty and work ethic.\n\nA police cruiser flipped after David Cimperman crashed during a high-speed chase. Handout\n\nCimperman was on the job for less than a year before his bosses in New Philadelphia started accumulating a file that would eventually overflow a large filing box. One of its first entries: He left the door of his cruiser open after work, his loaded shotgun still on the seat.\n\nThe next year, the mayor tried to fire him for a 115 mph chase over hilly country roads that ended with his cruiser upside-down in a creek.\n\nCimperman started the chase because he saw a motorcyclist who hadn\u2019t lowered the visor on his helmet, a minor infraction. He continued the pursuit even after a supervisor recommended that he break it off, because he said later he couldn\u2019t get close enough to read the motorcycle\u2019s license plate.\n\nAfter about 15 miles, the motorcyclist darted into a park and across a wooden footbridge that was only 3 feet wide, Cimperman speeding close behind in the department\u2019s new cruiser. The driver escaped (officers found him later), and Cimperman ended up in the creek. He shot out a window of the cruiser to escape. The mayor fumed that Cimperman should be fired but settled for a 10-day suspension.\n\nNew Philadelphia Police Chief Michael Goodwin sits down to speak about Officer Cimperman and his history in the city. Phil Didion, The Cincinnati Enquirer via USA TODAY Network\n\n\u201cHe just seemed to break everything he touched,\u201d Goodwin, the city\u2019s police chief, says.\n\nIn 2001, the city did fire Cimperman after he pleaded no-contest to a felony charge of unauthorized use of telecommunications property. State investigators found that he\u2019d paid a company to reprogram three of his own radios to work on the city\u2019s police radio network, something state and federal laws forbid.\n\nThe head of the company that did the work, Andy Brinkley, says Cimperman told him the radios were for the department, but he paid for it by sending a package of cash by UPS, which Brinkley says was \u201cunique.\u201d\n\nGoodwin says the radios weren\u2019t for police work. He says Cimperman wanted to make untraceable calls using the city\u2019s radio network, though officials never figured out why.\n\nWhatever the reason, it came at a cost. Records from the county prosecutor show that every time Cimperman used the radios to make calls, they tied up the communication network and blocked New Philadelphia residents\u2019 911 emergency calls.\n\nIf you think this is important journalism, please support us. Subscribe\n\nCimperman was sentenced to a year of probation, and prosecutors agreed to have the case sealed, a step they said they routinely take for people who don\u2019t have a criminal record. A judge unsealed the records last year after the USA TODAY Network sued.\n\nThe state briefly pulled Cimperman's license to be a police officer over the episode, but reinstated it a few months later. Ordinarily, a felony record would be career-ending because the state would automatically revoke his license, but Cimperman's plea let him avoid a felony record and avoid the automatic loss of his certification. The court\u2019s decision to keep the case sealed made it harder for future employers to find.\n\nIt was enough for the city to fire him. The city\u2019s termination letter cited Cimperman\u2019s criminal record and other actions his bosses said were \"tantamount to again being untruthful.\"\n\nFive months later, labor arbitrator Bruce McIntosh put him back on the force, saying he deserved to be suspended but not fired. McIntosh said he couldn\u2019t remember the case.\n\nTwo weeks later, the city fired Cimperman again, this time for perjury.\n\nThe year before, Cimperman had forced his way into the basement of a locked rental house, something that normally requires a search warrant. He said afterward that he had seen signs of a burglary outside the house, which could justify a warrantless entry. He found equipment for growing marijuana inside.\n\nSearch for police discipline records USA TODAY Network has gathered discipline and accountability records on more than 85,000 law enforcement officers and has started releasing them to the public.

Search our exclusive database by officer, department or state. Search database\n\nThe county went to court to seize the house and brought drug charges against its owner. It dropped both cases after Cimperman testified about how he had found the equipment.\n\nThe prosecutor running the case, David Hipp, told the local newspaper, The Times Reporter, that Cimperman gave \u201cperjured testimony\u201d during the hearing. He says he no longer remembers the details of the case but at the time left no doubt about why it collapsed.\n\n\u201cIt is my conclusion that Mr. Cimperman was not truthful,\u201d Hipp told the judge in the case, according to the newspaper. \u201cThis is the only time I\u2019ve seen this in 27 years of prosecuting cases.\u201d\n\nStill, a different mediator put Cimperman back on the force. David Pincus wrote in his decision that there were signs burglars might have entered the building, so Cimperman had the authority to go inside as he claimed in court.\n\nHe returned to work, telling his colleagues in a letter that he was doing \u201cmany things to set things right\u201d and wanted \u201ca fresh start with everyone in New Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nDavid Cimperman's Facebook post Facebook\n\nMore issues followed: Officials said he violated the department\u2019s time-off policy, failed to turn in traffic tickets, drove recklessly and didn\u2019t show up to the trial of an accused sex offender (who was eventually convicted).\n\nGoodwin says he launched an investigation into Cimperman over \u201cirregularities in the inventory\u201d of surplus equipment the military had donated to the department through a federal program. Cimperman left the department in 2012, when, according to Goodwin, the department gave him a choice: retire or face possible prosecution.\n\nIn the years that followed, Cimperman stitched together something like a full-time career from part-time police jobs. In one Facebook post in 2014, he boasted of working 24 hours straight between his jobs, plus three-and-a-half hours of driving to get from one to another. One of his friends replied with a picture of RoboCop.\n\nSome departments limit the number of hours an officer can work in a day, in part because studies have linked fatigue to increased civilian complaints and other risks.\n\nCimperman also found work with the state Lottery Commission, investigating problems with slot machines at the same time he held those part-time police jobs. He got into trouble there, too, and was disciplined for following a female gaming mechanic \u201cin a way that went beyond a normal work relationship\u201d and using a shower reserved for casino performers.\n\nIn 2016, lottery officials put him on leave for not showing up to work. He quit and said he\u2019d found a new job.\n\nAmsterdam, Ohio. Phil Didion, The Cincinnati Enquirer via USA TODAY Network\n\nA prestigious new title\n\nThat new job came with a more prestigious title: chief of police.\n\nIn 2015, Pepperling, Amsterdam\u2019s mayor, hired him to run what was essentially a one-man police force, sometimes with help from a few other part-timers, in this town of nearly 500 residents and zero stoplights about 100 miles southeast of Cleveland.\n\nOver two decades, the town\u2019s population has shrunk by about a quarter as nearby steel mills and coal mines shut down. The only two business left open in its small center are a diner and a convenience store. There\u2019s little in the way of crime, but the junction of two state highways can draw drug traffic and what Pepperling calls \u201cunsavory elements.\u201d\n\nAmsterdam, Ohio's Mayor, Gary Pepperling, speaks about his regret in hiring Officer Cimperman. Phil Didion\n\nAlthough most towns this size don\u2019t bother with their own police force, Amsterdam sits on the border of two counties. Locals worried that without their own officers, help would be too far away in an emergency.\n\nWhen Amsterdam\u2019s previous chief left, Pepperling scrambled to find someone to take a job that came with a lofty title and lousy benefits: 20 hours a week at minimum-wage.\n\n\u201cWe needed a police officer, bad,\u201d Pepperling says.\n\nTo a hard-up town, a longtime cop such as Cimperman \u201clooked good on paper,\u201d he says.\n\nPepperling called the people Cimperman listed as references but admits he didn\u2019t do a thorough background check, or even much of a Google search before giving him the job. Nobody called his old bosses.\n\nPepperling says that after the calls to references, he and other town officials interviewed Cimperman and gave him a badge.\n\nSuch lapses aren\u2019t unusual. The USA TODAY Network found that many departments \u2013 especially small ones \u2013 lack the wherewithal to dig into the pasts of prospective police chiefs or simply had so few candidates that they couldn\u2019t afford to care.\n\nThousands of communities are served by such tiny departments. At the federal government\u2019s last count, in 2008, half of U.S. police forces had 10 officers or fewer. In a wide-ranging assessment of American policing three years ago, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration warned that such small forces intensify problems of \u201corganizational quality control.\u201d\n\nHe accidentally shot a woman because of \u201creckless conduct.\u201d He\u2019s still sheriff. Show Hide The voters of Clayton County, Georgia, have repeatedly chosen Victor Hill as their sheriff, choosing to overlook his admitted misuse of department resources, a sprawling federal indictment and the accidental shooting that left a friend in a coma. Hill, who goes by the nickname \u201ccrime-fighter,\u201d was first elected sheriff of a county of 200,000 people outside Atlanta in 2005. In 2007 he reached an agreement with the Georgia Peace Officer Standards & Training Council acknowledging that he improperly used county resources. The next year, he lost his bid for re-election. Hill\u2019s conduct in 2007 and 2008 eventually prompted a 37-count state grand jury indictment on counts that included racketeering and theft. Prosecutors alleged that Hill ordered an employee to help write his book on work time, placed a female employee on paid administrative leave so she could be paid for personal trips with him, had on-duty employees produce his website and campaign materials and used department funds and vehicles to rent a cabin and travel to at least five states on work not related to the department. He also was accused of using dummy corporations and other means to route campaign funds into his personal account. Voters re-elected Hill in 2013 while the charges were pending. A jury found him not guilty a few months later. Hill was re-elected in a landslide in 2017, a year after he accidentally shot a female friend in the abdomen while demonstrating a \u201ctraining exercise,\u201d state records show. He grabbed a real gun instead of a training one with the firing pin removed. That led to a conviction for reckless conduct and a year of criminal probation. The state ordered a two-year probation of his certification, a loss of his instructor certification and a public reprimand but allowed him to remain a law enforcement officer. Hill did not respond to requests for comment. Hide\n\nEven big cities such as Baltimore, Detroit and Memphis have struggled to attract enough qualified recruits to fill out their police forces, a challenge magnified in small towns that can\u2019t match the pay and perks of bigger departments.\n\nSome smaller communities ended up with chiefs such as Richard Pacheco, who landed several top police jobs at small Missouri departments and runs campus safety at a Kansas college despite the fact that he was charged with a felony after yanking a man out of his car at gunpoint while he was off-duty because he thought the man was driving drunk. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of giving false alarm, his second criminal conviction. He lost his license to be a police officer in Kansas for misconduct and had been the subject of three restraining orders. In one, his then-fiancee said he threatened to shoot her.\n\nHis new bosses say they were unaware of his record until reporters contacted them.\n\nExperts say the system for tracking police misconduct is so fragmented that it\u2019s easy for officers and even chiefs to escape such a record. Though most states have statewide agencies that license police officers \u2013 and can pull their licenses for the most serious types of misconduct \u2013 much of the information about how a police officer has performed is stored in the personnel records of individual departments.\n\nHe lost his law enforcement license in Kansas. Two Missouri towns hired him anyway. Show Hide Richard Pacheco lost his certification to be a police officer in Kansas after two criminal convictions and three restraining orders. But he remains employed as a part-time police chief in two tiny Missouri towns and as a campus safety chief at a Kansas college. Pacheco, then the police chief in Holt, Missouri was convicted in 2003 of disturbing the peace for an incident where he blocked a woman\u2019s car and pounded on her windows, according to court records and a report by the television station KCTV. Nevertheless, Pacheco was named police chief in Mosby, Missouri, a job he held in 2011 when he was arrested after yanking a man from a car at gunpoint in Kansas City while off duty, believing him to be driving drunk. Pacheco was charged with felony aggravated assault but convicted of the lesser charge of giving a false alarm, a misdemeanor. That incident caused Pacheco to lose his law enforcement license in Kansas, but Missouri allowed him to keep his license there. Along the way Pacheco accumulated restraining orders from multiple women. One alleged he threatened to kill her and her mother, and two said he attempted to have them arrested on frivolous charges. \u201cThe respondent \u2014 due to being a law enforcement officer \u2014 believes that he can abuse his lawful powers to get what he wants and that he is above the law,\u201d April Cayce wrote in a 2002 petition seeking a restraining order, which a judge in Platte County, Missouri granted. Mayors in the two towns where Pacheco is now the police chief \u2014 Karen Baker of Camden and Jim Lovern of Henrietta \u2014 say they were unaware of his prior convictions until being contacted by USA TODAY. Pacheco did not respond to repeated phone calls and a letter seeking comment. Hide\n\n\u201cWith a highly decentralized system like we have in this country, we simply have got to get a better grip on misconduct so that people who don\u2019t belong in the profession don\u2019t get to stay in it by virtue of moving around,\u201d says David Harris, an expert on police misconduct and a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\n\nChristopher Chavis was fired from the Georgia state police in 2008 and lost his license to be a police officer for carrying out multiple affairs while on the job.\n\nState investigators concluded he lied to them, though Chavis denies that.\n\nThe decision to revoke Chavis\u2019 license was overturned on appeal, and Chavis kept his badge. In 2014, he landed a new job running the small police department in Adrian, population 645.\n\nFired from one job, forced out of another. He found a job in Georgia. Show Hide Christopher Chavis was fired from the Georgia State Patrol in 2008 after carrying on multiple affairs on the job. Investigators also accused him of lying to them about it. A state board voted to take his license, but that decision was overturned on appeal and he later landed a new job running a small police department in Adrian, Georgia. Email records showed Chavis used his work email for sexual or intimate exchanges with four women in late 2007 and early 2008. One woman, who reported him to supervisors when the relationship soured, said he was in uniform almost every time she saw him, and often on duty. She said Chavis claimed he had divorced his wife, although he had not. The State Patrol investigation concluded that Chavis failed a polygraph and attempted to \u201cdefeat\u201d the exam by moving around repeatedly. Chavis said in an interview that he \u201cdid not mislead\u201d investigators in any way. He was chief in Adrian, overseeing two officers, from 2014 until he was forced out this October. He now works as a deputy at the nearby Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office.

Then he overdosed on drugs. Show Hide James Hughes was named chief of a small Ohio police department last year despite a past criminal conviction and a hefty personnel file that included a suspension for \u201cincompetence as a supervisor.\u201d Hughes was hired in March 2018 and held the $14-an-hour, part-time role in Kirkersville until that May, when he died after overdosing on Fentanyl. Drugs and packaging found near Hughes' body bore markings from a police evidence room, said Lt. Ron Wright, who investigated his death. But he said police were unable to determine whether the drugs came from Kirkersville's evidence room because the department\u2019s record keeping was so incomplete that they couldn\u2019t tell whether any drugs were missing. Before becoming the chief, Hughes had worked for 14 months at the Fairfield County Sheriff\u2019s Office, where he was the subject of at least three internal investigations. One followed a disorderly conduct conviction from an intoxicated confrontation in a fast food drive-thru in June 2013. Agency records show Hughes swore at a worker and later described workers to responding officers using a racial slur. He said in a later statement that the incident was \u201cmy temper getting the best of me.\u201d In another instance Hughes had an inappropriate relationship with a former female jail inmate he met as a deputy jailer, an internal report said. Hughes was questioned by supervisors after another man reported seeing the two have sex at a friend\u2019s house. Hughes initially denied meeting up with the woman, then later said he was with her but they only talked. Hughes then worked for the Brice Police Department in 2013. He was suspended for a week in November 2013 and demoted from acting sergeant to patrolman after Police Chief James Ebersbach said in a letter that Hughes didn\u2019t write up officers as ordered, turn in reports, interview a suspect and complete other assigned duties. The letter said Hughes was guilty of gross neglect of duty and incompetence as a supervisor. The mayor who hired Hughes in Kirkersville, Terry Ashcraft, did not respond to requests for comment. When Hughes was hired, he told the Kirkersville council that his background check \u201ccame back good,\u201d The Newark Advocate reported.

Officials knew before they hired him that James Hughes had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct over an off-duty incident at a fast-food restaurant, the town's law director told The Newark Advocate. It was unclear whether officials knew he'd been the subject of multiple investigations in his previous job, as a sheriff's deputy. Kirkersville's mayor, Terry Ashcraft, did not respond to questions about the former chief.\n\nDrugs and packaging found near Hughes' body bore markings from a police evidence room, says Reynoldsburg Police Lt. Ron Wright, who investigated his death.\n\nA Potemkin police force\n\nThree years after he hired him, Pepperling ousted Cimperman as Amsterdam\u2019s police chief. By then, he says, Cimperman wasn\u2019t showing up to work. He\u2019d seen other signs of problems, including a state homeland security investigator who had come by to look into whether the chief was running a security business on the side.\n\nStill, he says, officials weren\u2019t prepared for the mess they found once their chief was finally gone.\n\n\u201cIt took us weeks to clean it out,\u201d says Amsterdam Police Chief Todd Walker, who had been the town\u2019s chief before Cimperman arrived and took the job again after he left.\n\nAmsterdam, Ohio Police Chief Todd Walker gives a tour of former Officer Cimperman's station. Phil Didion, The Cincinnati Enquirer via USA TODAY Network\n\nAn internal report obtained by the USA TODAY Network shows photos of a bag of marijuana and seized drivers\u2019 licenses found in the office but never returned or stored properly. That report was prepared for the mayor by an officer whom Cimperman had fired. Walker says he even found an unidentified handgun in the trunk of the town\u2019s police cruiser.\n\nTrash covered the town\u2019s dispatch computer, which Cimperman was supposed to use to track the department\u2019s activity.\n\nThough Amsterdam wanted its own police force to make sure someone was close-by in an emergency, county dispatch records show the town\u2019s officers signaled that they were on duty only 72 times in the years Cimperman was in charge, about once every two weeks. Some of those were for only an hour at a time.\n\n\u201cThe town had a part-time department that wasn\u2019t working for them,\u201d says Rob Herrington, director of Jefferson County\u2019s 911 system.\n\nDocuments shared by Amsterdam mayor Amsterdam Police Department\n\nCimperman seemed to be busy with other things, including building the Amsterdam Police Department into what appeared, on paper, to be something far more formidable than the one-man force the town had in mind.\n\nHe signed officers on to the town roster throughout 2015 and 2016, even if they never worked there or got paid. The department\u2019s roster swelled to 37 names, Walker says. More than half of them were former co-workers of Cimperman\u2019s from other police departments, state records show. Others had little experience as police officers.\n\nFew did any work for the town. Being on the roster let them maintain their state licenses to be police officers even if they were technically out of work. And it made it easier for them to take jobs doing security work, and for higher pay, because they could call themselves off-duty cops. Cimperman also did private security work, including during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to posts he made on Facebook.\n\nMultiple Amsterdam officers told state investigators that Cimperman hired them out as security guards through a business called APD Security \u2013 a play on Amsterdam Police Department \u2013 says Brandon Gardner, director of enforcement and outreach for the Ohio Department of Homeland Security, which oversees private security firms. The state's lead investigator, James Borntrager, says he visited Cimperman's office in 2017 and saw stacks of \"security guard\" patches and blank forms for adding officers to the town's roster that included copies of the mayor's signature.\n\nShare your stories of police misconduct with us We want to hear from you if you believe you\u2019ve encountered misconduct by a law enforcement officer or agency.

That meant Cimperman could \u201cget these guys on his roster, then charge an increased fee for their services, telling their client they are having off-duty officers work.\u201d\n\nFormer Amsterdam officer Louis Valdez says he and Cimperman worked several of the same off-duty details for APD Security. Valdez says he was paid in cash for the jobs by a different officer who he thought ran the security firm but acknowledged that he never did any work for the town and was on the roster only to qualify for off-duty work elsewhere. \"I thought it was a legitimate business,\" he says.\n\nPepperling says Cimperman \u201cwas running an off-duty security firm out of this office and using our town as a front.\u201d\n\nHow they got on the roster is another story. Ordinarily, the town\u2019s mayor would have to sign off on a request to add a new officer, and records show Pepperling\u2019s signature appears on 35 forms submitted to state authorities.\n\nCopies of Mayor Pepperling's signature on hiring documents that he says were forged. Amsterdam Police Department\n\nPepperling says he signed for no more than five of them. The rest, he insists, were forged.\n\nThere are signs Cimperman sought to use the town to outfit the officers he was hiring out. He wrote to other departments asking for spare or unused equipment, even though the county and town had provided relatively new gear in the past five years, Amsterdam police records show. He tried to get county and state officials to let him activate 30 other radios, even though he never had more than two or three other officers helping him patrol the town.\n\nWalker can\u2019t find thousands of dollars worth of equipment, including riot gear and even a sweater he bought from a state surplus-equipment program. This year, Ohio kicked Amsterdam out of the program because bills for the gear went unpaid. \"It's amazing,\" Walker says. \"This never ends.\"\n\nWalker and his officers are building a case against Cimperman for allegedly using his position as chief in Amsterdam to defraud local, state or even federal agencies. Walker says he is considering asking state investigators for help.\n\nOne more check\n\nAfter all that, Cimperman hasn\u2019t hung up his badge.\n\nWithin days of his departure from Amsterdam, he ended up on the roster of another small town less than 20 miles away, first as a volunteer auxiliary officer and later as a paid part-timer.\n\nHis new boss is Chief Stacy McGrath. She took over the department in Bloomingdale \u2013 a town so tiny police park their one cruiser on a side street each night \u2013 after volunteering as a police officer in two other small towns. She had been on the rolls in Amsterdam as a \u201cspecial officer,\u201d one of the dozens of names Cimperman added.\n\nMcGrath appointment history Ohio Attorney General's Office\n\nMcGrath started her own security company in 2018 after she became chief, says Gardner, the homeland security official. She added Cimperman to the rolls of her department and says she pays him for three to five hours of police work each week.\n\n\u201cThis is how we help each other because we don\u2019t know where to go,\" McGrath says. \"We have nowhere to work. We have no way to pay our bills because we don\u2019t know where to work.\u201d\n\nBloomingdale Mayor David Gaffney says the town\u2019s lawyer conducted a background check on Cimperman, including contacting other departments, and \u201cthose things came back positive.\u201d\n\nBloomingdale\u2019s law director, Kristopher Haught, says the check he conducted was somewhat less thorough: He submitted a request for a criminal background check, which wouldn\u2019t have turned up the then-sealed criminal file or any of the other debris spilling out of Cimperman\u2019s past. So once again, he had a badge.\n\nPilcher reports for the Cincinnati Enquirer. Hegarty reported from McLean, Virginia.; Nichols reported from Indianapolis; Litke reported from Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
