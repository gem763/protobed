But there was certainly no indication that Kano felt out of place \u2013 he undoubtedly belonged there.\n\nKano somewhat eased us into the show with the first half pretty much dominated by the vocal support of his gospel choir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDressed in all white, you\u2019d be mistaken for thinking he\u2019d just come from Kanye\u2019s Sunday Service but his talented choir are certainly a match for \u2018Ye\u2019s fleet of gospel singers.\n\nOh, hey Giggs (Picture: WireImage)\n\nNo, this isn\u2019t Kanye\u2019s Sunday Service (Picture: WireImage)\n\nThe choir particularly shone on tracks from Hoodies All Summer, Kano\u2019s latest album which was revered by fans and critics alike.\n\nWhether they\u2019re acoustically singing \u2018suck your mum\u2019 so eloquently on SYM or offering support on the emotionally-charged and electric Teardrops, the choir well and truly made sure Kano took us to church.\n\nAnd it was truly a blessing.\n\nHoodies All Summer offers the perfect mash-up of lyrically-conscious numbers to arresting grime bangers and, when pieced together with Kano\u2019s extensive back catalogue, made for a brilliantly eclectic show weaving from one sound to the next.\n\nTrue delights came from the roaring grime section, which featured surprise appearances from D Double E and Ghetts to assist on Class of Deja, a sort of tribute to the grime of yesteryear.\n\nWhat a night (Picture: WireImage)\n\nGiggs sharing the stage with Kano on 3 Wheels Up made for a particularly glorious moment, even if Wiley was missing from the formation.\n\nKano\u2019s breakout hit Ps and Qs earned a similar rapturous reaction and it was probably the first time the Royal Albert Hall floors had shook.\n\nIt certainly kept us on our toes so it\u2019s no surprise that it happened to the most engaging audience we\u2019ve come across in a long while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypically, concert-goers are dashing off to catch their last tube home but Kano\u2019s die-hard followers were lapping up every last drop until the bitter end, a sign of a job well done and then some.\n\nHoodies All Summer is considered a masterpiece, much like this iconic performance.\n\nAnd so we did go off into the night, happy and with our souls full.\n\nKano\u2019s latest album, Hoodies All Summer, is available to buy and stream now. His tour will resume in January.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
