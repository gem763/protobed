Most notably, it includes a bunch of emojis designed to be more inclusive and diverse. There are nearly 60 new designs in total, which feature gender-neutral characters, interracial couples, and disability-focused additions. A blood drop marks the first vagina-related emoji, in hopes to further de-stigmatize discussing periods. And it will also be possible for users to select from multiple skin tone options on group and family emojis.\n\nNot to mention there are a number of new emojis which are just super essential for your daily messaging needs. Those include, but are not limited to, a skunk, sloth, otter, waffle, butter, a yawning face (which we\u2019ll probably use quite often) and an ice cube.", "description": "A new update delivers gender-neutral characters, interracial couples, and disability-focused options.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db89e06d8e5970092733923/lede/1572383021430-new-apple-inclusive-emojis.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.562xh;0xw,0.0473xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
