REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he wanted a Brexit deal on Oct. 18, just two weeks before the two sides are due to part ways, but has repeatedly said Britain will dissolve the more than four-decade long marriage on Oct. 31, with or without a withdrawal agreement.\n\nYet all but three of the 35 respondents to an extra question said the scheduled departure date - already delayed - would be extended again, most likely to January.\n\n\u201cJohnson said that he\u2019d rather be \u2018dead in a ditch\u2019 than delay Brexit, but we don\u2019t believe that for a second,\u201d said Stefan Koopman at Rabobank.\n\nLawmakers passed a bill last week requiring Johnson to ask EU leaders for a further Brexit delay if Parliament - which is being shut by the government on Monday - has not passed a Brexit deal or voted in favour of no-deal by October 19.\n\nThere is a 35% chance of no deal being agreed, a so-called disorderly Brexit, according to the median forecast in a Sept. 5-9 Reuters poll, unchanged from an August poll which was the highest since Reuters began asking the question two years ago.\n\nForecasts ranged from 10% to 60%.\n\nStill, a strong majority of economists still say the two sides will eventually settle on a free trade deal, as they have said since late 2016 when Reuters first started asking about the most likely outcome.\n\nIn second place, again, was the more extreme option of leaving without a deal and trading under World Trade Organization rules.\n\nThe third most likely outcome was Britain remaining a member of the European Economic Area, paying into the EU budget to maintain access to the Single Market yet having no say over policy. Fourth place once again went to cancelling Brexit.\n\nRECESSION AVERTED?\n\nBritain\u2019s economy picked up more than expected in July, official data showed on Monday, dampening fears it will succumb to its first recession since the financial crisis as the Brexit crisis escalates.\n\n\u201cWe had been concerned over the risk of a contraction in GDP, which given the 0.2% decline in Q2, would have meant a technical recession. This looks very unlikely now,\u201d said Philip Shaw at Investec.\n\nThe world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy shrank in the second quarter, a hangover from a stockpiling boom in advance of the original March 31 Brexit deadline, but is expected to expand 0.2% this quarter and next, the poll showed.\n\nGrowth will accelerate to 0.3% per quarter for all of next year, it predicted.\n\nThe probability of a recession within a year held steady at 35%. The likelihood of one in the next two years fell to 35% from 40%.\n\nWith inflation forecast to hover around the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, no change in Bank Rate from 0.75% was expected until at least 2022, the end of the forecast horizon.\n\nNone of the 54 economists polled thought the Monetary Policy Committee would alter borrowing costs when they announce their latest decision on Sept. 19.", "description": "Brexit will be delayed again, according to a Reuters poll of economists that continued to put the chance of Britain and the European Union parting ways without agreeing a deal at 35%, despite the UK parliament attempting to block a no-deal exit.", "authors": ["Jonathan Cable", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427987722&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881C9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
