New York signed the lefty specialist to a minor league contract shortly after he was let go by the Pittsburgh Pirates, who finished dead last in the NL Central with a 69-93 record.\n\nDuring the 2019 season, Lyons pitched just 12.2 innings across 14 games, earning a 1-2 record and a 6.39 ERA. He also recorded 17 strikeouts, bringing his career total to 289.\n\nThat was apparently enough to earn him a playoff roster spot with baseball\u2019s most storied organization, though some Yankees fans disagree.\n\nMike Ford Left Off ALDS Roster\n\nYankees fans were particularly irate that Tyler Lyons earned an ALDS roster spot while fan-favorite Mike Ford \u2013 a former undrafted free agent whose improbable road to the major leagues was emblematic of the Yankees\u2019 \u201cplucky underdog story\u201d \u2013 did not.\n\nFord, a 27-year-old rookie, hit .259 in 143 big-league at-bats. He appeared in 50 games, bashing 12 home runs and recording 25 RBIs.\n\nHe also made his pitching debut during a blowout loss against the Cleveland Indians, giving up 6 hits and 5 runs against 1 strikeout in two innings of relief work.\n\nTwins vs. Yankees ALDS Schedule\n\nTyler Lyons and the Mike Ford-less New York Yankees will square off against the Minnesota Twins in the ALDS beginning tonight, Oct. 4.\n\nThe first game in the best-of-five series will start at 7:07 pm ET and will be broadcast on the MLB Network.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yankees-alds-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
