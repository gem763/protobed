At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?\" (Quo vadis is Latin for \"where are you going.\")\n\n.@BorisJohnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis? \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 8, 2019\n\nThe U.K. is set to leave the EU on October 31, but legislation recently passed by Britain's Parliament requires Prime Minister Johnson to ask Brussels for an extension if the House of Commons doesn't endorse a deal or consent to a no-deal Brexit by October 19. It's unclear whether Johnson's government might be able to find a loophole in that legislation that would enable it to stick to his promise to pull Britain out of the EU, with or without a deal, on the 31st.\n\nThere was \"skepticism\" within EU circles over the U.K.'s description of Johnson's call with Merkel, CBS News partner network BBC News reported. A spokesman for Merkel's office declined to comment on confidential conversations.\n\nMeanwhile on Tuesday, the U.K. government published a \"No-Deal Readiness Report,\" outlining preparations it has made in the event the U.K. does leave the EU without an agreement.\n\nPreviously leaked government documents laid out the possibility of medicine and food shortages in the U.K. should Britain leave with no deal, as well as potential civil unrest.\n\nThe plan published Tuesday detailed what the government has done to try and avoid those worst-case scenarios \u2014 many of which had been previously discussed. The \"Readiness Report,\" for example, notes the government has created a dedicated unit to support suppliers of medical goods in Britain, which could soon need to jump through additional hoops to ensure the integrity of their supply chains.\n\n\"While we remain optimistic, we are also realistic about the need to plan for every eventuality,\" the author of the report, Parliamentarian Michael Gove, said in the preface. \"If we cannot secure a good agreement with the EU, we must be prepared to leave without a deal.\"\n\nWhat comes next\n\nParliament is expected to be suspended Tuesday evening until October 14 to give Johnson's government the chance to set out a new legislative agenda in a \"Queen's Speech.\" This comes after the Supreme Court ruled Johnson's previous request for a suspension of Parliament \u2014 or \"prorogation\" \u2014 was illegal, because it shut down debate for what it said was an unreasonable amount of time.\n\nOn October 17 and 18, a summit of EU leaders will take place in Brussels ahead of the crucial date of October 19, when Johnson must ask the EU for a Brexit delay if a deal, or a no-deal Brexit, hasn't been approved by Parliament.\n\nThe U.K. is currently set to leave the EU, with or without a Brexit deal, on October 31.", "description": "Top EU official chides Boris Johnson for playing \"stupid blame game\" as British government says negotiations appear to have reached a standstill", "authors": ["Haley Ott"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/a3c5e4bd-b91e-4ee4-bf2b-be77921528a0/thumbnail/1200x630/85433672dd2b41f550a1bbd85aa8e0fa/gettyimages-1174204660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
