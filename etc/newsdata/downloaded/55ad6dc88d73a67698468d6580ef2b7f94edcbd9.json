Now in 2019, they're releasing 2TRP.P, which infuses hip hop and R&B with love, vulnerability, positivity and fun.\n\nAs Pagliacci told CBC Music, accessing those emotions had to come from within.\n\n\"Being from Toronto, and growing up here in the city, there's a lot of great and talented artists,\" Pagliacci says. \"And unfortunately, because of the influx of so much amazing talent, sometimes people feel that they're underappreciated ... but for myself, I realized that if I just love my art ... it tends to be infectious and catches on and people will do the same.\"\n\nThe duo has also been supportive and nurturing of one another.\n\n\"It was really fun to switch the roles around a little bit,\" says Truss. \"I got to songwrite and sing. And you know, Phoenix, although she likes to say she's not a producer, she's a producer. One of my favourite tracks on the album is produced by her.\"\n\nWatch below as TRP.P perform songs from their latest EP, 2TRP.P.\n\nTRP.P performs \"Stairs of Progression\" for CBC Music 1:11\n\nTRP.P perform \"Sweet Morphine\" for CBC Music 4:18\n\nTRP.P perform \"Ain't Havin' It\" at CBC Music. 4:34\n\nTRP.P perform \"Love, Calm Down\" at CBC Music. 3:57\n\nTRP.P perform \"Chakra Con\" for CBC Music. 2:40", "description": "TRP.P perform songs from their latest album.", "authors": ["Cbc Music"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5263069.1567020013!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trp-p-performing-heart-s-last-call-from-2trp-p.jpg"}
