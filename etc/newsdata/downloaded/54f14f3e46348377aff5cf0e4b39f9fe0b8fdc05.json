Slashing its profit outlook through 2020, Nokia said it would suspend its dividend for the next six months.\n\nAt the time of writing, Nokia\u2019s shares were down 20% on the day, hitting a six-year low.\n\nWhat\u2019s to blame? 5G, for one.\n\nMaking fancy new equipment for 5G installations is expensive, said CEO Rajeev Suri in published remarks (pdf). He also cited trouble raising prices\u2014especially in China, where its sales have slumped\u2014and the expense of absorbing Alcatel-Lucent, the French telecom equipment giant Nokia bought in 2016.\n\nThe beginning buildout of 5G was supposed to be a bonanza for Nokia (see our recent field guide, \u201cThe coming 5G revolution,\u201d for an in-depth look at this newest generation of mobile wireless network technology). What gives?\n\nNokia\u2019s challenges with 5G and Alcatel-Lucent are telling, as is the cratering of its network R&D, which fell 7% versus the same quarter a year ago. Its struggles encapsulate the intrinsic mismatch of corporate oligopoly and innovation.\n\nThough hard to tell from its glum earnings, Nokia very literally dominates the telecom equipment market. It has only two major competitors: Stockholm-based Ericsson, and Huawei, which is headquartered in Shenzhen.\n\nMind you, Huawei sells its equipment for much cheaper. And in a grab for market share, Ericsson has been discounting of late, too.\n\nUnlike Ericsson, Nokia boasts an end-to-end suite of equipment and services. And, of course, Huawei has been sidelined from many key markets by government suspicious of possible ties to the Chinese government, and battered by US policies threatening to block its use of American technology as components in its systems.\n\nScale, captive customers, minimal competition\u2014it should be a recipe for profits galore.\n\nDominance, however, often becomes a burden. The dynamics that at first assure easy market share and steady revenue eventually make it hard to stay profitable.\n\nThe telecom equipment industry illustrates this well. Its oligopolistic structure\u2014reinforced by how standards bodies regulate licensing\u2014takes pressure off the vendors to invest in broadening their technology base to compete. That\u2019s helpful since, after all, innovating is incredibly expensive and risky.\n\nIn the short term, anyway. Because technological advances often make things cheaper to produce\u2014and, therefore, more appealing to customers, which in Nokia\u2019s case are telecom operators\u2014scrimping on investment is ultimately unwise.\n\nOf course, Nokia and its two main rivals have invested heavily in spiffy new 5G network technology, developing radically new and innovative network architecture that replaces hardware with software. But equipment is still so expensive that it threatens telecom operators\u2019 already strained profitability, and leaves them dependent on a single vendor (which could pose security, as well as commercial, risks). That\u2019s likely why 5G buildout has gone slower than expected.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the equipment vendors are lazy or stingy; rather, the nature of their business means they\u2019re stuck spending a lot in unproductive ways.\n\nDecades of consolidation of what should be a globalized supply chain makes it hard for the telecom industry to shed old technologies. Pretty much all of the world still runs on older generations\u20144G, 3G, and even 2G. Telecom companies can\u2019t just ditch those consumers, or browbeat them into buying fancier smartphones.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Scale, captive customers, minimal competition\u2014it should be a recipe for profits galore.
