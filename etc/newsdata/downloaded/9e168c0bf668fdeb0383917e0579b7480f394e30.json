It is thought that she gave the photos to him personally.\n\nMr Birch held a selling exhibition of around 70 photos of Keeler in 2010 but chose not to include the two new photos in it.\n\nPictured: Christine Keeler had an affair with Tory Secretary of State for War in the 1960s\n\nAll three are expected to fetch a combined \u00a32,500 when they sell with auctioneers Sworders, of Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex.\n\nMark Wilkinson, specialist at Sworders, said: 'The vendor was friends with Keeler and we believe she gave him the photos.\n\n'He held an exhibition of her photos in 2010 but we don't believe the topless images featured so they have remained unseen.\n\n'They are great, very striking photos and she was on of the most famous figures of the era.\n\n'The estimates we have given are quite conservative and we expect a lot of interest.'\n\nThe sale takes place in London on December 11. Christine Keeler died age 75 in December 2017.", "description": "Christine Keeler had an affair with married Conservative Secretary of State for War John Profumo in the early 1960s - when she was also sleeping with a Russian spy.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/13/19692422-0-image-a-23_1571056906206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
