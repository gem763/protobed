So that\u2019s exactly what they had, all over their walls. Vienne\u2019s mum is Dorli Vienne-Pollak (a former student of Oskar Kokoschka), who made \u201cpretty crazy, transgressive works\u201d inspired by everything from 80s punks and strip clubs to fantasy battle scenes. It must have been quite an eyeful for a child.\n\nToday, Vienne\u2019s Paris home is completely white. It\u2019s a small rebellion against her upbringing, which, balanced with the influence of her \u201covereducated French intellectual\u201d father, makes complete sense of the artist Vienne has become. Her works in puppetry, theatre and dance (including Jerk, Kindertotenlieder, The Ventriloquists Convention) make headlines for their macabre obsessions: sex, violence, fantasy, serial killers and freaky dolls. Bubbling under all that is a vibrant intellect. Vienne\u2019s conversation down the phone from France bounces fizzily from early 20th-century sociology to transcendental meditation.\n\nVienne is not seeking darkness, she says, but stimulation. \u201cI like to go to the edges, to question what the limits are and what we can accept. There\u2019s something very exciting in going there. I often make this comparison to extreme sports \u2013 I think there is something ecstatic in going to the limits.\u201d That sounds like thrill-seeking, but really it\u2019s about unpicking complex questions of human behaviour.\n\nHer work is regularly performed in Europe and the US (she collaborates with the American novelist Dennis Cooper), but little seen in the UK, so it\u2019s with some anticipation that her piece Crowd opens London\u2019s Dance Umbrella festival this year. Crowd brings brightness, abandon, tenderness, humour and sensuality, along with hints of darkness and violence, and is based on Vienne\u2019s own experiences of clubbing in Berlin in the early 90s.\n\nAs a teenager, she went to squat parties in often spectacular abandoned houses and buildings in east Berlin (where she was living) or to Tresor, the legendary club in the underground vault of a bombed-out department store. \u201cThey were really extraordinary places, and the people going there were very inspiring,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole scene was mesmerising, all this Detroit music culture that came in had a big impact on me.\u201d\n\nShe was brought back to memories of those days when researching the iconic ballet The Rite of Spring, thinking about techno culture as a modern equivalent. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like pagan celebrations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about ecstasy and losing control.\u201d\n\nVienne brings up British philosopher Jules Evans\u2019s book The Art of Losing Control, in which he talks of the necessity of ecstatic experience. \u201cI would say liberal capitalist western societies don\u2019t have so much space any more for ecstatic experience, which other societies in the world do, and always have,\u201d she says. Violence, of the type that sometimes appears in Vienne\u2019s work, \u201ccan also be part of this ecstatic experience\u201d, she says. \u201cDarkness and violence are not necessarily negative. It can be very invigorating, joyful and pleasurable expressing primal energies in a context that is respectful of each other and doesn\u2019t disturb the balance of the community.\u201d Like a boxing match, or a pumped-up dance floor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Invigorating darkness ... Crowd. Photograph: Estelle Hanania\n\nIn Crowd, we watch the increasing messiness of a wild night out to a soundtrack of Jeff Mills, DJ Rolando and Global Communication. But more than just an expression of primal energies, the performance plays with the perception of time. It seems to compress and distort \u2013 something clubbers might recognise from their own nights out \u2013 thanks to cinematic choreographic effects: freeze frames, looping repeats and brilliantly realised slow motion.\n\n\u201cIf you see Crowd live, audiences have said they feel a little bit different afterwards than before they came into the theatre, a slightly altered way of being,\u201d says Vienne. \u201cI think there is this double feeling of being very sharp \u2013 because it has slowed down you can see detail in a sharper way than usual \u2013 and then a little bit of this stoned feeling.\u201d\n\nIn history, much ecstatic experience was linked to religion; Vienne points out that art, too, was mostly bound to religion. Its position in modern secular society is often confused with entertainment, she thinks. \u201cI think both are totally necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cEntertainment is crucial and art is crucial, but I just think the contract with the audience is different, you are looking for a different experience.\u201d\n\nSo what does she want to provide with her own art? \u201cI think it\u2019s more on the level of spiritual experience,\u201d says Vienne. \u201cIt\u2019s questioning, it\u2019s self-reflecting, it\u2019s human-reflecting. It\u2019s an experience of philosophy in a physical way,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, I would put it that way: it\u2019s physical philosophy.\u201d", "description": "Feted for her macabre and freaky stage shows, Gis\u00e8le Vienne has created a time-bending piece of \u2018physical philosophy\u2019 inspired by her clubbing days", "authors": ["Lyndsey Winship"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6bad73a9f09ca48e28940020da8c471dd24be2c/0_150_3215_1930/master/3215.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=defe08671fa2023ca5f95847bac72ab2", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
