Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nMy boyfriend has recently expressed he wants to start wearing more colors. Like real colors: yellow, red, pink, green. Do you have recommendations for logo-less tees for men in real colors? Or any other colorful \u2014 wearable \u2014 men\u2019s basics?\n\nI traffic in a muted color palette most days, but I get it. Sometimes you feel like making a statement!\n\nA T-shirt is the most approachable option for injecting color into an otherwise dark wardrobe, though you can apparently also do so with sweaters (more on those below). Scott Sternberg\u2019s Entireworld \u2014 the brand behind some of these striped tees \u2014 also makes some great colorful T-shirts in solids, too. This organic-cotton boxy tee is described as \u201cslouchy, not sloppy\u201d and comes in a variety of fun hues. I am partial to the pink and yellow.\n\n6.5oz Garment Dye Crew Neck T-shirt The 6.5oz garment-dyed T-shirt from Los Angeles Apparel is a certified hit. Perfect weight, great fit, and it comes in a full rainbow of colors. For $24, you can experiment! $24 at Los Angeles Apparel Buy\n\nAcne Studios Green Phoenix Face Track Pants $300 at SSENSE Buy\n\nAcne Studios Pink Bl\u00e5 Konst 1996 Jeans $320 at SSENSE Buy\n\nAcne always has fun with color, and not just on top. These green track pants are very wearable and not your basic black. Their pink jeans are an advanced move, but if done right, could be a very cool look.\n\nIf your boyfriend decides he ultimately just want some color to peek out, socks can offer the perfect element of surprise. Wigwam\u2019s Balsam Fir Sock in the ice-blue \u201cBiscayne Bay\u201d hue would get your ankles some much-deserved attention. So would this multicolor dip-dyed pair from Stussy.\n\nWith fall weather arriving, I\u2019m looking to refresh my sweater collection. What are some styles you like?\n\nAs it turns out, I recently have been on a hunt for some sweaters, a category of clothing I overlooked for years. What was I so afraid of? I will ask my therapist. Anyway, I came to embrace them and haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nAcne Studios Pink Wool Kal Sweater My first suggestion is this perfectly pale-pink wool number from Acne. This color really speaks to me, and would look great with jeans (but maybe not the pink jeans I mentioned above). $300 at SSENSE Buy\n\nAcne Studios Multicolor Wool & Mohair Sweater If that\u2019s too boring, this Easter egg-y multicolor mohair one is more of a statement piece. Burn a cigarette hole in the mohair for the full \u201990s effect. $430 at SSENSE Buy\n\nAlbam Ribbed Crew Knit Or, go full MUSTARD MAN with this ribbed crewneck from Albam. It will make people smile. $189 at End Clothing Buy\n\nCashmere Crew Neck Long-sleeve Sweater When it comes to a more basic option, I usually go with the simple Uniqlo cashmere sweater in navy. It\u2019s well-priced and fits like it should, not too tight, but not too baggy. $100 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nHowlin' Wizard Contrast Crew Knit Antwerp-based brand Howlin\u2019 knocked it out of the park with this made-in-Scotland, color-blocked wool crew neck. It just SCREAMS aging creative director in the best way possible. Don\u2019t pair it with your white Common Projects. :) $185 at End Clothing Buy\n\nRRL Roll Neck Knit I cannot forget to suggest a proper turtleneck (a.k.a. roll neck, m8). This marled version from RRL will have you daydreaming about a bonfire in Santa Fe. $269 at End Clothing Buy\n\nL.L. Bean Signature Cotton Fisherman Sweater A classic fisherman knit looks good on almost everyone, even if you aren\u2019t trying to catch lobsters in Maine. The OG version from L.L. Bean is priced right, and brands don\u2019t get more classic than the Bean. $99 at L.L. Bean Buy\n\nCurious about the Chris Black Kitchen\u2122. What sort of appliances or cookware (pots, pans, etc.) do you use, and are there basic things you think any kitchen should have (whether or not someone cooks a lot)?\n\nLol, I do not cook. I live in New York City baby, the land of restaurants. I can get anything by walking a few short blocks! The reality is, I am a freak. I hate the smell of food lingering in a home, so I avoid it altogether. I have lived in my apartment for three years and haven\u2019t cooked once; I don\u2019t even own a pan! Luckily, I have friends who are experts in this field. I called upon longtime friend of the brand, DJ, podcaster, strategist, and known home-cooking enthusiast Jason Stewart, a.k.a. Them Jeans, to help. Jason will take it from here!\n\nMac Knife Superior Chef's Knife, 7-inch Unless you\u2019re a professional sushi chef who drives an Audi, there\u2019s no real need to buy a crazy-expensive knife. The maintenance is a bit much, and you\u2019re never going to keep it sharp for long. This Japanese blade looks unique, is sharp as hell, and costs less than $100 (for $10 more, you can also get a slightly longer eight-inch option). Whenever I take this in to get sharpened \u2014 which you should be doing twice a year \u2014 I always get compliments from the #bladehive. $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nJohn Boos Block BBQBD Reversible Maple Wood Edge Grain BBQ Cutting Board With Juice Groove You may be able to get away with buying an affordable knife, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend skimping on the cutting board. The most satisfying feeling I can get in the kitchen is a good knife on good wood. Any board within the John Boos brand is industry standard; this one comes with a \u201cJuice Groove\u201d to collect any meat drippings (Chris\u2019s worst nightmare). But you can just as easily shop around and get one without it. Take good care of this and it will last a lifetime. And a tip: If yours slides around too much while chopping, put a kitchen towel underneath. $78 at Amazon Buy $78 at Amazon Buy\n\nDuraHome Food Storage Containers with Lids 8oz, 16oz, 32oz - 44 Sets, Mixed Sizes The generic plastic containers that your shitty Postmates\u2019d ramen gets delivered in are the same ones Rene Redzepi fills with pickled deer lungs. What I\u2019m saying here folks is that these plastic cups are the Bottega Veneta of kitchen storage. They\u2019re reusable and disposable at the same time, so when you bring that lame farro salad to your work wife\u2019s baby shower, just leave the cups there for her actual husband to deal with. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nOXO Good Grips 3 Piece Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl Set Most at-home-cooks mix and stir in bowls that are just way too small, then stuff flies out, and you\u2019re not able to really spread your wings and fly. The Oxo brand is known for making great kitchen stuff, and these bowls are no exception. They\u2019re heavy, sturdy, and have a rubber grip on the bottom to keep you from sliding around while whisking. I love using them to toss root veggies in olive oil and salt before roasting them in the oven, or just for mixing a simple salad for two. It can be hard to find cabinet space for big bowls, so get some nice-looking ones you wouldn\u2019t mind having out on display. $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nOXO Good Grips Nonstick 12\" Open Frypan $40 (was $50, now 20% off) Obviously cast-iron skillets and stainless steel All-Clad sets are amazing pieces to pass down to your kids. But don\u2019t sleep on a solid nonstick pan for everyday cooking and easy clean up. Use it to practice your French omelette flipping, nut toasting, and slow-cooking salmon fillets (skin side down.) Since it\u2019s inexpensive, you can bang this around and replace it when needed \u2014 just remember to keep it out of the oven. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nWildone Stainless Steel Baking Sheet - Set of 2 Everyone has a sheet like this in their kitchen right now, and it\u2019s probably covered with years of baked-on sludge you\u2019ll never get off. That\u2019s why I recommend buying new baking sheets every couple years if you can\u2019t be really good at keeping them clean. These are essential for roasting veggies, baking galettes, or for cooking anything else you\u2019d throw in the oven. If you do mess one up, soak it overnight and hit it with the Le Labo and a steel pad. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBerkey Gravity-Fed Travel Water Filter with 2 Black Berkey Purification Elements, 1.5gal Not necessarily a cooking utensil, but you\u2019ve got to put something clean in that stinky Nalgene of yours. Berkey water filters are the undisputed king of overpriced countertop conversation starters. This \u201ctravel sized\u201d model is expensive (and looks pretty gigantic), but once you hop on the Berkey train, it\u2019s hard to get off. You can find a chic ceramic or wood stand for it, and make your bone broth taste even better with pro\u2122-quality water that will make the stuff Chris drinks taste like tap water at Souen. $249 at Amazon Buy $249 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
