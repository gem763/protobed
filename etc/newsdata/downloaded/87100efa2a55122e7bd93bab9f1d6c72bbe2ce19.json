Facebook screengrab/Carrie Lam\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader put up a strong defence of the city\u2019s beleaguered police force on Thursday, questioning \u201cpuzzling\u201d demands by anti-government protesters for its disbandment and saying the protesters would still have to seek its help in times of trouble.\n\nReaching out to the public in the second Facebook live session of her leadership, and the first in more than a year, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed hope that the violence would end soon and the city would return to normal.\n\nShe insisted that while the government had the responsibility to restore order and bring about reconciliation, Hongkongers would also have to support the police and say \u201cno\u201d to lawlessness.\n\nLam spent an hour on the Facebook live session, responding to internet users\u2019 comments on her governance and her latest policy address.\n\nThe chief executive touched on various areas, including housing, land supply, health care, education and security, using social media for the first time since August last year to engage the public.\n\nRead also: Xi Jinping warns that attempts to divide China will end with \u2018crushed bodies and shattered bones\u2019\n\nShe was forced to unveil her policy blueprint on Wednesday by way of an unprecedented, pre-recorded video as opposition lawmakers blocked her from presenting it live in the Legislative Council.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Lam also faced a barrage of insults from opposition politicians for the second consecutive day, and 13 pan-democratic lawmakers were thrown out the chamber for disorderly conduct.\n\nAt its peak, more than 7,600 concurrent users were watching the live session. When it ended at 9pm, more than 11,600 users had reacted \u2013 9,000 posted \u201cangry-face\u201d emojis, 2,000 \u201cliked\u201d what she had to say, and 600 expressed \u201clove\u201d.\n\nThe session racked up 49,000 comments, many of which reiterated the protesters\u2019 favourite slogan: \u201cFive demands, not one less!\u201d\n\nWhile Lam insisted that she could not back down on those demands, including the setting up of an independent inquiry into police conduct against protesters and amnesty for all those arrested so far, she made it a point to address a sixth demand \u2013 the disbandment of the police force.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m puzzled when I hear this, because when there are public order and safety issues, such as theft or unfortunate attacks, people say they must ask police to follow up seriously,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo police are playing a very important role, and we must support them in law enforcement.\u201d\n\nRead also: Tim Cook sent a memo to employees explaining why he stands by Apple\u2019s decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters to track police\n\nLam also weighed in on the recent attack on Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, who has been organising the biggest anti-government rallies, saying her administration condemned all forms of violence, regardless of the background of the victim.\n\nThe chief executive expressed hope the public would not lose faith in the police force because of confrontations between officers and protesters or journalists.\n\nIn her policy blueprint, Lam put the focus firmly on housing as a root cause of public grievances, promising to find more land and improve livelihoods amid a worsening economy. But she offered no political solutions to restore order in a city rocked by more than four months of protest chaos.\n\n\u201cI also hope that Hong Kong can soon move on from this crisis \u2026 but we need everyone\u2019s effort. If we show sympathy to violence, attackers will only act without hesitation,\u201d Lam said when asked if Hong Kong would return to normal in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe biggest responsibility is on the government, because we have the ability to enforce the law, prosecute and reconcile. If there are better ways to work on these aspects, I\u2019m willing to take up the mission.\u201d\n\nThere were chaotic scenes earlier in Legco when the chief executive arrived for the traditional question and answer session on her policy address.\n\nOnly three pro-establishment lawmakers were able to ask questions because of frequent interruptions by pan-democratic legislators, more than a dozen of whom were kicked out of the chamber.\n\nRead also: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says she isn\u2019t ruling out Chinese military intervention as the city\u2019s violence appears unending\n\nPeople Power lawmaker Raymond Chan Chi-chuen was removed after he chanted: \u201cHong Kong Hitler! No one will call you Carrie any more! Blood all over your hands!\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a so-called citizens\u2019 press conference on Thursday, two masked protesters said the policy address showed Lam had diagnosed the city\u2019s situation wrongly.\n\n\u201cLam and her cabinet still want to buy us off. That shows Lam is totally out of touch,\u201d a protester said. \u201cThe root cause of our resistance is injustice. It is a political issue.\u201d\n\nSOUTH CHINA MORNING POST", "description": "Business Insider - She questioned \u2018puzzling\u2019 calls for the police force's disbandment, since protesters would still have to seek its help in times of trouble..
