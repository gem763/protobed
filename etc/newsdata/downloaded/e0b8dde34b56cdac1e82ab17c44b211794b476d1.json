Many people know him more directly for his Instapundit blog.\n\nHe was one of the earliest popular bloggers and continues to be one of the most successful. Before Moore\u2019s Law delivered plentiful and cheap bandwidth unto us, many website servers would strain from all the hits an \u201cInstalanche\u201d (from the many readers following a link from his website) would deliver.\n\nMr. Reynolds is a tech geek and a sci-fi enthusiast. He describes himself politically as a \u201clibertarian transhumanist.\u201d He believes that government should regulate with a light hand, if at all, and doesn\u2019t have many of the \u201cyuck\u201d reflexes that incline people to slam on the breaks when new technology threatens old ways of doing things.\n\nTherefore, his new book, \u201cThe Social Media Upheaval,\u201d should serve as a good barometer for just how much trouble Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley tech titans are in, politically. The conclusion calls for \u201cpolicing platforms, and collusion among them.\u201d\n\nIt elaborates: \u201cAn approach based on antitrust competition will preserve free speech while reducing social media abuses. As social media grows more pervasive, and more obviously destructive, the pressure for regulation is sure to grow. Better to regulate in a way that preserves free speech, and that doesn\u2019t empower tech oligarchs.\u201d\n\nThings have come to a pretty pass when libertarian law professors are suggesting renewed trust busting as a way to avoid even more censorious outcomes. How did we get here?\n\nThe 2016 election results were almost completely unexpected by anyone with any political or cultural pull. Our betters were simply gobsmacked by what happened and looked for someone to blame. They found it in Russian bots and Russian-bought ads on social media, which were said to have caused Hillary Clinton to lose her bid for the presidency.\n\n\u201cResisters\u201d saw the face of the enemy, also, in anyone who either vocally supported Donald Trump, stuck up for his supporters, or was insufficiently hostile to Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nWoke culture preceded the election, but President Trump\u2019s victory put it front-and-center and its obsessions became elite obsessions: Call outs, boycotts, crackdowns on all forms of alleged hate speech, de-platforming, and de-humanizing all who do not share the party line.\n\nSocial media has made such censorious efforts much easier, with the rise of \u201coutrage mobs.\u201d This has gone hand in glove with the increased tendency of folks to wall themselves off from sources of information that do not share their preconceptions and to substitute surface knowledge for real exploration and understanding. Too often, we share articles for the headlines without even so much as clicking on the link and reading it for ourselves.\n\nThe net effect of this activity, argues Mr. Reynolds, is that social media is making us dumber, meaner and more cocooned than ever before while at the same time feeding us the illusion of being in the right.\n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous mixture. It is made worse by the fact that a small number of social media platforms, crowdfunding sites, online payment firms, and credit card companies are making it much harder for alternative platforms to carve out room for other, dissenting voices in the name of stomping out \u201chate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaypal, for example, cut off money transfers to YouTube competitor BitChute, and Twitter competitor Gab,\u201d Mr. Reynolds writes. These options could become real alternative platforms over time, but the tech and financial industries are effectively colluding to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nBy stifling the platforms, Big Tech is also empowering the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other sites to feel free to stifle the speech of ornery users. After all, they really don\u2019t have anywhere to go.\n\nGiven all that, it\u2019s no wonder that to this law professor, and to many conservatives as well, anti-trust begins to look like the most appealing option. If President Trump is re-elected, expect the powers-that-be in Silicon Valley to face harsh new regulation.\n\nA few final words about \u201cThe Social Media Upheaval\u201d\u2019s structure and prose: There are no chapters to be found here. The work is one long essay, broken up by subtitles and occasionally distracting pull quotes.\n\nMr. Reynolds cites generously and quotes liberally, though in no case did I find myself rushing past the longer quotations from his sources. It used to be a burn on a book to say that it \u201creads like a blog post,\u201d but in this long pamphlet form it\u2019s not bad. At least it doesn\u2019t read like a series of tweets.\n\n\u2022 Jeremy Lott is creator and writer of the Movie Men comic book.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE SOCIAL MEDIA UPHEAVAL\n\nBy Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nEncounter Books, $7.99, 64 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
