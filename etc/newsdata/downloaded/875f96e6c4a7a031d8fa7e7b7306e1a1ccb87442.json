Successful completion of university administered research and CMSA exams are required for a specialist to register and practise in the country.\n\nMoletsane wants to be a specialist in internal medicine and is studying at the University of the Free State.\n\nHowever, he has failed his CMSA exam twice \u2013 during the first semester in 2017 and again in the second semester last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cI failed both exams and have been denied access to my scripts on both occasions. We sit for exams with no set pass mark. The pass mark is determined after marking,\u201d he said.\n\nCMSA chief executive Lize Hayes declined to comment on Moletsane\u2019s matter, citing confidentiality.\n\nHowever, she referred City Press to a section in the medical care quality custodian\u2019s policy, dated November last year, which allows appeals, but not reviews, and does not allow candidates to access their multiple choice questions (MCQ) scripts.\n\nThe policy was approved after HPCSA held a stakeholders\u2019 meeting in October last year to discuss similar complaints pertaining to CMSA exams at its council chambers in Pretoria.\n\nMoletsane was among six medical practitioners whose complaints led to the meeting. At the same meeting, universities raised similar concerns regarding the CMSA exams.\n\nHayes said, without making reference to Moletsane, that the recalculation of candidate exam papers was done after a formal request to do so.\n\n\u201cMCQ papers cannot be reviewed and are not made available to candidates, in line with international trends. A good bank is essential to running a fair and defensible examination,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nMoletsane said his requests to CMSA were about his MCQ scripts and that the policy had not changed anything.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing new; totally none,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the HPCSA meeting, stakeholders alleged that: There was a low throughput rate of local African specialists, coupled with unfair treatment and discriminatory practices towards African registrars, specialists and academics as a result of CMSA exams;\n\n\n\nThe exams lacked transparency, leading to a flood of litigations by black candidates against the manner in which scripts were marked and the issuing of results;\n\nBlack candidates were singled out and their fate was decided before exams, and sometimes performance in written exams was disregarded;\n\nBlack candidates were separated from their white counterparts on the basis of the command of English and were failed deliberately; and\n\nThere was gate-keeping, which directly inhibited the production of an acceptable number of specialists.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations agreed on at the meeting were submitted to the HPCSA board for consideration.\n\nSome of the conclusions made by stakeholders were that the council failed its oversight role and its board was to consider reviewing the contract it had with CMSA because of lack of transparency in the administration of exams.\n\nCity Press has seen an email Moletsane wrote to HPCSA chief executive Dr Raymond Billa last month, asking whether there was an external body that was recognised by the council with which he could write his exams.\n\n\u201cHaving tried to get a fair and transparent exam from CMSA without any success, I wish to be informed as to which examining body you recognise outside South Africa. I will make arrangements to be examined there, with the expectation of being registered after passing,\u201d Moletsane wrote.\n\nBilla said he had not been able to obtain information on his request on a local student wishing to write the exams of a foreign body without having studied in that country.\n\n\u201cThe only consideration we make is for foreign-qualified practitioners after undergoing training in those countries and writing examinations in those countries, upon completion of their studies and training programmes.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of the specific condition as you have raised it.\u201d\n\nThe HPCSA failed to respond to questions from City Press.\n\nSA Medical Association board member Dr Eddie Ngwenya said medical registrars, who are represented by registrars\u2019 organisations within his organisation, had also raised concerns relating to CMSA exam fees and assessment mechanisms, but these were being addressed with CMSA.", "description": "Phume Peter Moletsane has given up appealing for his exam scripts to be remarked by the Colleges of Medicine of SA (CMSA).", "authors": ["Msindisi Fengu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3191/78c6451eb2554a8ba6e650856ddf5fc3.png", "published_at": "2019-05-15"}
