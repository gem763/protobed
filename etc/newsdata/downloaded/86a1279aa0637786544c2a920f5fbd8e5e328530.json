Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1% after the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said that from Saturday a ban would be implemented on wearing masks at public gatherings, with penalties of up to a year in jail and a fine.\n\nThe ban could escalate tensions between the government and protesters, leading to more violent confrontations, according to Francis Lun, chief executive at Geo Securities. \"Investors should avoid Hong Kong-related stocks amid worsening social unrest,\" he said.\n\nDevelopers Sun Hung Kai Properties and New World Development were down 3.4% and 2.3%, respectively, and Hong Kong subway operator MTR lost 2.5%.\n\nStock markets in mainland China were closed on Friday.\n\nThe jobs report later Friday will provide the latest signal on the health of the U.S. economy during a period of global turbulence. Investors have grown skittish about global economic growth this week amid a series of weak data from the eurozone and the U.S. and the prospect of fresh tariffs from the U.S. on certain exports from the European Union.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys edged down to 1.525% on Friday, from 1.531% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, ticked down 0.1%.\n\nMarket watchers will comb the U.S. jobs data for signs of weakness, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy moving forward. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls were up 140,000 during the month, while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%. Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 3.3% from September 2018.\n\nLater Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a Fed Listens event in Washington.\n\nAt a Wall Street Journal event in New York on Thursday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank will do what it takes to keep the longest period of U.S. economic expansion going. He added that the central bank takes each policy meeting \"one at a time.\"\n\nU.S. stock indexes had bounced back from early drops on Thursday to close higher as traders increased their bets that the Fed would move to lower interest rates two more times by the end of the year.\n\nIn commodities, global oil benchmark Brent crude gained 0.4% to $57.95 per barrel. Gold was flat.\n\nJoanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 04, 2019 04:32 ET (08:32 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
