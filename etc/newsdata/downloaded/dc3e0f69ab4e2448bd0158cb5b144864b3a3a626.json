Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., official at a rally in Queens, N.Y., that marked Sanders' return to the campaign trail after recently having a heart attack.\n\n\"I'm in the United States Congress now,\" said Ocasio-Cortez as she gave a 20-minute speech introducing Sanders, \"a long, long way from being a sexually harassed waitress in downtown Manhattan one year ago.\"\n\n\"The halls of Congress are no joke,\" she continued.\n\n\"It is no joke. Standing up to corporate power, and established interests is no joke. It's not just about standing up and saying these things, but behind closed doors, your arm is twisted, the vise pressure of political pressure gets put on you, every trick in the book, psychological, and otherwise is to get us to abandon the working class,\" she said before a massive crowd.\n\n2020 Democratic presidential hopeful US Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) wave to a crowd of supporters during a campaign rally on October 19, 2019 in New York City.
