Lorde is in danger and only your tweets can save her! Well\u2026 not really, but that\u2019s what the word on the street is in New Zealand, where law makers are threatening to take legal action against families whose children drop out of school and leave their studies incomplete. According to The Guardian, the opposition National party in New Zealand is considering trying to take a harder stance on truancy and fining parents NZ$3000 if their children don\u2019t stay in school until the age of 16. This legal action would absolutely affect wunderkind and Auckland native Lorde, who left New Zealand in her early teenage years to craft the genre we now affectionately refer to as sad girl teen pop.\n\nWhile it\u2019s highly unlikely that this law will pass, and even more unlikely that Lorde will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of it, her fans are not taking any chances. They\u2019ve started a massive, hilarious Twitter campaign to keep Lorde out of prison and in the recording studio (where she belongs!) via the hashtag #freeLORDE.\n\nme hiding lorde in my pants so she can escape prison #freeLORDE pic.twitter.com/XlLH8xv3Kz \u2014 \ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd8f\ud835\udd92\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd93 #freeLORDE (@buzzcutthingz) October 8, 2019\n\nFollow the hashtag #freeLORDE and you will find so much to love: Lorde Stans putting in the work to free their fave, New Zealanders taking opposition leader Simon Bridges to task for threatening to fine their queen, and a lot of confused people who are worried about the singer and simply looking for answers. But they need not worry! Everyone knows that Lorde never needed to go to school - she is a gorgeous witch who has existed in this celestial plane for anywhere from 380 and 572 years. However, if Lorde does somehow end up on the wrong side of the law, her fans should have seen it coming because said it herself: I\u2019m a liability.", "description": "#freeLORDE is trending on Twitter because a new law in New Zealand about leaving school early could have a negative affect on Lorde.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/10-Lorde.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
