(Photo: FACUNDO ARRIZABALAGA/ EPA-EFE)\n\nAdd another lawsuit to the towering pile of legal conflicts stemming from the take-down of accused sex-predator Harvey Weinstein: Actress Rose McGowan, one of his first public accusers, is suing him and his ex-lawyers alleging a \"diabolical\" plot to intimidate her.\n\nMcGowan and her team of Chicago lawyers announced Wednesday she filed a lawsuit in federal court in California against Weinstein, two of his high-profile former lawyers, David Boies and Lisa Bloom and their firms, and Black Cube, the London-based private intelligence firm staffed by ex-Israeli Mossad agents.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges 11 complaints, including civil racketeering, wiretapping, fraud, invasion of privacy, computer crimes, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring. The suit seeks a jury trial, \"treble\" damages and punitive damages.\n\n\"This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims,\" declared the opening lines of the complaint. \"And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.\"\n\nLisa Bloom in Los Angeles in July 2017. (Photo: Jae C. Hong/ AP)\n\nJulie Porter, one of McGowan's lawyers, said in a press statement that the suit details a \"conspiracy\" led by fallen movie mogul Weinstein and enabled by the other defendants to \"intimidate and silence\" McGowan and others.\n\n\"My life was upended by their actions, and I refuse to be intimidated any longer,\" McGowan said in the statement.\n\nWeinstein issued a response via one of his civil attorneys, Phyllis Kupferstein, who said McGowan tried to reach a $6 million settlement with Weinstein in 2017 and was rejected.\n\n\"Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is; a publicity seeker looking for money,\" Weinstein's statement said. \"From the moment she sought a multi-million dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this. We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit.\"\n\nMcGowan, 46, is among Weinstein's first and loudest accusers. She says he raped her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Her public acknowledgment two decades later helped fire up the #MeToo movement in October 2017. Hundreds of women have come forward since to accuse Weinstein and scores of other entertainment figures of sexual misconduct ranging from groping to rape.\n\nWeinstein is set to go on trial in New York City next year on sex-crime charges, including rape, stemming from encounters with two women.\n\nBoth Boies and Bloom have lately been in the news for representing multiple accusers of financier Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who killed himself in a federal jail in New York this summer while awaiting trial on new sex-crime charges. Bloom, a noted women's-rights attorney, also represented accusers of Bill Cosby.\n\nBut before that they represented Weinstein in his efforts in 2016 and 2017 to ward off major media exposes about his alleged sexual misconduct over decades, plus McGowan's own memoir, published in January 2018, which discusses her rape allegation.

(Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)\n\nAll of this has been in the news again recently due to best-selling books by the New York Times and The New Yorker reporters whose exposes brought down Weinstein and later won them a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nBoth Bloom and Boies later apologized for working with Weinstein.\n\nMcGowan's lawsuit alleges that Boies\u2019 and Bloom\u2019s efforts on Weinstein\u2019s behalf were part of a \"sprawling smear campaign to defraud, malign and marginalize McGowan, employing unlawful tactics that inflicted severe emotional distress and caused her damages.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says that their alleged intimidation campaign included hiring \"undercover intelligence operatives from Black Cube\" who posed as women\u2019s rights advocates and journalists to gain McGowan\u2019s trust, unlawfully record her and acquire her unpublished manuscript.\n\n\u201cThe complaint alleges that these defendants launched a coordinated, sophisticated attack on Rose McGowan and others who sought to tell the truth about and expose Weinstein\u2019s misconduct in 2017,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThis suit seeks to hold Harvey Weinstein and his team of enablers accountable for the harm that they did to our client.\"\n\nBloom's lawyer, Eric George, said in a statement to USA TODAY that it's \"inexcusable\" that McGowan included Bloom in her lawsuit.\n\n\"There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client,\" his statement said. \"We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY sought comment from Boies and Black Cube but did not get immediate responses.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/23/rose-mcgowan-sues-harvey-weinstein-lisa-bloom/4076019002/", "description": "One of Harvey Weinstein's loudest accusers, Rose McGowan, is suing him, his ex-lawyers and Black Cube alleging a smear and intimidation campaign.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published P.M.
