The Wildlife Conservation Society says populations of the pups are endangered by development, hunting and diseases from domestic dogs.\n\nThe society\u2019s long-term plans include acquiring female dholes for a breeding program.\n\nAn exhibit formerly occupied by polar bears has been repurposed for the dhole\u2019s habitat. The Bronx Zoo\u2019s last polar bear, Tundra, died in 2017 at age 26.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A pack of handsome brothers is getting settled at New York's Bronx Zoo.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/zoo_wild_dogs_03791_c0-240-5760-3600_s1200x700.jpg?3b9a8ea0e82656f098dd6f7cd5420c99f93f2f69", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
