(Charles Mostoller/Reuters)\n\nThat is how Kirkus Reviews has judged Richard Brookhiser\u2019s new and exciting history, Give Me Liberty: A History of America\u2019s Exceptional Idea, and it represents just some of the high praise this forthcoming book \u2014 its publication date is November 5 \u2014 richly deserves (having read the galleys, I can attest to such).\n\nFor example, the great historian, Joseph J. Ellis, has meaningful praise for Give Me Liberty:\n\nIn our deeply divided America, Richard Brookhiser goes back in search of our roots, and finds them in that many-headed idea called \u201cliberty.\u201d In his signature style, he wastes no words, defies the conventional political categories, and invites us to join him in recovering a series of inspirational moments when we all felt the same future in our hearts and minds.\n\nSo too does the historian H. W. Brands:\n\nWith his characteristic combination of elegance and shrewdness, Richard Brookhiser gives us another insightful account of what makes us the nation we are. Give Me Liberty is intellectual history at its riveting best.\n\nGive Me Liberty is an exposition of 13 events, documents, and speeches \u2013 some famous, some not \u2013 that rediscover and define America\u2019s distinct trait, its love for Liberty, separating it from all other nations. In the current issue of NR, we run an excerpt of one of those chapters, this on the creation of the New York Manumission Society in 1785, an event that marked the desire by some of America\u2019s greatest Founders to extend liberty to all men by ending slavery. Read this chapter and learn for yourself why Rick\u2019s book is a powerful contribution to not only history, but to the current debate about nationalism.\n\nA word to the wise: Pick up a copy at your local bookstore next week, or be smart and order Give Me Liberty at Amazon right now.", "description": "That is how Kirkus Reviews has judged Richard Brookhiser\u2019s new and exciting book.", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
