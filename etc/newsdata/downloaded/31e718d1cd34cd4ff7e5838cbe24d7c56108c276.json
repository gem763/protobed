All-Rounder Retweets A Fan's Comment Criticising The Former Opener", "language": "en", "text": "India crushed South Africa by 203 runs in the first Test in Vizag.\n\nWe now lead it 1-0 with 2 games to go.\n\nChasing a hefty target of 395 runs in the fourth innings of the Vizag Test, South Africa suffered a massive batting collapse and were bundled out for 191 as the Indian bowlers dominated the proceedings. While Mohammed Shami was the destructor-in-chief for the Virat Kohli-led side, picking up a five-wicket haul to finish with brilliant figures10.5 of 5/35 in his 10.5 overs in the fourth innings, it was all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who got India some important breakthroughs with a four-wicket haul.\n\nJadeja removed openers Aiden Markram and Deal Elgar to break the backbone of South Africa's top-order before dismissing Vernon Philander and Keshav Maharaj. He also displayed excellent reflexes on the field and was at his usual best by continuously troubling the opposition batsmen with his sharp presence. He also scored 70 runs in two innings with the bat.\n\nHowever, the all-rounder failed to find a mention in former Indian opener Virender Sehwag's congratulatory tweet for the Indian team post their victory and was seemingly left irked.\n\nJadeja on Sunday retweeted a controversial tweet from a fan criticising Sehwag for not mentioning the all-rounder in his post. \"Fantastic test match for @ImRo45, a dream beginning to opening the batting in Test cricket. Wish him the very best. That was a convincing win for India with some great contributions from Mayank, Shami, Ashwin, Pujara,\" Sehwag had tweeted.\n\nDon't Miss 395 SHARES 1.9 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 503 SHARES\n\nReplying to Sehwag, a Twitter user blamed him for overlooking Jadeja's fine performance. \"@virendersehwag kya aapke TV me @imjadeja ki #batting, #bowling aur #fielding ka performance nahi dikha??? Ya phir so gaye the???,\" (Virender Sehwag didn't your TV show Ravindra Jadeja's performance with the bat, ball and on the field? Or were you sleeping?). The fan's comment was retweeted by Jadeja.\n\nFantastic test match for @ImRo45 , a dream beginning to opening the batting in Test cricket. Wish him the very best.
