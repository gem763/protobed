Their expression of affection was really very sweet and adorable to look at.'\n\nDuring mating season, owls hooting will increase as the males try to figure out the proximity of females, lure them over and perhaps offer food to court them. They will then mark their territory to prevent other males from stealing their mate.\n\nSpotted Owlets are distinct in their patterned fur, arched white brows and deep golden-yellow eyes which indicate that they hunt during the day.They are commonly found in southern Asia from Iran to Vietnam except Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nAmong Tadoba National Park's residents is the sloth bear, hyena, jackal, wild dog and sambar.\n\nThere are 195 bird species including those endangered and 74 species of butterflies.\n\nShreya Singha Ray captured the beautiful moment of two owls sharing a cuddle on a branch in Tadoba National Park, India.
