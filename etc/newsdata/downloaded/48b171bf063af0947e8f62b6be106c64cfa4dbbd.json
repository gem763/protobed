The tweet drew angry responses against the tech giant, including many who said: \"Shame on @Apple\".\n\nUnder Apple's rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.\n\nIn 2011, Apple modified its app store to remove apps that listed locations for drunk-driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.", "description": "Chinese media had sharply criticised Apple for offering the app on its online store.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/ee4aa98718da4dccbca811ab0e65aea6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
