The two-day event, which is slated to take place Dec. 6-7 in Las Vegas, markets itself as an experience \"where music, technology, and art converge.\"\n\nBack in August, its headliners were announced: Foo Fighters, Kacey Musgraves, Beck and Anderson.Paak & the Free Nationals. Last week, on Oct. 16, the full lineup was revealed and included acts such as Chvrches, H.E.R., Brandi Carlile, Leon Bridges and Montreal act, Kaytranada.\n\nOne of the announced acts, DJ and producer the Black Madonna, quickly took to social media, confused by her inclusion, telling fans: \"What the f--k is this Amazon shit? I absolutely didn't agree to this. Oh hell no.\" Explaining that she never saw Amazon's name attached to this event, she went on to denounce Amazon for what another Twitter user described as its \"contract to host ICE's deportation files, or its exploitation of its drivers, or its fuelling of Seattle's homelessness.\"\n\n\"I never saw the branding for this until my name was attached,\" the Black Madonna continued. In another tweet, she said, \"Also I didn't even know what AWS stood for till yesterday,\" noting Amazon Web Series' involvement in Intersect. \"I'm not a tech person. I didn't get hired by AWS. This wasn't even called intersect when I agree to do it.\"\n\nAre you hearing the words I\u2019m typing. I didn\u2019t see this. I do 150 shows a year. They didn\u2019t tag me in shit. Also I didn\u2019t even know what AWS stood for till yesterday. I\u2019m not a tech person. I didn\u2019t get hired by AWS. This wasn\u2019t even called intersect when I agree to do it. Chill. \u2014@blackmadonnachi\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Amazon Web Series told Pitchfork: \"Our affiliation of the Intersect Festival is clear in the contract that was signed by Black Madonna's management team.\"\n\nThree days later, the Black Madonna announced that she has been removed from the event's lineup.\n\nAnother act, Japanese Breakfast, also took to Twitter to explain her appearance at the festival, noting that she is \"still uncertain how to move forward as a small indie act on a bill.\"", "description": "Hundreds of artists are speaking out after Amazon announced its inaugural music festival.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333434.1571928483!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/amazon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
