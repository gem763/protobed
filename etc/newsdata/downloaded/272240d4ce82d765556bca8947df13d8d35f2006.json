It is unclear if this is what triggered the aggression.\n\nWhile the Russian military makes no mention of any equipment losses, the Geographical Society had a bit more to say on what happened.\n\n\"Walruses attacked the participating boat,\" the research group explained. \"The boat sank, but the tragedy was avoided thanks to the clear actions of the squad leader. All the landing participants safely reached the shore.\"\n\nThis wasn't the Russian navy's first run-in with walruses.\n\nThis past May, photos believed to be from 2006 surfaced online of a large walrus napping on top of a Russian submarine.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "A landing craft carrying researchers ashore from a Russian navy tugboat was attacked and apparently sunk by walruses during an Arctic expedition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7777/1c7bb89647e244f9965c01d2ebb12cbb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
