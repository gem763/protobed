After the recent, much-anticipated birth of her nephew, her husband\u2019s family were less excited about this next grandchild and, with her own family emotionally and physically distant, Karvunidis came up with the then-novel idea of a theatrical reveal of her baby\u2019s sex.\n\nDuring their 20-week ultrasound scan she asked her midwife to keep quiet about whether the baby was a boy or girl and, instead of telling the expectant couple in person, the bemused professional sealed a note containing the secret in an envelope. Karvunidis then baked two cakes in the shape of ducklings, filling one with pink icing and the other with blue \u2013 a discrete toothpick for differentiation.\n\nHer family took some convincing to gather for a midweek party without apparent purpose, but as soon as the butter-cream duckling showed its contents \u2013 pink for a girl \u2013 everything changed. There were gasps, tears and someone shrieked: \u201cI feel like she\u2019s been born!\u201d In that moment the cake and the party did all Karvunidis had hoped to bring her pregnancy to life.\n\nThe arrival of Bianca (the eldest of Karvunidis\u2019s three daughters) was still months away, but that day she did unwittingly birth something: the gender-reveal party. Her blog about the event was picked up by a popular magazine found in the waiting rooms of midwives and obstetricians in the area. The story spread through midwest America and then far beyond, becoming a mainstream part of US pregnancies and taking an increasing share of the $200-$1,000 US couples spend on their baby showers.\n\nThe popularity of elaborate, emotive gender-reveal videos on social media may have helped spread the trend to the UK. John Lewis stocks a gender-reveal party balloon and online retailers offer products from confetti blasters to personalised sweets and scratch cards. Celebrities have also acted as inspiration. In an Instagram video last year, announcing her third pregnancy, Kate Hudson, her husband and sons simultaneously pop a number of balloons, spilling pink streamers and confetti on to the grass. The family jumps up and down hysterically, screaming with delight and hugging each other as a cloud of pink drifts skywards.\n\nKarvunidis is far from happy about what she unleashed. In late July this year, responding to questions on Twitter about her role in the gender-reveal phenomenon, she confessed to \u201cmajor mixed feelings\u201d and posted a family photograph featuring Bianca, the world\u2019s first gender-revealed baby, dressed in a suit. Striking a strong pose with her hands in her pockets, Bianca was sporting what conservative media outlets would describe as an \u201candrogynous\u201d haircut.\n\nKarvunidis feels that \u2018aggressive energy\u2019 is caught up in the ritual\n\nThe story spread like wildfire: like the Arizona wildfire which last year destroyed 47,000 acres of forest, at a cost of $8m. Dennis Dickey, an off-duty border patrol agent, started the blaze with his gender-reveal stunt: shooting at a rectangular target marked \u201cBoy or girl\u201d, which exploded into blue smoke before setting grasslands alight. It\u2019s not just the environmental recklessness of Dickey\u2019s reveal, and the increasing popularity of expensive and dangerous stunts, that bothers Karvunidis. She\u2019s also concerned about what she calls \u201caggressive energy\u201d being so caught up with the sex of a foetus. \u201cWhen you announce your son with a gunshot, or by wrestling an alligator, I think, how far are we going to take this?\u201d\n\nAs a lifelong feminist, who has recently started law school, her unease about gender-reveals started soon after they began to take off \u2013 she felt the idea was becoming politicised by conservative forces. \u201cI feel like the guy who invented gunpowder,\u201d she half-jokes. Though Karvunidis accepts that the idea may have emerged, with or without her, from the cultural soup that surrounds pregnancy, she does feel some guilt. \u201cI\u2019m the one who put the form to it. I\u2019m the one who said: \u2018This is something we\u2019re going to celebrate now, and this is how we\u2019re going to do it\u2019. I put it out there.\u201d\n\nThough Karvunidis\u2019s instincts led her to reject the gender-reveal shortly after she created it, it was her daughters\u2019 experiences of modern American girlhood that solidified her views. Karvunidis explains that she\u2019s always tried to model to her children that there should be no limits on what women can do. \u201cI\u2019ve gone back to school, I started a business and I try to be that person \u2013 the boss \u2013 so that it\u2019s totally normalised for them.\u201d\n\nBut as Bianca has grown older she\u2019s been busy giving her mother an education in gender politics. Karvunidis\u2019s eldest is still just 10, uses she/her pronouns and considers herself a girl, but she\u2019s firmly rejected the idea that girls should dress or act a certain way and questions preconceived ideas about what gender means \u2013 something her parents have fully supported her in. \u201cBianca tells me there are more than two genders and many sexualities. I hadn\u2019t considered all this before.\u201d\n\nThanks to Bianca, who Karvunidis calls a \u201cbad-ass\u201d, she is now concerned that the parties she helped make popular are hurting trans and non-binary communities, a position shared by the many activists who have supported her stance. \u201cAt least when the child is born you are getting all the information at once: the sex, the colour of their hair, who they look like, how long they are, what their heart rate is. With the gender-reveal you\u2019ve isolated one aspect of this person. When it gets elevated as being central to your identity that\u2019s problematic,\u201d she asserts.\n\nShe feels the gender reveal now helps an anti-liberal agenda\n\nBut Karvunidis\u2019s worries about the extreme bent of the gender-reveal don\u2019t stop there. Despite recent media focus falling on Bianca, it\u2019s the world that her more \u201ctraditionally girly\u201d daughters are experiencing that really makes their mother feel guilty.\n\nWhen middle child Stella was three, Karvunidis bought her a set of Lego for Christmas. The toddler sobbed on seeing it, declaring it a \u201cboy toy\u201d because it was primary-coloured rather than pink. \u201cOur nursery was painted blue and yellow,\u201d reflects Karvunidis. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hold gender-reveals for our younger kids, but this still happened.\u201d She now believes the gender-reveal party has helped conservatives create increasingly restrictive pink and blue boxes for children, which support their anti-liberal agenda. \u201cI know I played a role in it and it makes me sick.\u201d Her worries don\u2019t stop there. \u201cI\u2019m pro-choice,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat else am I going to be? I have three daughters.\u201d In her eyes the gender-reveal has benefitted those trying to curb women\u2019s autonomy. \u201cIn the US, our reproductive rights are being eroded down to nothing. You\u2019ll have a six-day-old ball of cells eclipsing an adult human woman\u2019s medical decisions. It\u2019s not a football player or a ballet dancer, it\u2019s a foetus, but the gender-reveal helps people forget that.\u201d\n\nKarvunidis worries that the increasing polarisation of girl- and boyhood is \u201ca new extreme\u201d. Professor Sarah Knott, author of Mother: An Unconventional History, says that sorting people into one sex or another was a rigid and crucial part of the fiercely patriarchal society from which we descend. But our contemporary take (complete with highly gendered toys and clothing for newborns) is, she believes, something new. For centuries, infants were dressed alike and wouldn\u2019t have been differentiated by their clothing until later in childhood. \u201cIt seems that we are more focused on quickly establishing a person\u2019s identity now than we were then,\u201d Knott says.\n\nWhere the gender-reveal is heading, no one knows, but Knott reminds us that habits around pregnancy and birth can disappear as quickly as they appear. And UK consumers seem reluctant to follow their US counterparts wholeheartedly.\n\nStill committed to being a bringer of fun, Karvunidis wants a more inclusive, tolerant and liberal world for her children \u2013 but not at the expense of joy and celebration. \u201cI don\u2019t want to shame people for having a party. I hope everyone has cake when they want it,\u201d she laughs, \u201cbut let\u2019s just eat it in socially appropriate ways.\u201d\n\nRebecca Schiller\u2019s Your No Guilt Pregnancy Plan is published by Penguin Life at \u00a314.99.
