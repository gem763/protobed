Here\u2019s a notification for you parents: You\u2019re partly to blame.\n\nStudents, teachers and administrators say parents light up their kids\u2019 phones throughout the day with text messages. Students tell me they feel obligated to reply to their parents quickly, even if the text isn\u2019t urgent.\n\n\u201cOut of all people, you\u2019d think your parents don\u2019t want you on your phone,\u201d said Darya Iranmanesh, a 16-year-old in Lexington, Mass. \u201cMy mother texts me all the time.\u201d\n\nDarya Iranmanesh said her mom, Narges Iranmanesh, frequently texts her during the school day. Photo: Darya Iranmanesh\n\nNarges Iranmanesh, a dentist, usually sends her daughter scheduling reminders but sometimes just wants to check in. \u201cIf she has a headache, I\u2019ll ask if she\u2019s OK and getting enough fluid or I\u2019ll ask, \u2018How was your test?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe admits it is probably a distraction. \u201cI try my best not to do it,\u201d Dr. Iranmanesh said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s at work, I\u2019m at school, why are we texting each other? Like, I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Darya said.\n\nA school-day text exchange between Narges Iranmanesh and her daughter, Darya.

Principal Jarrett Gold added office staff in anticipation of handling more calls from parents who could no longer reach their kids directly. The number of calls didn\u2019t increase, however, suggesting that parents weren\u2019t reaching out to their kids with real emergencies.\n\n\u201cIt was usually, \u2018Uncle Jim is picking you up today, not me,\u2019 and that can wait until 3 p.m.,\u201d Dr. Gold said.\n\nEven before the new policy, the school experimented with having kids place their phones in pouches, and the teachers could hear them buzzing throughout class. They called it \u201cthe beehive.\u201d\n\nWhen teachers glanced at the phones periodically, they noticed a lot of the texts were from parents. Now, students are required to simply keep their phones out of sight\u2014in backpacks or at home\u2014and if they are caught with them, the devices get confiscated.\n\nDr. Gold provided parents at his school with a Q&A about the policy along with research on how distracting phones can be in class. He said the response from parents and kids has been positive. Teachers are reporting that students are more focused in class.\n\nA 2017 study published in the journal \u201cEducational Psychology\u201d found that college students who attended classes where cellphones and other electronic devices were permitted for nonacademic reasons scored lower on exams than students who didn\u2019t have access to devices.\n\nSan Mateo High School in Northern California began locking up all students\u2019 cellphones during the day in pouches to create phone-free spaces.

Dr. Gold said he has heard the same concern. He told parents that the safety and security consulting firm his school works with said that distractibility can be a problem in an active shooter situation and that the best thing students can do in such an emergency is to focus on instructions from their teacher on how to stay safe.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, San Mateo High School decided to lock up students\u2019 cellphones during the day, thinking kids were mostly texting each other. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize how often parents texted their students until they came to a meeting last spring and voiced their concerns,\u201d said Assistant Principal Adam Gelb, explaining that their fears, too, revolved around the possibility of a shooting.\n\nJulia Byrd said she doesn\u2019t expect an immediate response when she texts her daughter, Mia, during the school day. But Mia said she feels pressured to reply right away. Photo: Jen Davis\n\nAfter piloting the phone lockup in 13 classes last year, San Mateo High rolled it out schoolwide this fall. Mr. Gelb said early feedback from teachers indicates students are more engaged during class and more social with each other during lunch. In an anonymous survey of teachers after the first week in session this new year, one teacher said, \u201cThe kids suddenly seem younger. Or rather, maybe they just seem like what kids used to seem like.\u201d\n\nMr. Gelb said the school is being careful to manage parent expectations. In the past he would let calls go to voice mail but now he picks up his phone when he is in his office. \u201cI\u2019ve told the office staff to treat every call like it is an emergency because in the eyes of a parent, it might be,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring Mia Byrd\u2019s freshman and sophomore years in high school, the Montgomery, Texas, 16-year-old texted her mom whenever the fire alarm went off, if it wasn\u2019t clear that it was a drill. She had read that shortly after shooting began at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., a fire alarm went off, sending students into the path of the gunman.\n\n\u201cI got a text from her saying, \u2018There\u2019s a fire alarm. I love you,\u2019 \u201d her mother, Julia Byrd, recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s heartbreaking that she feels she even has to say that.\u201d\n\nMs. Byrd said it is comforting to know that Mia, now a junior, could reach her if she needed to. Still, texting between them isn\u2019t reserved for emergencies. Ms. Byrd, a freelance writer, admits she texts Mia about mundane things more than she should.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cWhen I do text her I\u2019m not necessarily expecting an immediate response,\u201d she said.\n\nUnless she\u2019s at the store.\n\n\u201cMy parents tell me the reason I have a phone is so I can text them and call them. You\u2019re supposed to respond to your parents because if you don\u2019t you\u2019re scared you\u2019ll get in trouble,\u201d said Mia. \u201cShe\u2019ll be in Target and say, \u2018What do you need? Last chance.\u2019\u201d\n\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "description": "Students, teachers and administrators say parents light up their kids\u2019 phones throughout the school day with text messages.", "authors": ["Julie Jargon", "Julie.Jargon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102824/social"}
