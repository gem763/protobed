Apparently not. Welcome to the moral maze of bivalves and eating things with faces ...\n\nI\u2019ve read that it\u2019s OK to eat oysters if you are vegan. Can this really be true?\n\nElia, Ham, Surrey\n\nIs that a trick question, Elia, or are you just having a laugh? Something tells me I\u2019m bound to get into all sorts of bother for even dipping my toes into these particular waters, so here goes nothing.\n\nAt face value, the answer would appear to be an open-and-shut case (#sorrynotsorry). Oysters are bivalves, and as such are clearly much more closely related to the likes of clams than to any plant matter, so they\u2019re animals, right? And The Vegan Society defines a vegan as a person who avoids \u201call animal foods such as meat (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and honey \u2013 as well as avoiding animal-derived materials, products tested on animals and places that use animals for entertainment\u201d, which surely rules out oysters full stop. \u201cVeganism is about rejecting the notion that animals are food or products, therefore we don\u2019t view oysters as something to eat,\u201d a Society spokeswoman confirms. Phew, I\u2019ve no idea why I was worried now. This culinary agony aunting lark is easy: 130 words in, and I\u2019ve already earned my corn. I\u2019m off to the pub \u2026\n\nEr, not so fast, sunshine, because this is where those waters get murky. You see, there is a school of thought that argues the exact opposite, even though that may seem a wildly have-cake-and-eat-it opinion. Far from it, says chef Alexis Gauthier, of Gauthier in Soho, one of the UK\u2019s top vegan-friendly fine dining haunts, complete with a \u00a370 nine-course vegan tasting menu. Gauthier is himself vegan, yet as far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s fine to eat oysters. \u201cYou what?\u201d you may well ask, but let\u2019s hear the man out.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a lovely bunch of coconut conundrums | Kitchen Aide Read more\n\nGauthier takes an \u201ceat nothing with a face\u201d approach to veganism. \u201cFor me, a vegan diet is fundamentally about compassion,\u201d he explains, \u201cand, as current research confirms, oysters are non-sentient beings with no brain or advanced central nervous system, so they\u2019re unable to feel pain. That\u2019s why I\u2019m happy to eat them.\u201d He accepts this view isn\u2019t shared by all, which is why oysters don\u2019t feature on his vegan menus. \u201cThere are plenty of other ingredients to choose from.\u201d\n\nGauthier is not a lone voice, either. It turns out the \u201cAre oysters vegan?\u201d debate has been going on for decades, and while the naysayers are in a clear majority for obvious reasons, there are a surprising number of advocates out there. Chef/restaurateur Jackson Boxer of Brunswick House and Orasay in London is among them: \u201cI\u2019d never dream of foisting oysters on anyone who doesn\u2019t want to eat them for whatever reason, ethical or otherwise,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there is a case for saying they\u2019re less sentient even than trees. Unlike most farming, oysters have a demonstrably beneficial impact on the environment around them, too \u2013 they filter and purify the water, which in turn encourages secondary ecosystems.\u201d\n\nYou might think Boxer would say that, wouldn\u2019t he, considering he\u2019s not a vegan and everything, but this column\u2019s far too cowardly to start pointing fingers at anyone about dietary purity one way or the other \u2013 after all, what we choose to put in our mouths is entirely up to each of us as individuals. As the bioethicist and philosopher Peter Singer put it in 2009: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine [oysters] can feel pain. But if you have doubts about it, don\u2019t eat them.\u201d And vice versa, presumably.\n\nSo, clear as mud then. I now need a lie-down, rather than a pub. Thanks, Elia, I hope you\u2019re pleased with yourself.\n\n\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
