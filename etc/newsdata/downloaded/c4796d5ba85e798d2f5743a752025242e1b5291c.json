Guyger\u2019s lawyers argued she cannot receive a fair trial in Dallas because of \u201cmedia hysteria\u201d and public comments by officials about the shooting. They asked to move the trial to one of several nearby counties \u2013 a request the judge, Tammy Kemp, denied.\n\nSeemingly fearful of public unrest, the Dallas police department told its officers last month that they could not request additional time off during the trial. There were street protests and angry scenes at a city council meeting after Jean\u2019s death.\n\nA Dallas civil rights group, the Next Generation Action Network, plans to hold a rally outside the courthouse on Monday.\n\nThe head of the Dallas police association called for the trial to be delayed on the basis that resources will be stretched by the city hosting the state fair of Texas, a suggestion that Lee Merritt, a lawyer for Jean\u2019s family, described on Twitter as \u201cabsurd and contemptible\u201d.\n\nGuyger, who is white, had finished work on the evening of 6 September last year but was still in uniform when she parked at her apartment building. Jean, a 26-year-old accountant, lived on the floor above her.\n\nIn Guyger\u2019s telling, she parked on the wrong floor after a long and tiring shift and walked into a dark apartment directly above her own, where she encountered Jean and thought he was a burglar. The 31-year-old claims she gave Jean verbal commands that were ignored. She then fired twice, fatally striking him with a bullet to the chest.\n\n\u201cIf it was a white man would it have been different? Would she have reacted differently?\u201d Allison Jean, the victim\u2019s mother, said on the local station KXAS last year.\n\nThe family of Jean, who was born in St Lucia and was active in his local church, have filed a civil lawsuit that questions how Guyger could have missed various details telling her she was in the wrong apartment, such as signs, door numbers and a red floor mat outside the door. The lawsuit alleges she killed Jean \u201cwithout any warning\u201d as he got up from his sofa.\n\nIt also claims Guyger\u2019s conduct reflects inadequate training and fits the department\u2019s \u201cpattern, practice, history and custom of using excessive force against minorities\u201d, citing examples of recent fatal shootings by Dallas police.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Botham Jean pictured in 2017.

Photograph: Jeff Montgomery/AP\n\nActivists and Jean\u2019s family accused police of conducting a biased investigation in the immediate aftermath of his death, treating it akin to an officer-involved shooting of a suspect rather than a civilian killing an innocent victim. It was made public that marijuana was found in Jean\u2019s apartment, which his supporters argue was an attempt to smear him.\n\nAn arrest warrant \u2013 which appears to rely heavily on Guyger\u2019s version of events \u2013 was not issued until three days after the shooting, by which time Dallas police had handed the investigation to Texas rangers. Guyger was initially charged with manslaughter and fired two weeks later. A grand jury indicted her on a murder charge in November.\n\nGuyger was a Dallas police officer for more than four years. She was previously cleared of any wrongdoing after shooting a suspect, who survived, in May 2017. Jean\u2019s lawyers will attempt to depict her as having violent tendencies given that incident and aggressive quotations and memes she allegedly posted on social media, including: \u201cPeople are so ungrateful. No one ever thanks me for having the patience not to kill them.\u201d\n\nGuyger\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue that Jean\u2019s death was a tragic accident and that \u2013 however misguidedly, given the location \u2013 she was acting in self-defense while fearing for her life and using lethal force in a context that is permissible under Texas law. Establishing whether Jean\u2019s door was locked will probably prove important.\n\nA recording of the 911 call made by Guyger was leaked to the local station WFAA in April. Sounding panicked and tearful, Guyger tells the dispatcher: \u201cI\u2019m an off-duty officer. I thought I was in my apartment and I shot a guy thinking he was \u2026 thinking it was my apartment \u2026 I\u2019m fucked. Oh my God, I\u2019m sorry \u2026 I\u2019m going to lose my job.\u201d She repeats the phrase \u201cI thought it was my apartment\u201d more than a dozen times.\n\nA foundation created in Jean\u2019s honor to expand on his missionary work is planning to hold a launch event in Dallas on 29 September, which would have been his 28th birthday.", "description": "Amber Guyger, 26, claims she entered Botham Jean\u2019s apartment by mistake and acted in self-defense, in case that has inflamed racial tensions", "authors": ["Tom Dart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aca955a9092b567b286216b22785b803a82c483/0_170_3785_2271/master/3785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c325f8713a6759d796f7f991900dfe5", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
