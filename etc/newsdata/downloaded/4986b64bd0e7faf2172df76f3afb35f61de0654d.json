But it doesn't compensate for the loss and that he's simply not here any more.\"\n\nHamilton can clinch the drivers' championship at the next race in Mexico in a fortnight's time as he holds a 64-point lead over Bottas.\n\nThe Englishman would need to outscore his teammate by 14 points at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez to seal a third consecutive world title and sixth of his career to close in on Michael Schumacher's all-time record of seven.", "description": "An emotional Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff dedicated his team's historic sixth consecutive world championship double to Formula 1 legend Niki Lauda, who died earlier this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7785/d63faf407884438a909183746da097aa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
