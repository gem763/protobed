The exhibition has the feel of a documentary.\u201d\n\nVisitors to the exhibition first encounter a statue by Breker, who accompanied Hitler on the German dictator\u2019s only visit to Paris in 1940. \u201cIt shows the Nazi concept of the ideal man,\u201d said De Rijk, a former lecturer in design at the Delft University of Technology. \u201cHitler was very interested in design. He hated the communists but he was impressed by their use of flags and such things and said the National Socialists should do better.\u201d\n\nDe Rijk said he had spoken to the protesters before the opening of the exhibition, which falls on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Den Bosch from the Nazis.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey are a group of young people from the Communist party, and we had a long conversation. They are concerned that maybe we are glorifying it all. I would not be doing this if I thought we were, but I can understand that they are aware of that kind of evil in history.\u201d\n\nOn the walls of the exhibition hang swastikas and other symbols from the Nazi era, arranged on the themes of racial purity and lebensraum, the concept of the need for extra living space for the German people.\n\nExhibits have been lent by the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin and the Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte in Munich but neither institution is officially partnering with the museum in Den Bosch because of the sensitivity of the subject.", "description": "Visitors have been asked not to share photographs of exhibits including Arno Breker statue", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d61ea57ff3e4bc01643699c7621da097e757fb2/0_164_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3cc0f5c1cd21da9a3fd9a367f6cdedc", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
