Impossible, you say? Consider the following.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe national polls continue to show that a large majority of millennials have a favorable view of socialism. A near majority favor the \u201ccompassion\u201d of socialism over capitalism which, they argue, is indifferent to the needs of the people, especially those on the bottom rung of the economic ladder.\n\nAvowed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the equally \u201cprogressive\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., continue to run strong in the presidential primaries; their combined support is close to 40% among Democrats polled. (Sanders, 78, suffered a heart attack a week ago but told reporters this week that while his campaigning may be scaled back he is still running strong in his bid for the Democratic nomination and the White House.)\n\nYounger Americans cheer their promises of universal health care and free education, while brushing aside the proposals\u2019 trillion-dollar price tags.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) support government ownership of industries whose products are viewed as \u201cnecessities\u201d (railroads, coal mines, social media, who knows?). They say that, to the greatest extent possible, government should \u201cdemocratize\u201d private businesses \u2014 that is, give control of them to workers.\n\n\u201cSocialism,\u201d says a member of DSA\u2019s national steering committee, \u201cis the democratization of all areas of life, including but not limited to the economy.\u201d So much for the Declaration of Independence and life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nWe must acknowledge that the Great Recession of 2008 tore a huge hole in the American people\u2019s faith in capitalism as the way to a better life and sent them looking for alternatives. Many of them, especially younger Americans, found it in a \u201csoft socialism\u201d that was part welfare state, part administrative state, part socialist state.\n\nWould a majority of millennials choose socialism if in exchange for \u201cfree\u201d education and \u201cfree\u201d health care, they would have to give up their personal property such as their iPhone and their iPad?\n\nWhat is to be done?\n\nWe must educate the rising generation about the true costs of socialism, and not just in dollars and cents. Would a majority of millennials choose socialism if in exchange for \u201cfree\u201d education and \u201cfree\u201d health care, they would have to give up their personal property such as their iPhone and their iPad? This is not simply a possibility -- the abolition of private property is the first dictum of socialism.\n\nWould 7% of millennials be willing to accept communism with its denial of free speech, a free press and free assembly? How about the imprisonment and often execution of dissidents? No open elections? No independent judiciary or rule of law? The dictatorship of the Communist Party in all matters and on all occasions?\n\nIs a world without freedom, without choice, without basic human rights the world that millennials would really willingly choose?\n\nThis is our challenge: to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about socialism \u2014 a pseudo-religion grounded in pseudo-science and enforced by political might.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThis is our obligation to this generation and generations to come: to make the case against socialism, a god that failed, a science that never was, a political system headed for the ash heap of history.\n\nHistorian Lee Edwards, Ph.D., is the Distinguished Fellow in Conservative Thought at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s B.
