Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money,\" Dorsey continued.\n\nThe ban will go into place in November.\n\nDorsey wrote, \"We\u2019re well aware we\u2018re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\"\n\nTwitter's recent decision differentiates itself from other companies that have resisted the push to stop taking political ads. Facebook is currently in a debate over the spread of misinformation through ads from political campaigns.\n\nThe social media company has reiterated it does not think it should be the gatekeeper of political speech. Several hundred Facebook employees have noted their disagreement with the decision in a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg was recently testifying on Capitol Hill, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked him if she could \u201crun advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably\u201d was one of Zuckerberg responses.\n\n\u201cI mean, if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added.\n\nDorsey clarified details about Twitter's thoughts behind the decision, stating that the company \"considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too.\"\n\n\"A final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address,\" Dorsey concluded.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in on Twitter, saying \"This is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world. What say you, Facebook?\"", "description": "\"We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, in a tweetstorm Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/07/26/USAT/74b037e8-3bd4-4792-9f91-0ef5e78acd33-AFP_AFP_1HB8N8.JPG?crop=1876,1055,x1106,y994&width=1609&height=1055&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
