In the story, Cox tells how MPC \u2014 a now-seemingly defunct company that apparently sold phones, tablets, and computers running custom firmware with significant encryption protections \u2014 was ultimately controlled by two at-large criminal kingpins known as The Brothers.\n\nAs Cox\u2019s reporting explains, The Brothers apparently first bought and used encrypted BlackBerrys before hiring developers to make a custom operating system that could theoretically offer them even more privacy and loaded it on phones. The story doesn\u2019t say what type of phones The Brothers use(d), but MPC sold Nexus 5 and 5X phones loaded with a custom OS, which seems likely to be the same one paid for by The Brothers.\n\nMPC even marketed itself to privacy-conscious customers to appear more legit, using images of Edward Snowden in its marketing, for example. MPC also offered to pay Cox to do a paid evaluation of an MPC device. (Cox declined to take payment, though he expressed potential interest in getting more details from the company. MPC never sent a device to him.)\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating and, at times, horrifying story (warning: it describes a murder), but you should go read it.", "description": "MPC, a company that sold encrypted devices, was actually run by criminal enterprise, as chronicled by Vice\u2019s Joseph Cox in this fascinating story.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8EhH0rYSwMveMcUwOK-7v_NNz4=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8792129/acastro_170621_1777_0008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
