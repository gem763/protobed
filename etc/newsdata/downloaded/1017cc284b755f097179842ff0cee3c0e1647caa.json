Juncker says he will recommend EU leaders approve the deal, but the outlook for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is far less certain. With the Oct. 31 deadline ticking closer, Johnson hopes to get the agreement approved in an extraordinary session of the British parliament this Saturday (the first Saturday session since the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982). You may recall that Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May also took deals to Parliament and was defeated \u2014 three times. Johnson has no majority in the 650-seat parliament, and in practice needs 320 votes to get a deal ratified. So far, the Northern Irish party he needs to do that has refused to support it. That was enough to take the edge off the markets\u2019 initial euphoria. The pound that spiked more than 1% on the news, nearing the US$1.30 mark, has since trimmed some of those gains.\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Where there is a will, there is a #deal \u2013 we have one!

Oxford Economics says in a report that it has a darker view than the International Monetary Fund for 2020. Its economists see global growth at 2.5% both this year and next, well below the IMF\u2019s forecast of 3% and 3.4% \u2014 and the weakest performance since the eurozone crisis in 2012. Unlike the IMF, Oxford thinks the worst of the world\u2019s industrial and trade weakness is yet to come, with uncertainty over the U.S., China trade dispute causing companies to be cautious about investment and hiring. It also suspects that the impact of monetary policy loosening will be less than the IMF thinks. Oxford says while it is more pessimistic than the IMF, there is \u201csound justifications\u201d for the world avoiding a recession. \u201cStill, risks are skewed to the downside, so we estimate a 30% probability of a global recession in 2020.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know this morning:\n\nCIX startup conference continues in Toronto\n\nEnergy Minister Sonya Savage holds a media conference in Edmonton to discuss legislative amendments that will restore investor confidence in Alberta\u2019s electricity market\n\nPremier John Horgan and Ravi Kahlon, parliamentary secretary for forests, lands, natural resource operations and rural development, hold a press conference in Vancouver with representatives from Pinnacle Renewable Energy and Mitsui & Co.

The country produced 70% of world supply in 2018 and controls 36.6% of reserves, giving it powerful sway over prices. Rare earths could also become a substantial weapon in the U.S., China trade wars, writes the Financial Post\u2019s Gabriel Friedman. That idea was hinted at earlier this year when Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by a trade negotiator, visited a rare earth magnet factory for a photo op.\n\n\u2014 Please send your news, comments and stories to pheaven@postmedia.com. \u2014 Pamela Heaven @pamheaven\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
