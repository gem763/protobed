Of course it can,\u201d Macri said to cheers at the first of 30 planned \u201cYes, we can\u201d marches ahead of the Oct. 27 vote.\n\n\u201cWe are going to defend the country that we all want together,\u201d Macri said, promising that economic growth and jobs were coming if voters would stick with him.\n\nThe odds, however, are against him. Macri was trounced by 16 points in a primary election in August and pollsters have him even further behind main rival Alberto Fernandez, a result that would hand the Peronist challenger an easy win next month.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of Macri coming back and winning is so small that no-one is talking about it,\u201d said Guido Chamorro, a portfolio manager for Pictet Asset Management in London.\n\n\u201cWe have had a lot of surprises with elections, but that would be the biggest surprise of the year for emerging markets.\u201d\n\nReading the elections is key as global trade partners and investors position themselves to deal with likely political upheaval in Latin America\u2019s No. 3 economy, a key grains exporter that is juggling debt obligations with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), amid concerns about default.\n\nThe shock result in the primaries - a good barometer of the likely general election outcome - upended what many had seen as a close election race. Argentine markets crumbled the day after the Aug. 11 vote on fears of political turmoil ahead.\n\nMacri was forced to roll out measures, including capital controls to protect the peso currency, and announce plans to renegotiate the country\u2019s debts - policies many saw as a recognition from Macri that his race was already run.\n\n\u201cThese measures were already anticipated to be adopted by an eventual Fernandez administration,\u201d a person familiar with policymaking at Argentina\u2019s central bank said, adding the bank had shifted to damage control mode after the primary.\n\nA spokesman for the president\u2019s office reiterated Macri was in the election race to win. \u201cNot only did more than 100,000 people accompany President Macri at this start of the campaign, but we showed that we are more united than ever and we will win the election,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nA central bank spokesman said the institution was an \u201cindependent body\u201d and that \u201cwhat it always did and does is care for the stability of the Argentine economy.\u201d\n\n\u2018REVERSING THE RESULT\u2019\n\nWith sluggish growth, inflation over 50% and rising poverty, Macri\u2019s bid for reelection was never going to be easy.\n\nBut in a country that once famously cycled through five presidents in two weeks, political analysts cautioned that the number one rule in Argentine politics was that anything was possible.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t 100% rule out the possibility that there is some unexpected development and Macri makes it to a second round,\u201d said Megan Cook, a Buenos Aires-based political and regulatory risk expert at advisory Cefeidas Group.\n\n\u201cBut I think it is incredibly unlikely.\u201d\n\nIf Fernandez gets over 45% of the vote or over 40% with a 10-point lead over Macri, he would win outright in the first round, without the need for a second round run-off. The primary election result suggests that is the likely outcome.\n\nThere is, however, some margin for doubt, analysts said. And even a more positive showing could have an impact, helping to give Macri\u2019s coalition more voice in Congress even if he loses.\n\nThere are about 385,000 votes up for grabs from Argentines living abroad who are not eligible to vote in the primary. Some supporters may have skipped the primaries, while others could switch votes to Macri from fringe candidates.\n\nIt also would not be Macri\u2019s first comeback. He lost by an 8-point gap in the 2015 primary election, closing that gap in the first round and then triumphing in the head-to-head.\n\nSome Macri voters, like Guillermo Eugenio Bansas, 65, are also not ready to accept defeat.\n\n\u201cI think he can turn it around. Look at this... it\u2019s a beautiful day. We could be anywhere else, but we are here,\u201d Eugenio Bansas told Reuters at the Saturday march.\n\nMacri\u2019s backers added recent economic turmoil could harden fears about potential interventionist policies under Fernandez and his running mate, divisive populist ex-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. The two are not related.\n\nCongressman Eduardo Amadeo, a member of Macri\u2019s party, said concerns about the \u201cdangers\u201d of Kirchnerism - referring to policies under Fernandez de Kirchner and her late husband Nestor Kirchner - would play into the Macri\u2019s favour.\n\n\u201cThe marches the president is launching now will put emphasis on people\u2019s values, and we believe that this will be positive when it\u2019s time to vote,\u201d Amadeo added.", "description": "Argentina's embattled President Mauricio Macri took to the streets on Saturday with a defiant message: \"Yes we can,\" he told crowds of supporters in Buenos Aires as he looks to launch an unlikely comeback ahead of general elections next month.", "authors": ["Cassandra Garrison", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435395210&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T076", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
