(Eve Edelheit/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u201cWell said, well said,\u201d Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) noted with a chuckle after a town hall audience member called President Trump \u201cmentally retarded\u201d in early September. Harris later apologized for condoning the discriminatory, ableist remark, but such rhetoric actually typifies many criticisms directed at Trump in the spirit of the tagline \u201cThis Is Not Normal.\u201d\n\nAs attorney George Conway recently wrote in the Atlantic, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something\u2019s very seriously off with Trump.\u201d Conway labeled Trump \u201cunfit\u201d for office and supported his impeachment.\n\nConway\u2019s judgment stems from Trump\u2019s erratic behavior, which only seems to increase by the day. But while critics often denounce Trump\u2019s policies, his flouting of norms and his personal tweet-driven style as products of his perceived deficiencies, racist appeals, praise for dictators, alleged corruption and support for right-wing conspiracy theories are not mental illnesses. Casting Trump as ill or disabled therefore has the twin effects of minimizing his ideological motivations and portraying all people with mental illness as harmful or deficient.\n\nIndeed, a tendency to focus on Trump\u2019s supposedly deficient body and mind \u2014 apparent in discussions of not only his mental capacity but also his weight, hair or even spray tan \u2014 only reinforces the stigmas facing those who\u2019ve suffered most acutely under Trump\u2019s rule: namely women, people of color, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities. By pathologizing and body-shaming the president, many of his critics harness and mobilize deeply entrenched prejudices rather than challenging them.\n\nAmericans have long looked to men\u2019s health \u2014 both physical and mental \u2014 as indicative of their ability to lead. Lore about presidential fitness is often used to bolster ideas about a political figure\u2019s internal character. Think, for instance, of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s rugged masculinity, Gerald Ford\u2019s daily swimming routine, Bill Clinton\u2019s jogs and George W. Bush\u2019s runs on his Air Force One treadmill. However, these stories often obscure a more significant truth \u2014 no president has perfectly embodied the norm of vitality expected of presidents.\n\nAnd in fact, the mythology surrounding presidents\u2019 physical abilities has actually concealed the neurodiversity of U.S. leaders \u2014 that is, the range of neurological and mental-health characteristics they\u2019ve exhibited. Scholars believe that Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s appetite for adventure may have been a symptom of his bipolar disorder, for example. And he was not the only president with an apparent mental illness: Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the country\u2019s most revered president, grappled with major depression for much of his adult life. That \u201cmelancholy,\u201d author Joshua Wolf Shenk argues, bestowed upon Lincoln unique insights that helped him steer the nation through the Civil War. Indeed, research has demonstrated that about half of the presidents who served between 1776 and 1974 showed signs of mental illness.\n\nA similar story swirls around physical impairments: Observers often interpreted John F. Kennedy\u2019s tan as a \u201csign of vigor,\u201d but it was actually a byproduct of Addison\u2019s disease, an endocrine disorder that Kennedy hid from the public. While Kennedy was lionized for his dynamism, masculinity and fitness, he actually suffered from serious medical conditions, including chronic back pain, colitis, ulcers and urinary tract infections. Similarly, even though he served more than 12 years in office, many Americans never knew that Franklin Roosevelt could not walk.\n\nPresidents and presidential hopefuls are less than forthcoming about their maladies because any sign of perceived physical or psychological weakness \u2014 historically or today \u2014 might embolden one\u2019s political opponents. Dating to the earliest days of the republic, those trying to disparage male political leaders have often questioned their masculinity or made veiled (or not-so-veiled) comments about their sexuality. During the 1800 election between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, the influential journalist James Callender called Adams \u201ca hideous hermaphroditical character.\u201d Following the Civil War, critics of Jefferson Davis often depicted him in a dress to humiliate him. And during the 2004 presidential contest, supporters of George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney coded their challengers John F. Kerry and John Edwards as emasculated Francophonic fancy lads (with \u201cBreck Girl\u201d hair), whose weakness might undermine national security.\n\nThe implication that mental instability, gender \u201cconfusion\u201d or non-normative sexuality could sully a person\u2019s moral character has persisted. In 2015, retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel Ralph Peters insisted on Fox News that President Barack Obama \u201cis just not manly\u201d enough to pursue and stamp out the Islamic State.\n\nHighlighting Trump\u2019s presumed mental, intellectual and masculine deficiencies follows in this tradition. But when armchair psychologists contend that Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and incendiary rhetoric can be linked to an undiagnosed neurosyphilis ravaging his body and brain, or that his behavior suggests dementia, they are reproducing ugly tropes that have long been used to discount the contributions of people with disabilities.\n\nConsider, for example, the controversy that surrounded 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. His strident proclamations regarding \u201claw and order,\u201d fiscal conservatism and the use of military force alarmed many observers, including those in the psychiatric community.\n\nActing on these sentiments, Fact magazine surveyed members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) about Goldwater\u2019s mental state. The magazine implied that Goldwater\u2019s supposed instability stemmed, in part, from his father\u2019s homosexuality. After Goldwater sued Fact, the APA began prohibiting its members from diagnosing individuals without an in-person evaluation. This restriction became known as the Goldwater rule, though it did not prevent over 70,000 self-proclaimed mental-health professionals from signing an online petition affirming \u201cthat Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States.\u201d\n\nMarshaling the harmful idea that Trump\u2019s flaws derive from presumed psychological abnormalities, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) has pushed for legislation mandating the presence of a psychiatrist in the White House at all times, while Reps. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) have looked to establish oversight committees that could evaluate a president\u2019s fitness for office and trigger the 25th Amendment, removing them from office if deemed unfit.\n\nSuch actions rest on the flawed notion that disability and effective leadership are incompatible \u2014 a premise disproved by the likes of both Roosevelts and Lincoln. Further, plenty of politicians who adhered to certain leadership norms have supported policies and tropes that have been detrimental to women, people of color, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities.\n\nDiscrediting Trump because he is purportedly abnormal or disabled does little to stall his rise and rather feeds the idea that neurodiversity and \u201cunmasculine\u201d behavior are at odds with the norms and ideals of the presidential office. Trump himself has often made use of fat-shaming, sexism and derogatory language toward people with disabilities for political gain. He has promoted the dangerous idea that gun violence stems primarily from mental illness and that people with mental disabilities (whom he has called \u201cmonsters\u201d) should be surveilled and even institutionalized. The president\u2019s opponents capitulate to his proclivity for strongman leadership and fuel the marginalization of vulnerable people when they link danger and disability and stress Trump\u2019s failure to behave as an idealized, normative male leader.\n\nInstead, critics and Democratic presidential candidates ought to emphasize the need for structural change that serves women, people of color, LGBTQ people and populations with disabilities \u2014 universal health care, demilitarization and dismantling the carceral state. Candidates must look beyond rhetorical strategies that strike at surface-level stigmas and instead listen to the marginalized peoples whose identities and conditions are so often weaponized by Trump and his opponents.", "description": "Calling the president mentally ill only hurts vulnerable people.", "authors": ["Byrd Mcdaniel", "Paul M.
