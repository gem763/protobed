The money will be distributed to 10 families in increments of $1,000 per month as a way of highlighting Yang\u2019s signature campaign promise, the implementation of a universal basic income. That plan, which Yang has dubbed the \"Freedom Dividend,\" would provide every citizen over the age of 18 with $1,000 a month.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt's the latest unconventional move for the outsider candidate who has defied expectations and moved ahead of experienced politicians like Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. Many presidential candidates promise financial benefits if voters elect them but few promise random people money before any votes are cast.\n\nBut the raffle has the potential to bring both attention to his platform and collect new contact information of potential supporters, in addition to the cash.\n\nYang has said his universal basic income plan is needed to help people adapt to the disruption caused by emerging technologies and automation. The 44-year-old entrepreneur argues that this era of technological innovation is so transformative that new careers will not reemerge quickly.\n\n", "description": "Yang will announce the online raffle in his opening statement.", "authors": ["Alex Thompson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0f/eb/6be34db64526b307e6fa7e95beb9/190826-andrew-yang-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
