With runners on first and second and one out, Holbrook called the infield fly rule - Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma drifted back and called for the ball, but veered off at the last second and it dropped in front of left fielder Matt Holliday.\n\nBraves fans littered the field with debris and the game was delayed for 19 minutes. Atlanta didn\u2019t score in the inning and lost 6-3 in what turned out to be Chipper Jones\u2019 last game.\n\nThe Braves filed a protest, which MLB executive Joe Torre immediately denied.\n\nHolbrook\u2019s crew for the NLDS that begins at SunTrust Park includes Tom Hallion, Jim Wolf, Ed Hickox, Pat Hoberg and Alan Porter.\n\nThe playoffs start Tuesday night when Milwaukee visits Washington in the NL wild-card game.
