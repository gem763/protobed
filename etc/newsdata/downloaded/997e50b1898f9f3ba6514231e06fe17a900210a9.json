That says a lot about how Nick Cave has transformed himself over the last 12 months. Previously an entertaining but guarded interviewee, he has, more or less, thrown himself open to the public. His website began with Cave posting the words \u201cYou can ask me anything\u201d online. He\u2019s subsequently answered dozens of fans\u2019 questions, from the trivial to the metaphysical, eloquently and at length.\n\nHis most recent tour was effectively its live incarnation, based around an audience Q&A, conducted without a moderator. Anyone who has attended an artist Q&A where a particularly banzai fan has ended up in possession of the microphone knows what a bold high-wire act that is. The accidental death of his son Arthur in 2016, he said, has led him to \u201csee people in a different way\u201d, giving him \u201ca deep feeling toward other people and an absolute understanding of their suffering\u201d.\n\nAnd yet, for all his new-found empathy and openness, some things about Nick Cave remain enigmatic. What, for example, are we supposed to make of Ghosteen\u2019s cover, a kitschy, fairytale landscape illustration that looks not unlike one of those leaflets Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses hand out at shopping centres? His description of the album is also pretty gnomic: the eight songs on the first album are \u201cthe children\u201d; the two lengthy tracks and spoken word piece on album two are \u201ctheir parents\u201d.\n\nAnyone seeking a more prosaic description of Ghosteen\u2019s contents might note that, sonically, it continues and extends the weightless, drifting style of its two predecessors. It\u2019s not entirely clear how Bad Seeds drummer Thomas Wydler passed his time in the studio, given that this time around, there are virtually no rhythms \u2013 with the more punishing of Warren Ellis\u2019s tape loops and electronics replaced by warm analogue synthesiser that gives proceedings a faintly proggy feel. Indeed, Ghosteen occasionally feels like an infinitely warmer, sweeter sibling of 2016\u2019s Skeleton Tree. While that album forced its most beautiful melodies to pick their way gingerly through minefields of explosive noise and eerie, discordant soundscapes - or to submit to Cave singing them in an alarmingly parched, numb voice \u2013 here they\u2019re bolstered by soft, pillowy harmonies and stately piano. Cave\u2019s voice, meanwhile, sounds rich. At an age when singers tend to start losing some of their range, his appears to be getting wider: it\u2019s hard to imagine the twentysomething who snarled and howled his way through Saint Huck or Your Funeral My Trial daring to attain the high notes he achieves on The Spinning Song.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artwork for Ghosteen by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Photograph: Ghosteen Ltd\n\nThe result is perhaps the most straightforwardly beautiful set of songs that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have ever recorded, which fits with the album\u2019s lyrical themes. When you listen to Ghosteen, the \u201cchildren\u201d/ \u201cparents\u201d description makes sense. Cave has talked about how his son\u2019s death altered his work, how he found a way to \u201cwrite beyond the trauma \u2026 to propel [myself] beyond the personal into a state of wonder\u201d. And, despite the appearance of regular Cave themes \u2013 the first thing you hear is him invoking Vegas-era Elvis \u2013 Ghosteen appears to depict that process. For all the cinematic attractiveness of their arrangements and the title track\u2019s opening meditation on the beauty of the world, the long songs on album two seem darker in tone, filled with sleepless nights, departures and desperate fantasies of escape: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for peace to come,\u201d repeats one ambiguous line in Hollywood. The songs on album one, meanwhile, sound like the result of working through those emotions: lighter, calmer, concerned with empathy and faith. You feel the shift most clearly on Sun Forest, in which Cave does his patented apocalyptic thing \u2013 screaming horses, burning trees, hanging bodies, Jesus mad with grief \u2013 before the lyric suddenly flips \u2013 \u201cthe past pulls away and the future begins and I say goodbye to all that, / and the future rolls in like a wave\u2026 and the past, with its savage undertow, lets go\u201d \u2013 and ends up exhorting the listener: \u201cCome on, everyone!\u201d\n\nMost listeners seemed to take Skeleton Tree as an extended treatise on grief, ignoring Cave\u2019s insistence that the songs predated the loss they were presumed to be about. In fairness, you could see why, given how bleak and disturbing it sounded. But if Ghosteen is the album people supposed its predecessor to be, it sounds like nothing like you might expect of an album informed by tragedy.\n\nOn one level, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that it\u2019s as good as it is: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have been in a career-high purple patch since the last double album they released, 2004\u2019s Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus. Nevertheless, listening to Ghosteen, it\u2019s very hard indeed not to be taken aback.", "description": "Cave\u2019s voice is richer than ever on this stunning double album that sets desperation against empathy and faith", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3dbba73d368788fb744d8cb97daf2ae0ba2ec1a/278_468_2641_1584/master/2641.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8ef21ad3d074d7085f7744b8d9e568fb", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
