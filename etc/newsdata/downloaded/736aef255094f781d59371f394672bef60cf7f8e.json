It's just too much.\"\n\nAnother man, who does not want to be named, said he regrets his recent move to the area.\n\nHe said: \"After reading what's going on round here, I'm starting to regret it.\n\n\"It appears to be Jeremy Kyle contestants central.\"\n\n(Image: Jon Corken/Grimsby Live)\n\nMarilyn Leeson, who has been living in the area for 13 years says she's lucky to not be directly affected but she knows people who are.\n\n\"I think most people have had enough,\" she said.\n\nInspector Tony Towse, who heads the Hull East Neighbourhood Team at Humberside Police, said officers are \"aware of the concerns from our community regarding crime and disorder in the Victoria Dock area of Hull\".\n\n\"We treat all reports seriously and the Hull East Neighbourhood Team are working in the Victoria Dock area to prevent further issues and tackle those responsible,\" he said.\n\n\"I want to stress that people should not take action themselves but to call us immediately so we can deal with incidents.\"\n\nPolice are encouraging anyone to report neighbourhood crime or issues by calling 101.
