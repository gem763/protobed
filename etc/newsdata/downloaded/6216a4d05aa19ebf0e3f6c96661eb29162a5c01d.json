Louis Browne, 27, worked on the estate\u2019s construction and was fortunate enough to secure a two-bedroom house, which he shares with his partner, Chloe, and daughter, Nevaeh.\n\n\u2018This should be the example for councils everywhere,\u2019 he says.\n\nThe houses are built to strict Passivhaus environmental standards. This means more than 60cm-thick walls, triple glazing and no openings (letterboxes are situated next to the front doors).\n\nIt might sound stifling but, not only are these homes incredibly quiet \u2014 \u2018you can\u2019t hear a sound from outside when the windows are closed,\u2019 says Louis \u2014 they also get ample natural light, even on dull days, because of the low-rise scale of the three-street estate, its south-facing orientation and the shallow roof angles.\n\nOn the market... best in show Norfolk: This four-bed house in Ringstead, two miles from the coast, was converted from a 19th-century barn and has been nominated for a design award.

A wide landscaped area, suited to community gatherings, runs through the middle of the estate.\n\nThese recreational spaces avoid the need to cross roads, and parking has been moved to the edges of the estate, meaning the streets are primarily given over to people. It\u2019s a microcosm of a different era, when children could roam safely.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the estate is the range of occupants, from young to old, nurses to metalworkers, and larger families to sole occupants.\n\nOne single woman with a chronic health condition speaks of her \u2018love at first sight\u2019 upon seeing the flat that has proved transformational for her health.\n\nGoldsmith Street took six years to complete and a \u00a317 million budget, equating to \u00a32,200 per square metre.\n\nGail Harris, Norwich City Council\u2019s cabinet member for social housing, says: \u2018It shows councils can do great affordable housing despite the financial constraints.\u2019\n\nWill there be more? \u2018That\u2019s the plan.\u2019", "description": "What makes this huddle of around 100 houses and flats in Goldsmith Street, Norwich, so special - and why might it have implications for the rest of us?", "authors": ["Daniel Pembrey For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20182574-0-image-a-35_1572012723299.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
