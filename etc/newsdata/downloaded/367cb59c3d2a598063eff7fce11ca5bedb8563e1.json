I should have understood it then, and I never should have done it.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he considered ending his reelection bid in light of the publication of photos and a video showing him wearing blackface, Trudeau was resolute.\n\n\u201cI will continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way,\u201d Trudeau responded while acknowledging that the blackface photos might cause some voters to pull their support for him. \u201cCanadians have an important choice to make on Oct. 21. I trust Canadians to make the right choice.\u201d\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday.

A second photo published by Time showed Trudeau wearing blackface in a high school talent show. A third instance emerged Thursday, when the Global News published a grainy video taken in the early 1990s of Trudeau laughing and gesturing at a camera while wearing blackface, a T-shirt and ripped jeans.\n\nAsked if he was certain that other photos or videos of him wearing blackface would yet be made public, Trudeau chose his words carefully.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I don\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with this discrimination every day. I shared the moments that I recollected. I recognize that this is absolutely unacceptable to do.\u201d\n\nThe scandal erupted one week after Trudeau, the head of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party, kicked off his reelection campaign. On Thursday, he made the case that since being elected prime minister, he has learned to relate to the struggles of \u201cracialized communities\u201d in Canada.\n\n\u201cI have dedicated my service to Canada to combat intolerance and racism whenever I can,\u201d the prime minister said. At the same time, however, Trudeau acknowledged that his own behavior was part of the problem. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that from the layers of privilege I have. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged his own \"privilege\" as a factor in his decision to don blackface costumes.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lDnDZmTDlBhljIGEPALfnQ--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/8e142fe0-db13-11e9-beff-440224573c21", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
