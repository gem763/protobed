Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy,\" said Warren, a Massachusetts senator who has emerged as a leading Democratic presidential contender.\n\nThe crowd's \"enthusiasm and size testified to her campaign's growing strength,\" the Reuters news service observed.\n\nMany held up signs saying, \"I'm a Warren Democrat,\" Reuters noted.\n\nLarge and boisterous crowd at rally for Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren in Washington Square Park in New York City on September 16, 2019 LUCAS JACKSON / REUTERS\n\nWhile aggressive, Warren's message was a familiar one. She's embraced corruption as a central campaign theme from the beginning of her 2020 presidential bid. But rarely has Warren addressed such a crowd with such a symbolic backdrop.\n\nThe crowd filled almost all of the 10-acre Washington Square Park, wrapping around a massive fountain and clogging the pathways that connect the street chess games to the classrooms of New York University and to the giant marble arch the downtown park is best known for.\n\nIt was a younger audience, racially diverse and packed with women. One of the biggest applause lines of the night: \"We're not here tonight because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we're not here because of men at all.\"\n\nU.S. Senator and democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren speaks at Washington Square Park in New York, New York, U.S. September 16, 2019. LUCAS JACKSON / REUTERS\n\nThe event was set close to the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire, which killed more than 140 workers in 1911.\n\nShe framed those deaths as the direct result of corruption. Many women died because factory owners neglected safety features to save money, with the implicit support of local elected officials who declined to intervene.\n\nWarren charged that the same thing is happening today.\n\n\"Giant corporations have bought off our government,\" she said.\n\nSpecifically, her anti-corruption plan would \"end lobbying as we know it\" by instituting a lifetime ban on members of Congress and White House Cabinet secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists. At the same time, corporate lobbyists would be blocked from working for the federal government.\n\nBoth practices are common today.\n\nShe also would prohibit federal judges from avoiding misconduct investigations by leaving their posts, prevent courts from sealing settlements in public health and safety cases and ban class-action waivers for all cases involving employment, consumer protection, antitrust and civil rights.\n\nAnd taking direct aim at issues involving the Trump administration, Warren would require candidates for public office to post their tax returns online. Presidents, Cabinet secretaries and members of Congress would also be prohibited from owning businesses on the side.\n\nMr. Trump, of course, has refused to release his tax returns years after promising to do so, and the Trump organization continues to do business around the world.\n\n\"Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh,\" Warren said. \"He is sworn to serve the people of the United States, but he serves only himself and his partners in corruption.\" Warren noted, however, that the president is only a symptom of the corruption that has infected the U.S. political and economic systems.\n\nWarren has long argued that the nation's modern government only works for \"the wealthy and the well-connected\" such as big energy, health care and insurance companies that employ lobbyists to advance their priorities over the best interests of ordinary citizens.\n\nShe wrote that popular policies championed by the Democratic Party's progressive wing - and many in its crowded field of presidential hopefuls - like universal child care, an overhaul of the federal criminal justice system, gun reform and plans to promote affordable housing have been \"stymied because giant corporations and billionaires who don't want to pay taxes or follow any rules use their money and influence to stand in the way.\"\n\nWarren's campaign noted that she already proposed a series of anti-corruption measures in Congress last year, but it says the proposal released Monday goes further.\n\nWarren has emerged as a central player in the broader fight for the direction of the Democratic Party in the age of Trump.\n\nLike her Democratic rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Warren is demanding transformational change that Mr. Trump and his allies deride as socialism. Warren and Sanders are up against Democratic front-runner and former Vice President and Delaware Senator Joe Biden, a favorite of the party's establishment wing.\n\nWarren didn't identify any of her Democratic opponents by name.\n\nShe noted, however, that \"too many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Warren was endorsed by the Working Families Party (WFP), described by Reuters as \"a progressive group with rising political influence\" that supported Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 White House run.\n\nReuters says the endorsement \"could boost Warren's chances of positioning herself, rather than Sanders, as the liberal alternative\" to Biden.\n\nWarren doesn't participate in high-dollar fundraising events as a 2020 candidate, though she did before launching her presidential campaign.\n\nOn Monday, looking out at the swelling crowd, Warren noted that she typically takes selfies with everyone who wants one at her events.\n\n\"Tonight is a little something different,\" Warren said.", "description": "Tells thousands in cheering New York City crowd seen as sign of campaign's growing strength that corruption \"is breaking or democracy\" and details her plans to combat it", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/1d532e2c-c673-4389-acd6-456165d99d8c/thumbnail/1200x630/2b9f83c1078fe56fba4585c5ac027935/2019-09-17t003333z-631554271-rc1e0c96a920-rtrmadp-3-usa-election-warren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
