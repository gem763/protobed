He decided to rein back on the tough taskmaster act, stop highlighting his players\u2019 microscopic faults and focus on the positives.\n\nThe Manchester City manager, whose side are eight points behind Liverpool at the top of the table, predicted problems if he didn\u2019t change. He knew there were potential pitfalls of a fourth season with largely the same set of players listening to largely the same set of methods. How to hold his players\u2019 attention topped his concerns.\n\nBut the reboot has faltered. Their two defeats \u2014 at Norwich and against Wolves \u2014 were shocking as results in isolation. But the performances have not hit the heights of last term. That seems strange to say given that they bludgeoned eight past Watford, but it is true.\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola predicted problems if he didn\u2019t change this summer\n\nGuardiola noticed this early on and almost immediately rowed back on his calmer character act. Zen is not really in his make-up during the heat of battle, which may explain why he has never had the energy to go beyond a fourth year managing at the same club.\n\nHe felt there was a slackening tempo in matches and even after the 5-0 opening-day win at West Ham chose to criticise City\u2019s sluggish start. Those in the room were aghast at that comment but the Spaniard was on to something.\n\nWhile observers were astonished that Tottenham escaped with a 2-2 draw from the Etihad a week later, Guardiola privately told his players that they were not sharp enough.\n\nDavid Silva was introduced with 12 minutes left that day with the scores level. Arguably the club\u2019s greatest-ever player could not turn the game. Guardiola said to him in the dressing room: \u2018David, you didn\u2019t give us enough running. Where were the legs?\u2019 Analysts had identified a drop in Silva\u2019s physical statistics towards the end of the 2017-18 season and they are still searching for an alternative plan.\n\nGuardiola knew there were potential pitfalls of a fourth season with the same set of players\n\nSo Guardiola is back to his bristling best, which the players actually respond to. But that doesn\u2019t mean there hasn\u2019t been a subconscious drop-off as Guardiola feared. As one source told Sportsmail \u2018there is always one player who loses concentration.\u2019\n\nBut Guardiola has also been hit by problems not of his making.\n\nLosing Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte through knee injuries were hammer blows. Laporte\u2019s absence is even more painful after City refused to meet the asking price for Harry Maguire. Nicolas Otamendi\u2019s calamitous display on Sunday only intensified that. In Sane they have lost the sort of unpredictability that might have opened Wolves up.\n\nThen there is the absence of Vincent Kompany\u2019s leadership. David Silva wears the armband but does not have the same qualities.\n\nTime is needed for \u00a363m signing Rodri to fully grasp the defensive basics of this system\n\nBut Kompany is also missed for his playing abilities. He and Laporte were the heart of defence, while Fernandinho held the midfield. Fernandinho is now trying to prop up Otamendi at the back instead, although the Argentine needs a defensive partner with more pace.\n\nRodri is attempting to fill Fernandinho\u2019s boots as the holding midfielder but there is an acceptance that time is needed for the \u00a363million summer signing to fully grasp the defensive basics of this system.\n\nRodri was used to playing with someone next to him at Atletico Madrid and has often been caught pressing balls when he ought to sit in front of his defenders. Assistant manager Mikel Arteta is working tirelessly to correct the 23-year-old\u2019s positioning.\n\nGuardiola has been reluctant to use 19-year-old Phil Foden despite his much-needed qualities\n\nWhat is not working is using Ilkay Gundogan alongside David Silva as attacking midfielders. Gundogan appears more suited to operating deeper. Guardiola, as ever, has tinkered with formations in a quest to recapture their fluidity.\n\nOne option they have been reluctant to use is Phil Foden, who sits unused on the bench. But Guardiola has become annoyed at the criticism levelled at him for that.\n\nFoden is 19. As a reference point at Barcelona, Sergio Busquets did not make his debut until he was 20. Andres Iniesta didn\u2019t make more than 10 La Liga starts in a season until he was 20. Only at the age of 22 did he start more than 20 league matches. Even so, Foden\u2019s willingness to break the lines could be utilised more often.\n\nOff the field, personal issues have plagued the injured John Stones, while Kyle Walker has been so desperate to fend off Joao Cancelo at right back and play his way into form that he battled on with a stomach infection. There is also a sense of injustice at Bernardo Silva being charged by the FA for his tweet aimed at Benjamin Mendy. Guardiola didn\u2019t see the social media storm coming but he did predict all might not be rosy in the City garden.", "description": "During the summer, Pep Guardiola came up with a plan.
