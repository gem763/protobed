Lots and lots of compromise and a fair amount of blur.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is now available for Switch. On the tiny console, the lighting is flat, the textures are rough, and the game looks like it was filmed by a camera with vaseline smeared on the lens. Compared to the PC version running at 1080p on a modestly powerful gaming laptop, the Switch version running at a docked 720p looks downright shabby.\n\nJudged solely as a Switch game \u2014 that is to say a resource-intensive PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 game scaled down to run on what\u2019s essentially a souped-up Nvidia Tegra Android tablet \u2014 The Witcher 3 is actually pretty impressive. God rays from the sky filter through the windblown trees. Shadows dance across the ground. The world feels alive, packed with people, creatures and fauna.\n\nMore importantly, the game runs well. Thanks to dynamic resolution scaling, The Witcher 3 on Switch maintains a stable framerate whether I\u2019m engaged in battle, galloping full-tilt through a tempest-tossed forest, or wandering a busy village. The only significant slowdown I\u2019ve encountered has been during scripted cutscenes, as well as with the odd bit of stutter here and there during lengthy horse riding sessions.\n\nFor those excited about taking the epic adventure on the road, The Witcher 3 also performs well in handheld mode. The resolution drops to 540p, but it\u2019s not a dramatic shift considering the small size of the Switch screen. Menus scale dynamically, so there\u2019s no squinting at small text. The dream of a portable Witcher is real.\n\nIf you\u2019ve played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you\u2019ll have to weigh to graphical downgrade against the convenience of having Geralt on-hand at all times. If you\u2019ve never played The Witcher 3 before then you\u2019re in for a treat, no matter the resolution.", "description": "How did CD Projekt Red and Saber Interactive get the gorgeous, resource-hungry role-playing game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt running on Nintendo\u2019s plucky hybrid handheld?
