It is not known how the unnamed woman, who is in a home and under legal guardianship, came into possession of the work, which she thought was just a rather old religious icon.\n\nDominique Le Co\u00ebnt-de Beaulieu, head of the Act\u00e9on auction house, said a judge had called his colleague to empty her house in June after the woman was put in an old people's home.\n\n\u201cNothing suggested such a discovery was on the cards as the painting was found among other objects without interest,\" he told the Telegraph.\n\nIt is unclear whether the work has been made available to other Renaissance experts to check its veracity.\n\nThe painting could be worth up to six million euros (\u00a35.3m) Credit: Michel Euler /AP More\n\nThe auction house, however, called the finding of the tempera on a gold leaf ground on a poplar panel \u201ca major discovery for the history of Western art\u201d given the rarity of works by Cimabue, who tutored Duccio and Giotto.\n\nThe painting is believed to be part of a large diptych dating from 1280 when Cimabue painted eight scenes depicting Christ's passion and crucifixion.\n\nHistorians only recognise a dozen works on panel as being unequivocally by his hand, although none of them are signed. Several Cimabues have been lost in wars, floods and earthquakes.\n\nMr Le Co\u00ebnt-de Beaulieu said his colleague had realised there was something special about the work given the emotion of the face of Christ compared to other known Byzantine art figures, which pre-dated the work.\n\n\"Cimabue was the first to represent such figures in the terrestrial world with such feelings. The emotion is palpable,\" he said. It took another couple of months for Turquin to confirm its provenance.\n\nTwo other scenes from the work hang in the National Gallery in London -- The Virgin and Child with Two Angels - and the Frick Collection in New York (The Flagellation of Christ).\n\nThe scene in the National Gallery was also lost for centuries, and only found when a British aristocrat was clearing his ancestral seat in Suffolk.\n\nIt was given to the nation in 2000 after a Sotheby\u2019s expert had spotted it in a routine valuation of the contents of Benacre Hall in Suffolk.\n\nThat work survived a major fire in the 1920s, when it was among piles of furniture and books dragged by the servants out of the burning house and heaped up on the lawn.\n\nCimabue's The Virgin and Child Enthroned with Two Angels hangs in the National Gallery, London Credit: www.alamy.com More", "description": "Art historians claim to have unearthed a masterpiece by Cimabue, the Florentine painter dubbed \"the father of the Renaissance\", in an elderly lady's kitchen at her home near Paris.\u00a0 Christ Mocked, a tempera painting on a wood panel by the 13th-century artist, is estimated to be worth between", "authors": ["Henry Samuel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yfnp.s7A4ZxrSRaCiB8pnw--~B/aD0xMzk2O3c9MjIzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/c9f57b6fcaa4dd7b672e0233c1b9c31b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
