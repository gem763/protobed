It also recommends making transfers between trains and buses free and cutting fares for low-income riders.\n\nThe year-long study, funded by Metro, explored ways to improve Metrobus and eight other bus service providers in the region.\n\n[Report: D.C. region needs to transform its bus network]\n\nRobert Puentes, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, said the group\u2019s surveys found bus riders want more focus on the basics: speed, frequency, reliability and affordability. Puentes, who chairs the group\u2019s executive steering committee, said the study comes amid a national \u201cbus renaissance\u201d as metropolitan areas seek ways to use their congested roads more efficiently.\n\nPuentes said the group has sought buy-in from regional transit agencies and governments and solicited ideas from the public.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not working for riders,\u201d Puentes said of the bus system, \u201cthen it\u2019s not working for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe report said area bus systems have suffered from a lack of regional cooperation and attention even as they rival Metro by carrying more than 600,000 trips daily.\n\nPuentes said buses have been \u201cunderappreciated\u201d for their ability to move people efficiently, particularly compared with people driving alone in cars.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time talking about Metrorail, for good reason,\u201d Puentes said. \u201cBut buses deserve the same amount of attention.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, bus systems are seeing ridership suffer as travelers find more options for getting around, from hailing a ride on their cellphone to grabbing an electric scooter off a sidewalk.\n\n[Will \u2018rethinking\u2019 the D.C. region\u2019s bus network lead anywhere?]\n\nStewart Schwartz, executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth and a member of the group\u2019s steering committee, said shortcomings in bus service have become more pressing as traffic has worsened and the region continues to add jobs and people.\n\n\u201cPeople [in the group] were unified behind the urgent need for better bus service in the region,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nWhile eight out of 10 D.C.-area residents live within a quarter-mile of a bus stop, the study found, many find it frustrating to wait for a bus, especially late at night and during nonpeak hours, and inconvenient when buses don\u2019t go directly to their destination.\n\nIn addition to having more dedicated bus lanes, the group said, buses should be given priority at intersections to get through traffic signals and around stopped traffic. Allowing riders to pay fares before boarding also would help buses spend less time at each stop. Bus stops and shelters should be cleaner and help people feel safer, the study said.\n\n[Business leaders warn D.C. area\u2019s inadequate bus system is stifling growth]\n\nSome of the recommendations would require more regional cooperation, such as redesigning bus routes as part of a regionwide network, rather than a hodgepodge of lines controlled by different agencies. The group also suggested transit agencies establish regional performance standards and a \u201cregional mobility innovation lab\u201d that would allow them to share ideas about how to improve.\n\nThe group said it wants to make buses the \u201cmode of choice\u201d and the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the region\u2019s transportation system by 2030. The panel plans to release a more detailed 10-year \u201caction plan\u201d by the end of the year, Puentes said.\n\nThough none of the recommendations in Thursday\u2019s report came with price tags, Puentes said the group focused on improvements that could be carried out without \u201cenormous upfront capital costs.\u201d Many of them would pay for themselves, he said, as better service attracted more riders and, in turn, more fare revenue.\n\nThe group also proposed that a task force composed partly of state and local appointees ensure the recommendations get carried out.\n\n\u201cNobody wants the report to sit on a shelf,\u201d Puentes said.\n\nRead more:\n\nWith ridership falling, Metro spends $2.2 million to study bus service\n\nTransportation group says revamped Baltimore bus system falls short\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Washington-area business leaders and transit experts call for more dedicated bus lanes.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6HOIxDFm4qiXpZJRtEKCeEvmFvg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G25MXVAGPMI6NP7N55S575MXBU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
