At the same time, Jurni will develop a booking tool that will improve access of small and medium tourism enterprises to the global market as well as a visitor portal that will better showcase the South African tourism product.\n\nNow it has been announced that Jurni has launched Jurni Gems, a social media campaign which aims to put South Africa\u2019s hidden tourism gems on the international and local tourism map.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa has a wealth of tourist products and services that international and local travellers, and tourism operators, often miss. Through the launch of Jurni Gems, we would like to shine the spotlight on these attractions and establishments,\u201d says Dr Nomvuselelo Songelwa, Jurni Chief Executive Officer.\n\nJurni\u2019s view is that every South African knows at least one SMME in the travel industry who deserves more exposure, and more visitors. \u201cIt could be a little accommodation establishment nobody has heard about, but that is truly exceptional. Or a tourist attraction or tour that has always been overlooked by international and local tourists but that should be on every tourist itinerary,\u201d adds Songelwa.\n\nREAD: This Hout Bay pizzeria was just named the best in Africa - but there's even more to them than pizza\n\nThe process to nominate a product or establishment is simple:\n\nChoose a candidate who is currently active in the travel industry in South Africa (this could be yourself or your company).\n\nChoose a candidate who is currently active in the travel industry in South Africa (this could be yourself or your company).
