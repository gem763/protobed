Police said on Monday they expected a \u201cvery serious violent attack\u201d in the city, but gave no details.\n\nHundreds of officials and the pro-establishment elite began the day with a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, held early and moved behind closed doors. Roads leading to the centre were closed and tightly policed.\n\nHong Kong has benefited from China\u2019s support under the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms for the territory after its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nHowever, he said the \u201cescalating violence of some radical protesters, including unlawful assemblies and blockage of roads, petrol bomb hurling, arson and attacks on other citizens, has not only disrupted social order but also posed a severe challenge to the rule of law, affecting the safety and normal lives of citizens\u201d.\n\nThe protests had \u201cfurther hit the local economy, which is already facing downward pressure,\u201d he added.\n\nThe protests have taken a heavy toll on shopping malls that house some of the world\u2019s best-known luxury brands, with many closing early in recent weeks amid escalating violence.\n\nThe IFC mall, close to the centre of the city, was entirely closed on Tuesday. One of Hong Kong\u2019s largest upscale shopping centres, IFC houses an Apple Inc (AAPL.O) store, jewellers Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) and Chow Sang Sang (0016.HK), cosmetics maker L\u2019Occitane (0973.HK) and Gucci, which is owned by French group Kering (PRTP.PA).\n\nThe closure of IFC and several other malls means retailers will miss out on what would normally be a busy shopping week, when mainland tour groups traditionally flood the territory for the annual Golden Week holiday.\n\nLatest data showed visitor arrivals plunged 39% in August from a year earlier, with the number of mainland tourists to Hong Kong dropping 42.3% over the period.\n\nPro-China supporters pose for a group photo with a giant Chinese national flag as they celebrate China's National Day in Hong Kong, China October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nEARLY SCUFFLE\n\nCheung called a first \u201copen dialogue\u201d held last week with citizens an important step, and said more would follow.\n\nA group of protesters outside the venue shouted \u201cNo national day celebrations, only national day mourning,\u201d and called for those arrested during recent clashes to be released. Police fired pepper spray during a scuffle outside a nearby train station.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp closed some flash-point metro stations, and several large shopping malls said they would close to avoid damage in any clashes.\n\nThe government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already cancelled the annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety concerns.\n\nLam, who was trapped in an indoor stadium for hours last week after attending the \u201copen dialogue,\u201d left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China\u2019s birthday on the mainland. She will return on Tuesday night.\n\nPROTESTS, PARADES\n\nIn contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nThe Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong\u2019s political unrest, slowing economic growth and a trade war with the United States.\n\n\u201cOn our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said in his nationally televised speech in Beijing.\n\nHong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial centre, which Britain returned to China under a formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nLast month, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into the restive city, a move state news agency Xinhua described as a routine \u201crotation\u201d.\n\nAsian and Western envoys in Hong Kong, however, have said the absence of any evidence that troops had been withdrawn suggested it was a reinforcement, with the largest-ever regular army force now stationed in the city.", "description": "Hong Kong was in lockdown on Tuesday, with barricades in the city centre, shuttered stores and a heavy riot police presence, as authorities scrambled to ensure protests do not overshadow China's National Day festivities in Beijing.", "authors": ["Anne Marie Roantree", "Farah Master", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435748443&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901SY", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
