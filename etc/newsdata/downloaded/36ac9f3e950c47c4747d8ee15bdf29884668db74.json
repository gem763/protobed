As readers of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale well know, it doesn\u2019t take much in Gilead to end up ripped apart by 70 women\u2019s hands in an execution, or hanged and placed on a public wall to rot.\n\nIn The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Atwood adeptly told the story of Offred, one of many women captured and forced to be a handmaid, or a sexual slave, in Gilead for male commanders of a group called the Sons of Jacob, who overthrew the United States government and in its place built a misogynist dystopian theocracy.\n\nThe first novel ends with Offred\u2014also known as June\u2014getting into a black van that will lead to her execution or escape, depending on the reader.\n\nExcept, during the 34-year break between novels, the Hulu original TV-adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, created by Bruce Miller and starring Elisabeth Moss as June, became a hit. As it turned out, June neither escaped nor was executed, but we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\n\u201c Only dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive. Already I am petrified. \u201d \u2014 Aunt Lydia\n\nThe plot of The Testaments takes place give-or-take 15 years after the first novel (and television series), when a mole inside Gilead\u2019s regime hatches a plan to take it down from the inside. The sequel was already named to the Booker Prize shortlist last week.\n\nThe fast-paced story features three female narrators: Aunt Lydia, a cunning and vengeful founder of Gilead who rose to the top of the new society by collecting and deploying state secrets; June\u2019s daughter Nicole, a 16-year-old living under a false identity who was smuggled to Canada as a baby; and June\u2019s older daughter Agnes Jemima, known in the TV show as Hannah, who was ripped from her mother\u2019s arms at the age of 5 and given to a powerful, childless couple in Gilead.\n\nAll three figures have been featured prominently in the television series, where Aunt Lydia is pitch-perfectly portrayed by Ann Dowd.\n\n\u201cOrdinary is what you are used to,\u201d Aunt Lydia tells Offred in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. \u201cThis may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary.\u201d\n\nIn Offred\u2019s story, the violence and torture in Gilead become everyday occurrences.\n\n\u201cIn a gradually heating bathtub you\u2019d be boiled to death before you knew it,\u201d she muses.\n\nBut the sequel has the opposite effect on her daughter, Agnes, who begins The Testaments by chronicling the day-to-day normalcy of her life as a Gileadean child and then grows to question the lies she\u2019s been fed by parents, teachers, and politicians.\n\nAgnes barely remembers her life before Gilead, or the day when she was taken from her birth mother and given to an official called Commander Kyle and his wife, Tabitha. Eventually, though, she realizes that the Bible stories she grew up hearing were edited and manipulated by corrupt leaders to justify their actions.\n\nNot for nothing, it takes nearly 300 pages before a character looks around at a ceremony in Gilead and says: \u201cThis place is weird as fuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't believe the sky is falling until a chunk of it falls on you.\u201d\u2014Aunt Lydia\n\nThough Aunt Lydia was a true villain in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, she may be the most complex and sympathetic character in The Testaments.\n\nThe former school teacher, then judge, saved herself in the early days of Gilead, after she was subjected to both psychological and physical torture. She became an architect of women\u2019s various subservient roles within the regime, and she rose quickly in the political ranks.\n\n\u201cAunt Lydia\u2019s always been a climber, so she climbed up,\u201d Atwood has said of the character. \u201cShe realizes the power of having dirt on people that you don\u2019t reveal publicly.\u201d\n\nBut the most exciting moments of the novel occur in the sort of spy-thriller story line about a mysterious mole who is sending secrets to the Mayday resistance in a bid to crush the regime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a contrived and heavily stage-managed premise\u2014but contrived in a Dickensian sort of way with coincidences that reverberate with philosophical significance,\u201d wrote Michiko Kakutani, in her New York Times review.\n\nAtwood has said The Testaments is, in part, an attempt to explore what causes totalitarian regimes to fall apart. Like in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, she uses history to inform her novel, taking real stories from the Nazis\u2019 Lebensborn program and public executions in North Korea to build a genuinely believable Gilead. That\u2019s what makes it so terrifying.\n\nReaders were also privy to more information about international politics this time around, thanks to the diversity of narrators. After the United States fell, the Republic of Texas, for example, \u201cfought Gilead to a standstill, but they don\u2019t want to be invaded\u201d and have since been \u201cavoiding provocations.\u201d Fifteen years after the founding of Gilead, wars were still raging all over North America.\n\nAtwood said she and the show\u2019s creator, Bruce Miller, worked together to make sure that plot and character developments in the series didn\u2019t create \u201cglaring inconsistencies\u201d with the book, but there are a few moments in the story when things don\u2019t quite add up.\n\nFor example, in the show, baby Nicole escaped to Canada in the arms of June\u2019s friend Emily, who appeared to be traveling alone when she arrived across the border with the crying infant. In The Testaments, Nicole is told that she was drugged and carried in a backpack by a woman named Ada traveling in a group. If you squint your eyes, maybe they could both have happened.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stretched thin, all of us; we vibrate; we quiver, we\u2019re always on the alert. Reign of Terror, they used to say, but terror does not exactly reign. Instead it paralyzes. Hence the unnatural quiet.\u201d\u2014Aunt Lydia\n\nThe show, which premiered in 2017, had a beautiful and successful first season translating the novel to the screen, and it inspired protesters to use the iconic red cloaks and white bonnets while demonstrating all over the country for women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cWhen I see those women wearing handmaid costumes and marching and protesting in them, I\u2019m even more proud to put it on,\u201d Moss, who is also an executive producer on the series, has said. \u201cI know what that costume stands for and what it means, and that\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\nOnce the show became a pop culture phenomenon, it was perhaps inevitable that Kylie Jenner would throw a handmaid-themed party.\n\nBut the second and third seasons have been bumpier, and the latter was widely criticized for a slew of problems, including dramatically changing June\u2019s character. She was once an ordinary woman who just wanted to escape a totalitarian regime with her daughter. By the third season, she is a murderer and seemingly fearless resistance leader working to evacuate dozens of refugee children to Canada.\n\nMaybe some of us would have bravely made the transition to badass hero under the circumstances, but would we survive it? Because June has grown some seriously heavy plot armor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either a police state or it\u2019s not,\u201d wrote Sophie Gilbert, in The Atlantic. \u201cIt can\u2019t be both a brutally efficient disciplinary environment and a world in which June has the freedom to enter any room she pleases, smoke conspiratorial cigarettes with Serena, and kiss her baby\u2019s father, bare-headed, outside the home of an impossibly powerful (and well-guarded) leader of Gilead.\u201d\n\nEven Atwood agreed, in an interview with The New York Times, that it\u2019s \u201ca bit of a problem for people that know about real totalitarianism that some of these characters have survived for as long as they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely they would have been shot by now,\u201d she added. \u201cQuite a few too many people know what June has been up to.\u201d\n\n\u201c Surely they would have been shot by now. \u201d \u2014 Margaret Atwood\n\nBut the biggest sin perpetrated by the television show is repetition. Again and again, June tries to escape with her daughter(s) and is thwarted. Fingers are cut off, eyes are gouged out, someone is stabbed. Nearly every gruesome episode ends with the same extreme close-up on Elisabeth Moss\u2019s impressively indignant face.\n\nAs Kakutani put it, the writers have forced Offred into \u201ca wearisome Groundhog Day loop of tribulations, including several failed escape attempts, repetitious, soap-opera confrontations with Serena and Aunt Lydia and more and more preposterous situations calling for bad-ass heroics.\u201d\n\nBut for those still on board with the grisly TV adaptation, viewers may get a fresh start with the silver screen version of The Testaments, which is already in the works.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s available as an audiobook narrated by a full cast, including Ann Dowd, Bryce Dallas Howard, Mae Whitman, Derek Jacobi, Tantoo Cardinal, and the author herself.", "description": "The fast-paced sequel is narrated by three characters who will be familiar to all fans of the print and TV versions of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568059820/190910-messer-the-testaments-handmaids-tale-sequel-hero_dfeiiz", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
