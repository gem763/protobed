She had been battling cancer for years, and her husband said recently he had been advised to put her in hospice care.\n\nHarper was a breakout star on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d then the lead of her own series, \u201cRhoda.\u201d She was 80.\n\nShe won three consecutive Emmys (1971-73) as supporting actress on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and another for outstanding lead actress for \u201cRhoda,\u201d which ran from 1974-78. Beyond awards, she was immortalized \u2014 and typecast \u2014 for playing one of television\u2019s most beloved characters, a best friend the equal of Ethel Mertz and Ed Norton in TV\u2019s sidekick pantheon.\n\nFans had long feared the news of her passing. In 2013, she first revealed that she had been diagnosed with brain cancer and had been told by her doctors she had as little as three months to live. Some responded as if a family member were in peril.\n\nBut she refused to despair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dying until I do,\u201d Harper said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarper did outlive her famous co-star: Mary Tyler Moore died in January 2017. Ed Asner, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Gavin MacLeod are among the former cast members who survive her.\n\nMacLeod recalled her as a \u201ctalented, gifted actress\u201d in an email to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a sad day. My life has been so enriched by having the experience of working with Valerie and calling her a friend. \u2026 The thing I remember so much about Val is that she loved her family, she loved the actors that she worked with, and she loved the underdog. She was always helping someone,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn recent years, Harper\u2019s other appearances included \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d \u201dThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cTwo Broke Girls.\u201d\n\nHarper was a chorus dancer on Broadway as a teen before moving into comedy and improv when, in 1970, she auditioned for the part of a Bronx-born Jewish girl who would be a neighbor and pal of Minneapolis news producer Mary Richards on a new sitcom for CBS.\n\nIt seemed a long shot for the young, unknown actress. As she recalled, \u201cI\u2019m not Jewish, not from New York, and I have a small shiksa nose.\u201d And she had almost no TV experience.\n\nBut Harper, who arrived for her audition some 20 pounds overweight, may have clinched the role when she blurted out in admiration to the show\u2019s tall, slender star: \u201cLook at you in white pants without a long jacket to cover your behind!\u201d\n\nIt was exactly the sort of thing Rhoda would say to \u201cMar,\u201d as Harper recalled in her 2013 memoir, \u201cI, Rhoda.\u201d Harper was signed without a screen test.\n\nOf course, if CBS had gotten its way, Rhoda might have been a very different character with a much different actress in place. As \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d was being developed, its producers were battling a four-point decree from the network, which insisted that the nation\u2019s TV viewers would not accept series characters who were (1) divorced, (2) from New York, (3) Jewish or (4) have mustaches.\n\nThe producers lost on having Mary Richards divorced (instead, she had been dumped by her long-time boyfriend). But with Rhoda, they overrode the network on two other counts.\n\nThe show that resulted was a groundbreaking hit, with comically relatable Rhoda one big reason.\n\nItem: \u201cWhat am I? I\u2019m not married, I\u2019m not engaged. I\u2019m not even pinned. I bet Hallmark doesn\u2019t even have a card for me!\u201d\n\nItem: Eyeing a piece of candy, Rhoda wise-cracked: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to eat this or apply it directly to my hips.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen really identified with Rhoda because her problems and fears were theirs,\u201d Harper theorized in her book. \u201cDespite the fact that she was the butt of most of her own jokes, so to speak, \u2026 her confident swagger masked her insecurity. Rhoda never gave up.\u201d\n\nNeither did Harper, who confronted her own insecurities with similar moxie.\n\n\u201cI was always a little overweight,\u201d she once told the AP. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Valerie Harper and I\u2019m overweight.\u2019 I\u2019d say it quickly before they could. \u2026 I always got called chubby, my nose was too wide, my hair was too kinky.\u201d\n\nBut as \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d evolved, so did Rhoda. Rhoda trimmed down and glammed up, while never losing her comic step. The audience loved her more than ever.\n\nA spinoff seemed inevitable. In 1974, Rhoda was dispatched from Minneapolis back home to New York City, where she was reunited with her parents and younger sister in a new sitcom that costarred Nancy Walker, Harold Gould and Julie Kavner.\n\nShe also met and fell in love with the hunky owner of a demolition firm.\n\nThe premiere of \u201cRhoda\u201d that September was the week\u2019s top-rated show, getting a 42 percent share of audience against competition including Monday Night Football on ABC. And a few weeks later, when Rhoda and her fiance, Joe, were wed in a one-hour special episode, more than 52 million people \u2014 half of the U.S. viewing audience \u2014 tuned in.\n\nBut \u201cRhoda\u201d couldn\u2019t maintain those comic or popular heights. A domesticated, lucky-in-love Rhoda wasn\u2019t a funny Rhoda. By the end of the third season, the writers had taken a desperate step: Rhoda divorced Joe. Thus had Rhoda (and Harper) defied a third CBS taboo.\n\nThe series ended in 1978 with Harper having played Rhoda for a total of nine seasons.\n\nShe had captured the character by studying her Italian stepmother. But Harper\u2019s own ethnicity \u2014 neither Jewish nor Italian \u2014 was summed up in a New York Times profile as \u201can exotic mixture of Spanish-English-Scotch-Irish-Welsh-French-Canadian.\u201d\n\nAnd she was not a Gothamite. Born in Suffern, New York, into a family headed by a peripatetic sales executive, she spent her early years in Oregon, Michigan and California before settling in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\nBy high school, she was taking dance lessons in Manhattan several times a week. By age 15, she was dancing specialty numbers at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nBy 18, she was in the chorus of the Broadway musical \u201cLi\u2019l Abner\u201d (then appeared in the film adaptation one year later). She also danced in the musicals \u201cTake Me Along\u201d (starring Jackie Gleason) and \u201cWildcat\u201d (starring Lucille Ball).\n\nShe found comedy when she fell in with a group of Second City players from Chicago who had taken up residence in Greenwich Village. One of these improv players was Richard Schaal, whom she wed in 1964. (They divorced in 1978.)\n\nHarper and Schaal moved to Los Angeles in 1968.\n\nTwo years later, in a theater production, she was spotted by a casting agent for the role of Rhoda.\n\nDuring \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d Harper appeared in her first major film, the comedy \u201cFreebie and the Bean,\u201d and later was cast in \u201cBlame It on Rio\u201d and an adaptation of Neil Simon\u2019s play \u201cChapter Two.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, she returned to series TV with a family sitcom called \u201cValerie.\u201d While not matching her past critical successes, the show proved popular. But in the summer of 1987, Harper and her manager, Tony Cacciotti, whom she had married a few months earlier, were embroiled in a highly publicized feud with Lorimar Telepictures, the show\u2019s production company, and its network, NBC.\n\nIn a dispute over salary demands, Harper had refused to report for work, missing one episode. The episode was filmed without her. She was back on duty the following week, only to be abruptly dumped and replaced by actress Sandy Duncan. The show was renamed \u201cValerie\u2019s Family\u201d and then \u201cThe Hogan Family.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, lawsuits and countersuits flew. In September 1988, a jury decided that Harper was wrongfully fired. She was awarded $1.4 million compensation plus profit participation in the show (which continued without Harper until 1991).\n\n\u201cI felt vindicated,\u201d Harper wrote in her memoir. \u201cI had beaten Lorimar and reclaimed my reputation.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1990s, Harper starred in a pair of short-lived sitcoms (one of which, \u201cCity,\u201d was created by future Oscar-winner Paul Haggis) and made guest appearances on series including \u201cMelrose Place,\u201d \u201dSex and the City\u201d and \u201cDesperate Housewives.\u201d\n\nShe reunited with Moore in a 2000 TV film, \u201cMary and Rhoda.\u201d In 2013, there was an even grander reunion: Harper and Moore were back together along with fellow \u201cMTM\u201d alumnae Leachman, White and Georgia Engel to tape an episode of White\u2019s hit comedy, \u201cHot in Cleveland.\u201d It was the ensemble\u2019s first acting job together in more than 30 years and during a news conference Harper cited a valuable lesson: The character of Rhoda, she said, pointing to Moore, \u201ctaught me to thank your lucky stars for a fabulous friend.\u201d\n\nSurvivors include her husband, Tony Cacciotti, and daughter, Cristina Cacciotti.\n\n___\n\nFrazier Moore, a long-time television writer for The Associated Press who retired in 2017, was the principal writer of this obituary.
