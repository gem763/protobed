More than 40 per cent of capital market participants that took part in a Greenwich Associates survey this year said that their firms are using AI for trading. A further 17 per cent said they will introduce it within the next two years.\n\nStill, this is the first time that bots have traded with other bots in corporate bonds, according to AllianceBernstein.\n\nThe robot is an extension of the asset manager's virtual assistant, named Abbie, which pores through data and identifies for traders the best bonds to buy or sell. AllianceBernstein gathers about 4 million data points a day to work out the best ways to trade including bid and offer prices from dealers and electronic trading venues.\n\nExecuting trades involves a number of manual steps. At present, it can take traders up to 20 minutes to negotiate the size, price and precise maturity of a trade with a counterparty on the other end of the phone or instant message. With bots that could become almost instantaneous.\n\nThe master is telling the dog to fetch and bring the stick back. \u2014 James Switzer, global head of fixed-income trading at AllianceBerstein\n\n\"Machines are helping us to make smarter decisions and be more efficient,\" said James Switzer, global head of fixed-income trading at AllianceBerstein. \"I guess we could look out five or 10 years and start anticipating what would happen, but right now they aren't replacing traders, they're really just helping us trade.\"\n\nThe robot is designed to save traders time and beat competitors, a meaningful edge in a secondary market starved of liquidity. It could also be developed using AI to remember the best counterparties for certain trades and target them first in future, a system known as smart order routing, according to Switzer.\n\nIn the test cases, AllianceBernstein made three separate trades in investment-grade US corporate bonds with each of the three banks and the firm expects to expand that to more dealers in the coming months. The bots agreed to the transactions on the signal of a human trader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The master is telling the dog to fetch and bring the stick back,\" said Switzer.\n\nIn the future, AllianceBernstein expects the bot to spot the best prices within parameters previously set by a trader and execute automatically. That would mean it would no longer need a human to give the execute command, although to be sure, the firm will still have human checks and balances, including compliance.\n\nCiti and Morgan Stanley both expect their trading algorithms to be able to directly handle requests to trade and execute without human command, depending on the nature of the transaction. A spokesman for RBC Capital Markets declined to comment on the trade with AllianceBernstein.\n\n\"We're automating parts of a very manual process,\" said Kevin Foley, head of markets electronification at Citi in New York. \"Phase two is fully-automated straight-through processing.\"\n\nIt's surely a world Bonfire's bond trader Sherman McCoy would have no place in as the crumbs disintegrate.\n\n\"Just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake, and you didn't bake the cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of the cake a tiny little bit comes off, like a little crumb, and you can keep that,\" Wolfe wrote in his novel.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "This is the first time that bots have traded with other bots in corporate bonds, according to AllianceBernstein.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/736d332c12c998dc60d506912a30b5a6a0f5b996", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
