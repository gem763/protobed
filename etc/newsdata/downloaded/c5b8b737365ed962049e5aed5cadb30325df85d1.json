In the coming weeks, I\u2019ll be bringing you stories focusing on the experiences of women across the world. Today, we\u2019re highlighting stories from the HuffPost U.S. Hispanic Heritage Month series, which spotlights Latinx trailblazers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been discriminated against so many times, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to be an activist,\u201d Amara La Negra told HuffPost U.S. \u201cI want to say the day that I die, my life mattered.\u201d\n\nThe Dominican-American singer and actress first made a name for herself on the series \u201cLove & Hip Hop: Miami.\u201d Since then, she\u2019s become outspoken about her experiences in the entertainment industry as an Afro-Latina and about overcoming the prejudice she faces for having dark skin.\n\nHuffPost associate video editor Kiara Alfonseca thought it would be important to feature the star in the Hispanic Heritage Month series.\n\n\u201cOne of our main focuses for Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month was on creating a diverse, nuanced series that looks at how complicated our community is, and I knew that some of our content should center on and highlight Afro-Latinx talent,\u201d Kiara said. \u201cAmara La Negra was the first one to come to mind because she has so fiercely addressed this issue of race and color in general and among our own people.\u201d\n\nMaria Alejandra Cardona for HuffPost Amara La Negra first made a name for herself on the series \u201cLove & Hip Hop: Miami.\u201d\n\nLooking for a sense of belonging both within Latinx communities and in the larger U.S. society, while finding one\u2019s authentic self, has been a major theme in Kiara\u2019s recent work for HHM. The topic has resonated with many HuffPost readers.\n\n\u201cA lot of the response has been about relating to those experiences and readers who want to see Amara and other Afro-Latinxs thriving in all of these spaces that aren\u2019t always so accepting, even if you\u2019re [considered] \u2018one of them,\u2019\u201d she said, adding that readers \u201cexpressed their love for her and what she stands for.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kiara\u2019s interview with Esmeralda Santiago, author of the celebrated novel \u201cWhen I Was Puerto Rican,\u201d also touches on this theme of cultural belonging \u2014 specifically, staying connected to one\u2019s homeland even while living in a society that isn\u2019t always welcoming toward immigrants.\n\n\u201cI related to Santiago\u2019s story of being an outsider and being \u2018other-ed,\u2019\u201d Kiara said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of feedback about readers feeling like they\u2019re understood or that they feel represented by these kinds of narratives.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges the Latinx community faces when it comes to representation and acceptance in the U.S., Kiara says Hispanic Heritage Month is a chance to highlight its nuanced and complex stories.\n\n\u201cWe just had to dedicate the time and effort to serve an underserved community because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy best advice: Listen to other Latinx people about what is important to them and what they want to hear.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nAurora\n\nMIGUEL MEDINA via Getty Images Valentina Sampaio poses during an interview in Milan on Feb. 18, 2017.\n\nLast month, Victoria\u2019s Secret announced that Valencia Sampaio would be the brand\u2019s first transgender model. Sampaio, a native of Fortaleza, a city in northeastern Brazil, has been making waves in the fashion world in recent years, and she\u2019s determined to keep pushing boundaries.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m very happy with the changes taking place in our industry. And not just for the trans community. It\u2019s inspiring to see many minorities represented, whether by gender, body type, or ethnicity,\u201d she told HuffPost Brazil. \u201cEveryone needs to be represented in fashion and in society.\u201d\n\nSampaio\u2019s hiring is particularly significant amid a crisis in Brazil for LGBTQ people. While homicide rates in Brazil are high generally, advocacy groups point out that many incidents of violence targeting LGBTQ people are directly related to homophobia and transphobia.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Thomas Cook staff giving information to British passengers at Palma de Mallorca airport on Monday.\n\nThe shutdown of the U.K.\u2019s oldest travel company has had reverberations all over the world, with the firm canceling all future flights and hotel bookings \u2014 and women have been especially affected by the company\u2019s demise, argues Sophie Walker in HuffPost U.K. The government has previously fought to protect men\u2019s jobs in manufacturing and steel, but she says there has been an eerie silence over the 6,000-odd women\u2019s jobs lost at the travel group. Sophie warns policymakers that Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse should be a wake-up call for decision-makers and said it shows that the U.K. economy is becoming skewed in a way that could threaten future growth and prosperity.\n\nIn Case You Missed It...", "description": "Plus: Greta Thurnberg scolds world leaders, urging them to act on climate change.", "authors": ["News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ba632230000100552cd58.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
