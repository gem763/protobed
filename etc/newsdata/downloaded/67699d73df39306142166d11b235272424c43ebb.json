(AP) - Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general began casino gambling negotiations with more than two dozen tribal nations on Monday, but the sides remain locked in a stalemate over whether the existing gaming compacts automatically renew at the end of the year.\n\nAttorney General Mike Hunter described the two-hour, closed-door meeting at the Citizen Potawatomi Nation\u2019s Grand Casino Hotel & Resort as \u201cpositive and constructive,\u201d but offered few details about the stalemate. He said the meeting was a good opportunity to outline the state\u2019s position.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt has taken the position that the 15-year compacts expire at the end of the year and wants to renegotiate the terms to give the state a larger share of casino revenue.\n\nThe 35 tribal nations with gaming compacts are unified in their position that the agreements automatically renew after Jan. 1 if an agreement can\u2019t be reached on new terms, and that that issue must be resolved before negotiations can begin.\n\n\u201cThe way forward is to come up with a process that resolves the dispute, getting that resolved, getting it in a trajectory where it is no longer a barrier to looking at ways to modify the compact in a way that benefits the tribes and the state mutually and cooperatively,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nMatthew Morgan, chairman of the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association and a key player in the discussions, said tribal leaders will take time to assess today\u2019s discussion, but that it\u2019s clear there is a \u201cmajor dispute\u201d over the renewal language.\n\n\u201cNothing is more important to the tribes than resolving the automatic renewal, and we are committed to continued dialogue,\u201d Morgan said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s current gambling compacts call for the tribes to pay between 4% and 10% of a casino\u2019s net revenue in \u201cexclusivity fees,\u201d which gives tribes the exclusive rights to operate casinos in the state. Those fees generated nearly $139 million in payments to the state last year on roughly $2.3 billion in revenue from games covered under the compacts.\n\nNearly 60% of Oklahoma voters approved a state question in 2004 that authorized expanded gambling, and nearly all the tribal nations in Oklahoma signed compacts with the state shortly thereafter. Casino gambling is now a booming industry in Oklahoma, with 130 casinos dotting the state, ranging from gas station annexes to resort-style hotel casinos, many of them in border communities.\n\nWithout a compact in place, Oklahoma tribes would be unable to offer many games at casinos, including advanced slot machine-style electronic games or card games such as poker and blackjack. Casinos could still feature bingo-style electronic games, which remain popular in Oklahoma and don\u2019t require the tribes to pay any fees to the state.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma's attorney general began casino gambling negotiations with more than two dozen tribal nations on Monday, but the sides remain locked in a stalemate over whether the existing gaming compacts automatically renew at the end of the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sean Murphy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/tribal_gambling_oklahoma_51835_c0-172-4133-2582_s1200x700.jpg?c34bb9638f8a99f5dad3a36a26283b8c26e6b386", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
