He was then drawn into a Trump administration effort to leverage U.S. military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAnd then he apparently grew alarmed.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d he wrote in excerpts of text messages released by impeachment investigators in Congress.\n\nNow, members of Congress will hear directly from Taylor. The former Army officer is scheduled to testify behind closed doors Tuesday in an inquiry trying to determine if Trump committed impeachable offenses by pressing the president of Ukraine into pursuing information that could help his campaign as Trump withheld military aid to the Eastern European country.\n\nTaylor had been serving as executive vice president at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan think tank founded by Congress, when he was appointed to run the embassy in Kyiv after Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was removed before the end of her term following a campaign against her led by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHe was chosen for the post because he was among only a handful of former officials with experience in Ukraine who would be perceived as neutral by local officials and wouldn\u2019t raise objections at the White House, according to a colleague.\n\n\u201cIt was a very short list, but Bill was at the top of it,\u201d said the colleague, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe were very grateful he agreed to do it.\u201d\n\nTaylor, who had served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, was welcomed back to Kyiv as a steady hand.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the epitome of a seasoned statesman,\u201d said John Shmorhun, an American who heads the agricultural company AgroGeneration.\n\nHe said Taylor\u2019s experience has shown in his handling of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine. \u201cHe seems to know the difference between right and wrong,\u201d Shmorhun said.\n\n\u201cWe need guys like Bill Taylor working in Ukraine, helping to deal with the politics in Ukraine, having a strong arm.\u201d\n\nBefore retiring from government service, Taylor was involved in diplomatic efforts surrounding several major international conflicts. He served in Jerusalem as U.S. envoy to the Quartet of Mideast peacemakers. He oversaw reconstruction in Iraq from 2004 to 2005, and from Kabul coordinated U.S. and international assistance to Afghanistan from 2002 to 2003.\n\nHe is a graduate of West Point and served as an Army infantry platoon leader and combat company commander in Vietnam and Germany.\n\nHe arrived in Kyiv a month after the sudden departure of Yovanovitch and the inauguration of Ukraine\u2019s new president, prepared to steer the embassy through the transition. He was most likely not prepared for what happened next.\n\nIn July, Trump would have his now-famous phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which he pressed him to investigate unsubstantiated claims about Democratic rival Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory involving a computer server at the Democratic National Committee. Trump at the time had quietly put a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid that Ukraine was counting on in its fight against Russian-backed separatists.\n\nIn the follow-up to the call, Taylor exchanged texts with two of Trump\u2019s point men on Ukraine as they were trying to get Zelenskiy to commit to the investigations before setting a date for a coveted White House visit.\n\nIn a text message to Gordon Sondland on Sept. 1, Taylor bluntly questioned Trump\u2019s motives: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told him to call him.\n\nIn texts a week later to Sondland and special envoy Kurt Volker, Taylor expressed increased alarm, calling it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nHe said not giving the military aid to Ukraine would be his \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario because it sends the wrong message to both Kyiv and Moscow. \u201cThe Russians love it. (And I quit).\u201d\n\nIn a stilted reply, Sondland defended Trump\u2019s intentions and suggested they stop the back and forth by text.\n\nU.S. diplomats based at the Kyiv embassy have refused to speak with journalists, reflecting the sensitivity of the impeachment inquiry. The embassy press office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\nPublicly, as in his texts, Taylor has continued to stand up for Ukraine, a country he describes as on \u201cthe front lines\u201d of a war with Russia.\n\nSpeaking to university students on Aug. 31, Taylor said Ukraine was showing its commitment to a \u201cdemocratic, European, prosperous future\u201d and could count on U.S. support.\n\n\u201cWe know you have challenges. We know your large neighbor has started a war against your country. We stand with you in resisting that aggression,\u201d Taylor said, according to remarks published on the embassy website.\n\nIt was a message that would be repeated in a \u201cMusic of Freedom\u201d concert this past weekend by the U.S. Air Forces in Europe Band performing together with Ukrainian musicians.\n\nJoseph Pennington, the acting No. 2 while Taylor is in Washington, addressed the mostly Ukrainian audience, saying he hoped they would \u201cfeel the support and commitment to democracy that our two countries cherish\u201d and \u201crecognize the power of the enduring partnership between the United States and Ukrainian armed forces.\u201d\n\nThe lyrics of the first song, \u201cOver There,\u201d may have been lost on many in the audience as the refrain \u201cthe Yanks are coming\u201d cheerfully rang out in the Kyiv concert hall.\n\nBut there was no missing the parting words from Pennington: \u201cGlory to Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "William Taylor is a former U.S. ambassador who was tapped to run the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT774_willia_ZG_20191022094623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
