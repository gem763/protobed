About the big stuff, not about childcare arrangements, or what the funny noise coming from the fridge means? According to a study at the University of California, Los Angeles, couples with small children, and who both have careers, talk for just 35 minutes a week, and mainly about errands. That study, says John Gottman, \u201calarmed\u201d him and his wife, Julie. \u201cIt seemed like couples who had been together a long time were not taking care of the relationship \u2013 their curiosity in one another had died,\u201d he says.\n\nGottman, the renowned relationships researcher known for his work on divorce predictors, and Julie Schwartz Gottman, a psychologist, have been married for 32 years. They founded the Gottman Institute, which conducts research and trains therapists. Their Gottman method is an approach designed to repair and deepen relationships, concentrating on three main areas \u2013 \u201cfriendship, conflict management and creation of shared meaning\u201d. They have also written many books, together and separately. Their latest book, which they wrote as a couple, is Eight Dates. It guides couples through eight conversations \u2013 to have on dedicated dates \u2013 on the big issues such as sex, parenting and how to handle conflict. It was partly sparked by the rise of online dating and to provide new couples with a roadmap to navigate tricky subjects, but mainly to give long-term couples a project to steer their relationship to a better place. \u201cCouples who have been together for quite a long time create a relationship that grows stale with time, and they lose track of one another,\u201d says Julie. \u201cPeople evolve over time. They change.\u201d\n\nMany of the questions will encourage you to confront your ideas of what a relationship should look like\n\nThe categories \u2013 trust, conflict, sex, money, family, fun, spirituality and dreams \u2013 came out of the Gottmans\u2019 years of observing the flashpoints in relationships, and they sent 300 heterosexual and same-sex couples out to test the dates. The dates have suggestions of places to go that fit the category \u2013 for instance, for the trust and commitment date, choose somewhere that is meaningful to your relationship \u2013 though they also have suggestions for meaningful dates at home, and open-ended questions to ask each other. Amazingly, they report that only one couple had an argument on one of their dates. But might disagreement be a danger for readers of the book? \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but what we like to do is give people preparation in case conflict arises, so each chapter includes a bit of that,\u201d says Julie. \u201cBut also we very carefully tailored the questions so that people were encouraged to self-disclose as opposed to comment on each other\u2019s thoughts. And when you self-disclose, that\u2019s really the antidote to creating conflict as opposed to judging the other person for their point of view.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Couples who have been together for quite a long time create a relationship that grows stale.\u2019 Photograph: Norman Pogson/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nEach category has exercises and prompts to think about before the date \u2013 for instance, in the money and work section, you are encouraged to think about your family history with money, and complete a questionnaire on what money means to you, then bring these to the date to share, along with suggestions for discussion including: \u201cWhat do you appreciate about your partner\u2019s contribution to the wealth of the relationship?\u201d and: \u201cWhat is your biggest fear around money?\u201d\n\nMany of the questions will encourage you to confront your own prejudices and ideas of what a relationship should look like, probably influenced (for good or bad) by your parents\u2019 relationship. \u201cPeople tend to role-model after their caretakers,\u201d says Julie. \u201cThose are hard to step out of. It takes knowing what the alternative is and then practising it, making repairs when you do make a mistake and trying again.\u201d\n\nI can see the point of all of the dates, but some fill me with horror (talking about sex, mainly \u2013 I am British, after all). And my boyfriend would probably rather abandon his family, change his name and leave the country than have a date during which we try to have a serious conversation about growth and spirituality (sample question: \u201cWhat do you consider sacred?\u201d). How can you get your partner on board if they\u2019re resisting? \u201cStart with the chapter on sex,\u201d says Julie. \u201cI think it depends on what the objections are. If somebody is afraid of having a deeper conversation, you could say this is not about being judged. This is not meant as a sadistic torture for your partner, it\u2019s about having a fun conversation and being able to have a jumping-off point. People are so caught up in the day-to-day tasks, they rarely have time to sit and reflect on: \u2018What do I not know about my partner that I want to know?\u2019\u201d So many people in our culture are \u201cbroadcasters\u201d, says John. \u201cThey think the important thing in a relationship is to be interesting, rather than to be interested.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Lo and behold, here\u2019s this beautiful person who thinks you\u2019re funny and cute.\u2019 Photograph: svetikd/Getty Images\n\nWhich are the most important dates? Julie chooses trust and commitment, and dreams and ambitions. \u201cWhen people talk about that, they have a chance to plumb their own depths, to see what really matters to them and what they really value, and how they want to give their lives meaning. Those are things that change and evolve over time.\u201d She turns to John: \u201cHow about you, honey?\u201d He smiles and says: \u201cFun and adventure, and sex.\u201d They laugh and Julie says something about him being a typical man and kisses him on the cheek. \u201cIt was really sad that more than 70% of couples said that their lives had deteriorated in the bedroom,\u201d says John, of his research. \u201cThey weren\u2019t having much fun with one another. The things that really draw people together, that enhance living, wind up being put on the garbage heap. It\u2019s certainly easy for relationships to become drudgery.\u201d\n\nJohn and Julie met in a coffee house in Seattle in 1986. John had recently moved to the city and was getting to know his new home: mainly, he says, by answering personals ads in the newspaper. \u201cI dated 60 women. In three months.\u201d Julie laughs and says: \u201cHe made a job of it.\u201d Julie walked into the cafe and he invited her to join him: \u201cJulie was number 61.\u201d They were married within a year. How did they know each other was the right person? \u201cWe\u2019d had other relationships so we had a lot of negative comparisons,\u201d says Julie. \u201cWe\u2019d made so many mistakes, and you really learn from your mistakes. Lo and behold, here\u2019s this beautiful person who thinks you\u2019re funny and cute, and whose eyes light up, and with whom you know you\u2019ll never be bored.\u201d They have worked together for much of that time. Even when they were newly married, they would go out \u201cand we would ask each other these big open-ended questions, just like the ones in the book\u201d, says Julie. John would bring a notebook on their nights out and make notes.\n\nBoth agree on the most productive category for them \u2013 dreams. Each year they take a holiday together (they call it a honeymoon) and discuss three things: what was bad about the previous year, what was good, and what they hope for the year ahead. \u201cWe really take some time to take a look at our lives and figure out how to make it better,\u201d says John. Julie adds: \u201cThat\u2019s where the dreaming comes in.\u201d\n\nFour weddings, four babies, one pair of lost knickers: celebrating 10 years of Blind date Read more\n\nThey seem happy and connected. What do they wish all couples knew? \u201cIf your partner is having one of the negative emotions \u2013 fear, anger, sadness \u2013 you approach it with interest and curiosity and really communicate: \u2018I want to know what you\u2019re feeling, I want to know what\u2019s going on with you,\u2019\u201d says John. Julie laughs and says it says a lot about their relationship that John focuses on listening when she chooses the opposite. \u201cMy thought is related to the speaker \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of responsibility for the health of the relationship from how you bring up issues,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I wish all couples knew is, when they have a concern or complaint, they need to describe themselves, not their partner.\u201d It\u2019s the difference between \u201cI\u2019m feeling hurt\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve hurt me\u201d.\n\nThey both still get it wrong, says John. \u201cWe\u2019re all facing the same kinds of problems and we need these blueprints,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not experts on relationships, we\u2019ve taken these ideas from real couples that we\u2019ve done research on. It\u2019s the data that\u2019s informing us, not our own expertise: we don\u2019t really have that, we\u2019re like any other couple, we struggle with the same things.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Eight Dates: Essential Conversations for a Lifetime of Love is published by Workman.
