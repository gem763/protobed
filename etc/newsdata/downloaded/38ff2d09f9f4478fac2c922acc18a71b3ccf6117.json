Still friends today.\u2019\n\nWhen a follower asked if his wife was someone connected to the case, they replied with a simple: \u2018No.\u2019\n\nAccording to Undisclosed, Sarah Koenig chose not to include this detail about his personal life in Serial, presumably to focus on the murder case.\n\nAdnan was 18 when he was convicted of Hae\u2019s murder (Picture: Syed Family, HBO)\n\nAdnan\u2019s said to be an exemplary inmate\n\nSocial life\n\nDespite being locked up for more than half his life, Adnan seems to have pretty good access to events in the outside world, as well as entertainment.\n\nRabia told the audience at the TCA panel in February: \u2018Adnan hears everything about himself from the news. The guards keep him updated. He gets all the newspapers and magazines.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerial host Sarah also detailed the extent of Adnan\u2019s entertainment, which includes video games.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe journalist said on podcast Fresh Air: \u2018He doesn\u2019t have Internet. \u2026 He has an Xbox, one of those game things for the TV, and apparently you can play a CD on it, so at one point I said, \u201cI can burn [Serial transcripts] onto CDs for you and send you those\u201d.\n\n\u2018I think he has to get special permission to receive a CD in prison, and he said, \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. I\u2019ll let you know when I get the permission\u201d.\u2019\n\nTrouble behind bars\n\nAdnan is said to be an upstanding inmate, rarely getting in trouble.\n\nHowever, he does have one infraction that is public knowledge, which is being found in possession of a mobile phone in 2009.\n\nThe Case of Adnan Syed is available to watch on Sky Crime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
