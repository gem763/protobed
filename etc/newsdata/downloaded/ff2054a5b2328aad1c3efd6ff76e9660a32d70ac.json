Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said if the whole House were to vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, that would be one thing.\n\nBut Democrats have been reluctant to do that.\n\nInstead, Mrs. Pelosi has unilaterally declared one, and the House Judiciary Committee has voted to approve various investigations, and they\u2019ve asked a federal judge to release grand jury information to them as part of that move.\n\nNeither step is sufficient, Mr. Collins argued.\n\n\u201cAn impeachment inquiry was authorized, in explicit terms, but the full House in the two previous cases where presidents were impeached,\u201d Mr. Collins wrote in his brief. \u201cIndeed, in the [Judiciary] Committee\u2019s 206-year history, the committee has never reported articles of impeachment against a president without first conducting an impeachment proceeding authorized by a full House vote.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, sent a letter to Mrs. Pelosi saying she\u2019s bungled the whole process. He urged her to suspend her impeachment push until she comes up with a firm plan.\n\nHe said she must answer whether she\u2019ll hold a full House vote, must say what powers the GOP minority will have in any investigation and must decide what role Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team will have in attending hearings, cross-examining witnesses or gaining access to evidence.\n\n\u201cBy answering \u2018no\u2019 to any of the above, you would be acting in direct contradiction to all modern impeachment inquiries of a sitting president,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, California Republican, wrote.\n\nRepublicans say there are two different investigative powers given to Congress.\n\nLawmakers have an oversight power, which comes from Article I of the Constitution and is used to further their ability to write legislation. But courts have held that power is limited.\n\nImpeachment is found in Article II of the Constitution, and has been considered a judicial proceeding \u2014 the House\u2019s articles of impeachment are a political indictment, and the Senate sits in judgment as jurors at a trial.\n\nAs a judicial proceeding, the courts have granted impeachment inquiries broader latitude to explore, including perhaps the ability to see information gleaned by a grand jury, which under normal rules is secret.\n\nMr. Collins says Congress has every right to take that step and launch an inquiry, but it can\u2019t be done on the cheap, and lawmakers must be willing to stand up and cast a vote in favor of it \u2014 and suffer any political repercussions for it.\n\nMrs. Pelosi on Wednesday rejected the idea of a vote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that there be a floor vote,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not anything that is excluded.\n\nYet she also suggested it would be a winnable vote were she to schedule it \u2014 and could even draw bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some Republicans that are very nervous about our bringing that vote to the floor,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
