It revealed technology for full-body avatars that can express body language to help users better understand the other person's emotions. It has also created 3D real-world environments that allows two people to enjoy together. The firm also touched on AR glasses that could teleport users on the go. These glasses would use LiveMaps to find a destination or view real world information.\n\n'This work will ultimately help us seamlessly overlay virtual objects on top of the real world and enhance our experience of daily life.'\n\nIn March, the research division released a serious of videos displaying lifelike floating heads called 'Codec Avatars'.\n\nThis technology allowed users to virtually converse with one another, as their real facial expressions were replicated on VR faces in second-by-second detail.\n\nFacebook said the project could one day ease the loneliness of long-distance family members, friendships or relationships by simulating what it feels like to be in the same room \u2013 and the firm is getting closer to making this happen.\n\nNow, the technology is able to measure facial expressions in real-time, as well as produce a full-body avatar, as the firm noted, 'body language is critical to our ability to communicate'.\n\n'While you won't find this technology in a consumer product anytime soon, we imagine a future where people will be able to create ultra-realistic avatars of themselves with just a few quick snaps of their phone cameras and animate them via their headsets,' Facebook Reality Labs shared.\n\n'And that future will usher in a new wave of fully immersive VR.'\n\nIn addition to creating lifelike avatars, Facebook Reality Labs is putting its efforts towards creating 3D models of real-world environments.\n\nAt the event, techniques were shown that create an environment where two people can be co-present with their avatars.\n\nThe technology is able to measure facial expressions in real-time, as well as produce a full-body avatar (pictured), as the firm noted, 'body language is critical to our ability to communicate'\n\nAnd this is one of the first technology in history that has allowed for this to happen.\n\n'Through a combination of a high-accuracy depth capture system, state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, a cutting-edge camera rig, and a dense reconstruction system, we're able to achieve a level of fidelity that's unprecedented in VR,' the research division stated.\n\nUsers can view their reflection in mirrors hanging on the wall and see the texture of the rugs on the floor with great detail.\n\nThe team has also suggested their technology could lead to cutting-edge AR glasses that have the ability to 'teleport while you're on the go'.\n\nAnd this is where LiveMaps will come in hand.\n\nUsing machine vision alongside localization and mapping technology, LiveMaps will create a shared virtual map that lets users choose their destinations.\n\nThe avatars can be designed to look just like its users and be immersed in a virtual world\n\nIn addition to teleportation, LiveMaps will one day allow you to search and share real-time information about the physical world.\n\nYou could see exactly where a store is or view the movie times on a theater marque.\n\n'Virtual reality lets us immerse ourselves in digital content, giving us the power to defy distance and physics while inventing and inhabiting new worlds,' Facebook Reality Labs stated.\n\n'Augmented reality takes virtual objects and adds them to our perception of the real world for an enhanced experience of the everyday.'\n\n'Taken together, these technologies stand to reinvent the way we connect with the world around us \u2014 and with each other.", "description": "From fully-body avatars to 3D environments to teleporting AR glasses  --Facebook Reality Labs revealed its plans and technology to create a social presence with VR and AR", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/23/18938944-0-image-a-91_1569450089919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
