I used their cars to transport stuff to the venue in Leeds, my grandma helped out with sewing material for me to have on the floor,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThe feedback was amazing. I thought, 'If I can sell this many tickets in a week how many will I sell in a month?'\u201d\n\nAfter being launched with a Facebook post, Faye\u2019s company BoomChikkaBoom now hosts raves for groups of between 10 and 600 parents and babies.\n\nShe opened her own venue in April and has even hosted parties for the offspring of celebrity couples like footballer Peter Crouch and model Abbey Clancy.\n\nNow they have a snow machine, bubble machine and disco lights to create the ultimate party atmosphere and charge on average \u00a36 for an adult and child, and \u00a32 for additional children to take part.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a Take That versus a Spice Girls rave, and reggae, rock, old school, trap, metal, RnB themes. We\u2019ll do a Halloween remix and in August we held a Pride rave, where everybody came dressed in rainbow colours,\" Fay said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of working out what people want and adapting it.\n\n\u201cWe react to the crowd and change things up if we need to, which is why it\u2019s so good. They last between one to three hours.\"\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/RICHARD MCCARTHY)\n\nAnd more than just fun for the parents, there's also a benefit for the children.\n\n\u201cThe kids get a real confidence boost from it. It\u2019s good to help bring children out of their shells,\" Faye said.\n\n\u201cSometimes you will see a child walk in that looks a bit worried or shy and you can guarantee they will be getting involved by the end of the session.\n\n\u201cOne little boy was scared of the music we had, so we changed the music and he got to press the button on the snow machine, which was a huge confidence boost for him.\"\n\nThe benefits extend beyond small children, too.\n\nThey now host raves at care homes and respite centres for adults with learning disabilities.\n\n\u201cWe want to teach everybody to dance or do a routine. In the care home, we get them waving their hands and dancing away,\" Faye said.\n\n\u201cIt suits every age. We just try and adapt it, which is what is unique about the company.\"\n\nAnd all that from a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cI never had a business plan for this, I never set out to do this and really make money from it. It was something to do while I had a baby because there was nothing else like it,\" Faye said.\n\n\u201cI started off on my own and now I employ 10 full time staff.\n\n\u201cAs a parent, I still go to the events the company hosts when I\u2019m not running them, because I know I will like it.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be for a short time while I had my son, but I\u2019ve built it up and now I\u2019m so passionate about it.\"", "description": "Generally, having children means you cut back on your clubbing - but for one savvy mum the arrival of her little one led to a successful business throwing raves for toddlers instead", "authors": ["Harriet Whitehead", "James Andrews", "Image", "Pa Real Life Richard Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704899.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Faye-Kenny-baby-raves.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
