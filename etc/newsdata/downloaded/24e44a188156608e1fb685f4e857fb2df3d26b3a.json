'So I felt like in the first-half I affected the game more than I did in the second-half.'\n\nHis comments aren't likely to go down well with Howe, who often plays Fraser in what the player perceives to be his weaker position on the right as opposed to the left.\n\nChelsea can win ugly under Lampard\n\nThere have been some truly impressive, free-flowing wins by Frank Lampard's Chelsea this season - notably away at Wolves and Southampton.\n\nBut the Blues manager will have found Saturday's hard-fought 1-0 win over Newcastle equally, if not more, satisfactory.\n\nFrank Lampard gives match-winner Marcos Alonso a hug after Saturday's win over Newcastle\n\nNot only did it prove Chelsea can keep a clean sheet - this was only the second of his tenure in all competitions - but it proved they can win ugly and when not at their best.\n\nThey didn't look themselves in the first-half but improved vastly after the break and finally gained their reward when Marcos Alonso drilled home the winner.\n\nAnd, almost by stealth, that was a fifth straight victory for Lampard's men in all competitions and they're up into the Premier League top four.\n\nVichai would be proud of Leicester's progress\n\nIt would have been easy for the Srivaddhanaprabha family to walk away from Leicester City following the tragic helicopter crash that killed owner Vichai on October 27 last year.\n\nInstead, Vichai's son Aiyawatt, known as 'Top', pledged to continue his father's legacy and the club continues to make progress.\n\n'Top' not only made the right call in appointing Brendan Rodgers as manager in February having dispensed of Claude Puel, but also backed the manager in the transfer market over the summer.\n\nLeicester defeated Burnley 2-1 on Saturday having honoured Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha\n\nAnd while a repeat of their astonishing 2016 Premier League title triumph isn't likely, there's no reason why Leicester can't finish this season in the top four.\n\nSaturday's battling win over Burnley, on an emotional day at the King Power Stadium, was secured through goals by Jamie Vardy and Youri Tielemans.\n\nSpurs need the real Dele Alli back\n\nDele Alli is only 23 but you get the distinct impression plenty of people are ready to write off his career already.\n\nAn injury-plagued campaign in 2018-19 was also marked by poor form and further setbacks at the start of his campaign led to Dele losing his England place.\n\nMemories of Dele being ranked among the finest midfield talents in Europe already seem distant but his performance on Saturday was one of precious few bright points in Spurs' lacklustre 1-1 draw with Watford.\n\nDele Alli scores Tottenham's crucial equaliser in their 1-1 draw against Watford on Saturday\n\nHe scored an absolutely crucial late equaliser to spare Tottenham the embarrassment of defeat and Dele now needs to use that as a springboard for the remainder of the season.\n\nSpurs definitely need him to restore not only a bit of swagger, but his in-built aggressive streak, to his play.\n\nVAR could be Southampton's player of the season\n\nSouthampton had a distinct style when managed by Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman, and there are signs that Ralph Hassenhuttl is trying to stamp his own mark on the team.\n\nThey lined up in a 3-4-2-1 at Wolves on Saturday, the fourth time they've fielded three at the back this season, and they just about succeeded in stopping the likes of Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez in a 1-1 draw at Molineux.\n\nVAR came to Southampton's rescue twice in their 1-1 draw at Wolves on Saturday afternoon\n\nBut not before seeing Wolves have two goals disallowed by the Video Assistant Referee.\n\nSeven goals against the Saints have now been ruled out by the VAR this season and they'd certainly been in the relegation zone without it.\n\nGabriel Jesus's stats are insane\n\nWhy don't we talk about Gabriel Jesus in the same breath as Kylian Mbappe as the best young striker in world football?\n\nThe Brazilian, 22, scored his 50th goal for Manchester City in their 2-0 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday night.\n\nThat has come in 108 appearances for the club since his arrival in January 2017. Perhaps a better stat is that Jesus has been directly involved in 58 goals in 64 starts for City in all competitions.\n\nGabriel Jesus scored his 50th Manchester City goal in their 2-0 win at Crystal Palace\n\nThey're certainly impressive returns and remember that he has also been affected by a couple of injury setbacks in that time.\n\nAlarmingly for the remainder of the Premier League, City won't be short of firepower for quite some years to come.\n\nMan United urgently need to improve their game management\n\nGiven that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is trying to hark back to Manchester United's Sir Alex Ferguson glory years in so many ways, here's one thing they really need to work on.\n\nYou'd hardly ever see a Ferguson team chuck away a lead, especially at Old Trafford, and it was even a trend continued by his successors.\n\nAdam Lallana sneaks in behind the Man United defence to score Liverpool's equaliser\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side have chucked away eight points from winning positions\n\nIn 282 home Premier League games prior to Sunday's 1-1 draw with Liverpool, United had never lost when ahead at half-time. Indeed they'd gone on to win 265 of them.\n\nNot so on Sunday as Adam Lallana's late equaliser meant Solskjaer's team have now chucked away eight points from winning positions in nine league games this season.\n\nHad they showed more effective game management to get themselves over the line, Solskjaer's side would be sitting third in the table as opposed to 13th.\n\nSame old problems for Arsenal\n\nAs The Who sang in Won't Get Fooled Again, 'meet the new boss, same as the old boss.'\n\nThe lyric came to mind watching Arsenal's abject performance in losing 1-0 to Sheffield United on Monday night, 90 minutes that left you wondering whether Unai Emery really is an upgrade on Arsene Wenger.\n\nArsenal fans can rightly question whether Unai Emery has been an upgrade on Arsene Wenger\n\nA distinct lack of cohesion, passive when not in possession, unimaginative when in possession, devoid of leadership and lacking the mentality needed to win in a northern town on a midweek evening.\n\nJust two clean sheets in their last 24 matches away from home plus four defeats in their last seven away encounters with newly-promoted teams says it all really.\n\nHas anything changed in the last year-and-a-bit?", "description": "Sportsmail's ADAM SHERGOLD takes a look at 10 things we learned from the season's ninth round of Premier League fixtures as Man United chucked away another lead.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20029362-0-image-a-27_1571738382634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
