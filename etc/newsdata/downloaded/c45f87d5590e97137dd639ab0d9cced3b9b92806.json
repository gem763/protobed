No one told me there would be anything wrong with going or that I could possibly be offending anyone. With that being said, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve hurt or offended anyone, that was not my intention.\n\n\u201cSometimes people present you with opportunities and no one tells you the potential backlash you could face in return,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis was meant to be a spiritual experience for me, NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT and now I realize it hurt people and for that I\u2019m sorry. Sorry I\u2019m not more educated, and sorry for thinking this trip was just a spiritual experience.\u201d\n\nMs. Lovato had shared several photos on Instagram from her trip to Israel this week, where she was baptized and also visited the Western Wall, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, and the Shalva National Center, where she was photographed holding a little girl with special needs.\n\n\u201cSpirituality is so important to me\u2026to be baptized in the Jordan river \u2013 the same place Jesus was baptized \u2013 I\u2019ve never felt more renewed in my life,\u201d the singer wrote Tuesday. \u201cThis trip has been so important for my well-being, my heart, and my soul. I\u2019m grateful for the memories made and the opportunity to be able to fill the God-sized hole in my heart. Thank you for having me, Israel.\u201d\n\nThe posts, which no longer allow for commenting, apparently garnered criticism from pro-Palestinian activists and those who oppose the Israeli government.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
