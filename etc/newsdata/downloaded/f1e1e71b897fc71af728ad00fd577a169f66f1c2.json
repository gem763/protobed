We looked at NFLX on Wednesday ahead of earnings and wrote that, \"NFLX is showing a little improvement in the technical position of the stock ahead of earnings Wednesday night. Prices could continue their recent improvement but a sustained rally is likely to need a big and developed base pattern. Things could change but for now only experienced short-term traders should be involved with NFLX.\"\n\nIn this two-day intraday chart of NFLX, below, we can see the upside price gap from the opening this morning. Some of this gap is going to be filled but I suspect a large part of this price void will not be retraced. With maybe 22 million shares sold short before the earnings reaction, bearish traders will probably use any intraday weakness to cover shorts.\n\nIn this updated Point and Figure chart of NFLX, below, we can see that prices reached the $307 price target. No gap is shown this style of charting. Prices are at the upper end of a resistance area from $300 to $320 so we are likely to see some sideways price action before renewed gains.\n\nBottom line strategy: NFLX's rally today is a wake up call to the bears. I would look for some sideways price action followed eventually by further strength to the $340 area.", "description": "Prices reached the $307 price target from the Point and Figure chart so now what?...NFLX", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Netflix Needs To Catch Its Breadth Before Further Strength", "Prices Reached The", "Price Target The Point", "Figure Chart So Now What", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/b6b121cd-f0d6-11e9-93dd-5784ce40c25b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
