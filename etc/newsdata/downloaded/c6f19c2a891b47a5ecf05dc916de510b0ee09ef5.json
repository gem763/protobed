The other report, \u201c2018 U.S. Utility-Scale Photovoltaics-Plus-Energy Storage System Cost Benchmark,\u201d establishes NREL\u2019s first benchmark of PV-plus-storage costs.\n\nCosts Fall for Residential and Commercial Standalone PV\n\nSpecifically, the Q1 PV cost benchmarks are $2.70 per watt of direct current (Wdc) for residential systems (a 4.9 percent cost decline), $1.83 per Wdc for commercial systems (a 2.6 percent decrease), $1.06 per Wdc for fixed-tilt utility-scale systems (a 1.9 percent increase), and $1.13 per Wdc for one-axis-tracking utility-scale systems (a 0.9 percent increase).\n\n\u201cHigher-voltage inverter designs, lower inverter prices, and higher module efficiencies contributed to cost reductions,\u201d said Ran Fu, who authored the report with fellow NREL researchers David Feldman, Mike Woodhouse, and Robert Margolis. On the other hand, higher module prices, higher labor wages, and higher steel prices raised costs. In the utility sector, where PV modules represent a larger portion of overall project costs, increased module prices helped to drive the slight increase in installed solar costs.\n\nNew Benchmark Established for Battery Storage Costs\n\nFu and Margolis, along with fellow NREL researcher Timothy Remo, authored a companion report that provides NREL\u2019s first cost benchmarking of energy storage and PV-plus-storage systems. The report, \u201c2018 U.S. Utility-Scale Photovoltaics-Plus-Energy Storage System Cost Benchmark\u201d models the costs of several standalone lithium-ion storage and PV-plus-storage system configurations.\n\nFor a standalone storage system, assuming a constant battery price of $209 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the installed system costs vary from $380/kWh for a four-hour battery system to $895/kWh for a 30-minute battery system.\n\nHistorically, most PV-plus-storage systems have installed PV and storage systems in separate locations. However, the report finds that co-locating the PV and storage subsystems reduces costs related to site preparation, land acquisition, permitting, interconnection, labor, and hardware.\n\nBoth reports and their models can be used to estimate future cost-reduction opportunities for PV and PV-plus-storage systems, helping to guide research and track costs.
