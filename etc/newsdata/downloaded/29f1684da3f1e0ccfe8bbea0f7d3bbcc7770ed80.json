Newsom also signed legislation tightening age verification requirements for the sale of tobacco products.\n\nNEW YORK STATE AND CHICAGO\n\nOn Sunday, Cuomo said New York state\u2019s health commissioner would formally ban all flavoured e-cigarettes besides tobacco and menthol later this week.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Monday she was leading a move to ban the sale of flavoured vaping and tobacco products in the third-largest U.S. city.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration last week announced plans to remove flavoured e-cigarettes from store shelves nationwide.\n\nAt a news conference in the state capital, Sacramento, Newsom urged state legislators to send him a bill in its next session to ban flavoured e-cigarettes in California, saying he lacked the power to impose such restrictions outright.\n\nThe Democratic governor unveiled a package of measures, including a $20 million statewide social media campaign to educate young people about health dangers from vaping nicotine and cannabis products.\n\nNewsom cited data showing vaping devices were the most commonly used tobacco products in California and that more than 80% of high school students who consume tobacco do so by vaping.\n\nHe also said nearly 87% of California teens who consumed tobacco products reported using a flavoured product, and that more than 15,500 e-liquid flavours were on the market.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man uses a vape as he walks on Broadway in New York City, U.S., September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe share of high school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years, with 27.5% reporting they had tried an e-cigarette in the past month, according to preliminary federal data released last week. That was up from 20.8% using e-cigarettes last year and 11.7% a year earlier.\n\nThe emergence of e-cigarettes has reversed gains made by public health authorities in curbing tobacco use by young people.\n\nNearly 400 people nationwide have been stricken with a lung illness that is potentially vaping-related, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six have died.", "description": "California's governor on Monday ordered a public awareness campaign on health risks from vaping, part of a multi-pronged effort to combat what he called a \"youth epidemic,\" but said he lacked authority to impose a ban on flavoured e-cigarettes.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430553183&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1FF", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
