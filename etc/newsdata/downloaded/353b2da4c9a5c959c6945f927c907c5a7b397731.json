I was terrible at figuring out who was fake. You look at everyone individually and think they're fake, you sort of go off your own experiences, and that's what makes it so good. The fact that liars won last time says it all really.\"\n\nShe added: \"[It wasn't easy to spot the fakes], especially now I was hosting the show. I thought couples who were genuine are fake and the fake ones are lovers.\"\n\nEastEnders star Danny left viewers in stitches with his quick-witted take-downs of contestants on series one, and Dani says this time is no different.\n\n(Image: MTV)\n\n(Image: MTV)\n\nShe said: \"I've heard a few things from this series and he's such a wind up, especially now I'm on it.\n\n\"He does a few things and I'm like, 'How dare you?' but it works and he bigs me up as well so it's really cute.\"\n\nDani says she loves working with her dad, and thinks the bond she has with him and her mum Joanne Mas is stronger because they were so young when they had her.\n\nThe reality beauty, who is loved-up with boyfriend Sammy Kimmece, said: \"It's so nice to work with my dad as well, we get on so well.\n\n\"We're doing Nativity the Musical [again this year] as well. We don't bicker, we have a really good time and heart to hearts and it just works.\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\n\"I think because they were only 19 when they had me I was sort of brought up with them so they're like my friends as well as my mum and dad.\"\n\nTrue Love Or True Lies kicks off on October 21, and Dani said it's definitely one to watch.\n\nShe told us: \"There were so many shocks every night and I literally didn't know what was going to happen.\n\n\"There were moments when people were arguing, then heartwarming moments as well, it was a rollercoaster and I really think people are going to love it. I was so invested in everyone else's lives.\"\n\n* True Love Or True Lies premieres October 21 at 9pm on MTV and continues every night for two weeks\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
