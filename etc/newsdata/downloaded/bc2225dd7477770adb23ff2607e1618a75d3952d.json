In a now-deleted tweet, Azalea wrote, \u201cImagine thinking I was his biggest blunder lmaoooooooooooooo Tip. Sweetie. We have a whole list for you.\u201d\n\nAzalea added in a follow-up tweet: \u201cThe tea I could spill on what bulls\u2014t this is but at the end of the day I think people can see it\u2019s clear he\u2019s salty. He\u2019s a huge misogynist and has never been able to have a conversation with any woman in which he doesn\u2019t speak like a fortune cookie.\u201d\n\nThe Australian rapper has a long history with T.I. The \u201cLive Your Life\u201d MC signed Azalea onto his Grand Hustle label just months after the release of her debut mixtape Ignorant Act in 2011. In 2012, Azalea released \u201cMurda Bizness,\u201d which featured T.I. and was set to become the lead single off of The New Classic.\n\nView photos Iggy Azalea and T.I. in 2014 | Kevin Mazur/WireImage More\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Iggy Azalea Jokingly Tells Fans to Stream \u2018Se\u00f1orita\u2019 as Lizzo Tries to Beat Her Billboard Record\n\nIn 2012, the \u201cKream\u201d M.C. had only positive things to say about Tip.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I felt like I was just floating around in a big ocean. I got picked up and caught by a label [Interscope], and it was very impersonal,\u201d she told Interview then. \u201cIt felt like I was a product. When I met him and everybody else over at [Grand Hustle], it felt like I was with real people again. He cared about me as a friend, not just as a check. I want to know that when I make mistakes, I have a label and a family who won\u2019t desert me.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2015, T.I. said he was no longer interested in working with Azalea as their relationship \u201ctook a bit of a rest stop.\u201d The separation came after Azalea feuded with fellow rapper Azaelia Banks on Twitter, leading Q-Tip to send out a series of tweets schooling the \u201cStarted\u201d rapper on the history of hip-hop and its relationship to race and politics.\n\nView photos Iggy Azalea and T.I. | Kevin Winter/Getty More", "description": "Iggy Azalea Calls T.I.
