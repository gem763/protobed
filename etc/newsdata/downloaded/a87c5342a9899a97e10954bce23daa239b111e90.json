That\u2019s because a lot of the energy used to get that video to your eyeballs happens at the network and device level.\n\nBy sending only sound to users who aren\u2019t watching, the company could reduce its annual carbon footprint by the equivalent of about 300,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. That\u2019s about the same amount of the greenhouse gas produced by 30,000 homes in the UK every year, according to a University of Bristol press release.\n\nPeople watch a billion hours of YouTube every day, and each of those views sucks up energy. There\u2019s your phone or computer, the internet or cell network that carries the video to you, and the servers at data centers that host videos and send them on their way. Companies like Google (YouTube\u2019s parent company) have focused a lot on making the latter more energy efficient and on buying up renewable energy to offset the massive amounts of carbon dioxide produced by dirtier energy sources, like coal or natural gas, that often power their data centers.\n\nPeople watch a billion hours of YouTube every day\n\nCorporate efforts to make the digital pipeline more environmentally friendly tend to focus on these data centers, Chris Preist, lead author of the study and professor of sustainability and computer systems at the University of Bristol, explains in an email. \u201cBut we could see that the impact of digital services spreads beyond that,\u201d Preist says.\n\nPreist and his colleague Dan Schien first started looking at the carbon footprint of digitally focused companies in 2011, with a project focused on the carbon footprint of news organization The Guardian. After The Guardian project, Preist and his colleagues decided to zero in on YouTube.\n\nGoogle had already publicly released data about YouTube usage, giving the researchers a great starting point. They were also really intrigued by one particular way that people use YouTube: to listen to music in the background while they\u2019re doing other things online. Sending video to computers takes energy, but if people aren\u2019t watching, that energy becomes what Preist calls \u201cdigital waste.\u201d\n\nthe equivalent of 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide\n\nYanking back 300,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year is big, but it\u2019s still only a fraction of the total energy that we invest in getting videos to our phones and computers. By comparison, the researchers estimated that, in 2016, streaming videos on YouTube produced the equivalent of 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. (The Verge emailed YouTube for comment but did not hear back as of press time.)\n\nThere are a few caveats. First of all, the researchers didn\u2019t have access to YouTube\u2019s internal data on energy usage, so all of their numbers are estimates and are focused only on data from 2016. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to measure a carbon footprint directly, so scientists are often forced to estimate how much carbon is produced by different activities. In this case, the authors went with more conservative estimates, assuming, for example, that people mostly watched videos on lower-resolution settings (which use less energy). Because of that, \u201cour figure is very likely to be an underestimate of the actual footprint.\u201d Preist says.\n\nAlso, the research doesn\u2019t look at how much carbon was produced during the manufacturing process of computers, phones, and servers \u2014 all the hardware that makes streaming possible. \u201cThis is important and valuable work,\u201d Preist says of hardware\u2019s environmental impact. \u201cBut it\u2019s not directly relevant to our key question: how can climate change consideration be factored into the design and running of digital services?\u201d\n\nPreist thinks that the burden of reducing streaming\u2019s carbon footprint should rest on the companies that host and stream the content, not people tuning in to makeup tutorials, music videos, cooking shows, and vlogs.\n\n\u201cIt is really important that the service designers take responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor global digital services, they have large footprints because billions of us use them. Our individual footprint is small.\u201d Preist says. \u201cIt is really important that the service designers take responsibility for measures which can reduce the overall footprint, rather than individuals feeling they need to \u2018cut down\u2019 for environmental reasons.\u201d", "description": "If people who are only listening to videos don\u2019t have images playing, companies like YouTube might make themselves more Earth-friendly, a new study finds.
