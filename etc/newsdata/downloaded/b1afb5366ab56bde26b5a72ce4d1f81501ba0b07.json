Now, she is sharing her story for the first time to raise awareness of uterus didelphys.\n\nMolly-Rose from Gillingham, Kent, said: \u2018When I first started my periods, doctors would blame my age and say my body is still young and can\u2019t cope.\n\nShe was repeatedly dismissed by doctors (Picture: Caters News)\n\n\u2018But now I know it is because I am having two periods at once, I have been on birth control since 12-years-old to try and reduce the heavy flow and fainting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As I got into my early teens, I attempted to use tampons, but it would fall straight out, I thought maybe it was normal.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t until I became sexually active with my then boyfriend, I began to worry as it was impossible and very painful.\n\n\u2018I noticed there was a piece of skin in the middle and two holes and I felt so embarrassed.\n\n\u2018From the outside, you would never even know, even the doctors didn\u2019t as I had attended three appointments.\n\nMolly-Rose ended up researching for her own diagnosis (Picture: Caters News)\n\n\u2018Before my diagnosis I was advised to get tested for a sexually transmitted disease due to the bleeding and abnormal discharge.\n\n\u2018It came back all clear, as predicted \u2013 I knew something was wrong and began to research myself which was a challenge itself.\u2019\n\nMolly-Rose says there was a lack of knowledge and awareness in the medical practise and she had to tirelessly research online before finding uterus didelphys.\n\nShe adds: \u2018There wasn\u2019t any leaflets for me to read nor doctors who could help me understand my condition which is why it took so long for me to get a diagnosis.\n\n\u2018I told my GP that I know what it is and was referred to a gynaecologist and I requested general anaesthetic for the intrusive vaginal scan.\n\n\u2018I went on to have general anaesthetic for my second gynaecologist appointment as it was too painful for me having the scan that I had at university college London hospital.\n\nIt was descovered she had two vaginas (Picture: Caters News)\n\n\u2018I was desperate to get some answers. It was best for me to sleep during the examination to avoid me tensing up again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Within ten minutes, they confirmed I have two uteruses, two cervixes and two vaginas \u2013 I felt so happy to finally know what is wrong.\u2019\n\nIn August 2017, Molly-Rose had an operation for the longitudinal septum to be removed at the University College of London Hospital.\n\nShe says it would do \u2018more harm than good\u2019 for doctors to attempt to remove any of her doubled reproductive organs.\n\nMolly-Rose adds: \u2018Although I may face some complications when I am ready to start a family as there is a high chance of miscarrying \u2013 at least I can now plan ahead as I am aware.\n\n\u2018I tend not to dwell on my condition, and I will cross that bridge when I get there.\n\n\u2018If I wasn\u2019t persistent, then I would still be clueless, and I am sharing my story to raise awareness for other girls and women who may be going through the same.\u2019\n\nMORE: Cat abandoned with heartbreaking note saying owners \u2018can\u2019t afford\u2019 him anymore\n\nSPONSORED: Ten practical things to try if you want to give up cigarettes\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Molly-Rose Taylor, 19, was diagnosed with the rare condition known as uterus didelphys \u2013 which caused her to have two vaginas, two cervix's and two wombs.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89994204_1571202555.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
