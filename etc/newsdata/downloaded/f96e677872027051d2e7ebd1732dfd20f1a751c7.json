Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 Nick Bosa just had to bring some extra heat for Baker Mayfield.\n\nAnd it went beyond trolling the Cleveland Browns Browns quarterback by mimicking the \u201cplant the flag\u201d gesture after one of his two sacks during the 31-3 romp on Monday night. The San Francisco 49ers rookie defensive end also tried to get into Mayfield\u2019s head with some serious trash-talking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually talk, but this game, yeah, I talked,\u201d Bosa said after having a huge hand in Mayfield\u2019s worst NFL game. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say one word.\u201d\n\nBosa was surely a man out for some revenge, still mindful of the incident two years ago when Mayfield planted an Oklahoma flag in Ohio State\u2019s home stadium after he led the Sooners to victory.\n\nYet as the rout unfolded and Mayfield (8-for-22, 100 yards, 0 TDs, 2 INTs) produced a career-worst 13.4 passer rating, Bosa was relentless in mocking the quarterback.\n\nWhat exactly did he say to Mayfield?\n\n\u201cBaker, Baker,\u201d Bosa said softly, singing the name like a nursery rhyme \u2014 or punch line from a horror film. \u201cHow are you feeling? I want a challenge.\u201d\n\nSTATEMENT WIN: 49ers stay unbeaten after rout of Browns\n\nNOW THAT'S FAST: 49ers RB hits top max speed in past 2 seasons\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nBOSA JUST PLANTED HIS FLAG IN SAN FRAN \ud83d\ude24 @nbsmallerbearpic.twitter.com/wsoVZVAXiX \u2014 The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) October 8, 2019\n\nIn addition to his sacks, Bosa forced a fumble, recorded another fumble was forced by linemate DeForest Buckner, had two of his four tackles result in losses, and was credited with five quarterback hits. In other words, a dominant performance as part of an overwhelming unit.\n\nThat Mayfield didn\u2019t verbally respond to Bosa\u2019s attempts to goad him hardly mattered. Bosa sensed that the 6-foot-1 Mayfield, sacked four times, had trouble seeing over the inside rush from D-tackles Buckner and Arik Armstead, who are both listed at 6-foot-7.\n\n\u201cHe was double-clutching, going back and forth,\u201d Bosa said, referring to the hesitation he saw in Mayfield as he tried to work through progressions on passing plays. \u201cWe had him rattled all game.\u201d\n\nJust as Bosa expected.\n\n\u201cWe rush well,\u201d he said of the dominant defensive front. \u201cAll four of us. All of the backups. We\u2019ve been rattling all the quarterbacks we play. I just knew he would hold on to it, which we love.\u201d\n\nAnd Bosa also knew he couldn\u2019t wait to plant the flag ... after planting the quarterback.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
