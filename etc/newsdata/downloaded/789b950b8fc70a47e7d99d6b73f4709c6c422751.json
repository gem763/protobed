In August 2011, the elite special forces unit suffered the worst battlefield calamity in its history. A Taliban fighter shot down a Chinook helicopter carrying 22 Navy SEAL Team 6 members in Afghanistan. All 38 persons on board \u2014 the Navy SEAL warriors, other U.S. military personnel and seven Afghan soldiers \u2014 were killed. Grieving family members have been demanding answers. They may now get some as Congress finally opens an investigation.\n\nNavy SEAL Team 6 has attained international prominence for one reason: They were responsible for killing Osama bin Laden. They are American heroes. Yet, their own government betrayed them. Several days after the bin Laden operation, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 in a pathetic attempt to spike the football and gloat \u2014 publicly revealed their central role in the raid. His revelations put a giant target on the backs of every Navy SEAL Team 6 member. A covert unit, whose mission is to operate in the murky shadows, was exposed as the group that eliminated al Qaeda\u2019s chief mastermind. Mr. Biden\u2019s reckless actions \u2014 followed by President Obama\u2019s own words acknowledging the secret unit\u2019s operation \u2014 jeopardized the Navy SEALs\u2019 safety. Jihadists bent on revenge began an intense manhunt. The hunters now became the hunted.\n\nUpon hearing of Mr. Biden\u2019s disclosure, SEAL members were stunned. Many of them immediately contacted family members, warning them to eradicate all personal information from social-media sites. Aaron Vaughn, one of the SEALs eventually killed in the ambush, told his mother, Karen Vaughn, to delete every reference to SEAL Team 6 from her Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n\n\u201cI never heard Aaron this concerned and worried in his entire life,\u201d Mrs. Vaughn said in an interview. \u201cHe called me and said, \u2018Mom, you and Dad have to take everything down. Biden has just put a huge target on everybody.\u2019\u201d\n\nTragically, Aaron Vaughn was right. Mr. Biden is often portrayed in the liberal media as an amiable buffoon. His gaffes are written off as Joe simply being Joe \u2014 a loveable uncle figure who has a tendency to shoot his mouth off. That is pernicious nonsense. Mr. Biden is a cynical opportunist, who will say and do anything to advance Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda. He hung the SEALs out to dry in order to score cheap political points. He compromised a highly sensitive, covert operation that ended up costing dozens of U.S. lives.\n\nSEAL-gate is potentially a bigger scandal than Benghazi, Libya. The administration \u2014 along with the top military brass \u2014 are desperately trying to cover up what took place on that fateful raid. Taliban guerrillas were waiting for the Chinook as it approached its landing site. Apparently, someone tipped them off that the SEALs were coming; the helicopter was attacked from three sides in a coordinated ambush. The U.S. military claimed that the Chinook was blown to pieces by a shoulder-fired missile, in which everyone on board was burned beyond recognition. Hence, senior military officials ordered the American bodies cremated without the prior approval of their family members.\n\nThe military\u2019s narrative, however, is false. Charles Strange, whose son, Michael, died during the attack, says he viewed the pictures of the crash site. \u201cI saw Mike\u2019s dead body,\u201d Mr. Strange said in an interview. \u201cIt was clearly recognizable. He was clutching his gun. He wasn\u2019t burned to a crisp. Why did they cremate my boy? They didn\u2019t need to do that. Something\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous questions that need to be answered. Why was the Chinook\u2019s black box never found? The military claims it was washed away in a flash flood. Impossible. Flash flooding is extremely rare \u2014 almost unheard of \u2014 in that part of Afghanistan. Why was the Chinook not given aerial backup, which is standard military procedure when special forces are deployed?\n\nEven more alarming, why were the seven Afghan soldiers who boarded the Chinook at the last minute different from those on the flight manifest? This clearly violated U.S. military protocol. Afghan strangers (al Qaeda suicide bombers?) got on that Chinook, and potentially sabotaged the raid.\n\nAfghanistan President Hamid Karzai\u2019s regime has been infiltrated with al Qaeda sympathizers. Only the naive could dismiss the possibility of an inside job: Jihadi cash in exchange for information about the whereabouts of our SEALs. If our supposed ally cut a deal with the Taliban, resulting in the slaughter of U.S. troops, it would be a humiliating blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s failed Afghanistan policy.\n\nThe most important question of all remains the strict rules of engagement. Why were U.S. troops deployed into battle in a Chinook jalopy made in the 1960s and ordered not to fire back at Taliban snipers? Washington has imposed such severe rules of engagement \u2014 the inability to fire into civilian areas, the refusal to conduct night operations, and the reluctance to confront the regular occurrence of Afghan soldiers deliberately shooting American personnel \u2014 that defeat is not only likely, it\u2019s inevitable.\n\nCongressional Republicans must get to the bottom of this burgeoning scandal. Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Darrell E. Issa of California have now launched an official probe into the deaths of the SEALs. Thirty brave warriors honorably served their country \u2014 only to be betrayed. Those responsible must be exposed and punished. Justice demands it.\n\nJeffrey T.
