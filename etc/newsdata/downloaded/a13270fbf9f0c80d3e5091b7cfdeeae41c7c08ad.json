No team is dominating the Pac-12 quite like the Rainbow Warriors at this point in the year.\n\n\u201cI think beating two Pac-12 teams has given them a little bit of belief that they can handle it,\u201d Rolovich said.\n\nHawaii will get its shot at improving to 3-0 against the Pac-12 when it leaves the islands for the first time this season to face No. 23 Washington on Saturday. It\u2019s been a charmed beginning for the Warriors, opening the season with a solid win over Arizona before last week\u2019s rally for a 31-28 win over Oregon State.\n\nWhile the Wildcats and Beavers don\u2019t represent the elite of the Pac-12, it\u2019s still a major accomplishment for Rolovich\u2019s rebuilding Warriors.\n\n\u201cThey know Washington has been better than Arizona and Oregon State in the Pac-12,\u201d Rolovich said. \u201cThey understand it\u2019s on the road, it\u2019s going to be loud, it\u2019s going to be wet. We\u2019ve got to get on a plane for the first time this year so there is a little bit more but I think this team will handle it well.\u201d\n\nWashington (1-1, 0-1 Pac-12) is looking to rebound after last week\u2019s odd home loss to California . After sitting through a delay of 2 \u00bd hours due to severe storms, the Huskies played late into the night, making enough mistakes along the way for California to capitalize on and escape with a 20-19 win in a game that ended at 1:22 a.m.\n\nThe loss snapped Washington\u2019s 15-game home win streak and raised concerns about a defense that was run over in the second half and an offense that settled for too many field goals.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a really good team coming in here, because it\u2019s completely unique,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing, you don\u2019t see it. They\u2019re back to the run-and-shoot, which you don\u2019t see a lot. \u2026 You don\u2019t see what they\u2019re doing out there. They\u2019re good at it.\u201d\n\nOther things to watch as the schools meet for the first time since 2014, a 17-16 win by the Huskies in Petersen\u2019s first game with Washington:\n\nEASON SEASON\n\nWashington QB Jacob Eason was fantastic in the opener, throwing for four touchdowns and looking confident. His second game was a much bigger struggle as California\u2019s secondary flustered the Huskies quarterback. Eason was 18 of 30 for 162 yards and an interception. He wasn\u2019t helped by his receivers, who dropped at least six passes.\n\n\u201cI thought he played well, and I think he\u2019s going to continue to grow in the system,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI think he\u2019s still getting used to some things, but you put the tape on and kind of see what he was looking at, and it makes sense. But I thought he did a good job.\u201d\n\nBACK FROM THE BENCH\n\nHawaii quarterback Cole McDonald was benched in the fourth quarter of the opening win against Arizona after throwing four interceptions. He responded well to the decision by Rolovich by throwing for 421 yards and four touchdowns against Oregon State. He was also much better protecting the ball, with only one interception against the Beavers. McDonald is fourth nationally in yards passing (399.5) and TD passes (eight).\n\nMcDonald and his bevy of pass catchers will be tested by Washington\u2019s standout secondary led by senior safety Myles Bryant.\n\nUNDER PRESSURE\n\nWashington has been able to get to the quarterback through two games. The Huskies have seven sacks after two weeks. A year ago, Washington had just eight sacks through six games. Seven different players have been credited with at least a half-sack so far. The Warriors have allowed only four sacks.\n\nPOWER FIVE\n\nHawaii has never defeated three teams from Power Five conferences in the same season. The Warriors have lost six straight and are 1-16 all-time against ranked teams away from home. They haven\u2019t defeated a Pac-12 team away from the islands since beating Washington State in 2009.\n\nThe Warriors would like to end those streaks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at Washington any different than we did Arizona or Oregon State,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going in there with cocky heads. We\u2019re going in there with the mindset to work and the mindset to compete and play a full game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nick Rolovich is having some fun with Hawaii's start to the season to the point of tweeting a picture of the Rose Bowl logo.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/oregon_st_hawaii_football_70169_c0-176-4220-2636_s1770x1032.jpg?d3ecf7d980c431fb41ea399175677d19349e7139", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
