There was damage to the lorry also,' he said.\n\n'I'm not sure as to why he didn't see the traffic was stopped. He was Polish so there was a bit of a language barrier.'\n\nMr Evans said police had to arrange for a translator to go to the scene so that he and the HGV driver could swap details.\n\nA spokeswoman for Staffordshire Police said: 'I can confirm police were called to the A5 near Eccleshall at 3.15pm, to reports of a collision involving a HGV and car.\n\n'We assisted with traffic management. There were no injuries reported and this was left as a civil matter between the two parties.'\n\nMr Evans uploaded the clip to a private Facebook group for dashcams.\n\nAfterwards, with the camera hanging sideways, Mr Evans is able to slowly nurse the wrecked vehicle out of further harm's way\n\nThe terrifying footage shows him gently come to a stop and leave a gap between him and the car in front.\n\nBut the rear-facing camera reveals a red HGV approaching at speed.\n\nMichael seems oblivious to the danger but, moments before impact, glances in the rear view mirror.\n\nHe can be heard saying: 'Oh f***'.\n\nSlowed down, the footage shows the front of the HGV demolish the back of his car in a shower of glass.\n\nAfterwards, with the camera hanging sideways, Mr Evans is able to slowly nurse the wrecked vehicle out of further harm's way.\n\nCommenting on the footage, one user wrote: 'How did that not do more damage?'\n\nAnother added: 'The lorry driver isn't paying attention to what's in front of him.\n\n'I know it's the A5 but this is what will happen if a car is broken down in lane one on a motorway and there's nowhere to get out of the way.\n\nWhile another said: 'I use the A5 a lot. Wow you were lucky mate. It could have been a lot worse.'", "description": "Michael Evans, 31, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, captured the crash on a rear-facing camera while stopped on the A5 near Fazeley, Staffordshire on Monday.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20080278-0-image-a-19_1571829853703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
