I\u2019ve been doing my thing, super busy, I got a lot of acting stuff, movies, a lot of s*** presented to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But I\u2019ve been hearing some bits about the WWE. You know, some of the stuff I just don\u2019t believe \u2013 like the $15million.\n\n\u2018I just can\u2019t see them giving Fury $15m for what is a guest appearance, when the highest paid I believe is Brock Lesnar on $12m.\n\n\u2018Why would they give that to a guy that can\u2019t even sell out Vegas?\n\n\u2018In his first fight he sold 1,500 tickets, and the second he sold 3,500 tickets the rest he gave away, why would they give someone $15m after that?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just like the ESPN deal, that was a lie. He was never getting $100m, even his promoter Bob Arum came out and said that\u2019s not true, if everything goes perfect then maybe he get a $100m.\n\n\u2018A lot of it is smoking mirrors and clout chasing.\u2019\n\nMORE: Deontay Wilder predicts Tyson Fury will pull out of rematch", "description": "Deontay Wilder has accused Tyson Fury of lying about earning $15million (\u00a311.9m) for his WWE bout with Braun Strowman this month and believes the figure is heavily inflated.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1067405492_1572010067.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
