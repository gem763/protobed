The inspector general also \u201cdetermined that the complaint was both urgent \u2013 and that it appeared credible\u201d.\n\nStephen Colbert: Trump trying to 'confuse everyone about a very simple story' Read more\n\n\u201cBasically, the IGIC gave the president an F you,\u201d Kimmel explained. In a normal situation, he continued, this would end the claims of hearsay. But this case clearly calls for applying what Kimmel called \u201cthe fundamental theory on which the Trump presidency is based: the theory of inverse validity, which states that things that are true are false\u201d.\n\nUnder this theory, for example, you don\u2019t have to worry about climate change \u2013 \u201cWe could just say it isn\u2019t happening and the weather is fine.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the theory of inverse validity states that \u201cthings that are false are true\u201d, which means if, say, you \u201cneed your inauguration crowd to be bigger than it was, or a hurricane to hit Alabama, or to not have paid off a porn star you definitely paid off\u201d, Kimmel said, \u201cjust do what Trump does. Just flip it on its head.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nOn the Daily Show, Trevor Noah focused on Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and frequent cable news guest Rudy Giuliani, one of the key figures in the whistleblower complaint. The Ukraine scandal \u201cmay also take down Rudy Giuliani\u201d. Noah said, but \u201cthe question is: has Rudy Giuliani done enough to also be impeached?\u201d\n\nTo find out, Noah held a faux trial, white wig and all, on his mock court show Judge Mental. The first charge he heard was meddling in foreign affairs; given that Giuliani was mentioned in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint 30 times and was the person directed by Trump to work with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Noah reached an easy conclusion. \u201cYes, it appears Rudy Giuliani was the anus of this entire operation \u2013 everything passed through him and it stinks to high heaven.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Welcome to the impeachment trial of Rudy Giuliani: personal attorney to the president and anus of the entire Ukraine operation. https://t.co/rNcUyfYbWD\n\nThirty mentions in the complaint is \u201c29 times too many\u201d, Noah continued. \u201cI mean, you know you\u2019re in trouble if you control-F your name in a whistleblower\u2019s report and the screen lights up like a motel bed under a black light.\u201d\n\nAs for personal conduct, Giuliani\u2019s recent appearances on cable news \u2013 in which he claimed to show texts on his iPad from the state department, thus implicating them in the Ukraine scandal, and contradicted himself in a viral CNN appearance \u2013 weren\u2019t helping his case. \u201cIt says a lot when you\u2019re the most unhinged person on Fox News,\u201d said Noah.\n\nGiven the evidence, Noah\u2019s court reached a swift verdict: \u201cOn the charges of interfering in foreign affairs, acting as the president\u2019s personal thug, and just being an overall hot mess in breach of the Hot Mess Act of 1834, this court finds you, Rudolph William Dracula Giuliani, guilty!\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nOn the Late Show, Stephen Colbert dove into the latest chapter of the ongoing saga of \u201cDon and the Giant Impeach\u201d. \u201cThis Ukraine scandal is moving faster than a chalupa through a goose,\u201d Colbert said as he pivoted focus to Trump\u2019s inner circle of advisers.\n\nFirst up, Colbert said, is the attorney general, Bill Barr, who is investigating what many view as conspiracy theories about the origins of the Mueller investigation in 2016. Barr recently sought help and encouragement in his investigations from British and Italian government officials.\n\n\u201cBill Barr is traveling the world trying to prove that all of Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories are true. He\u2019s going to find Obama\u2019s birth certificate. He\u2019s going to rescue all the people that aliens abducted from Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd, and finally bring help to hurricane-ravaged Alabama,\u201d joked Colbert.\n\nThe \u201cnext domino about to fall\u201d, Colbert said, is the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who took part in the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call. \u201cHe was on the line, even though he was asked about it two weeks ago and he played dumb. I mean, like, \u2018I-think-people-someday-will-forget-I-was-a-willing-part-of-this-administration dumb.\u2019\u201d\n\nColbert mimicked Pompeo\u2019s stumbling appearance on ABC this week, in which he stuttered through a non-answer on whether he had read the whistleblower complaint. \u201cWell \u2026 you just gave me a report \u2026\u201d Colbert said. \u201cOh, this elevator is going down.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts focus on three elements of the Ukraine scandal: Bill Barr, Rudy Giuliani and Trump\u2019s \u2018theory of inverse validity\u2019", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9c1f6f6cc4ae7d06043f017c7a69788818be8d6/58_0_1487_892/master/1487.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d862e818102fd13f51ea952c9bffb443"}
