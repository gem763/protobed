There\u2019s no \u2018Big I Am\u2019 about him, even though his nickname would suggest otherwise.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy who will continue to grow and will continue to lead, whether that\u2019s through having a \u2018C\u2019 next to his name or just through his actions.\n\n\u201cHe will become one of the greats, I\u2019ve no doubts about that.\u201d\n\nSimon Easterby, pictured, believes Ryan can be one of Ireland\u00b4s best ever players (Donall Farmer/PA)\n\nRyan made his Test debut even before his senior bow with Leinster, such was Ireland\u2019s faith in their fast-maturing lock.\n\nThe sharp-witted youngster came off the bench in Ireland\u2019s 55-19 win over the United States in Harrison on June 10, 2017, and has stormed from strength to strength ever since.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come through the ranks, hasn\u2019t he? We plucked him, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d even played a senior game for Leinster when we took him to the States to make his debut,\u201d Easterby said.\n\nAfter round two of #RWCEpicMoments here at Rugby World Cup 2019, the winner as voted by fans across the globe was Gareth Davies for his interception for @welshrugbyunion!\n\n\n\nStay tuned for round three launching on Wednesday! @DHLRugby #RWC2019 pic.twitter.com/u7CGCThxN1 \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cMaybe there were a few eyebrows raised at that. But he hasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal athlete. He\u2019s certainly on the right track currently. He works incredibly hard.\n\n\u201cAnd that I guess is the baseline for any great player: that they have the raw talent and the ability but that they also work incredibly hard. And he has all three.\u201d", "description": "The 23-year-old Leinster lock is being touted as a future Ireland captain.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/wire-19468194-1570579419-59_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
