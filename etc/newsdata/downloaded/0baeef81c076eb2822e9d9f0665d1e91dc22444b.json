What is known is that over the next two weeks circumstances will change.\n\n\u201cThe courts understand that there is a limited amount of time. The political debate requires to be played out in the correct form.\n\n\u201cThe court can only intervene if there is a demonstrable unlawfulness which it requires to correct. There has been no such unlawfulness.\u201d\n\nJudge Lord Pentland ruled on Monday it was not necessary to compel the Prime Minister to comply with the terms of the Act given the \u201cunequivocal assurances\u201d of Mr Johnson and the Government before the court, but campaigners lodged an appeal against this decision.\n\nNumber 10 has been accused of submitting documents to the court which contradict the Prime Minister\u2019s public statements, which have included saying the UK will leave the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d on October 31.\n\nThe action aimed to ensure Boris Johnson adheres to the Benn Act (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nThe latest legal action \u2013 led by SNP MP Joanna Cherry, businessman Dale Vince, and Jolyon Maugham QC \u2013 sought an order requiring the Prime Minister to send the request and another which would allow an official to do so if he does not.\n\nElaine Motion, a lawyer acting for the petitioners, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent judgment from the Inner House of the Court of Session, as you would expect.\n\n\u201cThe court have indicated that there are undertakings given by the Prime Minister that he will abide by the Benn Act and not seek to frustrate it.\n\n\u201cIn continuing the matter to the 21st, there is a sword of Damocles over the Prime Minister\u2019s head to comply with the Benn Act, and we hope he does.\n\n\u201cWe hope we do not have to return to court on October 21 and that politics can run its course.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only if he doesn\u2019t comply with the orders that we have to come back to court.\u201d", "description": "Judges at the Court of Session said the political debate must be played out before a decision is made.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/12/wire-19488488-1570621120-862_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
