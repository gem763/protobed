Another group of states is looking into Facebook\u2019s practices.\n\nThe group of top legal cops said they will review Google\u2019s advertising markets and search capabilities to determine whether business practices have led to anti-competitive behavior, harmed consumers and drove rivals out of business.\n\nThey said some Google search queries have yielded responses to businesses or advertisers who pay for their links to show up in specific positions.\n\n\u201cAs a new mom, when my daughter is sick and I search online for advice or doctors, I want the best advice from the best doctors \u2014 not the doctor, not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising,\u201d said Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. \u201cMost Americans think it\u2019s free to \u2018Google\u2018 something, but it comes at a cost.\u201d\n\nEuropean countries already are investigating the market power of Google, Facebook and other U.S.-based tech giants. In this decade alone, the European Union has launched three antitrust cases against Google and levied over $8.1 billion in fines against two of the company\u2019s services: Google Shopping and Android.\n\nThe pressure has been building in the U.S. on tech companies as well. Reuters has reported that the Federal Trade Commission is looking into antitrust allegations against Apple, Amazon and Facebook in addition to Google. Facebook was hit by a state investigation, led by New York\u2019s attorney general, this month over its dominance of social media.\n\nThe red and blue states came together Monday for the latest legal offensive, telling reporters at the Supreme Court that small businesses could be locked out by the monopolistic powers of Google\u2019s dominance. Though they are not filing a lawsuit against the company just yet, they have vowed to follow the facts where they lead and communicate weekly about where the investigation stands.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition, but we have seen evidence that Google\u2019s business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users\u2019 privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information. We intend to closely follow the facts we discover in this case and proceed as necessary,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the coalition.\n\n\u201cWhile many consumers believe the internet is free \u2026 the internet is not free. This is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet,\u201d Mr. Paxton said at the press briefing.\n\nGoogle responds\n\nIn anticipation of the investigation, Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs, said the company has received a Justice Department request for information pertaining to the investigations.\n\n\u201cWe have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so. We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition,\u201d he said in a blog post Friday.\n\nCalifornia, where Google has headquarters, did not join the other states in their effort. Neither did Alabama, but attorneys general from the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are involved, making up the 50 states and territories driving the investigation.\n\nThe attorneys general said that more than 90% of Google\u2019s revenue comes from digital advertising, while the prime source of revenue for traditional advertisers, including newspapers and magazines, has dried up.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s dominance now allows them to pick winners and losers in this exchange,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry.\n\nKevin Clarkson, attorney general of Alaska, said this issue is critically important for business in his state because of its geography. He noted that many Alaskan businesses rely on the internet to reach customers across the country.\n\nThe initiative, using resources from 50 state prosecutors\u2019 offices, brings increased pressure, the group argues, especially given the political divisions they may have on other issues.\n\n\u201cThis is an unusual setting right here,\u201d said Karl Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia. \u201cI\u2019m next to friends of mine I vehemently disagree with on issues like immigration, reproductive rights, gun rights and other issues.\n\n\u201cWe are acting as one today,\u201d he added.\n\nThe bipartisan effort was organized after reports in June that the Justice Department was preparing its own antitrust investigation into Google.\n\nJohn E. Lopatka, a law professor at Pennsylvania State University, said the states\u2019 investigation is likely to prove duplicative because the Justice Department usually has the expertise on antitrust law, a complex legal issue.\n\n\u201cGoogle, as well as the other Big Tech companies, are highly politically unpopular now. This is political red meat,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nMr. Lopatka said the states could try to push for quicker action than the Justice Department might be willing to accept if they find a suspected violation and file suit.\n\n\u201cI think the Justice Department would be more careful,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
