REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe annual rate of GDP growth slowed to 1.1% from 1.3%, matching a seven-year low set in June.\n\nRECESSION RISK DIMINISHES\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31, without a transition period if necessary - despite parliament telling him to delay Brexit again if he cannot negotiate a fresh deal. Businesses say a no-deal Brexit risks causing major disruption to imports.\n\nTwo consecutive quarters of contraction would mean Britain\u2019s economy met a commonly used definition of recession, but the ONS said the economy would need to shrink by an almost unprecedented 1.5% in September alone for this to happen.\n\nAs well as Brexit, manufacturers across Europe have been hit by a rise in trade tensions between the United States and China.\n\nThe new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, warned earlier this week that the world economy was suffering a \u201csynchronised slowdown\u201d.\n\nSo far the Bank of England has not followed the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank and cut interest rates but last month one BoE policymaker, Michael Saunders, said this might prove necessary.\n\nSeptember\u2019s IHS Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index data released last week for the private sector pointed to a 0.1% contraction in the third quarter, with businesses reporting that foreign customers were staying away before Brexit.\n\nThe ONS said it had not received any substantive anecdotal evidence of the effect of Brexit preparations on the economy in August.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nIndustrial output dropped by 1.8%, the biggest annual fall in six years. Soft global demand was hurting demand for manufactured exports, the ONS said, and despite bright spots such as film and television production, growth in the dominant services industry slowed to zero in the month of August alone.\n\nReflecting slower export growth, August trade data showed Britain\u2019s goods trade deficit widened slightly to 9.8 billion pounds ($12.0 billion) from 9.6 billion pounds in July, broadly as expected by economists.\n\nThe total trade deficit for goods and services narrowed slightly to 1.5 billion pounds from 1.7 billion.", "description": "Britain's economy looks to have dodged recession in the run-up to its deadline for leaving the European Union this month but the pace of growth has sagged as exporters felt the impact of the slowing world economy, official data showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439221330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990M0", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
