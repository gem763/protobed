But over the past decade or so, this no-nonsense Victorian seaside resort (whose spectacular annual Illuminations stretch for 8km along the Golden Mile) on Lancashire\u2019s Fylde coast has been enjoying a renaissance.\n\nHundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on regeneration, whose spoils include an impressive new promenade with \u201cSpanish steps\u201d down to the town\u2019s 11km-long golden sandy beach, a refurbished Tower and a huge \u00a316.25m investment in Blackpool Pleasure Beach\u2019s newest and biggest project, the ICON double launch roller coaster. Added to which, smart hotels, boutique guesthouses and B&Bs have been springing up at a rate of knots, with not a brushed nylon bedsheet in sight. So, put any negative preconceptions aside and come and join the fun.\n\nBest for a modern vibe: Hampton by Hilton Blackpool\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Located on the new South Promenade, it\u2019s far enough removed from the general hubbub, yet close enough to walk to the Pleasure Beach and Sandcastle Water Park. Many of its 130 modern rooms have a sea view, the bar and fitness centre are open round the clock and a cooked breakfast is included in the room price. If you need to bring your work with you, there\u2019s a fully equipped business centre too.\n\nRooms from \u00a385\n\nhamptoninn3.hilton.com\n\nBest for uninterrupted sea views: Number One South Beach\n\nNeighbourhood: New South Promenade\n\nIt\u2019s a chintz-free zone at this stylish family run hotel at the southern end of South Beach, which offers uninterrupted views of the Irish Sea and Blackpool\u2019s enormous mirrorball.

The elegant decor continues in the property\u2019s eight bedrooms and every afternoon guests can help themselves to a selection of home-baked pastries courtesy of owner Ursula Beswick.\n\nRooms from \u00a390\n\ntheredstoneblackpool.co.uk\n\nBest for kicking back at happy hour: Mode St Annes\n\nNeighbourhood: Lytham St Annes\n\nFive miles down the coast from Blackpool in upmarket Lytham St Annes, the Mode hotel (which has a room-only sister property) has 19 smart rooms, eight of which have a balcony and sea view.
