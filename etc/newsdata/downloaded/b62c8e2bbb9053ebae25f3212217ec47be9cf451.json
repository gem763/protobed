While China\u2019s rulers were celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic with an enormous parade of missiles and technological achievements meant to intimidate and impress, Hong Kong witnessed some of the most violent protests in four months of demonstrations against Beijing\u2019s encroachment on the enclave\u2019s autonomy.\n\nThere was no subtlety in either President Xi Jinping\u2019s celebration of his country\u2019s raw power, or Hong Kong\u2019s rejection of the repressive rule behind that power. Something will have to give.\n\nMr. Xi was central to his show. Clad in a Mao suit, he made no mention of his immediate predecessors as he presided over an awesome display of what he calls the \u201c Chinese dream ,\u201d a broad vision of China\u2019s rise as an economic, military and police force to be reckoned with. \u201cNo force can shake the status of our great motherland, no force can obstruct the advance of the Chinese people and Chinese nation,\u201d he declared.", "description": "As President Xi celebrates 70 years of Communist rule, a democratic enclave resists.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/opinion/01chinaWeb/01chinaWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
