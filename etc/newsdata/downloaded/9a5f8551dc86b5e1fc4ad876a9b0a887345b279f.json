[NEWS1]\n\nThousands of non-regular workers including cafeteria cooks at elementary, middle and high schools in Korea may go on a strike from Thursday if ongoing negotiations with the government for a pay raise are not resolved.\u201cWe are trying to reach a point of compromise,\u201d an official of the Ministry of Education told the JoongAng Ilbo Monday. \u201cWe have worked out our differences, more so than before.\u201dThe Ministry of Education said that the ministry and a national union of non-permanent school workers began their closed-door negotiations on a pay raise on Monday morning.It was the second round of negotiations after the two parties held one from last Thursday to Friday, which fell apart.The ministry is said to have made an additional offer to the division Sunday night, and that the two parties were negotiating over the new offer Monday morning. If they cannot reach a deal by Wednesday, the union warned it will go on a strike from Thursday.There are 142,000 non-regular workers at schools across the country, which include bus drivers, cafeteria cooks and janitors, and of them, 67 percent, or around 95,000, are members of the union. Such employees get no job security, and many are outsourced from contracting companies.These members are demanding a 5.45 percent raise to their pay, a drop compared to the 6.24 percent hike the school workers demanded when they went on strike in July after negotiations with the ministry fell through.The ministry, in the ongoing round of negotiations, is offering a 1.8 percent raise - the same it offered in July. The last time the negotiation fell through, around 2,500 contract workers at elementary, middle and high schools went on the strike from July 3 to 5. Around 2,800 schools had to stop serving lunch during those days.Education offices in some provinces and municipalities distributed a variety of foodstuffs - mainly bread and milk - or asked parents to pack their children\u2019s lunches. Some schools cut classes short.\u201cIf the strike happens again, we will be at a loss for what to do regarding the school lunches,\u201d said a 44-year-old woman surnamed Lee, who lives in Yangcheon District, western Seoul, with two children attending middle and high schools. \u201cI don\u2019t know why our children have to be the ones to suffer in this fight among grown-ups.\u201dIn the last strike, school workers were also joining a larger, general strike by non-regular public sector employees, who argued that President Moon Jae-in was going back on the labor-friendly promises he made while running for president which included raising the minimum wage further, strictly enforcing shorter working hours, and putting many of the country\u2019s public sector employees on permanent payrolls.BY ESTHER CHUNG, JEON MIN-HEE [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/14202009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
