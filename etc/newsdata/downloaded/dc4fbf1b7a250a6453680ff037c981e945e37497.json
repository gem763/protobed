I do not think this camera is so cool as it shoots upwards,\" she said in a further statement emailed to Euronews from her spokesman.\n\nShe added: \"There was certainly no woman involved in the development because you have to climb over it while wearing tight clothes.\"\n\nL\u00fcckenkemper went on to say that the German Athletics Association (DLV) had complained to the IAAF \"because of the camera filming the crotch\".\n\n\"We are not the only ones who protested.\"\n\nThe cameras, which were introduced during the World Championships in Qatar as \"trailblazing technology to give sports fans a fresh view of the IAAF\", consist of two miniature devices installed into the starting blocks.\n\nShooting at an upwards angle, they are designed to show the athlete's face in the seconds leading up to the starting pistol, and the \"explosion of energy\" as the race begins.\n\nBut athletes and audiences alike have noted that such an angle could also be deemed a \"bit creepy\".\n\nIn a statement, the DLV said it had elevated the complaints from L\u00fcckenkemper and her fellow sprinter Tatjana Pinto, and that the IAAF had, in response, agreed to black out the \"block cam\" images on the main screen.\n\nOn secondary screens, the size of the image has been altered \"so that nothing is recognisable\".\n\n\"The video data is not saved and deleted daily,\" the DLV added.\n\nEuronews has reached out to the IAAF for comment.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "The IAAF has installed cameras into starting blocks to capture the moments leading up to the starting pistol, but athletes say such an angle is \"unpleasant\".", "authors": ["Rachael Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/19/97/76/1000x563_cmsv2_952a8ccf-5122-5684-98d6-3d57029d0ee2-4199776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
