It has also repeatedly expressed displeasure about a months-long stalemate in negotiations and ramped up testing of short-range ballistic missiles and rocket artillery in recent weeks in an apparent effort to build bargaining leverage.\n\n\u201cOur expectations of dialogue with the U.S. are gradually disappearing and we are being pushed to re-examine all the measures we have taken so far,\u201d Choe said in the statement, carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA.\n\n\u201cWe are very curious about the background of the American top diplomat\u2019s thoughtless remarks and we will watch what calculations he has,\u201d she said. \u201cThe U.S. had better not put any longer our patience to the test with such remarks irritating us if it doesn\u2019t want to have bitter regrets afterward.\u201d\n\nIn a speech to U.S. veterans in Indiana on Tuesday, Pompeo said the Trump administration recognized that \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s rogue behavior could not be ignored\u201d while touting its approach in foreign policy.\n\n\u201cAmericanism \u2015 it means telling the truth about the challenges we face,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, this administration didn\u2019t pretend that the Islamic Republic of Iran was a responsible actor in the Middle East. We called out China\u2019s bad behavior on trade and on national security. We recognized \u2015 we recognized that North Korea\u2019s rogue behavior could not be ignored.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, walks with Kim Yong Choi, a North Korean senior ruling party official and former intelligence chief, right, as they follow President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Feb. 28, 2019.\n\nNuclear negotiations have been at a standstill since a February summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam collapsed after the U.S. side rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.\n\nSince the breakdown in Hanoi, North Korea has repeatedly demanded that Washington remove Pompeo from the nuclear negotiations, accusing him of maintaining a hard-line stance on sanctions and distorting Pyongyang\u2019s statements, while avoiding direct criticism of Trump.\n\nTrump and Kim met again at the inter-Korean border in June and agreed to resume working-level talks, but there has been no known meeting between the countries since then.\n\nLast week, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho called Pompeo a \u201cdie-hard toxin of U.S. diplomacy\u201d after he said Washington would maintain strong sanctions on North Korea until the country is denuclearized.\n\nKCNA also on Saturday said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit North Korea soon at the invitation of Ri, but did not specify what would be discussed.\n\nSince initiating diplomacy with Seoul and Washington last year, Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping five times before and after his summits with Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, cementing longtime ally Beijing as a major player in the process to resolve the nuclear standoff.", "description": "A senior North Korean official skewered the secretary of state on Saturday for his \"thoughtless\" comments and warned the U.S. to not \"test\" Pyongyang's p...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6b8ae62400004f0071c382.jpeg?cache=u9jsik08n0&ops=1778_1000"}
