Smoking cannabis in public wasn\u2019t legal, neither was buying it in brick-and-mortar shops. Back then, the retail space that now houses dozens of dry leaf and oil products was only used to host the occasional pop-event after long-time tenant New Era, a hat retailer, vacated it.\n\nWe're going to have to evolve on a weekly basis Hunny Pot's Cameron Brown\n\nChange has been swift in the cannabis space and outside the Hunny Pot, one of the three 20-something friends is looking forward to more. In December, retailers will begin selling a host of new cannabis derivative products, including edibles, vaporizers and beverages in a second wave of legalization that the industry has dubbed cannabis 2.0. It has taken just a year for the next phase of legalization to occur, but for one of the friends, it hasn\u2019t been fast enough.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to f\u2013k up my lungs anymore,\u201d the man said, eyes watery after taking another puff from the joint.\n\nCannabis 2.0 will test how quickly retailers such as the Hunny Pot and the licensed producers that supply them are able to adapt. The introduction of extracts is estimated to add an additional $2.7 billion to the cannabis market, according to Deloitte, but as producers add dozens of new products, retailers may already be facing a crunch in terms of how much of it they can actually carry.\n\nThe Hunny Pot\u2019s layout was meant to be minimalistic, according to spokesman Cameron Brown. The store is divided into four small floors and only two of them have product on display in a series of glass cabinets and hexagonal-shaped tables. Customers can find CBD products on the third floor, THC products on the fourth and accessories in glass cabinets on both.\n\nBrown said the store has little more than 100 SKUs on display from a total of 350 that it stocks. After cannabis 2.0 arrives, that last number might triple. And so Brown and the Hunny Pot find themselves at a crossroads: They can either sacrifice its minimalist aesthetic, or choose not to carry a significant portion of the new products.\n\nAt least to start, the Hunny Pot is heavily leaning toward the second option. Brown says the store may decide to order less than 25 per cent of the products that will be made available on Dec. 16 after a 60-day moratorium begins. The Hunny Pot doesn\u2019t know what these products will taste like or how they\u2019ll be received \u2014 no one does \u2014 and so they\u2019ll be forced to be agile and adapt quickly to customer preferences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to evolve on a weekly basis,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou\u2019ll know very quickly what\u2019s moving, what\u2019s not and what\u2019s going to continue to sell.\u201d\n\nThe rotation system that the Hunny Pot and other retailers are planning to implement won\u2019t flatter licensed producers. Unlike in the alcohol industry, regulations stipulate that producers cannot buy shelf space and can have no influence on where their product is displayed \u2014 or if it\u2019s stocked at all.\n\nNot wanting to overwhelm retailers, producers are staggering the release of new products.\n\nCanopy Growth Corp. president Rade Kovacevic said the company has 50 new products in its pipeline but is planning to have what he would only describe as a \u201ccore part of the portfolio\u201d available in December, with the rest hitting shelves over the six months that follow.\n\nAt OrganiGram Holdings Inc., CEO Greg Engel is planning a similar approach that will see vaporizers and vape pens available on Day One, cannabis-infused chocolate during the first quarter of 2020 and a dry powder beverage in the second quarter. The company is only planning to have 24 SKUs.\n\nOf the new products that will be made available, retailers have concluded that beverages will likely take up the most space, given that some will have to install refrigerators to serve them cold. That played a role in OrganiGram\u2019s decision to push forward with a dry powder beverage mix instead of a bottled drink, Engel said.\n\n\u201cOur strategy with beverages is we\u2019re only launching a dry powder beverage because we did look at shelf space,\u201d Engel said.\n\nBesides concerns over the preparedness of individual retailers, Engel said some provinces don\u2019t have sufficient retail space for the expansion. Ontario will expand its cap on the number of cannabis stores from 25 to 75 by the end of the year, but still pales in comparison to Alberta, which has more than 250 locations.\n\nEven with 75 stores in Ontario, consumers may have to accept that they\u2019ll have to visit different stores in different cities to find a specific product they\u2019re looking for. Complicating matters, Brown said the province has approved some locations that are planning for just 800 to 1,200 square feet of retail space.\n\nIn Ottawa, Mimi Lam\u2019s Superette has over 3,000 square feet in retail space in a store that was built for constant change. Lam already knew that extracts would soon be hitting the market and planned ahead of time to make an easy transition.\n\nThe shop has a deli bar complete with a white-box menu above it. Both are advertising mostly pre-roll and dry leaf products but it\u2019s easy enough to picture edibles in their place. Instead of rushing to put in refrigeration units by December, Lam already has two vintage ones set up for decoration that can be fully functional to store and display beverages.\n\nThat versatility should help with Lam\u2019s plans to buy \u201cwide and shallow\u201d in December by bringing in a large number of products in small quantities, seeing what moves off the shelves and quickly rotating different products.\n\n\u201cWhat we recognize is supply, introduction of new products and brand is going to be in so much flux over the next six or 12 months, that we are not looking to be beholden to setting precedence in how we make those decisions,\u201d Lam said.\n\nFire and Flower Holdings Corp., which operates more than two dozen stores across the country, uses modular shelving that can easily be removed and replaced with refrigeration units, according to CEOTrevor Fencott. He said he is unconcerned about making changes to the store layout, as he doesn\u2019t think retailers will see hundreds of new products all at once.\n\nThe exception, he said, is in Saskatchewan where retailers can buy their product directly from licensed producers and guarantee that it\u2019ll be on shelves in December. In other provinces such as Ontario, where the government buys the product from producers, has it shipped to a warehouse and then makes it available for individual retailers, delays are to be expected.\n\n\u201cLook what happened with 1.0 \u2014 and that was dry cannabis,\u201d Fencott said.\n\nDepending on how successful the new products are, the Hunny Pot has more drastic plans that would see three walls potentially being torn down to make additional space, spokesman Brown said. In the meantime, there will be many adjustments made on the fly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to out product really quickly if it doesn\u2019t sell and try something new,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the responsibility is going to come down on the LPs to provide a quality product for the consumer because if they don\u2019t, they might not have a second chance in these stores.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\nEmail: vferreira@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VicF77", "description": "Extracts are expected to add $2.7 billion to the cannabis market, but retailers face a crunch on what and how much to sell", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/edibles.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
