Here was President Obama, who had run for office as a critic of the Bush administration\u2019s extraordinary invocations of executive power, not just continuing his predecessor\u2019s surveillance programs but entrenching them. (Obama\u2019s policies have been comprehensively documented by The Times reporter Charlie Savage in \u201cPower Wars,\u201d which dates Obama\u2019s about-face on national security to the failed so-called underwear bombing of 2009.) Snowden\u2019s girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, had \u201centhusiastically campaigned\u201d for Obama. \u201cLindsay\u2019s hope in him, as well as my own, would prove more and more misplaced,\u201d Snowden writes.\n\nThe second half of \u201cPermanent Record\u201d reads like a literary thriller, as Snowden breaks down how he ended up in a Hong Kong hotel room in the summer of 2013, turning over a trove of classified documents to Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill of The Guardian, Barton Gellman of The Washington Post and the filmmaker Laura Poitras.\n\nJulian Assange wanted Snowden to release the information through WikiLeaks, but the site\u2019s \u201ctotal transparency,\u201d Snowden says, wouldn\u2019t allow for proper authentication and curation of such incendiary material. Snowden emphasizes that the distinction was important to him \u2014 not that the government would see it that way. \u201cWhereas other spies have committed espionage, sedition and treason,\u201d he writes, \u201c I would be aiding and abetting an act of journalism.\u201d\n\nIn his acknowledgments, Snowden thanks the novelist Joshua Cohen for \u201chelping to transform my rambling reminiscences and capsule manifestoes into a book.\u201d (As the N.S.A. might know, I edited several articles by Cohen in a previous job.) It\u2019s like a recursive loop of life imitating art imitating life; in Cohen\u2019s \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d published in 2015, a novelist named Joshua Cohen is hired to ghostwrite the autobiography of a mysterious tech billionaire \u2026 whose search-engine company happens to be sharing information with government agencies.\n\n\u201cPermanent Record\u201d weaves together personal intel and spycraft info, much of it technologically elaborate yet clearly explained. You\u2019ll also learn that even in our fragmented era, the tools of mass surveillance have revealed one thing that seems to connect almost everyone who\u2019s online: porn. \u201cThis was true for virtually everyone of every gender, ethnicity, race and age,\u201d Snowden writes, \u201cfrom the meanest terrorist to the nicest senior citizen, who might be the meanest terrorist\u2019s grandparent, or parent, or cousin.\u201d\n\nThis is funny, but it\u2019s ominous, too. Without belaboring his points, Snowden pushes the reader to reflect more seriously on what every American should be asking already. What does it mean to have the data of our lives collected and stored on file, ready to be accessed \u2014 not just now, by whatever administration happens to be in office at the moment, but potentially forever? Should such sensitive work be outsourced to private contractors? What entails effective \u201coversight\u201d if the public is kept in the dark? When can concerns about \u201cnational security\u201d slip into bids for unchecked power?\n\nSnowden doesn\u2019t reveal too much about his life in exile. He and Lindsay have since married, renting a two-bedroom apartment in Moscow, where he beams out his image through a screen-on-wheels, nicknamed the \u201cSnowbot,\u201d giving talks about privacy to audiences around the world. He says he takes care to avoid being recognized in public \u2014 \u201cbut nowadays everybody\u2019s too busy staring at their phones to give me a second glance.\u201d", "description": "With \u201cPermanent Record,\u201d the former intelligence contractor who leaked documents about the United States government\u2019s surveillance programs gives an account of his life.", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/books/12booksnowden1/12booksnowden1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
