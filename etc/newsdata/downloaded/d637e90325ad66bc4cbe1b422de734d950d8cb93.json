Just last year, Boston Dynamic's humanoid bot became an object of ridicule after a series of accidents at a government 'robo olympics' saw if falling constantly, and needing a crane to get back on its feet. But ' the World's Most Dynamic Humanoid' came back with a blast in recent weeks - and you really don't want to mess with it. Its makers have given the bot an overhaul, and it is now so stable it can even perform a perfect backflip. 'Atlas is the latest in a line of advanced humanoid robots we are developing, Boston Robotics said. Standing 6 foot 9 (two meters) and weighing in at 167 pounds (76 kg), Atlas is a robot that you really don't want to argue with. Its makers have given the bot an overhaul, and it is now so stable it can even perform a perfect back flip 'Atlas keeps its balance when jostled or pushed and can get up if it tips over.' To stay upright, Atlas has stereo vision, range sensing and other sensors give Atlas the ability to manipulate objects in its environment and to travel on rough terrain. According to Boston Dynamics, Atlas is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. 'In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces.'\n\nAnother claim in the same year followed a warning he made in July 2017 that regulation of artificial intelligence is needed because it's a 'fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation.'\n\nThe billionaire said regulations will stop humanity from being outsmarted by computers, or 'deep intelligence in the network', that can start wars by manipulating information.\n\nGovernments must have a better understanding of artificial intelligence technology's rapid evolution in order to fully comprehend the risks, he said.\n\nElon Musk has been very vocal about his concerns over artificial intelligence and killer robots, and the Tesla and SpaceX CEO quantified his worries last week. In a recent talk, Musk claimed that efforts to make AI safe only have 'a five to 10 per cent chance of success (stock image)\n\n'Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid, as they should be...By the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it'll be too late,' he added.\n\nThe billionaire made the comments during a question-and-answer session at the summer conference of the National Governors Association in Rhode Island.\n\n'Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry,' said Musk.", "description": "Elon Musk has once again issued a stark warning over his fears of artificial intelligence.
