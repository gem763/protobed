We've seen in the labour market plenty of slack there relative to the 4.5 per cent the Reserve Bank says is full employment. That's why you need to keep going,\" Mr Blythe said.\n\nMr Evans also says the unemployment rate will figure signicantly in the central bank's policy deliberations.\n\n\"The labour market is still not behaving in the way the RBA wants, so if you interpret the 5.2 per cent unemployment rate as being unacceptable well you say they keep cutting,\" he said.\n\n\"The trouble is they've got to balance that against other factors around confidence and around very limited further scope so it's really just a trade off. \"\n\nThe likelihood of unconventional policy like QE has increased after Dr Lowe said the prospect of negative interest rates in Australia was \"extraordinarily unlikely\".\n\nMr Evans said the RBA's thinking on QE would be concerned with the effective lower bound for interest rates, particularly the trade-off between the effect of lower rates on activity and the unintendeded consequences for confidence.\n\n\"If inflation remains below the 2 to 3 per cent band, which I expect it to do, and they reach a point where they think the impact of further rates could be self-defeating, especially around confidence, then they'll still want to be seen to be doing something,\" Mr Evans said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Because if you don't do anything and inflation is below 2 per cent then you're basically encouraging inflation expectations to fall.\"\n\nMr Blythe pointed to the Commonwealth Bank's recent research on consumer sentiment, saying he thought low rates were \"now starting to hinder\" the economy.\n\nDownbeat sentiment may be constraining the hoped-for boost to growth from lower tax rates.\n\n\"I think that most people equate rate cuts with something going wrong in the economy and that encourages everyone to sit on their wallets.\n\nCBA chief economist Michael Blythe said low rates may be hindering the economy. Lisa Maree Williams\n\n\"Not only are rate cuts not helping, they're potentially offsetting some of the benefits of those tax rebates that are supposed to be working through right now.\"\n\nMr Blythe thought the RBA was \"still a fair way\" from adopting quantitative easing and questioned how effective it would be given most Australian borrowing is linked to short term rates rather than 10 year bonds, which are trading at an already low yield of around 1 per cent.\n\n\"I don't think there is anybody saying that high interest rates are stopping them from borrowing money. It's more they don't want to borrow in the current environment.\"\n\nMr Blythe forecasts a rebound in growth in 2020 to 2.7 per cent from 1.8 per cent in 2019, helped by the rebound in the housing market and the cycling through of prior weak GDP data.\n\n\"The idea that we're around a low point now sounds right. A fair amount of the slowdown after last year has been temporary factors that are either receding or should soon, like the drought.\"", "description": "Leading economists expect another rate cut in the new year despite the RBA downplaying the need for more easing and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg talking up global growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/12cbbcf9fb55c38fc0ec6efbcd8b17e03c2ec47e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
