Congratulations!\u2019 \u201d Trump said as he announced the United States would be lifting sanctions on Turkey and declaring the cease-fire in Syria permanent. The president did not say who was offering this praise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut only a couple of miles down Pennsylvania Avenue, a different reflection of Trump\u2019s actions on Syria was being detailed. There, the Trump administration\u2019s envoy to Syria, James Jeffrey, was giving testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Though he spoke cautiously, Jeffrey painted a less rosy picture of the move than Trump did.\n\nAt least 100 imprisoned fighters from the Islamic State were now missing, the envoy said, explaining that U.S. diplomats \u201cdo not know where they are.\u201d Jeffrey backed up comments made by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and said Turkish-backed forces may have committed war crimes. And he said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to patrol inside Syria would not accomplish \u201canything good.\u201d\n\nTrump says that the ISIS fighters who have escaped have \"been largely recaptured,\" directly contradicting his Syria and D-ISIS envoy Jim Jeffrey who said about an hour ago of the escapees: \"We do not know where they are.\" \u2014 Jennifer Hansler (@jmhansler) October 23, 2019\n\nBetween the White House and the Capitol, there are two separate universes of diplomacy being portrayed. Trump offers one in which his Syria decision has been widely praised and has resulted in benefits to everyone involved. In the other, an experienced, polyglot diplomat who has served as ambassador to both Turkey and Iraq gave a picture of chaos and calamity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven Trump himself seemed to slip up on the unreality of his own universe Wednesday, ad-libbing moments into his prepared speech that undercut its meaning. He tripped over the term \u201csafe zone,\u201d which he mused was an \u201cinteresting term\u201d but \u201cthat\u2019s the term we\u2019re using. Hopefully that zone will become safe.\u201d\n\nBut it may be the parallel universe that ultimately holds the most power. Jeffrey testified Tuesday at a Senate hearing that despite his role as America\u2019s top envoy for Syria, he was not consulted on Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of the country.\n\nFor diplomats working in the shadow of Trump, it can be a bewildering experience. In his opening statement to impeachment investigators in a closed-door hearing Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr. described taking up the position of acting ambassador to Ukraine and discovering soon that there were \u201ctwo channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor, as chief of mission in Kyiv, was in the regular lane. But at the same time, there was another portion of U.S. diplomacy being led by people such as then-special envoy Kurt Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nThese two lanes had different objectives. While Taylor viewed U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as vital for pushing back Russia in the east, the parallel universe line of diplomacy apparently viewed it as a bargaining chip for Ukraine to investigate the family of Joe Biden, the president\u2019s political rival.\n\n\u201cIn an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened,\u201d Taylor testified of the moment he realized that military aid had been blocked. \u201cThe irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of long-standing U.S. policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe world began to find out about all this only after a whistleblower came forward and Trump subsequently approved the release of a rough transcript of a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 an idea that apparently made a lot of sense in the parallel world.\n\nBut Ukrainian leaders were apparently well aware of the demands being placed upon them and had been for some time. The Associated Press reports that in early May, before he had even taken office, Zelensky had gathered a small group of advisers to discuss how to navigate the requests from Trump and Giuliani for a probe into Biden\u2019s son Hunter and \u201chow to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections.\u201d\n\nWhen these two parallel worlds of diplomacy collide, there is collateral damage. Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until when she was recalled in May, was \u201ctreated poorly, caught up in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and Washington,\u201d according to her successor Taylor. In her own statement to Congress, Yovanovitch spoke of her \u201cdeep disappointment and dismay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrett McGurk, Jeffrey\u2019s predecessor as special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, left his position because of Trump\u2019s repeated attempts to pull out of Syria, despite the official U.S. position of fighting against the Islamic State. Former defense secretary Jim Mattis also left because of that, though a new book suggests it was hardly the only factor.\n\nIt is not only those who push back on Trump\u2019s version of diplomacy who fall by the wayside, however. Two indicted associates of Giuliani were in court Wednesday; prosecutors are also investigating whether the former New York mayor broke lobbying laws. Volker resigned from his position in September and Perry is due to step down in December; Sondland clings on but is mired in scandal.\n\nJUST IN: Schiff/Engel/Maloney write to State Dept demanding release of documents \u201cthat are directly and highly relevant\u201d to the impeachment probe.\n\n\n\n(Bill Taylor referenced his notes a lot yesterday, per sources, & Sondland has said he wants to provide docs but is being blocked.) pic.twitter.com/nCV7WyU8XE \u2014 Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) October 23, 2019\n\nMike Pompeo, secretary of state, finds himself torn between the dual realities of Trump and the diplomats he is supposed to represent. And then there\u2019s Trump, who finds himself facing impeachment inquiries because of his conduct with Ukraine and rare rebukes from Republicans because of his action in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the biggest impact of Trump\u2019s parallel universe of diplomacy isn\u2019t felt in Washington, nor in the halls of U.S. embassies around the world. In Syria, the U.S. decision to pull troops out has led to possible war crimes, a potential refugee crisis and a possible resurgence in the Islamic State. And the hold on military aid to Kyiv took place as Ukrainian soldiers were dying on battlefields.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
