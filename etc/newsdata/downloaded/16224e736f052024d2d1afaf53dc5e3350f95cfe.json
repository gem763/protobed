I Am Not a Monster.", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m asking honestly. People\u2019s answers differ. If it\u2019s hard to imagine answering these questions for yourself, can you imagine being asked to answer them for someone else?\n\nMy husband and I chose to end our child\u2019s life. Many imagine this as an impossible decision to make, one that would take hours of deliberation. I will be honest with you. You may not want to hear this, but the decision was obvious to us. Our child would not be given a life of pain and suffering. Instead, we would take her pain on as our own.\n\nI regret that we had to make the choice. I regret that she was so sick, so broken. But I do not regret the decision we made. Within 15 minutes of the diagnosis, we knew what we had to do: We would become baby killers.\n\nAm I punishing myself by using that term? I don\u2019t think so. I want people to know: I ended my child\u2019s life. At 23 weeks and six days into my pregnancy, I had a \u201clate term\u201d abortion. When people ask, \u201cHow could you?\u201d I reply that allowing her to live would have been a fate worse than death. Her diagnosis was not fatal, not incompatible with the bare mechanics of a living body. But it was incompatible with a fulfilling life. And that makes all the difference to me. That\u2019s why I call myself \u201cpro-life.\u201d\n\nThe night before our abortion (a procedure that takes three days to complete), President Trump delivered the annual State of the Union address. I did not watch, but later I saw his comments about late-term abortion make the rounds on social media. Who are these monstrous women and doctors that, in his lurid language, \u201crip\u201d babies \u201cfrom the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth\u201d?\n\nMy child was lovingly cared for until her last heartbeat. She was gently laid to rest after her footprints were stamped in black ink on a rectangle of paper. Those same footprints hang on my bedroom wall along with a locket containing her ashes.\n\nIs this not the picture of maternal feticide you had in mind? I am not a dark shadowy imaginary figure.
