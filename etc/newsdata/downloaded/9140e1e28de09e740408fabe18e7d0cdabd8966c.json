The federal government\u2019s new rules about \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d withdrawals from retirement savings plans like 401(k)s go into effect in January 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s great that people in a financial crunch will have less trouble tapping their retirement plans if necessary. But one thing hasn\u2019t changed: Pulling money out of your retirement savings before retirement is, generally speaking, a bad idea. That\u2019s why personal finance experts, including me, urge caution before using the new rules to make an early withdrawal.\n\nAlso see: The money in your 401(k) and IRA accounts doesn\u2019t belong entirely to you\n\n\u201cAmericans, on average, are undersaved for retirement,\u201d says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar, the Chicago-based investment research firm. \u201cThe idea of prematurely extracting money from a retirement plan in an era when people are undersaved doesn\u2019t seem great.\u201d\n\nWhat qualifies for early withdrawals from 401(k) plans\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service says these types of economic hardship qualify for early withdrawals from employer-sponsored retirement plans:\n\nMedical care expenses for the employee, the employee\u2019s spouse, dependents or beneficiary\n\nCosts directly related to the purchase of an employee\u2019s principal residence (excluding mortgage payments)\n\nTuition, related educational fees and room and board expenses for the next 12 months of postsecondary education for the employee or the employee\u2019s spouse, children, dependents or beneficiary\n\nPayments necessary to prevent the eviction of the employee from the employee\u2019s principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage on that residence\n\nFuneral expenses for the employee, the employee\u2019s spouse, children, dependents or beneficiary\n\nCertain expenses to repair damage to the employee\u2019s principal residence\n\nMost medium-to-large companies allow for hardship withdrawals and 401(k) loans, the main alternative for accessing retirement savings while working. (More about 401(k) loans in a moment.)\n\n401(k) early withdrawals vs. loans\n\nIf you withdraw money from your retirement plan while you\u2019re working at the employer who offered it, you\u2019ll pay a 10% tax penalty and income taxes on the withdrawn amount in most cases and you don\u2019t need to repay what you take out. But the IRS does allow for penalty-free (not income-tax free) withdrawals under limited conditions, including becoming totally disabled; debt for medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of income and a court order for payments to divorced spouse, child or dependent.\n\nAlso read: This is the average 401(k) savings by age\n\nThe other way of gaining access to retirement savings early is through a 401(k) loan. The IRS limits such loans to $50,000 or 50% of your retirement savings account balance (whichever is less). The loan generally must be paid back within five years or within six months after you leave your employer. Loans are a popular option since you\u2019re paying yourself back and, assuming the loan is paid off on time, won\u2019t incur an early withdrawal tax penalty or owe income taxes on what you borrow.\n\n3 ways 401(k) early withdrawals will get easier\n\nHere are the three ways the early-withdrawal rules are changing come January 2020:\n\nUnder the old rules, hardship withdrawals were limited to the amount of money you\u2019d contributed into the plan. The new rules increase the potential pool of savings by including any employer match, profit-sharing contributions and investment earnings.\n\nEmployers will no longer require you to take out a 401(k) loan before applying for a hardship withdrawal.\n\nYou\u2019ll be allowed to contribute to your 401(k) immediately following the withdrawal, rather than waiting six months, as in the past.\n\nWhat retirement experts expect\n\n\u201cMy take is that more employees will be inclined to take hardship withdrawals, with employer matches and investment earnings now becoming accessible,\u201d says Olivia Mitchell, professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School and executive director of the Pension Research Council.\n\nThe reason hardship withdrawals and loans are allowed: there\u2019s some evidence that knowing the possibility of dipping into retirement savings exists boosts both participation and savings rates.\n\nThe new rules might boost the popularity of hardship withdrawals over loans.\n\nA 2017 study of 401(k)s by Mitchell and colleagues found that 86% of 401(k) loan defaults occur when an employee failed to pay the money back within the required six months after leaving. Here, \u201cdefault\u201d means the amount outstanding is considered an early withdrawal and hit with a 10% penalty and income taxes.\n\n\u201cIf there is a substitution of hardship for regular plan loans, this could reduce the unpleasant surprise when people leave their jobs and find they need to come up with money to pay the tax plus, possibly, a penalty for not repaying the loan,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nThe big worry: 401(k) leakage\n\nThe big worry is that the making hardship withdrawals easier will increase what\u2019s known as 401(k) \u201cleakage\u201d \u2014 meaning people using their retirement plan money while employed.\n\nAlready, 401(k) leakage is considerable and concerning.\n\nParticipants in 401(k) plans aged 25 to 55 withdrew at least $29.2 billion early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts) and unpaid loan balances in 2013, according to a March 2019 Government Accountability Office report on 401(k) plans. That amount is actually understated since data limitations obscure the total amount of unpaid 401(k)s loans.\n\nAccording to an Employee Benefit Research Institute analysis, eliminating leakage would result in roughly 27% more participants achieving \u201cretirement success\u201d for the lowest quartile of them based on income. For the highest income quartile, an additional 15% would reach their retirement benchmark, EBRI estimates.\n\nHow to limit leakage\n\nRetirement analysts have a number of good ideas to reduce 401(k) leakage: Simplifying the rollover process when employees change jobs; narrowing the reasons for hardship withdrawals to exclude buying a home and paying for postsecondary education and incorporating an emergency savings account within a 401(k) plan. For an explanation of the last idea, see the Next Avenue story, \u201cThe Sidecar Plan to Help Workers Save for Emergencies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, with the new hardship rules, the government\u2019s essentially encouraging people to make early withdrawals from their 401(k)s.\n\nOf course, financial emergencies happen. Just remember, if you take a 401(k) hardship withdrawal, you\u2019ll have less money set aside for retirement \u2014 when you probably could really use the cash.\n\nSometimes, an early withdrawal is the right choice to make. But only sometimes.", "description": "New rules about \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d withdrawals go into effect in January.
