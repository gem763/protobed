That's a rise of 1.0% from late Thursday\u2019s levels, but is down a little after spiking to $53.30.\n\nThe international benchmark was at $58.47, up 1.4% on the day.\n\nThe labor market report showed that the U.S. economy had created more jobs than thought in August and that, while hiring slowed in September, it didn\u2019t fall off a cliff as some had expected after reading business surveys from the Institute of Supply Management this week.\n\nThe ISM\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a 10-year low, while its fell to the lowest in three years.\n\nThe bounce is taking the edge off what had promised to be one of the worst weeks of the year for crude, in which the easing of geopolitical risks in the Middle East had combined with a weakening demand picture to provoke fears of a new glut.\n\nSome, however, think that a premium on supply risks is still warranted.\n\n\u201cOil markets are focusing on severe macro risks, but are also shrugging off the most heightened geopolitical risk in years,\u201d newswires cited Citigroup (NYSE: ) analysts including Ed Morse as saying in a report. \u201cAs markets shed just about any consideration of supply risk, attention stays focused on what is nearly universally expected to be a significantly weaker year of demand growth.\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva had told Bloomberg TV that the so-called OPEC+ group would look at making additional output cuts to keep the market in balance if necessary.\n\n\u201cEverybody agrees in OPEC that we need to stabilize the market. We cannot allow prices just to plummet,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nElsewhere, rose 1.6% to $1.5808 a gallon, while futures fell 2.2% to $2.28 per 10,000 MM Btu.", "description": "Oil Prices Head Higher as Jobs Data Brightens Demand Picture", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE4U0C5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
