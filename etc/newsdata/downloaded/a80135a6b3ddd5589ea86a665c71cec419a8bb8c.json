You then put on an Oculus Quest headset and can cycle through world landmarks (courtesy of slightly jerky footage drawn from Google Maps). There are also various (very basic) games where you can lasso cowboys and even pilot a tank, controlled via the headset\u2019s hand controllers. It definitely stops you cycling away thinking about work. Pairing with a friend to work out is a nice idea but fiddly in practice (not to mention the fact you both have to invest in a \u00a3400 VR headset). Obviously the idea of doing the same with a stranger is enough to make your skin crawl\u2026", "description": "What could be more undignified than donning unflatteringly tight gym wear and cycling in a frenzy on an exercise bike?
