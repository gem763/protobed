The Trump administration had initially argued it was not covered by a whistleblower statute that would require its automatic disclosure to Congress.\n\nThe administration dropped its opposition to its release after a political firestorm erupted over news reports of some of the details in the complaint.\n\nPelosi cited the complaint as reporting \"repeated abuse of an electronic records system designed to store classified, sensitive, national security information, which the White House used to hide information of a political nature.\"\n\nShe said: \"This is a cover-up. This is a cover-up.\"\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who had withheld the complaint after consulting with the Justice Department, told the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Thursday he believed the whistleblower was acting in good faith.
