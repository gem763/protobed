It was an almost empty car park. He was clearly watching and waiting to strike.\n\n\u201cIt was as if he\u2019d waited for one second past their ticket time to issue a ticket \u2013 disgusting.\u201d\n\nParking tickets in the Fishing Heritage Centre\u2019s car park can cost between \u00a350 and \u00a370, depending on the time of contravention, but a 50 percent discount is applied if paid within 14 days.\n\nThe motorist added: \u201cIf you can\u2019t park in an almost empty car park for free on a Sunday when it\u2019s chucking it down with rain, what\u2019s the point of coming into Grimsby to go around one of its only attractions?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t the council develop a free-for-two-hours policy or make parking free on a Sunday like they have in North Lincolnshire?\n\n(Image: Grimsbylive)\n\n\u201cIt would be especially useful in this car park because you\u2019d probably end up with more people coming into town and the Fishing Heritage Centre. They could trial it over Christmas.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said the council's \"need to generate revenues\" was a key driver of the policy.\n\nThe council statement said: \u201cWe always appreciate peoples\u2019 views on such things as parking and are constantly reviewing and looking at the best options to increase footfall to our town centre and the facilities we provide.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must also balance those decisions out with the need to generate revenues, which is vital if we are to maintain and improve what we have to offer across the whole of North East Lincolnshire.\u201d\n\n(Image: Grimsbylive)\n\nA coach driver was previously fined \u00a350 for parking in the Fishing Heritage Centre's approved \"coach-only\" space when the car par was deserted.\n\nIt was argued that the driver was required to purchase a pay-and-display ticket, but this was later disproven.\n\nThe Fishing Heritage Centre provides coach drivers with free parking when dropping off and picking up visitors.\n\nSpeaking at the time, the coach driver said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to pay to park when you\u2019re bringing a group of children to be educated in a place like this, you\u2019re only doing your job - it seems a bit unfair.\n\n\u201cI think the council is just clutching at straws trying to get every driver they can now.\u201d", "description": "The motorist who was fined last Sunday had parked up outside Grimsby's Fishing Heritage Centre after buying a pay-and-display ticket", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Grimsbylive"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652623.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RBP_HMB_131019parking_005JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
