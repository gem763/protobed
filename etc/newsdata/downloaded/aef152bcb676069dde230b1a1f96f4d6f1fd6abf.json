This tale is for those who prefer the look and feel \u2013 even the smell \u2013 of cold, hard cash.\n\nThe armored car is an integral part of the story.\n\nYou hear the low rumble of idling outside your bank or grocery store. You see the imposing, reinforced steel body ringed with mirrors affixed to a heavy-duty chassis. Darkened windows on the sides of the truck provide inside-out visibility. If someone is watching, you don't know who.\n\nAn armed guard cautiously steps from the truck, one hand close to his sidearm. The other clutches a large canvas bag. A second guard, sometimes toting a shotgun, may shadow the first. You instinctively shy away, allowing unimpeded access to the bank or store. Chatting up a uniformed guard on the job for Brink's (NYSE: BCO) or Loomis AB (OTC: LOIMF) is a bad idea.\n\nThousands of times every day, strategically timed cash deliveries foil those who would lie in wait to ambush the guards. It happens, of course, but less frequently than TV and movies would lead you to think. There's a good reason why armored car companies shun media attention.\n\nOnce in a while, a made-for-TV scene plays out in real life. In May 2018, the rear door of a Brink's truck flew open during rush hour on Interstate 70 near Indianapolis \"blowing bags of cash onto the highway,\" according to the New York Times. State troopers scooped up most of the $600,000, but not before dozens of people helped themselves to fistfuls of $20 bills.\n\nMinting Money\n\nThe U.S. Treasury produces the nation's paper currency and coins. U.S. mints in Philadelphia and Denver make pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and half-dollars. The San Francisco mint is dedicated to proof issues and collector coins like silver bullion dollars. Some commemoratives come from West Point, New York.\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving prints currency notes up to $100 in Washington, D.C. and Fort Worth, Texas. The $500 bill was discontinued in 1969.\n\nAfter production, the paper money is shipped to the 12 Federal Reserve banks and their branches. The Fed releases the currency to commercial banks based on public demand, which varies by the day, week and season. Cash-oriented businesses arrange for their own deliveries, typically by armored truck.\n\nCounting Coins\n\nThe U.S. Mint continually revises how it estimates demand. It uses long-range economic indicators and historical seasonal trends, such as Christmas, to decide how many coins to manufacture. It is tough to nail the exact amount. Banks need inventory but not too much.\n\nDespite advance planning to mix newly minted coins with those in circulation, shortages occasionally occur. In an emergency, the Fed can work around advance shipping schedules to get more coins. Armored cars, along with registered and express mail, fill bank orders.\n\nArmored trucks usually transport dimes, quarters and half-dollars. Tractor-trailer trucks carry pennies and nickels, each of which cost more to make than their face value. The comparatively low metal content of higher denomination coins offset low-end losses, said Patrick Heller, former owner and now communications officer at Liberty Coin Service in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nPenny Peril\n\nThe Mint purchases the plain metal discs called a planchet from which it strikes pennies. In September 2016, a tractor-trailer hauling millions of copper-plated zinc planchets en route to the Philadelphia Mint struck a concrete median barrier on I-95 in Delaware and burst into flames.\n\nFor 13 hours, clean-up crews used hand shovels and truck-loaded vacuums to recover the planchets scattered along the northbound lanes. Unlike the Brinks' free-for-all in Indiana two years later, the public didn't get close to the would-be pennies. Delaware State Police diverted traffic off the interstate at the exit before the crash site.\n\nAll other coin denominations come from coinage strip. The mint punches its own raw blanks to convert into finished planchets for production.\n\nBanks returned badly worn or bent coins to the Mint, which melts them down and makes them into new coins. They also remove foreign and counterfeit coins from circulation. More than 20 billion coins worth in excess of $2 billion passes through Mint coin processing units each year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The U.S. Treasury produces the nation's paper currency and coins.
