It's not normal for a kid to be working 40-plus hours a week and going to school and taking care of themselves in order to just get out and be able to graduate.\"\n\nKhan bounced in and out of the foster care system beginning when she was six years old. She was in a string of temporary care arrangements, which meant she wasn't eligible for some of the same supports as permanent Crown wards.\n\nWhen Crown wards reach the age of majority, they \"age out\" of the system and lose government support, typically at 18 or 19 years old. But Khan says people need to realize those in temporary arrangements may lose access to support even earlier.\n\nArisha Khan bounced in and out of Ontario's child welfare system between the ages of six and 18. (Submitted by Arisha Khan)\n\n\"In my experience, and I see this happening in the system a lot now, it's kids who are younger and younger that don't even meet that age of majority who are being dropped by their child welfare agencies, either formally or informally just through a lack of support,\" she said.\n\n\"In my case I was working too much, and so then they took away those supports.\"\n\nKhan studied health and social policy at McGill University, where she helped pioneer a bursary for former youth in care.\n\nAt Oxford, she will be \"examining cross-sectoral collaborations between health and social service systems to address the health needs of children and youth in state care.\"\n\nSelf-sufficiency vs. interdependence\n\nMelanie Doucet, who spent time in care in New Brunswick, said youth in care are expected to be instant adults when they lose government support.\n\n\"When you look at kids who aren't in care, they're not expected to be basically disowned by their parents just because they reach the age of majority, which is what happens to kids in care,\" she told Walker.\n\nShe said the expectation of instant self-sufficiency is unfair and unrealistic, given that young people in the rest of society are increasingly living at home longer or moving home in times of crisis.\n\n\"[Former youth in care] don't have that option \u2026 you can't return into care if you're going through a rough time. That's why, if you look at the statistics of homelessness, it's really not a good outcome for kids who age out, because they're basically left on the side of the street with a garbage bag full of belongings if they didn't have a good social worker that helped them find their first apartment.\"\n\nMelanie Doucet entered care in New Brunswick as a teenager and moved six times in four years. \"It's really hard to develop healthy attachments to people when you're bounced around from home to home,\" she said. (Melanie Doucet/Twitter)\n\nDoucet is currently a PhD candidate in social work at McGill University, where her research focuses on pathways to supportive long-term relationships for youth exiting government care. She recently completed a project with eight former youth in care about the importance of relationships in their lives.\n\nDoucet said she wants to see the child welfare system focus on teaching interdependence and helping youth in care form healthy relationships, rather than sending the message that youth in care need to be able to fend for themselves.\n\n\"I'd really like that whole independent living paradigm to be completely eliminated ... to focus on interdependence instead, because that's how kids who aren't in care live their lives. They are supported by their families, their friends, and their communities throughout their entire lives, and there's no magical age where that stops,\" she said.\n\n\"So kids in care also deserve to experience that.\"\n\nLand and culture\n\nBach, a member of the Mishkeegogamang First Nation in northern Ontario, entered foster care in B.C. at birth.\n\nShe said it's important for Indigenous youth in care to have opportunities to reconnect with their communities \u2014 something she didn't have the chance to do when she was young.\n\n\"It was honestly never even encouraged to know what my community's name was. I actually didn't learn that until I was 17,\" she said.\n\n\"I missed everything that First Nations youth should have \u2014 in particular, Anishinaabe youth. I missed all the rites of passage, and missed the cultural teachings. I didn't get to go out in the bush with a family member and learn everything from the land. I didn't get to meet family members who ended up passing away.\"\n\nAshley Bach, pictured here with her newly handmade moosehide gloves, said it's important for Indigenous youth in care to have the chance to reconnect with their culture. (Donna Simon)\n\nToday, Bach sits on the Nishnawbe Aski Nation's young people's council, and she recently testified before the Canadian Senate about Bill C-92, on Indigenous child welfare.\n\nShe said there are some initiatives to help Indigenous youth connect with their culture, but she's yet to see substantial change.\n\n\"There's a little bit in British Columbia, but it's not enough for the demand. Some First Nations have implemented their own programs to bring kids out on land camp, but it's not something that I've seen yet at a systemic level,\" she said.\n\n\"One social worker won't be able to, for example, send you all the way back home to your First Nation or travel with you to visit your nation and meet elders in your community. That's something that the system as a whole has to learn how to support.\"\n\nFamily reunification\n\nKhan said there is an increased focus on family reunification in the child welfare system \u2014 in part because of the legacy of the Sixties Scoop, and the over-representation of Indigenous youth in foster care today.\n\nWhile reunification is the right goal for some, she said those decisions need to be made on a case-to-case basis.\n\nThe child or youth's voice needs to be heard. - Ashley Bach\n\n\"You have to put supports in place to ensure that families can be supported \u2014 or if the child wants to be on their own, that they will be supported as well,\" said Khan. She's sometimes seen child welfare agencies use the rhetoric of reunification without delivering adequate support to families.\n\n\"There wasn't really investment in communities in order to allow for structural support needed for kids to thrive. I think using the family reunification rhetoric without also taking into account what the needs and wishes of the child are is really harmful.\"\n\nBach said it's crucial for decisions about reunification to be as youth-centred as possible.\n\n\"First and foremost, the child or youth's voice needs to be heard. Their wants and their needs have to be considered and factored in, and that's easier to do with the youth than it is with a young child, but it's still something that the social workers and judges should really be considering,\" she said.\n\nClick listen above to hear the interview.", "description": "Connie Walker speaks with Ashley Bach, an Indigenous youth leader, Arisha Khan, a Rhodes Scholar, and Melanie Doucet, a PhD student in social work.
