Traders and investors could go long on strength above $145 and $150. Risk a close below $135.\"\n\nPrices did not rally after the numbers and instead gapped lower so traders should not have gotten long. IBM declined to near the Point and Figure \"price target of around $132.\" The gap to the downside has so far not started a new leg to the downside, so let's look at a quick-turning candlestick chart.\n\nIn this daily Japanese candlestick chart of IBM, below, we can see that Monday's pattern was a doji where the opening price and the closing price are the same or nearly the same. This pattern suggests that buyers and sellers are in balance. If today's bar shows that prices can close above today's opening of $132.55 then we will have some confirmation that we are seeing a bottom reversal.\n\nIn this updated Point and Figure chart of IBM, below, we can see that prices have met their downside price target and that a trade at $128.71 would be a new low for the move down and that would be a good place to stop out any new longs.\n\nBottom line strategy: Japanese candlestick charts were designed to spot reversals. A doji is a potential reversal pattern if it exists at the end of a trend and we get confirmation. Assuming IBM closes above today's opening of $132.55, then aggressive traders could go long IBM and risk below $128.71.", "description": "Let's look at the Japanese candlestick chart of IBM....IBM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Ibm Is Getting Over The Big Blues Of Last Week'S Earnings", "Let'S Look At The Japanese Candlestick Chart Of Ibm.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/ibmlogoredsculpture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
