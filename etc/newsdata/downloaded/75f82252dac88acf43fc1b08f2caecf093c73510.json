Though Trump has already cast off the issue as another \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d he has reportedly agreed to its release.\n\nCNN reported that the document is currently undergoing declassification. It\u2019s unclear how much of the document will actually be released.\n\nEarlier that day, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution calling for its release.\n\nSources also told The New York Times on Tuesday that White House officials had concluded they had no choice but to let the whistleblower meet with congressional investigators. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has subsequently requested a meeting take place Thursday.\n\nThe complaint, which relates to Trump\u2019s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate former former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, could be a vital document in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nAt issue is whether Trump illegally put pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2020 Democratic front-runner Biden. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have spent the last few months pushing the unfounded theory that when Biden was vice president, he pressured Ukraine to fire the country\u2019s chief prosecutor to stymie an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company with ties to his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThe report on the complaint is also up for release. Though Inspector General Michael Atkinson concluded the whistleblower complaint was urgent and credible, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire disagreed and did not act on it when Atkinson forwarded it to him.\n\nShortly after reports broke of the complaint\u2019s release, Maguire issued a statement saying he\u2019s upheld his responsibility to \u201cfollow the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the whistleblower applauded news of the development.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the decision to release the whistleblower complaint as it establishes that, ultimately, the lawful whistleblower disclosure process can work,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nThe news comes the same day Trump vowed to release a transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president the following day, though his administration has a history of editing out unflattering parts of Trump\u2019s conversations.\n\nThis story has been updated throughout.", "description": "The move comes after the Republican-controlled Senate passed a non-binding resolution calling for its release.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8aa8362300005a006e09a2.jpeg?cache=fxao0kxjhb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
