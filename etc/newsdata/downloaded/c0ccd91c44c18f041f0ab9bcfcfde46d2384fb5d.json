The States has Spam, China has the century egg, France has escargot and the UK has its historical jar of tar-looking yeast spread.\n\nMarmite is a brand that has carved out a niche by being divisive, with its age-old slogan being: \u2018Love it or hate it.\u2019\n\nAnd they\u2019re still playing on this feature.\n\nPerhaps you can\u2019t resist a bit of Marmite melted with butter on toast, or perhaps you think the paste is simply sin in a jar, no matter how much vitamin B-12 it packs. Well, Marmite happens to be recruiting those who fit in the latter camp.\n\nThe brand has put the call out for the UK\u2019s biggest Marmite hater to reveal themselves.\n\nTheir new campaign, Marmite Mind Control, is set to involve a professional hypnotherapist using techniques to turn Marmite haters into Marmite lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be five winners who will get to partake in the experiment, and only one will be titled Marmite\u2019s Biggest Hate\u2019.\n\nOn top of despising the stuff, applicants will be older than 18, and will have to answer the following questions:\n\nHow much do you hate Marmite? Have you ever been a volunteer for a stage hypnosis show? Yes/No If yes, did you have a good experience?\n\nIf successful, haters will travel to London for the conversion experiment. *shudders*\n\nEntries are now open. Be sure to get them in by 12pm GMT on October 31, 2019.\n\nTo enter, visit marmite.co.uk.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Marmite have tried something a little bonkers. In April this year, the brand released a Marmite Peanut Butter, blending the classic savoury taste of Marmite with a dollop of smooth PB.\n\nFor Christmas last year, Iceland paired an unpopular veg with the sometimes-unpopular spread and launched Marmite brussels sprouts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A bizarre new campaign from the yeast spread is looking to convert the UK's biggest Marmite hater.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88978421_1570598754.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
