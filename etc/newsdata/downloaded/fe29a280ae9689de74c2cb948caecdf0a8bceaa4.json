Only a fifth think it's a good idea and the majority said the number plates wouldn't have the effect of making them any more likely to switch to an electric vehicle.\"\n\n(Image: Blackball Media / SWNS)\n\nShapps recently announced that he has doubled funding for electric vehicle charging points on residential streets.\n\nThe Government is also consulting on requiring charge points to be built into all new homes with a parking space.\n\nData published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders shows 25,097 purely electric new cars were registered during the first nine months of the year, more than double the figure during the same period in 2018.\n\nThese cars now hold a 1.3% share of the new car market.", "description": "Special number plates have been trialled in Ontario, Canada, with drivers of electric vehicles given free access to toll lanes and high occupancy vehicle lanes", "authors": ["Neil Lancefield", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Afp Getty Images", "Blackball Media", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9047937.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Climate-Change-And-Global-Pollution-To-Be-Discussed-At-Copenhagen-Summit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
