The 22-year-old American won with a cushion of 2.1 points, her biggest at a world all-around event, as Tang Xijing of China claimed silver and Russia\u2019s Angelina Melnikova took bronze.\n\n\u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d Biles said. \u201cFor my fifth, that\u2019s kind of unheard of, so it was really exciting. But we finished strong and we gave it our all. It\u2019s super exciting we had the opportunity to do this.\u201d\n\nOne year ago Biles fell twice in the all-around final and left the arena seething despite her clear victory. She seems to have learned from those mistakes. Instead of opting for all of the risky, mind-blowing skills she has written into gymnastics history in the past two years, she decided to play things relatively safe. The greatest measure of Biles\u2019s dominance is that her version of \u201csafe\u201d is still far beyond what any of her rivals could dream of.\n\nSimone Biles wins fifth world all-around gymnastics title by record margin \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nBiles opened her competition with the Cheng vault \u2013 a round-off, half twist on to the table with one and a half twists off, a half twist less than her eponymous vault, on which she fell last year. Despite landing with a foot slightly out of bounds, Biles flew high and far with supreme form and a small hop, immediately establishing her lead with a monstrous score of 15.233.\n\nAs medal contenders fell all around, Biles stepped up and produced a clean, assured uneven bars set, finishing with a stuck double-double dismount, a big score of 14.733 and a beaming smile. There was a time when the uneven bars were consistently Biles\u2019s weaker piece, but with each passing year she improves a little more.\n\nSo often in gymnastics history, the balance beam has been the apparatus that decides medals and exposes nerves. Last year Biles fell victim to the beam and tumbled on a tricky front flip with a half turn. This year she eradicated the skill from her set and marched through with rhythm and ease as she scored 14.633. Instead of the breathtaking, undervalued double-double dismount she invented this year, Biles again chose to be \u2018safe\u2019 and opted for one fewer twist. It was still the most difficult dismount in the entire competition.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Biles on the balance beam.

This week, more trivially, she debuted a skill on the beam that was valued low, explicitly because nobody else is good enough to compete it. Biles\u2019s strength on and off the podium have propelled her to achievements that nobody ever thought were possible. Now she is the face of the sport and it is difficult to imagine gymnastics without them.", "description": "Simone Biles reinforced her status as one of the most dominant gymnasts in history by bulldozing the competition in Stuttgart", "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef36fd535f6e680ac512a89f3cc95e1c54f48908/0_564_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afe83f6a2515a84c59b038e8019d2f76", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
