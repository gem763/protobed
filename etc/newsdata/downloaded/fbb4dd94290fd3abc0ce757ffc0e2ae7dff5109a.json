I don't know how much stuff there was going on behind the scenes, but Giuliani has lawyered up as expected. I know that everyone is focused on the phone call, but that was basically just evidence that Trump and his folks were doing something and that he was fully aware. This is different than the 2016 election and the Mueller investigation where he wasn't in the meetings and said that he was not aware of any assistance from Russia. This is really different because in this case he is actually asking for assistance. He could have said \"pretty please with sugar on top.\" It doesn't matter because how he says it; the act of solicitation is illegal. Period. Case closed. The thing is that he's continued to fight to secure anything related to his income. Russia is not a wealthy country, but it is a country based on rule of some very, very wealthy folks. Putin for example is one of the wealthiest people in the world. Right now he and many of his wealthy friends are under personal sanctions that limit their ability to do anything. I'm not saying that Trump has any financial ties to Russia. I do know that he likes to wheel and deal. There is no doubt that someone like Putin would not be extremely grateful to have those sanctions lifted. The problem is that those were additional sanctions were put in place because of the election interference. The original sanctions were put into place because of the invasion of Ukraine. So right now we have our President asking the leader of Ukraine to play nice with Putin (who has invaded his country). There appears to be some questions about starting an investigation into Biden and his son. The request was right after discussions about weapons for Ukraine to defend itself from Russia. In the meantime we are learning that our Attorney General is running around the world talking to the nations that provided intelligence regarding the election interference and basically asking them to do something that makes it sound different. On top of that we have a personal lawyer running around working on behalf of the President's campaign (??) which is fine, but he's also working with the State Dept? What is his position? What authority does he have? Who does he answer to? If he's a private citizen than he doesn't have the authority to do any of this stuff. As someone who is supposed to know the law and who also served in the government this man should know that he's put himself into a bad situation. Bottom line is that they don't have to like it, but they are subject to oversight by Congress. That's just how it is. The really bad part about this is that not only do we appear to be exploiting countries like Ukraine who we were supposedly helping to dig out from a corrupt government .....not only do we seem to have an organized effort to defend corrupt governments from exploiting nations like Ukraine, but now we're possible undermining our relationships with our allies through a display of absolute hypocrisy and disregard for facts in favor of power and greed. This isn't just about Trump or the democrats and republicans and I wish that people weren't so damn small-minded. This kind of stuff has wide ranging and long term effects.", "description": "Matt Damon has revealed that he lost out on \u00a3250 million worth of profits when he turned down the lead role in Avatar.The actor said that when director James Cameron approached him for the role of Jake Sully \u2013 which was eventually taken by Sam Worthington \u2013 he also offered him 10 per cent of the movie", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6h9Nzlt0KHO5WTybvEkaQQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/4697a9a595eaf2bf6cc5051f9962bbf8"}
