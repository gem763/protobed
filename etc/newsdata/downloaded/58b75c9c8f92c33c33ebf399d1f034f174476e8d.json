(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Redskins defensive lineman Jonathan Allen plans to play against the Chicago Bears on Monday night after returning to practice Friday. Allen suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament in the season-opening loss against the Philadelphia Eagles and did not play against the Dallas Cowboys last week. He did not practice Thursday and was limited Friday. The original prognosis called for him to miss one or two weeks.\n\nAllen said that he is absolutely playing Monday, but that his knee isn\u2019t 100 percent. He has dropped about eight pounds to get down to 287 in hopes that playing lighter will take some stress off the knee.\n\n\u201cHe looked good, it was a good test for him today,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said.\n\n[In a pivotal season, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden has ramped up the intensity]\n\nTight end Jordan Reed was held out again Friday as he remains in the concussion protocol after a helmet-to-helmet hit in Washington\u2019s third preseason game.\n\nCornerback Quinton Dunbar (knee) and linebacker Cassanova McKinzy (hip) did not practice Friday but were in the rehab area. Dunbar was not able to play last week against the Cowboys. Safety Montae Nicholson (foot) and receiver Robert Davis (knee) got a rest day Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about Dunbar,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s struggling a little bit. We have another day tomorrow and Sunday. We\u2019ll wait and see. Hopefully he feels stronger in that leg, can push off and drive and run. If not, he\u2019ll probably be doubtful. ...
