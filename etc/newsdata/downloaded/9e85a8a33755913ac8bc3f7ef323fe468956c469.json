The gift that keeps on giving.\n\nThis week, it was reported that the coworking firm is considering the drastic move of cutting its $47 billion valuation in half before its planned IPO. WeWork's roadshow is reportedly set to kick off next week, but it remains unclear if that'll happen. Some investors that I spoke to said they're still concerned about opacity around WeWork's financials and lack of disclosures. They think ultimately the deal will get done \u2014 it just may not be at the company's ideal price.\n\nMeanwhile, even seasoned asset managers are confused about WeWork's valuation, reports BI's Bradley Saacks.\n\nFidelity, which has exposure to WeWork through its massive Contrafund, slashed the fund's valuation on WeWork shares between the end of last year and the middle of this summer, according to a regulatory filing. The mutual-fund giant once valued the company significantly higher than its peers but has cut the valuation of WeWork shares in the Contrafund by roughly a third.\n\nOther funds, like T.
