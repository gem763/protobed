She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week.\n\nMr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined \u2014 twice \u2014 to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and \u201cmake it clear they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe then turned to Mr. Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds, America\u2019s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: \u201cThis is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.\u201d\n\nOnly Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping \u201ca small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities\u201d on the ground, especially in Syria.\n\nThose forces, he argued, \u201cwere the only thing that stood between that part of Syria\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by.\n\nThe exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia\u2019s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago.\n\nWhen Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe\u201d facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: \u201cThe 1980s, they\u2019re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\u201d an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed.", "description": "After decades of trying to prove their toughness on national security, the candidates described an allies-first, tough-on-Russia foreign policy.
