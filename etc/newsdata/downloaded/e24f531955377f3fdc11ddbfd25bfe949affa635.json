I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you are a bunch of politicians and say that we swear we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, 'we don't want to respect that vote', what do you expect to happen?\"\n\nHe said both Leave and Remain campaigners had received \"serious threats\" of violence, which he said should be taken seriously.\n\n\"In the end the situation can only be resolved by Parliament honouring its promise to respect the result,\" he said, echoing the prime minister's words in the Commons.\n\n\"Believe me,\" Mr Johnson told MPs. \"The best way to ensure that every parliamentarian is properly safe and to dial down the current anxiety in this country is to get Brexit done.\"\n\nPM 'deplores threats'\n\nMr Cummings also said Downing Street was \"not under pressure\".\n\n\"This is a walk in the park compared to the referendum, we are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, a video showed Labour shadow minister Karl Turner approaching Mr Cummings and urging him to dial down the \"inflammatory\" language used by the prime minister.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned that the PM's language was encouraging people to behave in a \"disgraceful and abusive way\", as MPs debated the use of language in the Commons on Thursday.\n\nIn the debate, several MPs said the prime minister should apologise for saying the best way to honour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered during the EU referendum campaign, was to \"get Brexit done\".\n\nMPs also detailed some of the threats they had faced, with Tory MP Caroline Noakes describing how someone called her a \"traitor who deserved to be shot\" on a walkabout in her constituency.\n\nBut Mr Johnson insisted he \"deplores any threats to anybody, particularly female MPs\", and he said that \"tempers need to come down\" in Parliament.", "description": "He says the only way the issue of abuse will be solved is if MPs \"respect\" the EU referendum result.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pdplx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
