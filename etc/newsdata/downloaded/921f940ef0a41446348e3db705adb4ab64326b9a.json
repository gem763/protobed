We are saying it is time to rebalance the onus onto firms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like firms to be very conscious of what \u2018sludge\u2019 they\u2019re imposing on consumers and really get rid of unnecessary product complexity that isn\u2019t in the best interests of consumers and their own business.\u201d\n\nSuperannuation 'manipulated'\n\nThe pendulum shift from relying on product disclosure statements, fact sheets and fine-print warnings builds on pressure applied by the Hayne royal commission for companies to treat customers fairly.\n\nIt is a marked departure from disclosure and financial literacy being the foundations to protect consumers since the Howard government's landmark financial system inquiry by Stan Wallis in 1997.\n\nAmong the case studies over a decade contained in the ASIC-Dutch report, published on Monday night, superannuation dashboards \u2013 intended to provide a simple snapshot summary of a super product on a fund's website \u2013 were found to be \"vulnerable to manipulation\".\n\n\"A key implication of this research is the ease with which consumer choice could be manipulated through the \u2018dashboard\u2019 form \u2013 for example, by relabelling or reweighting asset allocation information used in the pie chart,\" the report notes.\n\nTwo-thirds of people were not able to locate all relevant investment fund fees and less than half could identify all super fund fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn insurance, consumers focused too much on price to the exclusion of other factors such as the terms of payouts in the event of an accident.\n\nOnly two in five Australians given a key fact sheet for insurance objectively selected the best product, with 60 per cent given suboptimal insurance.\n\nSome 86 per cent of local consumers assessed the quality of financial advice to be good, in contrast to 39 per cent of the same advice being independently rated as poor.\n\nConsumers were also unduly influenced by the frequency and placement of advertisements, which were treated as a proxy for the quality and safety of investment advice.\n\nFurthermore, the complex and time-consuming sales processes fatigued consumers and rushed them into making decisions, the report said.\n\nThe 33 case studies span across Australia, the Netherlands, United States and Britain over 10 years.\n\nBehavioural economics\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work was influenced by the thinking of behavioural economists and organisational psychologists, including Sunita Sah, who advised the Hayne commission that a focus on enhanced disclosure and professional ethics may be insufficient to protect customers.\n\nAsked if ASIC was abandoning the principle of \"buyer beware\" or caveat emptor, Ms Chester insisted personal responsibility still had a role to play in financial consumer protection.\n\n\u201cDisclosure and financial literacy still matter, but if you have unnecessary complexity don\u2019t expect it to protect consumers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe regulatory switch reflects a recognition by ASIC's behavioral economists that the financial services market is not adequately competitive or efficient, and that relying on disclosure and financial literacy ignores the complexity of markets, cognitive biases, firms competing for consumer attention through advertising blitzes and \"warnings about warnings\".\n\nASIC, bolstered by new laws recently passed by the Federal Parliament, is already enforcing a more consumer-outcome-focused approach.\n\nShift to product intervention\n\nProduct intervention powers have enabled it to deal with risky and expensive short-term credit by payday lending firms such as Cigno and add-on insurance products sold by car yards.\n\nDesign and distribution obligations for financial products set expectations for firms to deliver good consumer outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIC will also lobby the government for any new laws to be written in a consumer-centric way.\n\nThe regulator is working with the government to stop firms confusing people via the conflation of general advice and personal advice, with more regulatory action due by the first half of next year.\n\nMs Chester said she was conscious of the regulatory burden on firms, but ASIC's new approach could reduce red tape and be good for business.\n\n\"If firms get this right, ASIC won\u2019t need to use our product intervention powers, they\u2019re less likely to have breach reporting and less remediation bills,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Firms need to realise that these obligations, and them acting in the best interests of the consumers, is actually good business. They should be doing it as an insurance policy for themselves.\"\n\nMore than $10 billion had been paid and provisioned for in compensation and fines by finance firms in response to the Hayne commission.\n\nIn a broadside at the $2.9 superannuation industry following her report on super last year for the Productivity Commission, Ms Chester said on Monday the failure of disclosure was worse in super and she pledged to \"lean in\" from ASIC on default super once the Morrison government finalises its response to the PC report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 50 of the 76 Hayne royal commission's recommendations relate to requiring better firm conduct, with only one finding on improving disclosure.\n\nSome banks have been eradicating complex products and simplifying their offerings since the Hayne commission, with ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott and Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief Matt Comyn earlier speaking in favour of providing services and products that are good for consumers and easy to understand.\n\nThe regulatory switch follows the Coalition government's 2014 financial inquiry by former Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive and now AMP chairman David Murray, who similarly found disclosure was ineffective for several reasons.", "description": "The corporate regulator has admitted a two-decade systemic reliance on disclosure such as fine print and product warnings has failed to protect consumers of financial services.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9439%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_276%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/20f5ff12e5db68eb8a7c2da10bfeb2c9592cdc28", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
