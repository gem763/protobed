Trump signed the First Step Act into law last year that reduces mandatory minimum sentences in certain instances and gives judges more discretion. More than 3,100 inmates will be released under the act, which has been praised by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nLegend responded to Trump\u2019s tweet by appealing to the First Lady.\n\n\u201cImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody\u2014ANYBODY\u2014will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you,\u201d he tweeted. A minute later he tweeted, \u201cYour country needs you, Melania.\u201d\n\nThe news channel was airing \"Justice For All,\" a special on mass incarceration in the country and Legend was interviewed during the broadcast.\n\nTeigen called the president a \u201cp***y a** b***h\u201d for tagging \u201ceveryone\u201d but her in his tweet. Legend, in a tongue-in-cheek appeal, requested that followers not to retweet the vulgar comment as a hashtag.\n\nLegend, 40, and his wife have been fierce critics of the president. The Grammy-winner called Trump a \u201cpiece of s***\u201d and a canker sore on the country after the president\u2019s criticism of Baltimore.\n\nIn an interview with USA Today, Teigen said, \"I've actually been a big Donald Trump hater [or a long time]. I've been trolling him for about five to seven years now,\" she said. \"I've been doing this forever, and I take pride in that.\"\n\nTrump talked about criminal justice reform and how President \u201cObama couldn\u2019t come close\u201d to passing meaningful law. The president said he is tired of \u201cboring musician John Legend\u201d and his wife for touting the bill.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it...And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!,\" Trump tweeted.", "description": "President Trump late Sunday took to Twitter to identify his own success\u00a0in\u00a0criminal justice reform and called out celebrities for not\u00a0acknowledging his efforts, namely singer John Legend and his \"filthy mouthed wife\" Chrissy Teigen.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
