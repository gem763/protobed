It wasn't fun. I complained to my husband \u2014 a lot.\n\n\"Why didn't you just buy a new mattress?\" you're probably thinking. Well, here's the scenario \u2014 we didn't want to buy a new King-sized bed \u2014 and all the accompanying bedroom furniture \u2014 until we bought our forever house. And we didn't want to invest in an expensive new mattress that we would only use for a year or so either.\n\nFinally, one night, while I was lost in the black hole that is Amazon Prime, I started looking at mattress toppers.\n\nIt seemed like a logical temporary solution to my problem that would require little investment \u2014 or not. My innocent little search proved to be a bit overwhelming to say the least, as there are probably hundreds available of varying thicknesses, materials and price points. For example, a 3-inch Tempur-Pedic can set you back more than $250, while a 1-inch egg crate foam can cost less than $20.\n\nAfter I got over the initial overwhelmed feeling, I went straight to the page for Amazon's Choice products, which consists of \"highly rated, well-priced products available to ship immediately.\" Then I looked at the number of reviews and average star rating \u2014 if a product manages to get a 4+ star rating with thousands of reviews, it's likely pretty legit to me. I found my favorite leggings this way, so I'd say this strategy has a good track record.\n\nAnd that's how I landed on the Linenspa 2-Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper too \u2014 which it didn't disappoint at all. But the best part? It cost me just a little more than $50.\n\nSpecs\n\nThe mattress topper is available in several different sizes: Cal King: 71 inches x 83 inches x 2 inches Full: 52.5inches x 74 inches x 2 inches King: 75 inches x 79 inches x 2 inches Queen: 59 inches x 79 inches x 2 inches Twin: 37.5 inches x 74 inches x 2i nches Twin Xl: 37.5 inches x 79 inches x 2 inches\n\nMaterials 100% Polyurethane Memory Foam Gel Beads\n\n\n\nThe foam is CertiPUR-US\u00ae Certified, meaning it has been analyzed by independent, accredited testing laboratories, and meets CertiPUR-US standards for content, emissions, and durability.\n\nWarranty It comes with a 3-year limited warranty.\n\n\n\nSet-up process\n\nThe mattress topper arrived the next day (because Amazon Prime rules) in vacuum-sealed packaging and was easy to unroll. It looked super flat at first, and then quickly expanded to its full two-inches. The pad itself is blue, and the memory foam is infused with a cooling gel that supposedly captures and distributes body heat in order to help regulate temperature and keep you cool at night. I didn't really notice this aspect of the topper a lot since I just wanted to sleep on a softer surface, but we didn't wake up sweaty so I guess it helped a little.\n\nDepending on when you get your topper, I'd suggest opening it in the morning, placing it on your bed, and allowing it to \"breathe\" for several hours before sleeping on it. Some reviewers complain that it has an odor, but that wasn't my experience.\n\nSome mattress toppers come with a cover, but this one doesn't, so you might want to order one. Alternatively, you can place it under a mattress pad, which is what I did. Or you can just place it directly on your mattress and put the bed sheets on top.\n\nThe first night sleeping on our doctored-up bed was honestly pretty awesome. While I can't say it was like sleeping on a cloud, it definitely transformed our hard slab to a plusher, more body-conforming mattress. It seriously felt like we were sleeping on a new mattress.\n\nAfter sleeping on the bed for several weeks, my husband noticed that my back and neck pain complaints subsided substantially too. In retrospect, I should have gone with the 3-inch version instead for a little more cushioning.\n\nAfter several months, the topper is still in great condition. I haven't noticed any sagging or denting, and it continues to do the trick.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Linenspa 2-inch Gel Infused Mattress Mattress Topper was an incredibly small investment for such a huge improvement in our quality of sleep.\n\nI'm really glad that I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a topper, especially because this one did the trick just fine. As I mentioned before, if I could go back in time I might've chosen the plusher 3-inch option, which only costs $20 more. But we're still happy with our 2-incher \u2014 now my husband doesn't have to listen to me complain about my neck and back.\n\nPros: Inexpensive, highly-rated, can soften a firm mattress, comes in various sizes\n\nCons: Choosing between the ideal thickness for your needs might be a gamble, warranty might be limiting", "description": "This Linenspa memory foam mattress topper helped with my back and neck soreness, and also kept me cool during the night.", "authors": ["Leah Groth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d0d0456e3ecba346b3fd0ca-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
