Fourteen remained in detention on Saturday.\n\nNepal is home to around 20,000 exiled Tibetans, but under pressure from Beijing the communist government has taken an increasingly hardline stance on their activities.\n\n\"There is heavy police presence, it is an intimidating situation. We've been asked to stay in,\" one Tibetan told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nNepal's authorities declined to comment.\n\n- 'Focus on connectivity' -\n\nAlthough India has traditionally been Nepal's main ally, China has intensified its presence in the impoverished Himalayan nation, pumping millions of dollars into infrastructure projects ranging from roads to hydropower plants.\n\nIn 2017, Nepal signed up to China's Belt and Road programme which includes initiatives to build or upgrade highways and airports in the country.\n\nAlthough India has traditionally been Nepal's main ally, China has intensified its presence in the impoverished Himalayan nation\n\n\"A trans-Himalayan connectivity network is thus taking shape, which will serve not just our two countries but also the region as a whole,\" Xi said in his article.\n\nLandlocked Nepal is seeking closer ties and much-needed energy and infrastructure investment from its giant neighbour.\n\n\"This visit has historic significance for Nepal. Our priority is to create opportunities for Nepal, joining it to China's development. We are focusing on connectivity between the two countries,\" said Nepal's Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali.\n\nAlthough no official announcement has been made, it is expected that the two countries will sign agreements for Chinese investment in highways, tunnels and hydro projects.\n\nHigh on the agenda is the extension of China's Kerung railway from the border to Nepal's capital Kathmandu. There have been warnings over the financial commitments however.\n\n\"Nepal has to be conscious when it reaches the point of financial dealings on these projects and build capacity to negotiate and not fall into debt traps,\" said Sudheer Sharma, editor of the Kantipur national daily.\n\nXi will hold talks with Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and other top leaders and meet with President Bidhya Devi Bhandari.", "description": "Nepal rolled out the red carpet on Saturday for China's President Xi Jinping as authorities rounded up Tibetans to prevent protests during his stay.Xi is...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/13/wire-19625736-1570882665-758_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
