All three defendants alleged they suffered abuse including beatings and rape at the hands of their 'tyrannical' father. Now the Moscow Department of Health officially found that Mikhail Khachaturyan (top inset with his daughter Angelina) inflicted 'serious harm' on his daughters' health, according to findings cited by lawyers representing the sisters. Forensic experts confirmed they suffered abuse and diagnosed them with mental health disorders as a result of his actions. The ruling came as a new video was released of Mr Khachaturyan (left and right) appearing to shout at his daughters and even kicking the youngest girl because they 'ate too many sweets'.", "description": "Discover the latest global news from the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.
