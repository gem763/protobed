Instead, it can be unlocked and turned on with a smartphone, a car-shaped key fob, or a keycard that comes in handy if you don\u2019t have a fob or your phone dies. One creative driver figured out a way to make sure that she can always unlock and start her Model 3: she implanted the RFID tag from the keycard into her forearm.\n\nAmie DD is a software engineer and self-described \u201cmaker of things.\u201d In a video, she explained that she had implanted an RFID tag in her arm years ago, which she had used to open her home\u2019s front door and to send a smartphone\u2019s browser to her personal website. When she preordered her Model 3, she realized that she could probably do something similar with the keycard. She didn\u2019t have any luck transferring the software to her existing chip, so she decided to extract the card\u2019s chip and implant that into her arm.\n\nTo do that, she dissolved the card using acetone, and had it encased in a biopolymer. From there, she went to a body-modification studio to have the chip (about the size of a Lego mini-figure) implanted into her forearm. In another video (warning, there\u2019s some blood), she shows off the implantation. She also documented her process on Hackaday.\n\nWhile she doesn\u2019t show off the chip in action on the video (she noted on Twitter that her arm was swollen right after she had the chip implanted), she told The Verge via DM that the chip does work, although the range from her arm to the console \u201cisn\u2019t the greatest,\u201d \u2014 about an inch (25 mm) \u2014 and she says that she hopes that\u2019ll improve as the swelling goes down. At the very least, she\u2019ll never accidentally lock herself out of her car.", "description": "Tesla\u2019s Model 3 doesn\u2019t come with a physical key: you can unlock and start your car with your phone, a car-shaped key fob, or a keycard.
