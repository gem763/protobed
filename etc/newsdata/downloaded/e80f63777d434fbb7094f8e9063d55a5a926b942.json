The doctor waved off the fight at the end of the fourth, and Ortega suffered his first loss as a pro.\n\nThat prompted \u201cT-City\u201d to make some changes, and after taking some time off to heal from nose and hand surgery, Ortega wants to pick up right where he left off, when he was taking everyone out.\n\n\u201cI feel like coming out here and really putting on a show and demonstrating who I am and what I\u2019m made out of,\u201d Ortega said at the UFC Busan pre-fight press conference. \u201cThat I can really go back and to climb the ladder again. I\u2019ve only had one defeat in my career, and that was to the champ, and that night, I was not myself so I want to get back in there and let the world know who I really am when I step in there. The same guy that finished everyone in the UFC, and I just want to keep that streak going.\u201d\n\nAnd he believes the \u201cKorean Zombie\u201d is the perfect dance partner, who will bring the best out of him. Stylistically, both guys have shown that they are unafraid to exchange in a firefight, and Ortega says the South Korean fans are in for a treat on Dec. 21.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at who is out there, that is going to bring a fight to you, it\u2019s going to be him,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the guy who likes to go in there and likes to fight. There\u2019s very few fighters now at the top who are willing to stand in the pocket and really pretty much trade punches for punches and see who is the toughest man in this sport and those are the type of fights that I love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love when I go in there, I love it when we both go in there with heart, strength, honor and put it all on the line, and I love that type of style. I\u2019ve seen his fights, he loves that type of style, and the fans love it so it\u2019s going to be a beautiful show.\u201d", "description": "Brian Ortega excited for the style matchup vs. Chan Sung Jung, and wants to prove that he's still a top contender.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/brian-ortega-ufc-231.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
