He could go on too long. But he seemed to see the value of each person he met, irrespective of their status,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn a new interview, Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer asked Power whether she\u2019s supporting Biden\u2019s presidential bid. Widely considered the front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden had the highest favorability rating among Democrats, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\n\u201cI'm not in the endorsement business. But I have great affection for Vice President Biden,\u201d said Power, who\u2019s currently a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nThen-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden talks with then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power before a summit during the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations headquarters in New York September 26, 2014.

Biden faced tragedy early in life. In 1972, shortly after he was elected to the U.S. Senate, his wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident. Biden was just 30 years old at the time. In 2016, one of the sons who survived that car accident, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer at 46.\n\n\u201cWhen he meets somebody who has suffered a loss of a loved one, and you know, he does his Biden thing, tactile, and warm, and deeply empathetic ... He, more often than not, will give the person his cell phone number,\u201d Power said. \u201cAnd he'll say, \u2018Look, I've been there. If you have no place else to turn, here's my number. You can call me.\u2019\u201d\n\nSamantha Power speaks to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer. More\n\nPower, who grew up in Dublin, added, \u201cHe's a big-hearted Irishman and I have nothing but respect for him.\u201d\n\nThe former ambassador made the comments on Tuesday during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nForeign policy expert\n\nWhen asked to comment on tax-the-rich proposals put forth by Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Power said she\u2019d prefer to discuss her main area of expertise \u2014 foreign policy.\n\nPower\u2019s experience in foreign policy began at the age of 22, when she worked as a freelance war correspondent in Yugoslavia. She entered Harvard Law School in 1995 to, in her words, \u201clearn the law and pursue the arrest of Balkan war criminals as a prosecutor at The Hague.\u201d She later won the Pulitzer Prize for her book on genocide in the 20th Century, \u201cA Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide.\u201d\n\nPower worked as an adviser on the Obama presidential campaign years later but resigned in March 2008 after calling Hillary Clinton \u201ca monster.\u201d She still went on to work for the Obama administration, including as a special assistant to the president, before becoming the second-youngest U.S. ambassador to the UN.", "description": "In a new interview, former ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power says that Joe Biden gave his phone number out to people he encountered who had suffered a loss.", "authors": ["Erin Fuchs", "Deputy Managing Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pIuw76g8.Rc9iAVpsFnKlQ--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/cb7731c0-d668-11e9-bcd7-c7e27ccf48d3", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
