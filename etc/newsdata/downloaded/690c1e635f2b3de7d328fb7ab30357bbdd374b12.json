to pursue an impeachment inquiry that could consume the country\u2019s attention for months, they say.\n\nMs Pelosi has indicated she aims to move the process along with haste, in part to avoid an election-year conflagration, but the exact course of the inquiry is impossible to foresee.\n\nAll 19 Democratic presidential candidates now support the impeachment inquiry, and many party members are optimistic that voters will as well, because Mr Trump is so unpopular and the allegations against him are grave and easily grasped.\n\nFor now, Republicans are the party on the defensive, flummoxed by the cascading disclosures about Mr Trump that have threatened to upend his re-election campaign.\n\nBut there is also a general recognition, at every level of the Democratic Party, that impeachment could complicate their candidates\u2019 efforts to explain their policy ideas to the country and persuade voters they have a vision beyond ousting Mr Trump.\n\nThe party has been disappointed too many times, its leaders say, by betting that the president\u2019s violations of political and cultural norms would bring about his downfall.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox
