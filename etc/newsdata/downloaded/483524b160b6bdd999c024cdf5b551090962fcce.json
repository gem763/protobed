In a conference call with D.C. reporters, the 49ers coach noted this won\u2019t be his first time back as a visitor and that he has \u201cmoved on\u201d with his life.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Shanahan from taking a few shots against his former employer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to not make it personal,\u201d said Shanahan, the Redskins\u2018 former offensive coordinator. \u201cI mean, the guys it would be personal with don\u2019t play in the game.\u201d\n\nShanahan, of course, spent four seasons with Washington from 2010 to 2013 when his father, Mike, was at the helm. By the end, Shanahan\u2019s tenure in the District got contentious \u2014 with the coaching staff not seeing eye-to-eye with quarterback Robert Griffin, the front office and owner Dan Snyder. Kyle and Mike Shanahan were fired after the 2013 season in which Washington went 3-13.\n\nSince then, Shanahan has gone on to have better success. He served as the offensive coordinator in Cleveland (2014) and Atlanta (2015 to 2016) before San Francisco hired him as head coach in 2016.\n\nShanahan, though, is seeking his first win against the Redskins as a head coach. The two teams met in 2017 and Washington prevailed 26-24.\n\nThis season, the 49ers are off to their best start under Shanahan at 5-0. The 39-year-old is regarded as one of the league\u2019s top offensive minds and San Francisco ranks 12th in offensive efficiency.\n\n\u201cKyle knows the running game,\u201d Redskins interim Bill Callahan said. \u201cHe\u2019s well-respected around the league for what he\u2019s accomplished here, in Cleveland, in Atlanta and obviously in San Francisco. He\u2019s really worked hard to establish their identity. \u2026 You don\u2019t see a lot of teams have that much diversity in their attack and in their scheme, but they gameplan really well.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Shanahan was asked the best part of being with Washington \u2014 to which he answered being able to coach with his dad.\n\nAnd the worst?\n\n\u201cEverything else,\u201d Shanahan said with a smile.\n\nOn the conference call, Shanahan also took a jab when asked about the team\u2019s homecoming weekend and whether that gives him any additional motivation. Each year, the Redskins host an event \u2014 formally called the \u201cRedskins Alumni Homecoming Weekend\u201d \u2014to honor the team\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know NFL teams had homecoming games,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI thought that was a high school thing. Are you serious?\u201d\n\nIndeed.\n\nShanahan did say that he had good memories with the Redskins, loving the opportunity to be close to his parents for the first time since high school. He also cited his relationship with the coaches and the players, the latter of which could also be seen as a dig.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s not many left over still now, except for probably Trent\u2013 but there were a lot of relationships I had there and a lot of people that meant a lot to me,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nThe \u201cTrent\u201d in this case is Trent Williams, who notably is in the midst of a holdout.\n\nNear the end of the call, Shanahan was asked what advice he would give an up-and-coming coach who was considering joining the Redskins.\n\nAt the start, Shanahan tried to be diplomatic.\n\n\u201cJust look into it, see what the situation is and who you want to work for,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI mean, anytime you get opportunities you\u2019ve got to look into it, but I\u2019m not there and I don\u2019t know how it is right now. That would be up to that person.\u201d\n\nBut before he finished his answer, Shanahan threw more shade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably not the person they want to call on that advice,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
