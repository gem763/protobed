Big Consequences! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\n\"He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s Republican aides have sought to turn the tables on Democrats pushing for his impeachment, insisting that the president was the true \"whistleblower\" as he had asked Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son for corruption.\n\n\"This individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government,\" Trump advisor Stephen Miller insisted on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\"Getting to the bottom of a corruption scandal in Ukraine is in the American national interest.\"\n\nMr Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2013 who has emerged as his point man in the Ukraine scandal \u2013 led the charge along with Mr Miller in combative Sunday talk show appearances.\n\nBrandishing what he said were affidavits incriminating Mr Biden\u2019s son Hunter over his work at a Ukrainian company, Mr Giuliani said Mr Trump was duty bound to raise the issue with Kiev.\n\n\"If he hadn\u2019t asked them to investigate Biden, he would have violated the constitution,\" Mr Giuliani told ABC\u2019s \"This Week,\" charging that \"Donald Trump was framed by the Democrats.\"\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives launched an official impeachment inquiry last week accusing Mr Trump of a \"mafia-like shakedown\" of Mr Zelensky aimed at damaging Mr Biden.\n\nMr Trump and his allies claim Mr Biden, as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, pressured Kiev to fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor to protect his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a gas company, Burisma Holdings, accused of corrupt practices.\n\nThose allegations have largely been debunked and there has been no evidence of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in Ukraine by the Bidens.\n\nBut a transcript of the July call shows Mr Trump pushing for Kiev to revisit the matter, saying both Mr Giuliani and US Attorney General Bill Barr would be in touch.\n\nFor Democrats, that amounted to a smoking gun, leading Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finally approve an impeachment process she opposed as a risky distraction from the 2020 battle.\n\nMs Pelosi on Sunday called for Mr Trump to \"speak the truth. Honour your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t make this any worse than it already is,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats have charged aggressively into the inquiry, ordering Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to turn over Ukraine-related documents and scheduling witness testimony.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" Mr Schiff said he expected the whistleblower to testify \"very soon\" \u2013 with all precautions taken to protect their identity.\n\nCBS News released a letter from the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers to the acting director of national intelligence expressing concern that their \"client will be put in harm\u2019s way.\"\n\n\"We expect this situation to worsen and become even more dangerous,\" the letter said, calling for \"appropriate resources to ensure their safety.\"", "description": "Donald Trump said on Sunday he wants and deserves to meet the anonymous whistleblower at the centre of the fast-moving scandal that has triggered an impeachment probe against him.
