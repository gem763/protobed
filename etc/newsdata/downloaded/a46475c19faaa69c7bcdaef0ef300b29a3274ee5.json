REUTERS/Mick Tsikas\n\nBrent crude oil futures LCOc1 were 3 cents lower, or 0.1%, to $57.66 a barrel by 0657 GMT, after tumbling 2% in the previous session.\n\nMeanwhile U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc futures were up 9 cents, or 0.2%, to $52.73 a barrel, after sinking by 1.8% on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s impossible to ignore is the economic realities being signalled in the latest run of doom and gloom financial market data which offers few if any reason for oil investors to be optimistic over the outlook for global demand,\u201d said Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nWorld equity benchmarks hit their lowest levels in a month on Wednesday as signs of a slowdown in U.S. economic growth and weak earnings in Europe fanned fears the global economy could slip into recession.\n\n\u201cWhile the near-term triggers may continue to relate to oil demand, next week U.S.-China trade talks remain the unknown variable which could lend a modicum of support,\u201d said Innes.\n\nIn a note, ANZ bank said the market was \u201cclearly fixated\u201d on the potential impact of weak economic growth on oil demand, with supply-side issues taking a back seat for the moment.\n\nAlso hurting sentiment in the previous session was U.S. crude inventories rising 3.1 million barrels last week, according to the country\u2019s Energy Information Administration, far exceeding analyst expectations for an increase of 1.6 million barrels.\n\nBrent futures are now well below levels seen before the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities that briefly halved more than half the kingdom\u2019s output.\n\n\u201cBut with the unrest in Middle East I am keeping a cautious eye on not being too bearish,\u201d said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney.", "description": "Oil futures were largely flat on Thursday, reversing gains made earlier in the day, as fears over the worsening global economic outlook that hit prices hard in the previous session offset modest hopes for progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["Roslan Khasawneh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436472495&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9201F"}
