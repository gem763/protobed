Where are the trees being planted & what kind of trees?\u2019\n\nThe YouTuber responded: \u2018The trees are being planted on every continent except Antarctica and the kind of trees planted depends where they are planted.\n\nSounds cool. Where are the trees being planted & what kind of trees? \u2014 Treelon (@elonmusk) October 28, 2019\n\nHe told Musk that species which are \u2018native to their surroundings\u2019 would be put in the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees,\u2019 Musk replied before changing his username to Treelon.\n\nSaplings will be seeded across the world over the next two years. A donation of \u00a31 will fund one tree.\n\n\u2018It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally,\u2019 the campaign wrote in a statement.\n\n\u2018We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions.\n\n\u2018Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation\u2019s area of expertise and something they\u2019ve been doing for nearly five decades.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration.\u2019\n\nElon Musk is the top donor on the #TeamTrees leaderboard, with Twitter boss Jack Dorsey in second place after pledging to fund 150,000 trees.", "description": "The billionaire pledges some of his fortune to a campaign working to make the planet green again.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PRC_81646580_1572430358.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
