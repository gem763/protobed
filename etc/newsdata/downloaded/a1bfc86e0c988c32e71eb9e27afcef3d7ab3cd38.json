I was so crestfallen that I didn\u2019t pursue it.\u201d Claiming the script was \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d, he said he abandoned the idea after seeing an advert for the George Clooney film The Monuments Men. \u201cI thought, \u2018Damn, that\u2019s probably my idea.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe existence of the script was revealed a week ago by Standard columnist and Vogue deputy editor Emily Sheffield, who appears to have been passed a treatment rather than the full script. Describing the pitch as \u201chilariously awful\u201d and \u201cwritten in classic Boris prose\u201d, Sheffield quotes sections of Johnson\u2019s work. Writing \u201cI cannot abide the apathy of the west\u201d, Johnson adds that he was inspired by the destruction of large portions of the Middle East\u2019s archeological heritage after the Iraq war to create \u201ca glorious wish-fulfilment dream movie, a mixture of Golan-Globus and Raiders of the Lost Ark\u201d.\n\nSheffield also quotes in full Johnson\u2019s description of Mission to Assyria\u2019s opening scenes: \u201cWe begin with a sickening montage of atrocities: beheadings of innocent people in orange jumpsuits, torchings of Shias, rapes of Yazidi women, and footage of the smashing and the demolition of the Assyrian cities \u2026 These bestial crimes are orchestrated by a horrible cologne-drenched jihadi with an air of mincing menace.\u201d\n\nLed by an archeologist called Marmaduke Montmorency Burton (\u201can old Clooney/Connery/Eastwood type geezer in his fifties\u201d), a seven-strong team of explorers aims to save \u201cShargar, the long-lost city of Tiglath-Pileser III in Syria, from the advancing evil of Islamic State\u201d. Johnson suggests Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johansson for the female lead, and describes enemy jihadis as being \u201cspifflicated\u201d with shovels.\n\nReleased in 2014, The Monuments Men stars Clooney as the leader of a team of academics who recover art works looted by the Nazis during the second world war.", "description": "Prime minister reveals he pitched Mission to Assyria \u2013 a Raiders of the Lost Ark-style adventure \u2013 to \u2018a very distinguished director\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aadc7934129d7c007e65851ad495f61a4e53db9f/2641_139_1225_735/master/1225.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1cf403ef8c42a2810c86135ede5f338b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
