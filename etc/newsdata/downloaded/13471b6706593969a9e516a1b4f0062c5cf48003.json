General Assembly.\n\nHe said socialism has \u201cdestroyed\u201d Venezuela and led to widespread suffering.\n\n\u201cToday Venezuelans are starving, and they\u2019re dying from lack of medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. is doing everything it can to isolate Mr. Maduro and his \u201ccronies,\u201d after a U.S.-backed push to replace the strongman with opposition leader Juan Guaido failed earlier this year.\n\nMr. Trump said he hasn\u2019t given up on the mission, and Venezuela will be rebuilt once \u201ca peaceful transition occurs.\u201d\n\nMr. Maduro, whose government in recent days has stepped up efforts to divide the opposition, was in Moscow Wednesday as Mr. Trump spoke, making a surprise visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussia has provided critical military and economic support to Caracas, and criticized the U.S.-led campaign to oust the socialist president.\n\n\u201cRussia has been an unwavering supporter of all legitimate authorities in Venezuela including the president,\u201d Mr. Putin said.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that neither leader spoke about future aid, though Mr. Putin said that Russia intends to maintain its cooperation with Venezuela in energy, health care and food supplies.\n\nLast spring, the U.S. and dozens of western countries hoped that economic and diplomatic pressure would force Mr. Maduro\u2019s inner circle to turn on him and topple the regime, though it didn\u2019t work as planned.\n\nThe false start caused friction between Mr. Trump and his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, who was pushed out of the White House earlier this month.\n\nThe administration continues to tighten sanctions on Mr. Maduro, even moving to establish a full economic embargo on Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe will stand with the Venezuelan people every single day,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey will be free.\u201d\n\nThe president took one question on the controversy over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said the release of the transcript revealed he placed \u201cno pressure whatsoever\u201d on the European leader and slammed the \u201ccorrupt\u201d media for building up the episode, even as some in Washington said the details put Mr. Trump in deeper trouble.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
