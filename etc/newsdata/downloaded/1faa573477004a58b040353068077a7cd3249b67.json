REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will adopt a policy of maximum crude production if the United States lifts sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMaximum production would be the Iranian Ministry of Petroleum\u2019s policy in case (U.S.) sanctions are eased on Iran\u2019s oil industry,\u201d the ministry\u2019s official news website SHANA quoted Zanganeh as saying.\n\nSince exiting from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers last year, U.S. President Donald Trump has reimposed sanctions on Iran. He has also introduced other limitations, including threats of sanctions against any country importing oil from Iran, causing a more than 80% drop in the OPEC member\u2019s oil exports.\n\n\u201cOur oil industry is alive, it is active. The U.S. sanctions cannot stop Iran\u2019s oil exports,\u201d Zanganeh said.\n\nTrump has pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran to try to force it into broader talks to restrict its ballistic missile program and end its support for proxy forces around the Middle East.\n\nBut Iran has ruled out talks until all sanctions imposed on it are lifted. European parties to the deal have struggled to calm the deepening confrontation between Iran and the United States.", "description": "Iran will adopt a policy of maximum crude production if the United States lifts sanctions on the country's oil industry, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429844300&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0M3", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
