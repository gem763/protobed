It may be you are never released. You will be in prison until there is any hope of you not being a danger to young girls.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLady Stacey added: \u201cYou are guilty of a horrible catalogue of offences. What you did was betray the trust of a family and what you did harmed these children.\n\n\u201cYou present a risk to the public and are likely to continue to do so even after work is done with you.\"\n\nAs Rigby was led away to the cells, a relative of one of his young victims shouted \u201ddie\u201d at him.\n\nThe court heard earlier that the sobbing young girl who was raped told her mother what had happened when she returned home around midnight.\n\nWhen the mother confronted Rigby, he claimed that the child had misunderstood what had taken place.\n\nHe left the house after stating to the woman: \u201cI am sorry if she misunderstood what happened.\u201d\n\nRigby, however, was later held by police. His mobile phone was seized and a series of sick video clips of him with the girl were found.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nProsecutor Margaret Barron told the court this included him raping the child, who was in her pyjamas at the time.\n\nAt one point, Rigby, also of Helensburgh, asked the girl to say \u201chello\u201d to the camera.\n\nA further 34 indecent images of children were also discovered.\n\nRigby later told police that he should be \u201cpunished\u201d for what happened.\n\nA probe revealed he had preyed on two others girls between 2006 and 2018.\n\nOne was aged four when it began, the other was six.\n\nRigby insisted with one of the victims he had acted on \u201cimpulse\u201d.\n\nHe admitted to charges of indecent and sexual assault in connection with these girls.\n\nSolicitor advocate Douglas Thomson, defending, said: \u201cHe now recognises there was manipulation of the children and his actions will have consequences for them for many years to come.\n\n\u201cWhen he is released into the community, if ever, he will be monitored and subject to the most stringent conditions.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, Detective Inspector Steve Martin, of Police Scotland, said: \"The abuse displayed by Rigby towards his victims was horrific and some of the worst my officers have seen.\n\n\"I want to praise the courage and strength shown by all of the victims. The account of the youngest victim led us to two other victims and the arrest of William Rigby.\"", "description": "William Rigby, 53, preyed on the girl while he was babysitting her in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, and had earlier abused two other girls aged four and six", "authors": ["Wilma Riley", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Police Scotland", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20595566.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_William-Rigby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
