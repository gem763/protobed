So, he\u2019s either lying or delusional, or both.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton was reacting to a tweet Tuesday morning by Mr. Trump who suggested she should run against 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cOnly one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton fired back in a headline-making tweet, writing, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nIn her interview Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know, just, seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote to President Trump in 2016. She is currently promoting her book with daughter Chelsea, titled, \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience,\u201d which released last week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
