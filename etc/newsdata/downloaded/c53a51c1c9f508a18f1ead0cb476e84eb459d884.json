You might wonder why that would be at this time so late into the cycle. This is the longest expansion ever. Now, you can say the expansion was partly Obama,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cBut lingering on this long needs an explanation.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the explanation? President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think that [strong spending] has to do with the inspiration for many people provided by our motivational speaker president who models luxurious living,\u201d said Shiller.\n\nShiller said that a recession is likely years away thanks to the confidence and optimism Trump inspires.\n\nThe biggest risk: the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf he survives that, he might contribute for some time in boosting the market,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cWe\u2019re maybe in the Trump era, and I think that Donald Trump by inspiration had an effect on the market \u2014 not just tax cutting.\u201d\n\nCNBC star reporter Stephanie Landsman pointed out that Shiller \u201ccontends the next recession may not hit for another three years, and it could be mild.\u201d", "description": "The ongoing strength of the American consumer is due to the fact that we have Donald Trump as an inspirational speaker, Shiller said. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Trump-Faith-Freedom-Coalition-2019-thumbs-up-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
