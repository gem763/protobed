But he says he found that sanctions on Russian are actually detrimental to US policies.\n\nIn recent years, Washington has piled sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and companies with the claimed goal of changing Moscow\u2019s behavior, even though the Russian government has repeatedly said that sanctions will not change its policies. It appears that Jon Huntsman, who recently resigned as US ambassador to Moscow, believes US politicians should start believing what the Russians say.\n\n\u201cRussians have accepted that US sanctions will probably remain in place for the long term, inevitably distorting the market as Russians create alternative supply chains that aren\u2019t always conducive to American interests,\u201d Huntsman wrote in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlso on rt.com US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman submits resignation\n\nThe US, of course, is far less interconnected economically with Russia than European nations, which toed the line in applying the sanctions and were hit by Moscow in return. Even so, US sanctions should do \u201cmore than to see some Russian officials squirm,\u201d but Washington doesn\u2019t really analyze what its sanctions do for its interests in the long run.\n\nThe core of the problem, Huntsman says, is that in the US there is \u201ca reflexive fear of being seen as Putin apologist\u201d for speaking out against the current situation, and that fear \u201chas calcified our ability to think creatively about our relations with Russia.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia\u2019s largest oil company ditches dollar in new oil deals\n\nPeople in Washington should \u201cdispel any lingering illusions\u201d that the sanctions could somehow subjugate Vladimir Putin and his government to the US\u2019 demands, and stop being obsessed with the Russian president.\n\n\u201cRather than cutting ourselves off from Russia, which is the inescapable effect of all these sanctions, we need to cultivate constructive relationships with those who will shape Russia\u2019s post-Putin period,\u201d he said.\n\nWe need more, not less, dialogue with Russia.\n\nThis lesson in realpolitik may be too hard to swallow for the throngs of American pundits and hacks still on the hunt for \u2018evidence\u2019 of how the Kremlin is secretly behind every bad thing happening in the US. Huntsman will probably just be ignored or labeled a Putin apologist.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
