Caffeine allows me to be myself so I\u2019m trying to reach these kids to show them that everybody is a part of a team and we\u2019re all one.\u201d\n\nOther Caffeine streamers include basketball player LaMelo Ball, rapper The Game and rapper Lil Xan, as well as game streamers Cartoonz, Ohmwrecker and Cranier. The streams are then monetized by allowing fans to purchase and send virtual gifts.\n\nKeighran said that game streaming will be a key part of Caffeine\u2019s appeal, but he suggested that compared to the currently dominant Twitch (owned by Amazon), Caffeine will have an easier time expanding beyond gaming.\n\nHe added that not only is Caffeine designed for a wide range of live-streaming content, but it also has the advantage of backing from 21st Century Fox and its new owner Disney, which was presumably a big part of how it acquired the streaming rights to sports content from Fox Sports and Disney-owned ESPN.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting content rights from Fox and Disney that Google and Amazon would love to have,\u201d Keighran said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the secret sauce that attracts athletes and hip hop artists \u2014 they can stream sports content and video games with a better community filter, chat, new monetization with no ads. I think Offset is the perfect example.\u201d", "description": "Caffeine, the live streaming service founded by former Apple designers Ben Keighran and Sam Roberts, has signed an exclusive streaming deal with Offset.
