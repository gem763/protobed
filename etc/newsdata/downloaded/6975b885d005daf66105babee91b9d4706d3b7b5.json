Both outlets come under regular criticism for their leftward tilt, despite being funded by taxpayers across the political spectrum, but Zuckerberg says that only outlets that operate as \u201can organ of the government\u201d will be labeled.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that people can see for themselves when media is actually operating as an organ of the government and is being editorially controlled there,\u201d said the Facebook CEO.\n\nIn the interview, Zuckerberg also reiterated his opposition to censoring politicians (although at least two politicians, the UK\u2019s Tommy Robinson and Republican congressional candidate Laura Loomer, are still banned on the platform).\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019re giving a green light to politicians, to lie, lie, lie?\u201d asked NBC\u2019s Holt, echoing criticisms made by Democrats, who want Facebook to censor or at least fact-check ads from the Trump campaign.\n\nZuckerberg countered that it was the role of journalists and citizens to hold politicians to account, not private companies.\n\n\u201cNo, look\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cI believe for people to be able to hear and say what politicians are saying. I think that when they do that, that speech will be heavily scrutinized by other journalists, by other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get that a lot of people are angry at us [but] part of growing up for me has just been realizing that it is more important to be understood than it is to be liked, and I believe it very strongly,\u201d the Facebook CEO said later in the interview.\n\n\u201cPeople can make up their own minds about me and the work that we\u2019re doing, but this is who I am.\u201d\n\nThe full interview with Zuckerberg will air on NBC nightly news at 6:30 p.m.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
