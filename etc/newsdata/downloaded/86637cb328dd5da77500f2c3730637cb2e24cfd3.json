But whether Schwab\u2019s brokerage is actually free for its customers is less straight forward than it sounds.\n\nThe San Francisco-based brokerage will stop charging online commissions for equities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and options listed on US and Canada exchanges as of Oct. 7, according to a statement today. (The charge for US stocks is currently $4.95.) The 48-year-old brokerage will still levy a commission for things like trading foreign stocks, large blocks that need more service, and fixed-income assets, as well as a 65-cent charge per options contract.\n\nStock prices for other stock brokerages plunged after the announcement, signaling investors think brokers will be forced to match Schwab and will have a harder time making money. TD Ameritrade fell more than 20%, while E-Trade and Interactive Brokers also declined. Schwab CFO Peter Crawford said in a separate statement that the commissions cut will cost the company as much as $100 million in quarterly revenue, which is the equivalent to about 4% of total net revenue.\n\nOnline stock trading has become much more competitive since digital startups like Robinhood began offering cut-rate brokerage for customers. Instead of commissions, Robinhood makes money from things like interest on customer deposits, charging traders who buy stocks with borrowed money (margin trading), and selling clients\u2019 stock orders to the market makers who handle the trades (payment for order flow).\n\nBrokers like Schwab and other companies also make money from payment for order flow. The way it works is that professional trading firms buy the retail-investor orders from the broker and execute the trades for them. These trading outfits typically make money from the gap between the bid and the offer. When the trading company buys order flow, they give some of that money (the rebate) to the brokerage that provided the orders.\n\nAs Justin Schack, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, told Quartz in March, brokers have the choice to keep that money or offer better asset prices for their clients. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious what\u2019s in the customer\u2019s best interest,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the case of Schwab, the brokerage reported $139 million in order-flow revenue in 2018, and $114 million the year before.\n\nSchwab isn\u2019t changing the way it makes money from selling order flow, even though it\u2019s getting rid of some commissions. \u201cWe are committed to providing clients with high-quality trade executions, and have a strong track record of meeting that goal,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email. \u201cExecution quality always takes priority when determining where we route customer orders.\u201d\n\nPayment for order flow certainly doesn\u2019t mean retail traders are getting a bad deal. Market makers, sometimes called high-frequency traders, can potentially save money for everyone by executing orders \u201coff-exchange.\u201d This allows them to avoid the fees that come with trading on New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq by, for example, filling a retail stock order directly with their own money. In the US, market makers are required to provide the best bid or offer that\u2019s publicly available, regardless of how a trade is filled.\n\nStory continues", "description": "What Schwab's brokerage service actually costs customers is less straight forward than it sounds.", "authors": ["John Detrixhe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HDa80ADMF74GbEI9rB_yQg--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/85c6faf7b8843e16320b14a9bed8c4c0", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
