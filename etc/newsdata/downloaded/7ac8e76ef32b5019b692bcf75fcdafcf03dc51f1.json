European rates are low because Europe is in trouble,\u201d said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics.\n\nCarl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, noted that when a 10-year government note has negative interest rates, it is worth less than \u201ca bag of dirt stored in your basement.\u201d\n\nNegative bond yields is a \u201cred flag\u201d that money has lost its value, he said. The risk is it may trigger \u201cfeckless spending\u201d\n\nTrump is the first U.S. president to say that he would want interest rates below zero.\n\nThe Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nJeremy Siegel, finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said he thinks the Fed\u2019s benchmark federal funds rate should be lowered, but not to zero or even negative.\n\nAt the moment, the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is in a range between 2%-2.25%. Siegel said he\u2019d like to see the fed funds rate down between 1%-1.5%.\n\nThat would put rates below the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.09% .\n\nFed watchers expect the U.S. central bank to be much more cautious and trim its policy rate by a quarter point to 1.75%-2% at its policy meeting next week. There is a lively debate among analysts about how low rates will ultimately go. Fed officials have stressed they are not anticipating a major easing.\n\nYields on U.S. 10-year notes have fallen from 3.45% last November to as low as 1.46% in late August.\n\nNegative rates would mean that a recession was inevitable, Siegel said.\n\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, agreed, saying on Twitter that a steep drop in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate would be a signal to the market that the economy was much weaker than it appears.\n\nSome thoughts of the Fed dropping rates to zero or less:\n\n\n\nMarket participants would likely view such a drop in rates as a signal that the economy is much weaker than it appears, which runs the risk of triggering a panic and self-fulfilling recession. \u2014 Diane Swonk (@DianeSwonk) September 11, 2019\n\nInterest rates are at zero on government debt in Japan and Europe because those regions are barely growing economically. In contrast, the U.S. has had economic growth above 2% this year, she said.\n\nTrump also tweeted that the U.S. should \u201crefinance\u201d its nearly $17 trillion outstanding debt.\n\nThis is also a puzzle to economists because the U.S. Treasury debt is not callable, like a mortgage, that can be paid off early. The Treasury debt that pays a high interest rate has to run off in order to be refinanced at lower yields.\n\nBut it makes a lot of sense for the government to issue new long-term debt with interest rates so low, Siegel said.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the Fed to push its benchmark interest rates into negative territory shows he doesn\u2019t understand that ultra-low rates are a...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP856_powell_ZG_20190821101018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
