Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who sits on the House Judiciary, argued that he deserves to be allowed in to those meetings because it was his committee who launched the impeachment inquiry in the first place. He insisted that Trump should be afforded the same due process as former Presidents Clinton and Nixon.\n\nTrump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry because Democrats had yet to take a real vote on it. This week they'll go on record for the first time. Pelosi, meanwhile, suggested that this week's votes are necessary to secure the Trump administration's cooperation.\n\n\"We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\"\n\nThe resolution will be introduced by Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-MA) on Tuesday, and voted upon on Thursday.\n\nHappy Halloween.", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:18:02PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/ffb018ef-76b9-4f2c-b325-04ac8852976d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
