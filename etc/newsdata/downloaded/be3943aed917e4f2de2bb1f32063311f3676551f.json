For Cody and Fox, it felt like the film was savaged by people who had a preconceived idea based on marketing that targeted young men and played up the film's supposed sexuality.\n\n\"There was so much going on with me at that time, that movie being picked apart was not at the top of [my list of concerns],\" Fox shared. \"Because I had such a fraught relationship with the public, and the media, and journalists, and I was struggling so much at that time in general, this didn't stand out as a particularly painful moment, it was just part of the mix.\"\n\nFor Fox, being sexualized and objectified was becoming a recurring theme when it came to her career, and the marketing plan for Jennifer's Body was just another instance of the problem.\n\n\"It wasn't just that movie, it was everyday of my life, all the time, with every project I worked on and every producer I worked with,\" she recalled. \"It preceded a breaking point for me.\"\n\n\"I think I had a genuine psychological breakdown where I wanted just nothing to do,\" she continued. \"I didn't want to be seen, I didn't want to have to take a photo, do a magazine, walk a carpet, I didn't want to be seen in public at all because the fear, and the belief, and the absolute certainty that I was going to be mocked, or spat at, or someone was going to yell at me, or people would stone me or savage me for just being out\u2026 so I went through a very dark moment after that.\"\n\nAccording to the actress, her experience speaking out against being sexualized by the industry was met with a significantly different reaction than that received by actresses sharing similar stories today.\n\n\"I feel like I was sort of out and in front of the #MeToo movement before the #MeToo movement happened, I was speaking out and saying, 'Hey, these things are happening to me and they're not OK,'\" Fox explained. \"And everyone was like, 'Oh well, f**k you. We don't care, you deserve it.' Because everybody talked about how you looked or how you dressed or the jokes you made.\"\n\nMegan Fox and Diablo Cody reunite for the 10th anniversary of 'Jennifer's Body.' ET / Jesse Goddard More\n\nCody explained that she has a real fear of not being heard or taken seriously, even in the current climate in Hollywood, which is why \"you haven't really heard a lot from me on that subject.\"\n\n\"I have a lot to say, but to be honest, I am still terrified people will say, 'Well she was a stripper, we don't really care. Does she really have a right to talk about being sexually objectified or being put through s**t in Hollywood? Because she made that choice for herself and her story is not valid,'\" Cody explained. \"So, I am scared.\"\n\nFox went on to explain that she doesn't feel like \"there is a space in feminism\" for her, despite her strongly held beliefs in equality and the ethos of feminism.\n\n\"Even though I consider myself a feminist, I feel like feminists don't want me to be a part of their group,\" Fox said. \"What is supporting other females if there is only certain ones of us we support? If I have to be an academic or have to be non-threatening to you in some way? Why can't I be a part of the group as well?\"\n\n\"Considering all of the stuff that has happened since then, and is happening on a regular basis in this country, and with celebs [stories] we have everyday, I never really did anything that crazy,\" she added. \"But I was really dragged through the coals for a lot of it.\"", "description": "The actress reunited with director Diablo Cody for the first time in 10 years to talk about 'Jennifer's Body' and their lives since.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2hNAZzfZoFGv71Kp2DNLA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/c345c777234dabd9b1f092d3bc8e4f92", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
