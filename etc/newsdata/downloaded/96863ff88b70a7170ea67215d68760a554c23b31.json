Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.\n\n\n\nOne such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Tailored Brands, Inc. (NYSE: ) , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in TLRD.\n\n\n\nA key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimates revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.66 a share a months ago to its current level of $1.10.\n\n\n\nAlso, for the current quarter, Tailored Brands has seen two downward estimate revision versus none revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 43 cents a share from 88 cents over the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nThe stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 12.1% in the past month.\n\nTailored Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nSo, it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don\u2019t have a long-time horizon to wait.\n\n\n\nIf you are still interested in the Textile - Apparel industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) . The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and may be a better selection at this time. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\n\n\nLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?\n\n\n\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\n\n\n\nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.
