His since-deleted post included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'\n\nHong Kong has been locked in several months of violent protests following the introduction of an extradition bill that would enable citizens to be forcibly sent to the mainland if accused of a crime.\n\nHis support for the protests in the Chinese-ruled city prompted anger in Beijing and caused outrage among Chinese fans and the team's business partners in the key NBA market.\n\nBogut also took to Twitter and said he was grateful Morey had spared him from being criticised by Chinese sports fans.\n\nAustralian born former NBA player Andrew Bogut has weighed in on the controversy surrounding the league's backlash against comments supporting Hong Kong protesters\n\nGeneral manager of the Houston Rockets Daryl Morey quickly backed down from his tweet that mentioned 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong' however Bogut tweeted his support for the manager's initial statement\n\n'Thanks (Daryl Morey) for taking some of the nmsl's (abuse) I was flooded with.... Enjoy the next few weeks anytime you post anything!' Bogut tweeted.\n\nThe Boomer's player referenced the acronym NMSL which means 'Your Mother Is Dead' in Chinese.\n\nBogut has been openly critical of drug cheat Chinese swimmer Sun Yang, and the 7-foot tall basketball players comments have made him deeply unpopular in the country.\n\nThe former Golden State Warriors player was again critical of the regime with a tweet on Monday following the airing of a controversial South Park episode that criticised the Chinese government.\n\n'Just watched the latest South Park (episode) Seeing today's events, they hit the nail on the head, as usual! Must watch!' he said.\n\nAfter Morey sent out the controversial tweet backlash has been swift, with several sponsors cutting ties with the Rockets specifically while a Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings said it would stop streaming the team's games.\n\nHouston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nHong Kong has been locked in several months of protests following the introduction of an extradition bill that would enable citizens to be forcibly sent to the mainland if accused of a crime\n\nAs a response the NBA released multiple statements, one in Chinese and another in English, commenting on Morey's remarks.\n\nThe English version was apologetic towards Morey's tweet and, unlike the Chinese version, stressed the importance of free speech.\n\nMorey himself tweeted a two-part response expressing his appreciation for the large Chinese fan base of the NBA.\n\n'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,' he said.\n\n'My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA,' he later added.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for Houston and helped build the NBA's following in China.\n\nSome businesses have said they will no longer cooperate with the Rockets and Chinese broadcasters have vowed not to show the team's games.\n\nMorey himself tweeted a two-part response expressing his appreciation for the large Chinese fan base of the NBA\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV's sports channel has said it would suspend any further broadcasts of the Rockets' matches starting from Sunday.\n\nAnd this morning, the network said it would 'immediately suspend' plans to broadcast a pair of NBA pre-season exhibition games being staged in China this week.\n\n'We believe that any comments that challenge national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,' China Central Television (CCTV) said on its social media account.\n\n'To this end, CCTV's Sports Channel has decided to immediately suspend plans to broadcast the NBA preseason (China Games) and will immediately investigate all cooperation and communication involving the NBA.'\n\nTencent Sports, which is the NBA's digital partner in China, also said it would suspend live streaming for future Rockets games. They also said they would not cover or post news about the team.\n\nSponsors have also been pulling the plug in the wake of the drama.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a further statement recognising that his initial remarks 'left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for'.\n\n'Over the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China,' he said.\n\n'At the same time, we recognize that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world.\n\n'But for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business.\n\n'Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA -- and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.'", "description": "Australian basketball star Bogut took to Twitter and said he was grateful Morey had spared him from being criticised by Chinese sports fans.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19435830-0-image-a-28_1570527669596.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
