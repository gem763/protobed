restaurant in Manchester just off Jack Rosenthal Way.\n\nAppropriate, as he was one of Corrie\u2019s first writers in the 1960s and his wife Maureen Lipman is currently in the show.\n\nJulie bounces in, oozing warmth, all smiles and hugs.\n\nHer almost-white blonde spiky hair is set off by a big pair of black-rimmed glasses, and she\u2019s dressed comfortably in a black denim big-buttoned top and trousers.\n\nShe immediately orders a pot of tea and when we mention the pizza looks good she says, \u2018Oh, I was going to have a salad, but stuff it, I\u2019ll have a pizza as well.\u2019\n\nHer accent is pure Lancashire, \u2018I\u2019m Accrington bred through and through,\u2019 she explains.\n\nJulie was famous for 16 years as soap\u2019s first transgender character in Corrie.\n\n(Image: CAMERA PRESS/CAMERA PRESS/Chris Floyd)\n\nHayley was much-loved and people still do a double-take when they see Julie \u2013 even our waiter was a bit giddy.\n\n\u2018I totally get it,\u2019 she says. \u2018There were moments when I was working there that the other actors and I would suddenly go, \u201cOMG, we\u2019re on Coronation Street !\u201d It\u2019s iconic.\u2019\n\nWhen Hayley succumbed to pancreatic cancer in 2014, there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house as her final episode aired.\n\n\u2018I was in bits myself,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018On my last day over 100 cast and crew came round to cheer me off, I was on the floor in a foetal position!\u2019\n\nSince then Julie has starred in hit series like Happy Valley and Broadchurch as well as a host of theatre productions.\n\nHer home life is as down-to-earth as she is \u2013 Julie and hubby, screenwriter Ian Kershaw (who she calls \u2018Kersh\u2019) met on her first week of Corrie.\n\nThey have two teenage daughters, Martha and Lyss, and an 11-year-old rescue dog, a lurcher called Bridie.\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke/EMPICS Entertainment)\n\nThey have lived in the same terraced house just outside Manchester since they got together.\n\n\u2018We want that continuity for the girls, so they\u2019ve always got the same bedroom to come back to,\u2019 she says.\n\nAs we chat and eat and drink more tea, Julie tells us about her life in Corrie, being a mum, romance and her latest role in a brand new play\u2026\n\nHow exactly did you and your husband meet?\n\nIt was on my first week of Corrie, he was an actor then but now is a writer \u2013 in fact, he writes for Corrie.\n\nWe became really good pals, then we went out one night for a mate\u2019s birthday and we had been full-on flirting all night.\n\nAt the end of it I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to marry you.\u2019\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nHe laughed, and we kissed.\n\nHe was going for an audition the next day and I texted him saying,\n\n\u2018I hope you get this job today, because I will expect to be kept in the manner I\u2019ve become accustomed to when we get married and have our two kids.\u2019\n\nHe texted back saying, \u2018What do you want from me!?\u2019\n\nI said, \u2018Not much, just a top wedding and kid by next Christmas!\u2019 He answered saying, \u2018Martha or Arthur?\u2019\n\nOur Martha was born by the next Christmas.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWow, that was quick!\n\nWe went out on the Thursday night, I moved in with him on the following Wednesday and I was pregnant within six weeks.\n\nWe went on a road trip across America and I did a pregnancy test on Santa Barbara pier, and there is a picture of us \u2013 we got a stranger\n\nto take it \u2013 pointing at the test saying, \u2018We\u2019ve just found out about you, Martha or Arthur!\u2019\n\nAnd it was Martha, who\u2019s now 18.\n\nIt\u2019s just been like the greatest thing in my life.\n\nWhat\u2019s been your most romantic moment?\n\nWith Kersh on our first date, we kissed on top of the giant pebble outside Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.\n\nWe go back on the anniversary, but these days I have to get a leg-up.\n\nBecause I got pregnant so quickly, we said we\u2019ve got to carry on courting each other and we have done.\n\nVery early on we got into the habit of really looking after each other and going on dates.\n\nWe\u2019re romantic, we have many romantic moments.\n\nBut what was really romantic was that he wrote a one-woman play for me called The Greatest Play In The World and gave it to me as a Christmas present!\n\nI\u2019ve already done it in Edinburgh and I\u2019m doing it in London in December.\n\nWhat sort of mum are you?\n\nOMG!\n\nMy mum and dad are a hard act to follow, so I\u2019m trying to emulate them.\n\nWe have a great relationship, the four of us.\n\nWe fall out constantly, though.\n\nThere\u2019s always a big old fight going on, with doors slamming and everything.\n\nI\u2019m always embarrassed if there are friends round.\n\nIt\u2019s not the image I want to project.\n\nBut my friends one after another have always said to me, \u2018This house is so\n\nfull of love.\u2019\n\nIt means the world to me, does that.\n\nWe live in a little terraced street, and have more or less kept the same neighbours.\n\nAre the girls going to follow in your footsteps?\n\nMartha showed some interest in drama for a while, and now she\u2019s fallen out of love with it.\n\nShe\u2019s doing her A-levels and applying for uni and wants to do English.\n\nLyss has got the gift of contentment.\n\nWhatever she does she\u2019ll be great.\n\nShe\u2019s a people person, people are fascinated by her.\n\nShe works in a charity shop on Saturday mornings.\n\n(Image: BBC/Red Productions/Ben Blackall)\n\nMost outrageous place you\u2019ve been recognised?\n\nOh, all over the place.\n\nI was once at a funeral and someone asked me for an autograph and I thought that was a bit off.\n\nBut honestly, I really don\u2019t mind people coming up to me.\n\nI soon got used to people pointing at me going, \u2018Coronation Street\u2019.\n\nWith Hayley\u2019s pancreatic cancer storyline, I felt a big responsibility, and of course people are going to want to talk to you about their experience with cancer, and you have to engage with them.\n\nWho were your best pals on the show?\n\nObviously lovely David Neilson who played my Roy, we had a great relationship.\n\nI still see Katherine Kelly (Becky).\n\nI can always rely on Jennie McAlpine (Fiz), Alison King (Carla) and Sally Dynevor (Sally) to lend a hand with any charity project I work on, they\u2019re all great mates.\n\nAnd in the past Suranne Jones \u2013 I loved her, I wept when she left.\n\n(Image: Kudos/Imaginary Friends/Sister Pictures/ITV)\n\nWere you a bit starstruck on the Broadchurch set?\n\nThe first day I was a little bit overwhelmed by it.\n\nWe did a photo shoot and it was like being in Madame Tussauds!\n\nI was like, \u2018What the hell am I doing here?\u2019\n\nAny more starry moments?\n\nI had breakfast with Lenny Henry this morning.\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m living in a parallel universe where my daughter is off to secondary school and I\u2019m FaceTiming her and then I\u2019m like, \u2018So how are things, Lenny?\u2019 It was just kind of weird, but I think that would be weird for anybody.\n\nWhat your worst habit?\n\nI leave a trail of mashed-up tissues wherever I go.\n\nI always have a bit of toilet roll scrunched up my sleeve or in my pocket and it falls out and Kersh hates it.\n\nDo you get stage fright?\n\nI get nervous, that\u2019s fine.\n\nIt is ridiculous, that mad adrenalin rush you get before you go on stage.\n\nYou are only actually supposed to feel like that rarely in your life, like if you are in danger or something.\n\nDoing it every night can\u2019t be good for you!\n\nThough I like a dressing room \u2013 I miss my dressing room at Corrie.\n\nI like my photos of the family around and any stuff that helps me with the part.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHow do you feel about getting older?\n\nI feel really good about it.\n\nI like it all.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve been a very beautiful young woman, ageing is a big thing and hard.\n\nThat moment of becoming invisible to men is really painful, but I\u2019ve always been invisible, I really have, so there\u2019s no loss there!\n\nI\u2019ve never turned heads in my life except as Hayley!\n\nNever in my life has anyone whispered about me and I\u2019ve thought it\u2019s because I\u2019m looking really hot today.\n\nI\u2019m settling into myself.\n\nI\u2019m fitter than I ever was because I walk a lot.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought I\u2019ll make an ace old woman.\n\nMy mum says, \u2018Old age, you can shove it!\u2019\n\nAnd she\u2019s right.\n\nDo you feel any different from when you were 16?\n\nI am the same person now, in essence.\n\nA few more wrinkles and a bigger belly!\n\nJulie's new project....\n\n(Image: Zoe Martin 2018)\n\nJulie stars in the brand new play There Are No Beginnings at the Leeds Playhouse.\n\nSet in 1975, June (Julie) is working to keep girls off the street at a time when the women of Leeds lived in fear of the Yorkshire Ripper and the authorities urged people to stay at home.\n\nThis gave birth to the Reclaim The Night movement and echoes down\n\nthe generations to this day.\n\n\u2018The play specifically and emphatically is not about the Yorkshire Ripper,\u2019 says Julie.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about the women of Leeds \u2013 not the victims and survivors, but the ordinary girls and the effect it had on their lives.\n\nAt one point women were put under curfew and not supposed to go out after a certain time.\n\nI\u2019m at the line-learning stage at the moment and I do that when I take Bridie for a walk.\n\nI\u2019m a familiar sight, the mad woman who walks and talks to herself!\u2019\n\nThere Are No Beginnings opens October 11 at Leeds Playhouse", "description": "Actress Julie
