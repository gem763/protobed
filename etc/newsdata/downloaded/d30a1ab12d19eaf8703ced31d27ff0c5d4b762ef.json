It was Atlanta\u2019s fourth straight victory and eighth in 11 tries over the Nationals.\n\nKeuchel (7-5) allowed six hits and two walks and struck out three to win his fourth straight start. He protected a 2-0 lead in the sixth by striking out slugger Juan Soto with a runner on first, and getting Yan Gomes to ground out with runners on the corners.\n\nNationals starter Patrick Corbin (11-7) walked a season-high six, issuing three consecutive passes before striking out Dansby Swanson, his last batter, to end the fifth. Corbin gave up three hits and two runs - one earned - with nine strikeouts.\n\nWashington, which began the four-game series badly needing to make up ground in the division, has lost four of five for the first time since July 30-Aug. 4.\n\nThe Braves tacked on runs with Albies\u2019 20th homer in the third and Tyler Flowers\u2019 sacrifice fly RBI in the fourth.\n\nDonaldson, the self-proclaimed Bringer of Rain, broke out another umbrella celebration in the dugout after going deep for the 35th time, a two-run shot that made it 4-0 in the seventh.\n\nLuke Jackson allowed Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s fifth homer, a three-run shot that cut the lead to 4-3 in the eighth. Shane Greene earned his first save in three tries with Atlanta and 23rd overall after facing the minimum with two strikeouts in the ninth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: RHP Joe Ross tweaked his forearm during a bullpen session this week and has been scratched from Saturday\u2019s start. \u2026 LHP Roenis El\u00edas still has too much swelling to undergo an MRI on his right hamstring. El\u00edas was injured Thursday. \u2026 INF Adr\u00edan Sanchez has a virus and was sent back to the team hotel to rest.\n\nBraves: RF Austin Riley was recalled from an injury-rehab assignment and went 0 for 3 with a strikeout. He had been sidelined since Aug. 5 with a right knee sprain.\n\nDAZZLING\n\nSwanson backhanded a grounder deep in the hole at short and jumped to throw out Trea Turner on a head-first slide at second and end the third. \u2026 The Nationals were solid in the field in the sixth. CF Michael Taylor threw out Flowers at the plate, and RHP Tanner Rainey picked off pinch-runner Billy Hamilton at second. \u2026 Keuchel is 4-0 with a 0.87 ERA over his last five starts. \u2026 The home winning streak is Atlanta\u2019s best since the 2000 team also won 12 in a row. \u2026 The Braves improved to 40-21 against the NL East.\n\nGOOD AND BAD\n\nRendon\u2019s fielding error in the fourth allowed Adam Duvall to advance to third and later score on Flowers\u2019 fly, but Rendon singled in the eighth to reach safely in his 22nd straight game dating to Aug. 13.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: RHP Austin Voth (1-0, 3.91 ERA) will replace Ross in the rotation and make his fifth start. Voth has pitched seven career innings and has allowed runs against Atlanta.\n\nBraves: RHP Julio Teheran (9-8, 3.38 ERA) will make his 30th start for the seventh straight season and is 1-0 with a 2.19 ERA in two outings against Washington this year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas Keuchel pitched six scoreless innings, Ozzie Albies and Josh Donaldson homered, and the streaking Atlanta Braves picked up another division win over the Washington Nationals with a 4-3 victory on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/nationals_braves_baseball_07738_c0-169-4037-2522_s1770x1032.jpg?49c7b5691acced905890fee7a79ce11ab71d08bf", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
