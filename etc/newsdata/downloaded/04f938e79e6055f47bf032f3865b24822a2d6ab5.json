I don\u2019t give a damn what your people say either. I\u2019m going to put twelve people on a jury who are going to find your goddamn black a** guilty.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s an emotional story (Picture: Warner Bros)\n\nFor the next 15 months he remained on death row awaiting trial, while Judge Robert E Lee Key, Jr relocated the trial from Monroe County, that was 40% black to Baldwin County where 86% of the residents were white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcMillian insisted he was \u2018known\u2019 due to having an affair with a white woman, Karen Kelly, and because one of his sons had married a white woman. Both McMillian and his 1987 attorney \u2018contended that McMillian\u2019s relationships alone had made him a suspect\u2019 in the case.\n\nIn a prison interview in 1993, McMillian said: \u2018The only reason I\u2019m here is because I had been messing around with a white lady and my son married a white lady.\u2019\n\nIn the December, McMillian, along with career criminal Ralph Bernard Myers were jointly indicted for Morrison\u2019s murder. Following the trial, Myers pleaded guilty as a conspirator and received a 30-year prison term.\n\nOn 17 August, 1988, a jury of eleven whites and one African American found McMillian and recommended a life sentence. This was based on the testimony of four informants found by the prosecution with two of the witnesses claiming to have seen McMillian\u2019s \u2018low-rider\u2019 truck outside the dry cleaner\u2019s around the time that the crime allegedly occurred.\n\nMcMillian was exonerated after six years (Picture: Warner Bros)\n\nThis sentence was overridden by the judge, who imposed the death penalty.\n\nIt was said the jury \u2018ignored multiple alibi defence witnesses, who were black, who testified under oath that he was at a fish fry at the time of the crime\u2019. There was no physical evidence implicating McMillian.\n\nIn November 1988 Stevenson, who was the director of the Alabama Capital Representation Resource Centre visited McMillian in prison, who was maintaining his innocence on death row.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding his case, the lawyer visited McMillian\u2019s community and met those who were with this condemned man at the time the crime took place 11 miles away.\n\nBryan, centre, with Just Mercy\u2019s cast (Photo by George Pimentel/WireImage)\n\nMcMillian appealed the case numerous times between 1990 and 1993, with the Alabama Court Of Criminal Appeals turning down four appeals. In 1991 his death sentence was affirmed on appeal.\n\nIt took six years from the original trial for the court to find that the prosecutor, District Attorney Theodore Pearson, and the judge practiced \u2018intentional racial discrimination\u2019 in selecting the predominantly-white jury.\n\nAfter his own sentencing, Myers admitted the testimony he gave against McMillian was \u2018false\u2019, adding that he knew nothing about the crime, that he was not present when the crime was committed, that he had been \u2018told what to say by certain law enforcement officers\u2019, and that he had testified falsely against McMillian \u2018because of pressure from the officers\u2019.\n\nWalter spent six years on death row (Picture: RTE)\n\nFollowing this, McMillian\u2019s attorneys filed a petition for a new trial alleging various constitutional violations, including \u2018that a key state witness had recanted his testimony, that the appellant\u2019s conviction had been obtained by perjured testimony, and that the evidence of perjury was newly discovered\u2019.\n\nThe petition also alleged that the state of Alabama \u2018violated his constitutional rights by withholding exculpatory and impeachment information,\u2019 but yet again, in 1992, the attorney\u2019s claims were denied by the court.\n\nA breakthrough occurred in February 1993 when all judges concurred that the state suppressed evidence that had been requested by the defence and McMillian was denied due process of law. His conviction and death sentence was reversed and he was given a new trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious evidence pertaining to McMillian\u2019s innocence was uncovered, including that McMillian\u2019s truck, supposedly seen by witnesses at the scene of the crime, had not been converted to a \u2018low-rider\u2019 until six months after the crime took place. It also emerged that District Attorney Theodore Pearson \u2018had concealed evidence proving McMillian\u2019s innocence\u2019 after a witness had seen Morrison alive after the time when prosecutors claimed that McMillian had killed her.\n\nThe two witnesses who had testified that they had seen McMillian\u2019s truck retracted their testimony, and admitted that they lied at trial, committing perjury.\n\nIt emerged that Sheriff Tate and investigators had \u2018pressured [Myers] into lying\u2019 about McMillian with his attorneys obtaining the original recording of Myers\u2019 confession, in which he complained that he was being forced to implicate McMillian, whom he did not know, for a crime neither of them committed.\n\nDistrict Attorney Thomas Chapman, who had represented the state in McMillian\u2019s previous appeals, told Stevenson: \u2018I want to do everything I can so that your client will not have to spend a single day more than he already has on death row. I feel sick about the six years that [McMillian] has spent in prison and the part I played in keeping him there.\u2019\n\nOn 2 March 1993 he was finally exonerated following his fifth appeal, in a unanimous vote.\n\nAfter returning to his family and hometown in Monroeville, McMillian filed a civil suit against Tate, Larry Ikner, an investigator with the District Attorney\u2019s office in Monroe County, and Simon Benson, an investigator with the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, for his wrongful conviction.\n\nWhile a county sheriff could not be sued for monetary damages, McMillian settled with other officials for an undisclosed amount and his case served as a catalyst for Alabama\u2019s compensation statute, passed in 2001.\n\nSpeaking about taking on the monumental role of Stephenson, Jordan was embarrassed to admit that he\u2019d never heard of the activist before landing the role, but was determined to play the role after researching his story.\n\n\u2018I felt a sense of responsibility to run toward this story and use my platform to get it out to the masses,\u2019 Michael told Entertainment Weekly, \u2018because I think he\u2019s a real-life superhero.\u2019\n\nJust Mercy is released in UK cinemas 24 January, 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
