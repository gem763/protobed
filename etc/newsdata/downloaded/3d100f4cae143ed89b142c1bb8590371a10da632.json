To say goodbye, say goodbye here \u2013 not inviting me to dinner,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When you receive a text from the player inviting you and the coaching staff for a dinner only two things can happen.\n\n\u2018[It\u2019s] because they want to say goodbye. Or because they feel that they love you and they want to show that they are with you. And I think it\u2019s the second.\u2019\n\nWhen asked which player messaged him, Pochettino responded: \u2018You can guess! Players. All the players, because it\u2019s a WhatsApp group.\u2019\n\nPochettino has admitted more than once this season that squad harmony perhaps isn\u2019t as it should be at Spurs and he hinted that there could be arrivals and departures during the January transfer window following defeat to Colchester United last month.\n\nThe Argentine appeared to backtrack on those previous comments in his press conference ahead of the Watford game, though, by stating that he is happy with his current squad and rejecting the idea that Spurs need to invest.\n\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t believe, really,\u2019 he said when asked whether Spurs would sign anyone in January. \u2018I believe in the players we have. I believe in the players that are in Tottenham today.\n\n\u2018I respect the opinion of people who say we need to change or do something, in or out. But if it is my decision I am going to stick with players because I know they have the quality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s only to unlock some situation that is going on in their minds. We have great quality to achieve the things we are expected to.\u2019", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino has insisted that he retains the support of Tottenham's players after a member of the squad invited him and his assistants out for dinner next week.
