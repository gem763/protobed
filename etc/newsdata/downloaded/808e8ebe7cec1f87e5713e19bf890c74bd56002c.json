The company also halted ticket sales to \"demeaning animal shows and performances\" in 2018.\n\nElaine Thompson/AP, File\n\n\"Our aim is not only to prevent future generations of whales and dolphins from being raised in captivity, but also to encourage the industry to move towards alternative models, like seaside sanctuaries, that will better provide for the needs of the current captive population,\" Halpin said Wednesday. \"Seaside sanctuaries have enormous potential, but they need more backing from the tourism industry. ... We hope our announcement today can help turn the tide.\"\n\nAnimal conservation and protection groups, including World Animal Protection and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, applauded the decision, but critics said the move ignores the needs and preferences of the general public.\n\nSeaWorld, which stopped breeding orcas in 2016 amid falling ticket sales and a wave of animal rights protests, released a statement Wednesday night, slamming the new TripAdvisor policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed by TripAdvisor\u2019s new position that ignores the educational value and conservation mission of professionally accredited zoos and aquariums. SeaWorld believes deeply in the mission of these organizations,\" Chris Dold, SeaWorld\u2019s chief zoological officer, said. \"SeaWorld maintains the highest standards of care for all animals, including cetaceans. And regardless of TripAdvisor\u2019s position, SeaWorld will continue to advance education and animal conservation efforts.\"\n\nSimilarly, Dan Ashe, president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said TripAdvisor was putting \"extreme opinions ahead of informed customers.\"\n\n\"TripAdvisor is letting voices of a radical minority dictate corporate policy, rather than listening to the voices and preferences of their customers,\" Ashe said in a statement Wednesday. \"TripAdvisor should give its customers good information and trust them to make well-informed decisions.\"\n\nTripAdvisor -- which serves an average of about 490 million travelers a month, according to its website -- said the new policy will go into full effect by the end of the year.", "description": "TripAdvisor will ban ticket sales to tourist attractions and aquariums like SeaWorld.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/killer-whale-mo_hpMain_20191002-224234_16x9_992.jpg"}
