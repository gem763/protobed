Given the current market conditions though Metro have elected to not proceed with a transaction at this time,\" the lender said in a statement.", "description": "Metro Bank's woes deepen as UK lender ditches debt issue", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8M1ME_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
