If you have nothing nice to say regarding my choices please scroll on and keep your opinions to yourself, thanks.'\n\nOthers shared their snaps of their own 'snack hauls' in support of the woman (pictured)\n\nAnd many were quick to support the woman's feelings.\n\n'It's crazy on this page that you have to justify yourself otherwise people get mad. Everyone runs their household differently. Good job,' one woman wrote.\n\nAnother added: 'Is it now a thing to criticise how ALDI mums spend their money to feed their families?\n\n'Can't we all just be glad that there's a shop where we can go for well priced goods? I don't get everything from ALDI but I like that people are happy that they're helping the budget.'\n\nOthers shared their snaps of their own 'snack hauls' in support of the woman's original post.", "description": "A mother has been slammed by parents after she shared a photo of her 'processed' back to school snack haul on Facebook - but she insists they don't always eat 'junk food'.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19761160-0-image-a-15_1571176712031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
