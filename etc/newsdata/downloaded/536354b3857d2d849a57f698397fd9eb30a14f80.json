Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nPresident Donald Trump has had a rough week fighting battles on three different fronts: one regarding the Ukraine scandal, one related to his tax returns, and one to hold his administration together.\n\nTrump faces an impeachment inquiry catalyzed by the Ukraine scandal, which is rapidly escalating and poses an existential threat to his presidency.\n\nMeanwhile, another whistleblower complaint beyond the one concerned with Ukraine has emerged and is linked to Trump's taxes. The complaint could give Democrats leverage to finally see Trump's tax returns released.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be fundamentally unprepared for the convoluted array of forces converging upon it. This is the losing battle Trump is fighting on the home-front.\n\nTrump's recent behavior has led to criticism from some Republican lawmakers as well as Fox News commentators.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is fighting a war on three fronts right now \u2014 one on the Ukraine scandal, one on his taxes, and one to hold his administration together \u2014 and it has not gone well for him this week.\n\nTrump faces an impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine scandal, which is rapidly escalating and poses an existential threat to his presidency. It's linked to a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in with Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe phone call is at the heart of a whistleblower complaint from an intelligence official, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finally move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry after pumping the brakes on the issue for months.\n\nRead more: Trump says Democrats are wasting the country's time on 'BULLSHIT' in angry tweet on impeachment\n\nAfter former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference was released, a significant cohort of Democrats urged Pelosi to move forward with impeachment. Though the Mueller report was damning and did foster a slew of inquiries by House Democrats, Pelosi was reluctant to formally get the ball rolling on impeachment over fears it could backfire on her party politically.\n\nBut the Ukraine scandal has unfolded at lightning speed and is more digestible than the long-running Russia investigation and Mueller's 448-page report on it, and Pelosi has opened the floodgates.\n\nMultiple polls have shown that public support for at least some impeachment action is up, albeit modestly, including among Republican voters. And over a majority of the House now supports at least an impeachment inquiry or more, which was not the case before the Ukraine scandal picked up steam in late September.\n\nThe other whistleblower complaint and the battle for Trump's taxes\n\nMeanwhile, another whistleblower complaint has emerged.\n\nThe chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on August 8 that said he'd received a credible and \"unsolicited\" complaint from a federal employee.\n\nIt alleges \"inappropriate efforts to influence\" the mandatory IRS audit of Trump's and Vice President Mike Pence's tax returns, Neal said in the letter, which was first widely reported this week.\n\nRead more: Another whistleblower has come forward, this time alleging 'inappropriate efforts' to influence Trump's tax audit\n\nNeal has in recent months called for more congressional oversight of the IRS's mandatory audit of the president's tax returns.\n\n\"The president is unique: No other American has the power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. That power, and the extent to which the IRS can audit and enforce federal tax laws against a current or future president, merits closer legislative scrutiny,\" Neal wrote in a July op-ed for The Washington Post.\n\nNeal's primary concern is that lawmakers and the public don't know anything about the scope of the mandatory audits and \"whether the president can exert undue influence on the IRS to affect his or her tax treatment.\"\n\nRichard Neal (D-MA), speaks during a news conference held by House Democrats condemning the Trump Administration's targeting of the Affordable Care Act's pre-existing condition, in the US Capitol on June 13, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Trump continues to maintain ownership of his business empire, breaking from the tradition of presidents placing their assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said he can't release his tax returns because they're under audit, but there's no law or rule dictating this.\n\nIn July, Neal sued Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to get ahold of six years' worth of Trump's tax returns.\n\nThough far more attention is being granted to the Ukraine scandal and few details are known about this whistleblower complaint, legal experts and former prosecutors told Insider it could land Trump in hot water legally and potentially lead to the release of his tax returns \u2014 dealing a major victory to Democrats.\n\nTrump's self-inflicted wounds\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be fundamentally unprepared for the convoluted array of forces converging upon it.\n\nThe White House is \"paralyzed\" and \"teetering off the edge of a cliff\" amid the political firestorm that's unfolded over the Ukraine scandal and related whistleblower complaint, a White House official recently told Insider reporter Sonam Sheth.\n\nAnd Trump appears to be unraveling before our eyes \u2014 floating wild conspiracy theories, suggesting a \"Civil War like fracture\" could transpire if he's impeached, lashing out at reporters asking basic questions, using profanity in tweets, and suggesting his political opponents be arrested for treason.\n\nBeyond creating anxiety within the White House, Trump's recent antics have also led to criticism from some fellow Republicans in Congress. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, referred to Trump's \"Civil War\" tweet as \"beyond repugnant.\"\n\n\"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,\" Kinzinger said of Trump's tweet, which quoted a Fox News guest.\n\nThe controversies swirling around Trump have also created a schism in Fox News between the opinion hosts who support Trump and news anchors, and the president is facing far more direct and serious criticism than ever before on the conservative network.\n\nFox News senior legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, on Monday, for example, ripped into Trump for his conduct with Ukraine and suggested it offers grounds for impeachment.\n\n\"The president of the United States using foreign governments to influence domestic politics \u2014 that was the fear of the framers when they put that impeachment clause in the Constitution,\" Napolitano said.\n\nIn a subsequent op-ed for FoxNews.com on Wednesday, Napolitano said Trump's behavior has been \"criminal\" and \"impeachable.\"\n\nHe also referred to Trump's suggestion that his impeachment could lead to a second American Civil War as \"a dog whistle to the deranged.\"\n\nTrump is not backing down, and that could continue to backfire\n\nOn Thursday, Trump stood on the White House lawn and doubled-down on the request that landed him in this political quagmire in the first place: he called on Ukraine to investigate Biden. But this time it was on live TV.\n\nOn top of this, Trump urged China to investigate Biden, presenting another instance of the president asking a foreign power to go after a political rival.\n\nRead more: Only 40% of Republicans believe Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden, even though he admitted that he did\n\nSoon thereafter, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, whom was the target of Trump's treason allegation, tweeted, \"The President cannot use the power of his office to pressure foreign leaders to investigate his political opponents. His rant this morning reinforces the urgency of our work. America is a Republic, if we can keep it.\"\n\nAs he adopts increasingly extreme rhetoric and tactics to push back on the crises enveloping his presidency, Trump only appears to be digging himself into a deeper hole.", "description": "The Trump administration appears to be fundamentally unprepared for the convoluted array of forces converging upon it.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d963cfd51823d256d2fb271?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
