Now, the troops are gone on President Donald Trump\u2019s orders, Turkey is invading, the Kurds are fleeing, leaving their prisoners unsecured, and ISIS fighters are escaping.\n\nHow does Trump defend this situation?\n\n\u201cSome people want the United States to protect the 7,000 mile away Border of Syria, presided over by Bashar al-Assad, our enemy,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI would much rather focus on our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nGraeme Wood: ISIS is gloating\n\nHe\u2019d have us believe that this is a campaign promise kept: an America First foreign policy that refuses to risk American blood or waste U.S. dollars in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he claims, \u201cwe are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t so.\n\nTake it from the Pentagon reporter at Fox News, who reports, \u201cSince May, U.S. forces have increased in Middle East by ~14,000 ... There are currently more than 60,000 U.S. troops deployed to various countries and aboard warships.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, Trump declared, \u201cThe Endless Wars Must End!\u201d To which a noninterventionist congressman, Justin Amash, retorted, \u201cThen we\u2019ll need a new president who will end them. President Trump has had nearly three years to end them and has done zero. He keeps sending more troops to the Middle East \u2026 He vetoed legislation that would have limited U.S. involvement in the Yemen war.\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s flailing.
