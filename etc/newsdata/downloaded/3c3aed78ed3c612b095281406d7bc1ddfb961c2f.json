The State Senate has already passed the measure, and Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that he will sign it into law. Beginning next year, companies like Uber, Lyft and other giants of the gig economy would be forced to treat hundreds of thousands of workers as employees. The legislation creates a valuable template that other states should emulate, particularly in the face of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to reduce worker protections.\n\nContractors are workers paid by a company, but not protected by most workplace laws. They are not guaranteed a minimum wage, overtime pay or any other benefits, for example.\n\nThe use of contractors can serve a legitimate purpose, as when a company pays an expert to perform a specific task. But companies have taken advantage of the law, hiring large numbers of contractors whom they have treated as an inferior grade of employee.", "description": "A California bill would make it harder for companies like Uber to take advantage of workers.
