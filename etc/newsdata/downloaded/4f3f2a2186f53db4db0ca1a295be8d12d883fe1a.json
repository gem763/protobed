The revelation that the G.I. Jane actress has patched things up with her family comes on the heels of the release of her candid new memoir, Inside Out. And, according to a new source, there were times Moore\u2019s life created so much \u201cchaos\u201d that any sort of reconciliation seemed practically impossible.\n\n\u201cShe was really struggling mentally and didn\u2019t take care of herself. She didn\u2019t have the best relationship with her daughters either and her life was just chaos,\u201d a source told People of the destructive years that followed her split from ex-husband Ashton Kutcher. As a result, it created distance between her and her children, as Moore addressed in her book.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nBut Moore has focused her energies over the last few years on getting healthy and restoring the closeness she once had with Rumer, Scout and Tallulah. \u201cNow, she has a beautiful relationship with all of her daughters,\u201d said the source. \u201cDemi feels bad about the years she wasn\u2019t healthy. She really tries to make up for it now. Her daughters are amazing. Demi is involved in their everyday lives. And they are supportive of Demi. They love that she wrote a memoir.\u201d\n\nGetting to this point wasn\u2019t easy, though. In a telling interview with The New York Times that went live last week, Moore admitted she sought professional help to address some of her issues \u2014 including a rehab program for trauma, codependency and substance abuse, as well as independent work with a doctor specializing in integrative medicine to assist in healing the health issues that contributed to her decline.\n\nThe effort hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by her daughters. Scout told the Times she was proud of their mom for \u201cdoing the internal work that she didn\u2019t have time to do, for a long time, because she was just in survival mode.\u201d Rumer said that the journey has given her a newfound empathy for her mom\u2019s struggles. \u201cWe grow up thinking that our parents are these immovable gods of Olympus,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously as we grow older, we start to realize how much our parents are just people.\u201d\n\nToday, Moore insists she has maintained her sobriety \u2014 and her relationship with her daughters. In fact, she, Rumer and Scout are taking a 10-month-long spiritual psychology course together. It\u2019s a far cry from those unhealthy years after her split from Kutcher when, as Moore explains in the memoir, she had \u201cno career, no relationship.\u201d\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
