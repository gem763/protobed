So he went on Fox News Friday to try to convince them otherwise.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t seen a lot of data that suggest that there\u2019s a negative impact,\" the Facebook co-founder told Dana Perino in an interview that aired Friday on \"The Daily Briefing.\"\n\nThe data often show the exact opposite. \u201cIn fact, a lot of conservative media does quite well on social media \u2014 not just Facebook,\u201d he added.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s sit-down was the latest chapter in Facebook\u2019s charm offensive in response to charges of bias from conservatives, including President Donald Trump.\n\nThere's little evidence to back up those claims. But they\u2019ve ramped up the potential for new tech regulations \u2014 and even a breakup of tech giants like Facebook.\n\n\n\nREAD: How Fox News dominates Facebook in the Trump era\n\nZuckerberg has pushed back against the notion that splintering his company, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, would answer the lingering questions around privacy and election security.\n\n\u201cI basically think each of those problems requires work on our part, but also the government,\u201d he said.\n\nGranting an interview to Fox News, which has elevated many of the GOP\u2019s bad-faith criticisms of Facebook, was notable.\n\nPolitico reported on Monday that Zuckerberg has also hosted meetings in recent months with media figures including own-the-libs pundit Ben Shapiro and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Those gatherings have apparently done little to tamp down pressure from the right.\n\n\u201cI understand why people would ask the question of, \u2018Are my ideas getting a fair shake?\u2019\u201d Zuckerberg said Friday. \u201cAll I can say is this is something I care deeply about. I want to make sure we can be a platform for all ideas.\u201d\n\nThe outreach to the right, including a Republican-led bias \u201caudit\u201d and enlistment of The Daily Caller as a fact-checking partner, has led some progressives to argue that Facebook actually tilts in favor of conservatives. That feeling boiled over in recent weeks when Facebook refused to remove a Trump campaign ad that falsely accused former Vice President Joe Biden of corruption in Ukraine.\n\nZuckerberg tried to sell the decision as a vote for free expression in a winding speech to Georgetown students on Thursday. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s become one of Big Tech\u2019s loudest critics from the left on antitrust grounds, panned it almost immediately.", "description": "The Facebook CEO is on a charm offensive with conservative media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daa2ad48434b4000a4438b8/lede/1571433478316-mark-zuckerberg.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7894736842105263xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
