You offer to put the kettle on because she\u2019s tired and parched from being out in the garden. But when you go to get the milk you find a peculiar surprise behind the fridge door. In there, you see out-of-date groceries and her hairbrush. You know your mother always prides herself on keeping an orderly home and that hairbrush belongs on her dressing table. The discovery is made all the more disturbing when you realise she\u2019s been rather forgetful lately, repeating stories she\u2019s already shared with you on phone calls. You also notice a letter about an unpaid bill on the dining table and your mother seems somewhat withdrawn. You have to ask yourself an uncomfortable question: could these be the first signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nWitnessing the cruel cognitive decline of someone you love, not least someone who once was your main carer, is painful and unsettling. However, recognising symptoms and doing something about it means the person can get a diagnosis, if one is necessary, and the help they might need to preserve wellbeing. So how does one act on such suspicions in a sensitive and helpful way?\n\n\n\nWhen should you broach the subject?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Knowing when to have that conversation can be tricky though.\n\nDr Tim Beanland, head of knowledge management at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, suggests the appropriate time to start thinking about having a conversation is when you can see changes that cause concern or begin to affect the person\u2019s quality of life. Be watchful of activities such as changes in how the person drives, for instance, or if they are having minor accidents at home, such as leaving the hob on. \u201cIf these are causing you concern, that is the stage I\u2019d want to ask for professional help and do something about it,\u201d says Beanland.\n\n\n\nHow do you have that conversation?\n\nThe person may already suspect that something is going on, others may think there is nothing wrong. Firstly, though, it is really important to ask yourself if you are the right person to be having that conversation. If you are, pick the right time and place. Beanland says: \u201cFind somewhere quiet and away from distractions. In case the person agrees they need to see a GP, it helps to talk when the surgery is open so the appointment can be booked there and then.\u201d\n\nBeing calm and reassuring is critical. \u201cWe say to people, start generally,\u201d Beanland explains. \u201cDon\u2019t jump in and say, \u2018I think you\u2019ve got dementia.\u2019 Try, \u2018I\u2019m a bit worried about you \u2013 have you noticed any changes recently?\u2019 And maybe give them specific examples of your concerns.\u201d\n\nIf the person agrees to see a GP, that is a positive step in the right direction because there is help out there for people. However, if the person rejects help things become a little more challenging. You can go to the patient\u2019s GP and tell them you\u2019re concerned but the doctor is not able to share information back with you because of patient confidentially.\n\nIn any case, Beanland recommends that the person is accompanied by someone who knows him or her well when seeing a GP, both for support and sometimes to gain the bigger picture. \u201cThe son, daughter, partner, etc might have noticed things and, if the person consents to them attending too, these can be shared with the GP,\u201d he says.\n\nHow can you offer emotional support?\n\nNever underestimate the power of just being there and listening to someone\u2019s feelings. \u201cIt will be an emotional roller-coaster,\u201d says Beanland, \u201cbut try to imagine as far as possible what it might be like for them because going through that assessment process \u2013 if it is dementia, that is a life-changing diagnosis.\u201d He also suggests not leaping ahead but taking one step at a time.\n\nThere might be instances, though, when the person does not want to engage and can even become angry. Beanland says: \u201cDoctors, nurses, psychologists and our own helpline can all help people understand and adjust to a diagnosis. Talking to someone can be really helpful in the long run.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou are not alone\n\nIt\u2019s really common for people supporting someone with dementia to not look after themselves as well as they should because they feel guilt if they put themselves first. There is help out there. Beanland says: \u201cReach out to people \u2013 can you ask a neighbour or your network of friends to help with shopping or errands? There are also support groups and online communities for carers. It can be quite isolating but don\u2019t feel you have to deal with it alone. Carer burnout is a real issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t forget\u2026\n\nWith the right support, people can live well with dementia. Getting a diagnosis is the first step in unlocking that support when it is needed and it removes some of the uncertainty that the person and their family might be feeling. It can be what allows them to move forward with their life.\n\nIf you have been affected by dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease you can call the National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 11 22", "description": "You\u2019ve gone to your mother\u2019s house to visit.
