So James Pyle donned the \u201cGhostface\u201d costume from the \u201cScream\u201d horror movie franchise, and posed in a few pictures of the four-bedroom home that are sprinkled among the more professional shots featured in the Zillow ZG, -0.32% listing. They include the slasher raking leaves in the yard, hiding behind sheer curtains in the living room, and carving a pumpkin on the kitchen island using his signature butcher knife.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the neighborhood or area; it\u2019s just not one of those neighborhoods that everyone is dying to get into,\u201d Pyle, 41, told MarketWatch. (The pun was not intended, he said). \u201cAnd so I was hoping if we did something novelty and comical and kind of silly, that we\u2019d garner between 500 and 1,000 views.\u201d\n\nMichigan real estate agent James Pyle wore the Ghostface costume from the \u201cScream\u201d movies in a recent listing.\n\nThe result? While typical Lansing real estate listings get around 100 views after a week or two this time of year, Pyle said, his creepy, comical post for 809 N. Chestnut St. was approaching 1 million views on Zillow alone on Tuesday afternoon \u2014 just four days after it went live. And Pyle guessed that the total number of views from Facebook FB, -1.27%, Twitter TWTR, -2.31%, other realtors sharing his post, as well as pickups from local news outlets and the \u201cToday\u201d show, puts it closer to 5 million hits. He is also scheduled to appear on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Wednesday, so this viral listing could be haunting social media feeds for days to come.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this $30 Halloween costume \u2014 available at shops like Amazon AMZN, -0.01% and Party City PRTY, +2.63% \u2014 has already brought in one potential buyer for the $105,000 home. \u201cThe sellers are very pleased,\u201d he said.\n\nYes, Ghostface photobombed the real estate listing for this century-old Lansing home https://t.co/r3y3C8cWPY \u2014 Lansing State Journal (@LSJNews) September 29, 2019\n\nSo what made this spooky stunt a hit instead of a horror show?\n\nPyle, who has 15 years experience as a real estate agent under his cowl, said that keeping things tasteful was key.\n\n\u201cThis is a professional listing,\u201d he said, noting that the Ghostface pics only make up about a third of the overall slideshow. \u201cAnd as much as we were having fun with it, we didn\u2019t want to do anything too scary. So we did things that weren\u2019t gruesome. We kept it fun and humorous, so that kids could laugh at it, too.\u201d\n\nMichigan real estate agent James Pyle wore the Ghostface costume from the \u201cScream\u201d movies in a recent listing.\n\nPlus, he said the horror elements fit well with the 1,568-square-foot, century-old house and its original hardwood floors and large windows, especially with Halloween around the corner. \u201cIt was just the right combination of things that made it pop so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did it classy, and it\u2019s the right time of year.\u201d\n\nHe was also sure to get the homeowner\u2019s permission before proceeding with the frightening photo shoot, of course. \u201cShe said she\u2019s thrilled with it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe and her family have just had a really good time with it, too.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still drawn at least one Halloween hater, however, as another real estate agent left him a furious voicemail on Tuesday morning. \u201cShe said I needed to be more professional and grow the f\u2014 up,\u201d he said.\n\nMichigan real estate agent James Pyle wore the Ghostface costume from the \u201cScream\u201d movies in a recent listing.\n\nBut while the extra attention is certainly good for getting people to look at the house, Pyle said that reading the market is even more important. \u201cReal estate in Michigan has slowed down because winter is coming ... so we have set the price right,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping to get an offer within a week, and we got one in four days. And I know there\u2019s more serious interest than just this one buyer.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s now considering hiding costumed characters in some future listings, as well, although he wouldn\u2019t share which ones or when. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to repeat the same success as with this listing ever again,\u201d said Pyle. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have fun. I\u2019ve been getting calls from real estate agents all across the country that said they loved the ingenuity. It\u2019s put smiles on people\u2019s faces, which has been the best part.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just completely enjoying my two minutes of fame,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd nobody will know who I am next week.\u201d", "description": "Michigan agent tells MarketWatch how he got a buyer in just four days using a Halloween costume.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS425_Scream_MG_20191001141902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
