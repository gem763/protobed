Parliament torpedoed her instead.\n\nVon der Leyen had reached out to the three group leaders \u2014 Manfred Weber of the conservative European People's Party (EPP); Iratxe Garcia of the Socialists & Democrats (S&D); and Dacian Ciolo\u0219 of Macron's liberal Renew Europe \u2014 about attending the Friday breakfast together with some of the most influential EU national leaders who were in Brussels for a summit.\n\nBut according to several officials with knowledge of the situation, the plan quickly unraveled, as the group leaders first scrambled to rearrange their schedules, then realized that Macron and von der Leyen were putting them in an impossible position.\n\nHow breakfast unraveled\n\nWith Macron still to name a new nominee, officials said that meeting with him would expose them to criticism of colluding in advance to support the French candidate, rather than exercising Parliament's independent oversight in the confirmation process.\n\nAfter Macron said he had gotten assurance from von der Leyen of support for Goulard, Garc\u00eda and Weber publicly denied it.\n\nWith the group leaders unwilling to attend such a meeting, Macron and von der Leyen met instead with heads of state and government representing the main pro-EU political families: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, and Latvian Prime Minister Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, all of the EPP; Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa of the S&D; and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel for Renew Europe.\n\nExplaining the session to reporters, Macron said it was intended to put a stop to what he viewed as out-of-control partisan feuding in Parliament that led to the rejection of his nominee.\n\n\"This morning I held a working breakfast with Angela Merkel, Ursula von der Leyen and representatives of the three big political families to discuss the entry into office of the new Commission, its strategic agenda and the work of the European Parliament,\" Macron said.\n\nHe said it was \"indispensable\" to have cooperation in the Council and the Parliament among leaders of the main pro-EU groups. \"We need to build a real pact of responsibility, majority and ambition together.\"\n\nThere was only one problem: no one from Parliament was at the breakfast \u2014 not even Parliament President David Sassoli.\n\nThat sent yet another signal that Macron, and von der Leyen, who tweeted a photo of the breakfast saying she looked forward to meeting the leaders of the parliamentary groups next week (she's scheduled to have dinner with them on Monday in Strasbourg), still don't quite grasp the balance of institutional power in Brussels \u2014 in which the Parliament most assuredly does not see itself as taking orders either from the Commission or Council.\n\nIn a sign of the perils of making political invitations in Brussels, von der Leyen was also slammed by an MEP from the smaller left-wing group. \"Starting your mandate with such an understanding of democracy won't help you build some trust,\" tweeted French MEP Manon Aubry.\n\nMacron continued to hype up the drama on Friday.\n\nMacron, at his post-summit news conference, attributed the defeat of Goulard to the earlier rejection by Parliament of the Hungarian nominee, a conservative, and the Romanian nominee, a socialist.\n\nMacron said he believed the three groups had undertaken a process of mutual immolation, describing them as akin to a self-cleaning oven that burns up everything inside. \"It worked,\" he said. \"There are three fewer commissioners. Each side has cut a head off. It\u2019s no more or less than that.\"\n\nThe French president continued, \"This dynamic of pyrolysis doesn\u2019t make it possible to have a strong Commission. It may not even make it possible to get a majority for this Commission at all. For sure, it won\u2019t make it possible to have an ambitious program. So we need to calm down. It\u2019s a real dysfunction. I think it\u2019s a political crisis.\"\n\nMany officials in Brussels believe that if there is a crisis it was created by Macron and his over-reaction to the defeat of the French nominee. Goulard had faced multiple investigations into allegations of misuse of official funds during her time as a member of the European Parliament, and also tough questions about a high-paid consulting job with a think-tank for which she did very little work. Although Goulard denied wrongdoing, she struggled during two confirmation hearings to answer questions about the allegations, which had led her to resign as defense minister of France after just one month in the job.\n\nOfficials in Brussels said that Macron \u2014 instead of accepting that he had put forward a flawed nominee and swiftly picking a replacement \u2014 had created a firestorm by lashing out at von der Leyen and declaring an inter-institutional crisis where none appeared to exist. While he insisted that he had offered up three different names and von der Leyen had preferred Goulard, the fact that he has still not named a replacement has led officials to doubt Macron ever had other candidates in mind.\n\nMacron continued to hype up the drama on Friday.\n\n\"What happened just cannot go on,\" he said. \"That\u2019s why I wanted the meeting this morning.\"\n\nNew kid on the block\n\nOfficials said that von der Leyen's initial move to include the leaders of the parliamentary groups highlighted that she remains a newbie in EU politics. The Commission president-elect has kept a low profile during the transition, and seems to be struggling to find her footing \u2014 especially in determining who she can trust among her vice presidents and commissioners as well as in the 30,000-strong EU civil service.\n\nThe breakfast overshadowed von der Leyen's debut at the European Council, where she made a presentation to the assembled leaders about her political program.\n\nThe breakfast brought together the heads of state and government who had led the effort to select the new EU leadership. And officials said that would have created yet another layer of awkward tension given that they were responsible for selecting von der Leyen, a former German defense minister and ally of Merkel, for the Commission presidency over Weber, who had been the EPP's official candidate for the post.\n\nSome MEPs have speculated that conservatives in Parliament voted against Goulard as a way of exacting revenge against Macron and Merkel for the selection of von der Leyen.\n\nThe breakfast overshadowed von der Leyen's debut at the European Council, where she made a presentation to the assembled leaders about her political program and her intention to run a \"geopolitical Commission.\"\n\nWith the leaders having discussed the situation in Turkey and Syria on Thursday night, von der Leyen stressed her plans to enhance the EU's defense capabilities, with an emphasis on boosting the EU's defense industry and improving coordination on procurement as well as research and development. Recognizing the importance of NATO, von der Leyen said that nonetheless \"the EU needs to have its own stance on defense,\" according to one person who heard her remarks.\n\nOne official who saw her presentation said \"she was impressive, extremely well-prepared.\" She did not read from her notes, and then answered comfortably when leaders peppered her with questions and comments, the official said.\n\nOne EU diplomat said leaders also recognized that von der Leyen was still adjusting to her new role, as well as to the curious culture of the Brussels bubble, and that she seemed not yet entirely sure whom she could trust.\n\nJacopo Barigazzi, Rym Momtaz and Paul Taylor contributed reporting.", "description": "Attempt to help Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen build a majority coalition may have backfired.", "authors": ["David M.
