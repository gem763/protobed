Luckily the humidity isn\u2019t terrible, but back in the noticeable range with dew points in the mid-60s, and an isolated shower or thundershower possible toward evening. Definitely not the refreshing weather I\u2019m looking for in mid-September. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Clouds increase as another front approaches from the north, with an isolated shower or thundershower possible during the evening and overnight. Otherwise low range from the mid-60s to near 70. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nBehind the front Tuesday and Wednesday is some of that mid-September stuff I\u2019m talking about! Some clouds may linger early Tuesday, but otherwise we\u2019re looking at partly to mostly sunny skies with a nice breeze from the northeast and afternoon highs around 75 or 80. Tuesday night is nice as well, with cooler lows in the low to mid-60s.
