The decision startled some members of Congress, including Republicans, who warned such a move could precipitate a genocide of the Kurds and lead to the return of the self-described Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in the region.\n\n\u201cI urge the President to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners,\u201d McConnell said in a statement.\n\nTrump defended his decision, which he made against the recommendations of the Pentagon and State Department.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,\u201d the president falsely claimed in a Monday tweet. \u201cIt is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory.\u201d\n\nTrump also tweeted that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if the country took any action he considers \u201coff limits\u201d in the wake of the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal.\n\nIn a bipartisan statement, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Monday requested Trump send a representative to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to defend the move.\n\n\u201cThe Administration must come before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and explain to the American people how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests,\u201d the senators said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent cheerleader of the president, called the decision \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d in a phone interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday.\n\nLindsey Graham calls in to Fox & Friends & calls Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds \"impulsive.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope I'm making myself clear how shortsighted & irresponsible this decision is in my view,\" he says. \"This to me is just unnerving to its core.\" pic.twitter.com/URH0DVA1bo \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 7, 2019\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a statement called Trump\u2019s decision \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cmisguided.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Northern Syria is a deeply disturbing development that betrays our Kurdish allies who have been instrumental partners in our mission to eradicate ISIS,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cDespite what the President might say, ISIS remains a serious threat. This reckless, misguided decision undermines the efforts by our brave servicemembers and our allies to end ISIS\u2019s tyranny.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story.
