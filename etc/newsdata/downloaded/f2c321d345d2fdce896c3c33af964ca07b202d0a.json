Tickets are available from website mcshow.co.uk.\n\nMichaela Strachan started a pension and began investing in the stock market at the age of 21\n\nWhat did your parents teach you about money?\n\nThat you can have a lot of money one minute \u2013 and it can disappear the next. My family went through a big financial crisis when I was 15. My father lost his job at a building society and we lost everything, including our home.\n\nI was attending a private school and had to get a bursary for my last year. We went from being a secure middle-class family to one that had nothing. I learned from that experience to put money aside and not spend everything you\u2019ve got. That was a good lesson to learn young.\n\nWhat was the first paid work you ever did?\n\nDelivering leaflets when I was 15. I remember thinking I would get it done a lot quicker if I did it on roller skates. But I was not good at stopping so I used to crash into people\u2019s front doors, put the leaflets through their letter box, then off I\u2019d go again. I would get home covered in bruises.\n\nHave you ever struggled to make ends meet?\n\nNo, never, but I have supported myself since the age of 16 when I started paying rent to my mum. At college studying musical theatre, I worked part-time as a dancing showgirl at a hotel near Heathrow. I earned about \u00a3100 a week for four evenings\u2019 work.\n\nThat was a lot of money for a student in those days. I got my first job in TV at age 20, presenting The Wide Awake Club on Saturday mornings. I have always lived within my means.\n\nHave you ever been paid silly money?\n\nYes, when I modelled clothes for Kays mail order catalogue in 1991. I got paid thousands of pounds for about two days\u2019 work, plus I got to keep all the clothes.\n\nWhat was the best year of your financial life?\n\nIt has to be 1998. I was so busy that year \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I ever had a day off. I was presenting The Really Wild Show and lots of other wildlife and family TV shows as well as headlining the pantomimes I was in. You get paid well for panto and I was in two of them that year.\n\nTV presenters were paid a lot more, relatively, in those days than now. I don\u2019t get much more for doing Springwatch than I did for doing The Hitman And Her late night TV show in the early 1990s.\n\nSavvy advice: Kids TV presenter Timmy Mallett\n\nWhat is the most expensive thing you bought for fun?\n\nIt was a convertible MGB GT. I fantasised about owning one for a while. I bought it before I had children. I can\u2019t remember how much it cost \u2013 it was 25 years ago \u2013 but I know it was an extravagance. I wouldn\u2019t buy a car like that now. The car I currently have is a Fiat 500. The boot is so tiny I had to measure my son\u2019s cricket bat before I bought it to make sure it would fit.\n\nWhat is your biggest money mistake?\n\nBuying my son an Xbox games console. He\u2019s 14 and I so wish I hadn\u2019t bought him one. It wasn\u2019t a lot of money but the games are addictive and as a parent you have to keep on top of it. I wish I\u2019d been stronger and just said no.\n\nThe best money decision you have made?\n\nPurchasing a two-bedroom flat in Highgate, North London, 25 years ago for \u00a375,000. It\u2019s been a great investment. I\u2019ve paid off the mortgage and rent it out which provides me with an income. I would also imagine it must have gone up a lot in value since I bought it, but I haven\u2019t had it valued.\n\nDo you save into a pension and invest in the stock market?\n\nYes, I have done both ever since age 21. I was lucky: the 1980s were a good time to start. The person who advised me to take out a pension and invest in the stock market was Timmy Mallett, my fellow TV presenter on the Wide Awake Club. He was really savvy about money.\n\nI was buying my first flat and he said that if I was going to get a mortgage, I should think about a pension. He sent me to an adviser he knew at an investment company and we set everything up.\n\nMichaela Strachan would introduce a tax on single-use plastic if she were Chancellor\n\nWhat\u2019s your investment strategy?\n\nNot to just invest in property. I have learned over my 30 years as an investor that it\u2019s good to have a spread of investments. When interest rates go up, property values go down and when interest rates go down, property values go up. You should never put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nI don\u2019t pick the stocks myself, I invest in funds, but I do have criteria. I try to put my money into ethical investments. Not all of it, but I\u2019ve had an ethical portfolio for years and I never invest in any company that exploits the environment or uses slave labour.\n\nI avoid tobacco companies as well. I don\u2019t think enough investors think about what companies are doing, particularly to the environment. I want to make a profit but not at the expense of the planet and of people.\n\nDo you own any property?\n\nYes, I own flats in London and a house in Cape Town, South Africa, where I live. It\u2019s a spacious, open-plan house in a beautiful private estate in Hout Bay, nestled between Table Mountain National Park and the sea. We have fantastic views and you just go out of a gate and you are straight into the national park.\n\nI\u2019ve been living in South Africa for 17 years. I bought a holiday home initially and then met my partner and decided to move there permanently.\n\nMichaela has donated to Greenpeace and conservation charity WWF since she was in her 20s\n\nWhat is the one little luxury you treat yourself to?\n\nI like a sports massage. I have one regularly because having trained as a dancer I put a lot of wear and tear on certain parts of my body. In Cape Town it costs only \u00a325 an hour.\n\nIf you were Chancellor of the Exchequer, what is the first thing you would do?\n\nI would put a tax on single-use plastic and use the proceeds to help fund projects that are trying to find alternatives. I think the only way you\u2019re going to reduce the amount of single plastic produced is if you give financial incentives to the companies that are working hard to find an alternative.\n\nDo you donate money to charity?\n\nYes. I\u2019ve donated to Greenpeace and conservation charity WWF since I was in my 20s. I also give a lot to the Seabird Rescue Centre in South Africa.\n\nI\u2019ve had breast cancer so I also support breast cancer charities and \u2013 because we live in Africa \u2013 I sponsor a child from a disadvantaged background through a local charity.\n\nWhat is your number one financial priority?\n\nTo be financially stable for the rest of my life. I want to make sure I have enough put away to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in the future.", "description": "Springwatch presenter Michaela Strachan started a pension and began investing in the stock market at the age of 21 - after taking advice from fellow kids TV presenter Timmy Mallett.", "authors": ["Donna Ferguson For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
