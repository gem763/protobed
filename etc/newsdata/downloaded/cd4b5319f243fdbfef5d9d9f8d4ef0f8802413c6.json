But was the backlash justified?\n\nIs this the worst guide to impressing your colleagues ever written?\n\nName: Five Ways to Impress on Your First Day.\n\nAge: Very short-lived.\n\nAppearance: See above \u2026 brief.\n\nSome kind of workplace guide? Exactly, published by Reed.\n\nThe employment agency? That\u2019s the one. It put out some advice for new employees.\n\nSuch as? \u201cBe early/work late,\u201d and \u201cUse your initiative.\u201d\n\nWell that sounds like reasonable advice, if a bit obvious. Hardly worthy of Pass Notes\u2019 attention. What else was in it? Well, there was a section called Don\u2019t Be Yourself.\n\nVery wise. What\u2019s in that? \u201cOK, so we\u2019re sure you\u2019re a very nice person. And no doubt you have many qualities that we would probably like if we got to know you. The point is: your colleagues will have plenty of time to get to know you, so don\u2019t try too hard.\u201d\n\nAgain, sound advice. Interesting tone, though. It went on: \u201cTry finding the most popular person in the office, then follow them around for the rest of the day.\u201d\n\nStalk them, in other words! Probably best not follow them into the toilet. Also, \u201cGet everyone in the office lunch,\u201d and \u201cLaugh at everything.\u201d\n\nI always ask a candidate that question in any job interview: you will buy me lunch, won\u2019t you? And laugh at your jokes.\n\nBut this is clearly meant to be humorous. It may not quite be The Thick of It, but it\u2019s still quite funny (for a recruitment agency, at least). Not everyone thought so.\n\nOh, dear. Who didn\u2019t? People online. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst advice I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said one person. \u201cPeople suck.\u201d\n\nOh, God. People online suck, more like. What else did they say? \u201cThis should be titled: How to Make Sure Everyone Thinks You\u2019re a Serial Killer.\u201d\n\nA bit better. But surely no one took it to-the-letter seriously. And, if they did, they probably didn\u2019t deserve the job in the first place. Well, you\u2019d think it was obvious which bits were supposed to be tongue-in-cheek and there were loads of links to sensible advice, but after the backlash Reed decided to take it down. RIP Five Ways to Impress on Your First Day.\n\nOh, no. I wondered why it was in the past tense. Maybe they sacked the person responsible for trying too hard.\n\nDo say: \u201cOn your first day, punctuality is the key to making a good impression from the get-go.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019m new here, you seem to be well-respected and important.
