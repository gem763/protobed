That notice was issued just two days into a work-to-rule campaign.\n\nOn Thursday, schools boards across Ontario sent notices to parents warning that without custodians, clerical staff, education assistants and others on site, they cannot guarantee students' safety and will be forced to close until workers are back on the job.\n\n\"I think it shows us how vital our services are in those schools, and on that I think we agree with the school boards,\" Laura Walton, president of CUPE's Ontario School Board Council of Unions, told CBC Radio's Metro Morning on Friday.\n\n\"And I'm hoping that is one thing we can build upon and head back to the table.\"\n\nLaura Walton, president of CUPE's Ontario School Board Council of Unions, said education workers will walk off the job Monday if a deal can't be reached. (CBC)\n\nContracts for all of the province's public school employees expired at the end of August, and the Progressive Conservative government has been in tense labour negotiations with several unions.\n\nOne of the main sticking points in talks for an education workers' contract has been sick leave and absenteeism.\n\nWalton said school boards have tools to deal with absenteeism they suspect to be fraudulent. But, she said, workers' use of sick days or a short-term leave program that pays them for up to 120 days at 90 per cent salary is a \"symptom\" of larger problems facing education workers.\n\n\"When we talk about consistency in the classroom, I do think workloads and workplace violence have a lot to do with why folks are away,\" Walton said.\n\nShe herself had to take eight weeks off work after having her jaw broken in a school.\n\n\"Without that short-term leave program, I would not have been able to provide for my family,\" she said Friday.\n\nAfter talks resume Friday afternoon, bargaining is expected to continue through the weekend.", "description": "The Ontario government and the union representing tens of thousands of education workers will head back to the bargaining table Friday afternoon in an effort to prevent a strike and the closure of schools across the province.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5307722.1570185329!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cupe-school-support-staff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
