The Fed isn\u2019t making any promises", "language": "en", "text": "Getty Images Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell isn\u2019t saying what will happen next.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, the third such cut in three months. The fed funds futures market puts the probability at 94%.\n\nThat same financial futures market is attaching low odds (28%) to another cut in December, which seems to be the message \u2014three and done, at least for now \u2014 conveyed by Fed officials, starting at the top with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBut that message is not uniform nor without inconsistencies. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the glaring ones.\n\n1. Increased risks to the economy/the end is nigh\n\nThe minutes from the Sept. 17-18 meeting offer one example of the mixed message policy makers are sending.\n\nAccording to the minutes, \u201cdownside risks had become more pronounced since July,\u201d yet \u201cseveral participants\u201d wanted the Fed to provide more clarity on when the response to those risks, including \u201ctrade uncertainty,\u201d would end.\n\nTo summarize: the risks have increased, but it\u2019s time to provide some clarity on when rate cuts will end.\n\nThe one modestly positive development since the September meeting is an agreement between the U.S. and China on a partial trade deal, even though the two sides disagree on what exactly has been agreed to.\n\nChina committed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion of U.S. agricultural products \u2014 a priority for President Donald Trump \u2014and agreed to some vague technology protections while the U.S. delayed a tariff increase that was set to go into effect on Oct. 15.\n\nSome of the thornier issues, including China\u2019s intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer, have not been resolved.\n\nAnyone who thinks the announced Phase One of the U.S.-China trade deal is a done deal or a guarantee of a rollback of the multiple layers of tariffs that have been imposed in the past 18 months, I have a bridge to sell you. \u201cTrade uncertainty\u201d is still part of the risk equation.\n\nBesides, a temporary truce will not alleviate the damage that has been done to global manufacturing and commerce.\n\nIMF Trade uncertainty is certainly high.\n\nIn its World Economic Outlook published on Oct. 15, the International Monetary Fund warned of a \u201csynchronized slowdown,\u201d a result of rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions, that will reduce world economic growth to 3% this year, the slowest pace in a decade.\n\nIf the risks to global growth haven\u2019t vanished, then vigilance against those risks would seem to be appropriate. Why the urgency to attach an end date for addressing those ongoing risks?\n\n2. Three and done\n\nThe idea that three\u2019s a charm comes from none other than Powell, who frequently cites the 1995 and 1998 experiences. In both cases, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times in a mid-cycle adjustment that extended the life of the expansion.\n\n\u201cThe Fed cut, and then cut again, and then cut a third time,\u201d Powell said during a Q&A session at an economics conference in Denver earlier this month. \u201cThe economy took that accommodation on board and gathered steam again, and the expansion continued. So that\u2019s the spirit in which we\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n\nIt may take more than spirit this time.\n\nIf the U.S. economy is \u201cin a good place,\u201d as Fed officials are wont to say, and the rate cuts were a form of insurance, the Fed will have to sort out just how much insurance is necessary to offset the risks.\n\nGiven the long and variable lags with which monetary policy operates, the Fed can make an educated guess at the effectiveness of a 75-basis-point insurance policy, but no one really knows for sure if it\u2019s adequate.\n\nWhich is why keeping its options open makes more sense for the Fed than closing the door.\n\n3. No preset course = no end date\n\nIn an Oct. 18 speech at a conference in Boston, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida outlined some key principles in his approach to monetary policy.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy is not on a preset course, and the committee will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to assess the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, and it will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2% objective, Clarida said.\n\nThose views, along with emphasizing the Fed\u2019s data dependency, have been echoed by Powell and New York Fed President John Williams as well.\n\nTo recap: No preset course, data dependent, meeting-by-meeting basis to determine what\u2019s necessary to sustain growth and raise inflation to the 2% target.\n\nThat open-ended framework pretty much contradicts the idea of providing an end date to the easing cycle.\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that the Federal Open Market Committee consists of seven governors in Washington (there are currently two open seats) and presidents of the 12 district banks, each with its own research staff. It\u2019s understandable how views on the economy and the policy outlook may differ.\n\nThose differences manifest themselves in the message transmitted to markets through speeches, interviews and the quarterly \u201cdot plot,\u201d which reveals policy makers\u2019 estimates for the appropriate target for the funds rate.\n\nThose estimates are based on forecasts of how the economy will perform.\n\nAt the September meeting, only seven of the 17 participants penciled in an additional rate cut this year. Two bank presidents preferred to hold rates steady while one dissented in favor of a 50-basis-point cut.\n\nRecent comments from Fed officials suggest that most favor a wait-and-see approach after a third cut, with the usual caveats that monetary policy is not on a preset course but is data dependent; a preference for assessing the effects of past rate cuts before implementing additional ones; and a pledge to act as appropriate to sustain growth.\n\nAnd of course, they must convey their message without doing anything to upset financial markets.\n\nIt has become standard operating procedure in recent decades for central banks to communicate policy intentions clearly so that financial markets can incorporate interest-rate expectations into market prices.\n\nBut there\u2019s an inherent contradiction in that strategy as well, succinctly expressed by Former Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer at a conference in Hong Kong in 2013.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect the Fed to spell out what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cWhy? Because it doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll be doing a year from now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to try and get too precise.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably the best guidance a central banker could give. Just don\u2019t expect any of them to adopt it anytime soon.", "description": "The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the third time, and then take a wait-and-see attitude.", "authors": ["Caroline Baum"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG082_jay_po_ZG_20190321070916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
