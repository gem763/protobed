Analysts are forecasting a 3.1% decline in earnings for the third quarter from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, and that could mark a recent low point in year-over-year quarterly changes.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 128 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.16 billion shares, compared to the roughly 7 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Nick Zieminski and Tom Brown)", "description": "U.S. stocks rose on Thursday on hopes that top-level U.S.-China trade talks would yield at least a partial deal, while a jump in Apple's shares also boosted the market.
