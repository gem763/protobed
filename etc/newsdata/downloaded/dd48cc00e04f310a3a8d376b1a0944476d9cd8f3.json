Biden, or they\u2019re intentionally trying to take him out.\n\nMr. Biden has been a weak candidate from the outset. While the comparatively moderate career politician appeared to be perfectly positioned when he stepped into the race for the Democratic Party nomination in April, a slew of other contenders were running hard left, promising free everything for everybody. That left the middle uncontested for Mr. Biden.\n\nSince then, though, the \u201cinevitable\u201d nominee has blundered his way back into the pack.\n\nThe former vice president is still at or near the top of most polls, but few Democrats are jazzed up for Joe (but then, it\u2019s hard to imagine voters getting excited about any of the others in the whole sad pack of wannabes).\n\nStill, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is rising fast in the polls, and Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled in $25 million last quarter, putting him atop the pile. The race is changing fast.\n\nThe way the Trump-Ukraine scandal has played out so far has certainly appeared to favor Mr. Trump (some conspiracy theorists speculate that the master troller set up the entire thing).\n\nRemember: Originally, the allegations were that Mr. Trump demanded at least eight times in a phone call that Ukraine investigate the business dealings of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump released the transcript of the call, it turned out there was just one time that the president asked for \u201ca favor.\u201d\n\nBut by then, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all the other top Democrats had already decided to move forward with an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs the smoke clears around Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden is left standing in the crosshairs. And this fact has emerged: Hunter Biden made hundreds of thousands of dollars through his employment with Burisma, the largest private gas company in Ukraine \u2014 despite having no known qualifications for the job. And when word spread that a prosecutor was looking into the matter, then-Vice President Biden demanded that the prosecutor be fired. That\u2019s a fact.\n\nMore, Mr. Biden is on tape discussing his push for the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, bragging he had threatened to withhold $1 billion until Mr. Shokin was canned. \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u201d he says he told Ukrainian leaders. \u201cWell son of a bitch, he got fired,\u201d Mr. Biden says with a smile in the video clip.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Mr. Trump is accused \u2014 accused, mind you \u2014 of doing. Weeks before Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump put on hold $391 million in aid. He says he did so to pressure other nations to contribute more money and to take time to examine programs. Democrats, though, say it was a clear quid pro quo: Dig up some dirt on Mr. Biden and his son, or no money.\n\nBut The New York Times\u2019 Kenneth Vogel posted an interesting statement on Twitter last week in the midst of the mess. \u201cThe Ukrainians weren\u2019t made aware that the assistance was being delayed/reviewed until more than one month after the call,\u201d he wrote. So, no quid pro quo.\n\nWorse, a photo emerged Monday showing Mr. Biden and his son playing golf with executives from Burisma. Not good.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly too early to tell whether Mr. Trump will emerge unscathed from yet another scandal, but regardless of his fate, Mr. Biden\u2019s star is greatly dimmed. And while House Democrats will get in lockstep to vote to impeach Mr. Trump, the Senate will be a whole different kettle of fish.\n\nDuring the trial of the president, Republicans will target Mr. Biden and his son nonstop. It\u2019s highly unlikely 22 Republicans will join Democrats to vote to convict, but Mr. Biden will be heavily damaged.\n\nThat may have all been part of Mr. Trump\u2019s master plan. He knew the transcript didn\u2019t show a quid pro quo, and the whistleblower complaint, now also public, doesn\u2019t amount to much, either.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, Democrats knew that this scandal would also take out Mr. Biden. If they did, they could well be right. Even better, if Mr. Biden gets crushed in the playout of the Ukraine scandal, they\u2019ll have no blood on their hands.\n\nFormer Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli said Tuesday that the Ukraine allegations will hurt Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine a Democratic primary electorate witnessing this spectacle of $50,000 a month to Hunter Biden, the contradictory information about whether there was consultation with him and his father, the rather unseemly view of this, that the Democratic primary electorate is going to decide this is our guy,\u201d said the former senator from New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe Torch\u201d wasn\u2019t right about much when he was in the Senate, but he could well be spot on with this prediction.\n\n\u2981 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
