Its population is small (around 18,000 people), its temperatures are frigid, and its location is remote (145 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle).\n\nMore troubling still, the Swedish town is sinking.\n\nAs the home of the world's largest iron mine, Kiruna has a long history of digging below ground. Over time, iron excavations have caused the ground to unsettle, jeopardizing the safety of homes, businesses, and historic buildings.\n\nRead more: Architects designed a skyscraper made entirely of plastic. It's inspired by the Tower of Babel.\n\nBut locals remain determined to preserve the history and economy of their beloved hometown.\n\nIn 2004, Kiruna came up with a R15 billion plan to move itself a couple miles east, onto more stable territory.\n\nNearly a decade and a half later, the town finally unveiled the first of its new buildings - a gold-flecked town hall and community center known as \"The Crystal.\"\n\nTake a look at its design:\n\nKiruna hopes to construct more than 3,000 residential buildings, with The Crystal symbolizing what's to come.\n\nUpcoming projects include a library and swimming pool.\n\nThe structure was designed by the Danish architectural firm Henning Larsen, which drew inspiration from the old town hall.\n\nThe old town hall, known as the \"Igloo,\" was inaugurated in 1963. A year later, it won the Kasper Salin Prize for Sweden's most beautiful public building.\n\nThe Crystal preserves the town's existing bell tower.\n\nThe Swedish mining company Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) is offering to buy properties at market rate plus 25% or outfit owners with a new property that's further east.\n\nOnly a few historic structures, such as the beloved church, will be lifted from their current position by trucks and cranes and transported two miles over.\n\nRibbon windows on the exterior are designed to maximize daylight.\n\nKiruna receives very little sunlight in the winter, with residents experiencing near-total darkness in December.\n\nAs its name suggests, the building's interior is shaped like a crystal.\n\nThe golden walls are a nod to iron ore, which can have a bright yellow hue.\n\nThe center includes meeting rooms, offices, and a council chamber.\n\nThe moving process will likely last until 2040, although some shop-owners expect to move their stores in the next few years.\n\nIt also includes facilities that showcase local art.\n\nThe building's exhibitions will feature S\u00e1mi arts and handicrafts, which are native to the region.\n\nThe town's old structures await one of two fates: they'll either be totally demolished or transported to new territory.\n\nIn a state-sponsored video, one owner shared her excitement about the project.\n\n\"In the city we live in now, we are kind of isolated on separate sides,\" she said. \"I think this will be a major improvement.\"\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Kiruna will construct around 3,000 new residences by 2040, beginning with a new town hall called \"The Crystal\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9004/f359a12863a1455c873d7fafc55f11ec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-15"}
