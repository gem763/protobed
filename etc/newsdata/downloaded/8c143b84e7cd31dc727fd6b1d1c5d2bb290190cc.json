A new study from Princeton University shows internet-connected TVs, which allow people to stream Netflix and Hulu, are loaded with data-hungry trackers.\n\n\u201cIf you use a device such as Roku and Amazon Fire TV, there are numerous companies that can build up a fairly comprehensive picture of what you\u2019re watching,\u201d Arvind Narayanan, associate professor of computer science at Princeton, wrote in an email to The Verge. \u201cThere\u2019s very little oversight or awareness of their practices, including where that data is being sold.\u201d\n\nOf course, data is part of the reason TVs have gotten so cheap. Today, Roku\u2019s sell for less than $200, subsidized in part by targeted advertising. Technically, people agree to have their data sold when they set up their devices. But many aren\u2019t aware it\u2019s even happening.\n\nTechnically, people agree to have their data sold when they set up their devices\n\nThat\u2019s true for other smart home technology, too. In a different study, researchers at Northeastern University looked at 81 smart home devices and found that some, including Amazon\u2019s Ring doorbell and Alexa, and the Zmodo doorbell, monitor when a user talks or moves, even when they\u2019re not using the device. \u201cThe app used to set up the [Ring] device does not warn the user that the doorbell performs such recording in real time, the doorbell offers no indication that recording is occurring, and the only disclosure is in fine print as part of the privacy policy,\u201d the paper says.\n\nTo understand how much surveillance is taking place on smart TVs, Narayanan and his co-author Hooman Mohajeri Moghaddam built a bot that automatically installed thousands of channels on their Roku and Amazon Fire TVs. It then mimicked human behavior by browsing and watching videos. As soon as it ran into an ad, it would track what data was being collected behind the scenes.\n\nSome of the information, like device type, city, and state, is hardly unique to one user. But other data, like the device serial number, Wi-Fi network, and advertising ID, could be used to pinpoint an individual. \u201cThis gives them a more complete picture of who you are,\u201d said Moghaddam. He noted that some channels even sent unencrypted email addresses and video titles to the trackers.\n\nThe study found trackers on 69 percent of Roku channels and 89 percent of Amazon Fire channels\n\nIn total, the study found trackers on 69 percent of Roku channels and 89 percent of Amazon Fire channels. \u201cSome of these are well known, such as Google, while many others are relatively obscure companies that most of us have never heard of,\u201d Narayanan said. Google\u2019s ad service DoubleClick was found on 97 percent of Roku channels.\n\n\u201cLike other publishers, smart TV app developers can use Google\u2019s ad services to show ads against their content, and we\u2019ve helped design industry guidelines for this that enable a privacy-safe experience for users,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement emailed to The Verge. \u201cDepending on the user\u2019s preferences, the developer may share data with Google that\u2019s similar to data used for ads in mobile apps or on the web.\u201d\n\nBoth Roku and Amazon Fire allow users to turn off targeted advertising. But doing so only stops a user\u2019s advertising ID from being tracked \u2014 not the other uniquely identifiable information.\n\n\u201cBetter privacy controls would certainly help, but they are ultimately band-aids,\u201d Narayanan said. \u201cThe business model of targeted advertising on TVs is incompatible with privacy, and we need to confront that reality. To maximize revenue, platforms based on ad targeting will likely turn to data mining and algorithmic personalization/persuasion to keep people glued to the screen as long as possible.\u201d", "description": "Roku and Amazon Fire TVs are guilty of the same level of surveillance as other smart home devices.
