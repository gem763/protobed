Kamala Harris (D-CA) attended a criminal justice forum at Benedict College after pledging to boycott the event the day before due to President Trump\u2019s keynote address at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, where he was awarded the Bipartisan Justice Award.\n\nHarris announced on Friday that she would skip the event and hold her own criminal justice roundtable due to the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center\u2019s recognition of Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Harris expressed her disgust with Trump\u2019s recognition, citing his purported \u201cdecades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures, and racist behavior that puts people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d\n\nHowever, her national spokesman Ian Sams confirmed on Saturday that the presidential hopeful would participate in the forum after Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin (D) released a statement, assuring candidates that the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center had nothing to do with the event.\n\n\u201cI am excited to welcome presidential candidates to a criminal justice forum dialogue which will allow Benedict College students and the wider community to have full participation,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear that the Candidate Forums are hosted by myself and Benedict College. This portion of the weekend is not a 20/20 Presidential Justice Center event,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBecause of Kamala\u2019s protest, the sponsor that awarded Trump has been completely removed from this event and it\u2019s been opened up to HBCU student participation,\u201d Sams announced.\n\n\u201cShe led, and she got results. She will now participate in Mayor Benjamin\u2019s forum at Benedict today,\u201d he added:\n\nUPDATE >> Because of Kamala\u2019s protest, the sponsor that awarded Trump has been completely removed from this event and it\u2019s been opened up to HBCU student participation.

And they are advertising @KamalaHarris as a participant. This contradicts @SteveBenjaminSC, @BenedictEDU and other campaigns. Grab your popcorn, folks. \ud83c\udf7f pic.twitter.com/dkrQtmeSyq \u2014 Meg Kinnard (@MegKinnardAP) October 26, 2019\n\nAnd there it is: @the2020club, claiming they are still sponsoring forum, tweets @KamalaHarris speaking at 'their' event. She agreed to speak after 20/20 was removed as the event sponsor. It will be very interesting to see how the Harris campaign responds.\ud83c\udf7fhttps://t.co/LvpcuvHaB0 \u2014 Meg Kinnard (@MegKinnardAP) October 26, 2019\n\nMORE: Mayor @SteveBenjaminSC \u2013 also a trustee of @BenedictEDU \u2013 disputes the claims by @the2020club. \"This is not a 20/20 event, \" he just told me. He says the group is still doing their own panels but not candidate part. Says 20/20 signs will be replaced w/ Benedict signs. \u2014 Meg Kinnard (@MegKinnardAP) October 26, 2019\n\n\u201cThe only external evidence of sponsorship was a typed note on one of the doors advising attendees that entering the area meant they could be photographed or filmed for \u20182020 Bipartisan Justice Center marketing material,'\u201d the Washington Post reported.", "description": "Sen.
