A late July survey \u2014 conducted by Trump\u2019s own pollster \u2014 showed the president losing to Biden, and another in August reported a tie. In Arizona\u2019s closely-watched 2020 U.S. Senate race, two of those polls show GOP Sen. Martha McSally in a tie and a third shows her trailing Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are very concerned,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, once a top aide to Republican Govs. Fife Symington and Jane Hull. \u201cThe ground is shifting.\u201d\n\nThe change has been gradually building for years as more Latinos, who tend to vote Democratic, have registered and voted in larger numbers.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
