Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine should be as far-reaching and aggressive as the Russia probe that targeted President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden said everybody\u2019s looked at this and found nothing. Who is everybody? Nobody has looked at the Ukraine and the Bidens,\u201d Mr. Graham said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is enough smoke here,\u201d he said. \u201cWas there a relationship between the vice president\u2019s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don\u2019t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it and I don\u2019t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham said the investigation should extend to Ukraine\u2019s possible involvement in the 2016 election, including leaking information that discredited Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and contributed to his conviction for tax and bank fraud as a result of the Russia probe.\n\nThe senator accused the news media of handling Mr. Biden and the corruption allegations with kid gloves.\n\nMost news outlets have focused on Mr. Trump after a report last week that a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower alleged misconduct by Mr. Trump for a July phone call with the country\u2019s president. Mr. Trump allegedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who has served on the board of a Ukraine gas company since 2014 when his father was vice president.\n\nThe potential corruption stems from Mr. Biden\u2019s actions in March 2016, when he was vice president and visiting Kiev. He threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if the nation\u2019s leaders did not fire Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor.\n\nMr. Biden said the prosecutor was \u201cturning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite.\u201d But the prosecutor also was investigating Ukraine gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a high-paying seat on the board.\n\nThe prosecutor was fired soon after Mr. Biden\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if this was the Trump family doing business like this,\u201d said Mr. Graham. \u201cI like Joe Biden. I like him a lot. But you can\u2019t have it both ways here.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
