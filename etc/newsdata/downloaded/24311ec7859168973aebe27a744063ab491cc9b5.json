Mandatory Credit: Terrence Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWide receiver Antonio Brown has been an early bird all week at New England\u2019s facilities and will practice for the first time with the Patriots on Wednesday, NFL Network reported Tuesday.\n\nThe recently signed free agent arrived before 7 a.m. ET on Monday and Tuesday, per the report, but coach Bill Belichick said that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he will play Sunday at Miami.\n\n\u201cTake it day by day,\u201d Belichick told NBC Sports Boston on Tuesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t practiced yet. We\u2019re going through information with him like we would any new player. Get out on the practice field and after Wednesday we\u2019ll talk about Thursday and see how it goes.\u201d\n\nThe Oakland Raiders released the disgruntled All-Pro wideout Saturday and he officially signed with the Patriots on Monday.\n\nBrown, 31, inked a reported one-year, $15 million deal that includes a $9 million signing bonus and a $20 million team option for 2020.\n\nAfter bailing on the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2018 regular-season finale and sitting out Week 1 this year, Brown could pay for the first time since Dec. 23 if he faces the Dolphins.\n\nBelichick downplayed Brown\u2019s past, responding to a question about Brown being a disruption with a name from the past that worked out pretty well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing you (the media) said about Randy Moss when we brought him in,\u201d Belichick said Tuesday.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Wide receiver Antonio Brown has been an early bird all week at New England's facilities and will practice for the first time with the Patriots on Wednesday, NFL Network reported Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428389094&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891MU-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
