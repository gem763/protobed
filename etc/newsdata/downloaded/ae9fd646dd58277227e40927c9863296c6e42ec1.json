Investing too conservatively when you're young may leave you financially vulnerable in the future.\n\nMany employers offer 401(k) and 403(b) plans (some with matching contributions). So it can be easier to get started.\n\nYour 20s and 30s are generally the ideal time to consider investing in stocks and other higher-risk investments via your employer's 401(k) or other retirement plan. Here's why:\n\n1. Time is on your side.\n\nStocks have historically generated strong returns over long periods.2 What's more, time can be on your side based on historical returns. This means that the earlier you invest the more time you have to potentially see the benefits.\n\n\"If you're young, you might not need that money for 30 or more years, so it may benefit you to stay invested in the market,\" Payne says. \"Stocks have historically done well over periods that long.\"\n\n2. Inflation can still put \"safe\" at risk.\n\nInflation is the general increase in prices over time. Even if the dollar value of money in savings accounts never declines, it doesn't mean your money is safe.\n\nInflation erodes the purchasing power of that money as time passes \u2014 sometimes more powerfully than a market decline. At a historically average 3% inflation rate, the value of a dollar you save today will be cut in half in 24 years.\n\nEven accounts that pay a fixed interest rate may lose ground after inflation. Stocks, on the other hand, historically have outpaced inflation \u2014 sometimes by a wide margin.3\n\n3. You can get help.\n\nA financial professional can help educate you on investment risk, so you can make more confident decisions about investing in a retirement plan. If you're worried about picking the \"right\" investments, one possibility may be a target date fund (if your organization offers one).\n\nTarget date portfolios are managed toward a specific date, which may be the date you plan to retire and expect to withdraw the money. As the portfolio approaches its target date, the investment mix becomes typically more conservative.4\n\nIf you want to retire earlier or later than average, you may want to consider an investment option with an asset allocation more appropriate to your situation.\n\nLike financial independence, but FIRE leaves you cold?\n\nFollowers of the FIRE lifestyle (financial independence, retire early) live ultra-frugally with the goal of retiring as early as their 30s or 40s. But FIRE isn't for everyone.\n\nIsak Knivsland, a 24-year-old user experience designer from Des Moines, Iowa, sees the FIRE community as a benchmark. \"FIRE sites and message boards give tips and information on saving and spending,\" Knivsland says. \"But FIRE also incentivizes some weird mindsets. Focusing on financial independence is important, but you just need to find balance.\"\n\nWhat's Knivsland's approach to financial independence and investing? A well-stocked emergency fund. \"With a full year's worth of fixed expenses, I'm far more comfortable taking investment risk with the money that I set aside for retirement and investing,\" he says.\n\nKnow your goal and take the next step\n\nInvesting aggressively is more than just choosing the right mix of investments. Know what you're investing for and if you're setting enough aside.\n\n\"You can't guarantee a certain return, but you do have control over the amount you save,\" Payne says. \"Set a realistic savings goal and stick with it.\"\n\nHave a retirement account from your employer with service at Principal?

Shares or unit values will fluctuate, and investments, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. It's possible for any investment option to lose value.\n\n4 Neither asset allocation nor diversification can assure a profit or protect against a loss in down markets.
