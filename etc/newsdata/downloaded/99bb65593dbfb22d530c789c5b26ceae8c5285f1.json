We don't care about your colour. We have to act. We look at the facts, and the facts from the statements obtained suggest there is a case to answer to.\"\n\nREAD: \u2018I was a fan\u2019, says man who alleges assault, racial abuse by Etzebeth\n\nJones said the SAHRC had also obtained and reviewed video footage, claiming this was not the first time Etzebeth had engaged in such conduct.\n\n\n\n\"He always got away with it. But this time around, it stops here,\" he added to thunderous applause.\n\nGroenewald said Jones' statement in Langebaan was \"extremely premature and biased\".\n\n\n\n\"The [SAHRC] is supposed to do its work without prejudice, as Jones rightly pointed out, and yet Jones said that the [SAHRC] wants to use Etzetbeth to set a so-called example, thus, the [SAHRC] has already found him guilty without giving him an opportunity to defend himself.\"\n\n\n\n'It is completely untrue'\n\nGroenewald said his party condemned all forms of racism, but that it expected a \"more responsible approach\" by the SAHRC, as protector of the human rights of all in South Africa.\n\n\"A person is supposed to be considered innocent until proven otherwise, and not the other way around.\"\n\n\n\nEtzebeth has responded to the allegations on his Facebook page.\n\n\n\nHe said: \"It is completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan as has been reported on social media. Multiple witnesses can corroborate that.\n\n\n\n\"I am and will always strive to be a true ambassador to this beautiful rainbow nation and the sport that I love.\"\n\n* Compiled by Jenni Evans", "description": "The Freedom Front Plus feels the Eben Etzebeth allegations are being treated with undue haste.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5231/59a9b5422182452a808c34e731a9b324.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
