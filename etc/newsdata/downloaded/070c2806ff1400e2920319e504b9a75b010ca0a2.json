The Federal Reserve has twice since July to cope with the negative impact of the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nCiting these headwinds, Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: ) signaled lower net interest income at the Barclays conference in September.\n\nAcross large U.S. banks, analysts\u2019 average 2020 earnings-per-share estimates have dropped 9% since the start of the year, according to Autonomous Research, cited by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nInvestor sentiment toward banking stocks is also reflecting similar uncertainty. Financial-company stocks in the are up about 4.6% over the past year, compared with a 7.3% jump in the broader index.\n\nIn the coming week, investors will be looking for trouble spots as the biggest U.S. banks start reporting. In this domain, we\u2019re focusing on the following two big names for possible buying opportunities after their earnings reports:\n\n1. Citigroup\n\nCitigroup is one of our favorite stocks to consider if you plan to have some exposure to the banking sector. The lender has consistently shown that it can keep costs down and is capable of quickly adjusting to the changing market conditions.\n\n\n\nWhen the lender reported its in July, it cut costs deeper than analysts expected, while its consumer division posted its strongest second quarter since 2013. Expenses fell 2%, also lower than what analysts had predicted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiti price chart\n\n2. JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThis strength is being reflected in Citigroup's (NYSE: ) shares, which have jumped about 35% this year \u2014 more than double the gains of the Index, which gained 15% in the same period. The stock rose more than 2% on Friday to close at $70.10.The lender is scheduled to report on Tuesday and is expected to post $1.95 a share profit on revenue of $18.52 billion, according to analysts\u2019 consensus estimate.\n\nWall Street\u2019s powerhouse commercial and investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. is another stock to watch closely when it releases its on Tuesday. Analysts on average expect $2.45 a share profit on sales of $28.46 billion.\n\nDriven by strong loan growth and robust business in the lender\u2019s flagship investment banking division, last year proved to be a great year for JPMorgan. The bank posted record net income\u2014even when you take out the benefits of U.S. tax reforms.\n\nThe story is also quite encouraging in the first two quarters of this year. In Q2, JPM\u2019s profit rose 16%, with the strong performance of its consumer businesses mainly offsetting a slowdown in the bank\u2019s other units.\n\nJPM price chart\n\nThis earnings momentum has kept JPM shares well-supported this year. Trading at $116.14 at Friday's close, its stock is up almost 20% this year, against the 15% gain in the benchmark index.\n\nChief Executive James Dimon told analysts in the last conference call that the Fed\u2019s rate cuts wouldn\u2019t affect the bank\u2019s expansion plans, including branch openings and technology spending \u2014 two areas which are likely to keep the lender\u2019s spending higher.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDue to their strong global presence, both Citi and JPMorgan are well-positioned to benefit if the U.S. and China are successful in ending their trade war and improving the global growth outlook. Both stocks are good buy-on-the-dip candidates even if their earnings tomorrow disappoint and trigger short-term weakness.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: S&P 500, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Company.
