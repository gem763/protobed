The key is to train your brain to not be overly critical of your mistakes, he and Schull said.\n\n\"So many of us are concerned about being wrong when it's just a part of the job,\" said Schull, who founded the ReThink Group and has been said to be the model that \"Billions\" character Wendy Rhodes is based off of (a lawsuit Schull filed earlier this year against Showtime and the show's creators was thrown out).\n\nManagers might need to learn these lessons quickly after the whiplash caused by momentum's slide and oil's rise over the last two weeks. Investors and managers have told Business Insider that they need to stick to their guns, and trust in their strategy in times like these.\n\nSee more: Hedge funds are getting whacked in an 'unheard of' stock-market shift \u2014 and a leaked Morgan Stanley memo warns of possible pain for months\n\nBacker, who helps manage Lockheed Martin's $72 billion corporate pension and was a client of Schull's, pressed attendees to not be afraid to cut losses early, while also being willing to buy back in at a higher price if your intuition was wrong.\n\n\"It's not about making mistakes, it's about catching them before they kill you,\" he said.\n\nWhat lets Backer think like this, Schull said, is the fact he is now \"inoculated against being wrong.\" Schull and Valiante said that the brain should shift from punishing mistakes to learning from mistakes.\n\nFear, the two performance coaches said, is not always the best motivating factor.\n\n\"Everyone is too self-critical,\" Schull said.\n\nSee more: Billionaire Leon Cooperman says the rise of passive investing 'scares the hell' out of him because it's left the market vulnerable to sharp, unpredictable sell-offs", "description": "Dr. Gio Valiante and Denise Schull, two performance coaches well-known in the hedge fund world, say investors struggle to learn from their mistakes.", "authors": ["Bradley Saacks"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84ea5c2e22af00ca02a6e9-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
