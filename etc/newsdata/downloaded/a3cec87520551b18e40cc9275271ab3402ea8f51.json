And the Supreme Court issued an order allowing for a new rule that effectively denies asylum protections for refugees arriving through a third country \u2014 a victory for executive authority when that authority is in the worst possible hands.\n\nCritics of this column will almost certainly complain that the United States can\u2019t possibly take everyone in \u2014 a dishonest argument since hardly anyone argues for taking in \u201ceveryone,\u201d and a foolish argument since America will almost inevitably decline without a healthy intake of immigrants to make up for a falling birthrate.\n\nCritics will also claim that \u201cvery bad people,\u201d as Donald Trump likes to say, might take advantage of a generous asylum and refugee policy. Here again I\u2019m aware of nobody advocating a \u201clet-the-terrorists-come-too\u201d immigration policy. Only a person incapable of kindness \u2014 a person like the president \u2014 can think that kindness and vigilance are incompatible, or that generosity is for suckers.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bret Stephens", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Refugees-Trump-America.Html"], "top_image": ""}
