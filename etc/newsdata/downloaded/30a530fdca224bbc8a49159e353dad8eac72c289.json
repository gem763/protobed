(Photo: Luca Bruno, AP)\n\nMILAN \u2013 Milan\u2019s mayor appealed Sunday to U.S. authorities to apologize for a World War II bombing raid that killed 184 elementary school children.\n\nMayor Giuseppe Sala made the request following a Mass marking the 75th anniversary of the Gorla massacre, named for the quarter in the city that was struck, the news agency ANSA reported.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s necessary that the American government apologizes, knowing that we are here to forgive,\u201d Sala said, adding that he would formalize the request with the U.S. consul in Milan this week.\n\nThe air raid on Oct. 20, 1944, targeted an industrial complex near the city, but a second wave of bombers went off course and released their bombs southeast of the target to lighten their loads as they returned to base.\n\nOne bomb struck the Francesco Crispi elementary school as children raced for shelter.\n\n\u201cIt was a very serious error resulting, as history tells us, from an incredible superficiality and inexperience,\u201d Sala said.\n\nThe bronze ossuary monument entitled 'Ecco La Guerra', (Here is War) dedicated to the 'Little Martyrs of Gorla', in memory of a World War II bombing raid on Oct. 20 1944 is pictured in Milan, Italy, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.
