By a seven to two margin, the justices agreed that the rule, which essentially acts as a safe third country agreement (without Mexico\u2019s participation) could remain in effect while the case continued through the appeals process.\n\nThe two dissenting justices were Sotomayor and Ginsburg, with the former writing the dissent. As Newsweek points out, Sotomayor was rather blunt in her objections, but I can\u2019t help wondering precisely what it was she was objecting to.\n\n\u201cOnce again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissenting opinion. \u201cAlthough this Nation has long kept its doors open to refugees \u2014 and although the stakes for asylum seekers could not be higher \u2014 the Government implemented its rule without first providing the public notice and inviting the public input generally required by law.\u201d Sotomayor also slammed the Trump administration for requesting the Supreme Court to allow the rule when lower courts ruled against the move. \u201cUnfortunately, it appears the Government has treated this exceptional mechanism as a new normal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHistorically, the Government has made this kind of request rarely; now it does so reflexively.\u201d \u201cThis is an extraordinary request,\u201d Sotomayor continued. \u201cUnfortunately, the Court acquiesces. Because I do not believe the Government has met its weighty burden for such relief, I would deny the stay.\u201d\n\nOkay, I suppose that qualifies as \u201cscathing,\u201d at least in terms of normal SCOTUS language. But what is Sotomayor actually objecting to? Her comments about the Trump administration rushing the rule through without having a period for public comment speak to normal practices. But the President has declared an emergency on the southern border, so some of the usual rules won\u2019t apply. (And how often do the words \u201cnormal\u201d and Donald Trump collide in the same sentence anyway?) The point is, she cast her vote based, in part, on tradition rather than law.\n\nHer other objection was in response to the fact that the White House asked the Supremes to let them jump to the head of the line and rule on this before the question had finished making its way through the lower courts where the policy had been blocked. As with the previous point, is she suggesting that the White House can\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) make such a request under the law? The fact is that such requests may come along infrequently, but it does happen. And the court has agreed to them in the past.\n\nWhile this may be a deviation from the normal course of judicial review (a point that CNN was screaming from the rooftops when I woke up this morning), it\u2019s also part of the accepted process when time is of the essence. Nobody forced them to take the case early. That was their decision, and seven justices apparently saw it the President\u2019s way. And let\u2019s not forget that they were reversing the Ninth Circuit once again. You could get the Ninth Circuit to ban Trump from eating breakfast if you wrote a mildly coherent brief.\n\nWith that bit of unpleasantness in the rearview mirror, I think the White House needs to clarify a few things about this new policy for us. One of the big questions involves what happens to people showing up at the border and requesting asylum without having applied for it in Mexico first. Previously they would have fallen under the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy while their case was heard, but now they\u2019ll just be disqualified. Can they then go back and ask Mexico for asylum or would they be immediately deported back to their home country? All of these changes are complicating the procedures that will have to be followed by border security officials. And it gives you the sense that mistakes will probably be made.", "description": "Over what isn't clear", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sotomayor-shrug.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
