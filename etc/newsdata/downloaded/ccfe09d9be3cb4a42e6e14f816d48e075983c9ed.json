Unfortunately, crowds were surging through its magnificent gardens, making it hard to contemplate. Nearby, Ryoan-ji temple, with its \u2018garden\u2019 of stone islands in a sea of raked gravel, was mesmerising \u2013 although the girls found the subsequent ride on Kyoto\u2019s last streetcar more exciting.\n\nAlmost as much fun was lunch at a conveyor-belt sushi bar where they watched with wonder as tempting morsels of tuna maki and prawn tempura nigiri trundled by.\n\nWe had our fill for just \u00a313, for all of us, but Kura Sushi will be remembered for the near pile-up of plates when our salmon sashimi dish got stuck on the belt.\n\nOur trip had started in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, where Celebrity Millennium was moored alongside Osanbashi pier. Its undulating boardwalks proved the perfect place for the girls to burn off the 12 hours they had spent cooped up on the flight as we waited to board.\n\nInside, Celebrity Millennium exceeds all expectations, having undergone a refurbishment as part of a fleet-wide upgrade. All suites and staterooms have muted tones and the bathrooms have power showers.\n\nAn overnight stop in Kobe means that nearby cities such as Osaka, Kyoto (above) and Nara are easily accessible\n\nTRAVEL FACTS The 17-night Japanese Explorer fly/cruise on Celebrity Millennium departs November 7 and costs from \u00a33,334pp in an Oceanview Stateroom, including return flights from Heathrow.

The food was outstanding and, from a spoiling array of options (eight restaurants), the girls loved Qsine restaurant for the iPads as much as the popcorn chicken and \u2018disco shrimp\u2019, while we favoured the Tuscan Grille for its pastas and wine list.\n\nSushi On Five was the stand-out family favourite for its ramen and udon, gyoza dumplings and fresh sushi. Its chef had very likely been shopping in Shimizu Port in Shizuoka, our destination on day two, where Japan\u2019s largest tuna catch is landed.\n\nThere we joined a half-day excursion visiting a pine-fringed beach with views of Mount Fuji and an important shrine dedicated to shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\nThe crowded cable car there gave us a taste of Japanese commuter trains as we were squeezed in by a gloved attendant.\n\nThat afternoon, as fellow guests returned from their day trips to Hakone, the mountain town famous for its onsen (hot spring), we hopped into our own version, Millennium\u2019s outdoor hot tub.\n\nFor me, scenic cruising through the breathtaking Seto Inland Sea was a highlight; for Dad, wine tastings on board in Cellar Masters and a sake brewery tour in rural Shikoku; for the children, petting the tame deer on the island of Miyajima.\n\nAn overnight call in Kobe presented the options of Osaka, Kyoto and Nara, all close by, to which organised excursions were offered.\n\nHowever, as most involved long days, we headed off to Kyoto and the city of Himeji (famous for its castle), travelling on the 185mph \u2018Nozomi\u2019 Shinkansen, the fastest of Japan\u2019s bullet trains, which was a hit.\n\nMy lasting memory is of our daughters leaving their own origami paper crane at the Children\u2019s Peace Monument in Hiroshima, beneath the statue of a young atom bomb victim called Sadako.\n\nWe had read her story and learned Sadako had folded paper cranes \u2013 a Japanese symbol of peace and long life \u2013 while she was sick in hospital. When we arrived, our four-year-old seemed to sense the significance of the place. It was a special moment and a reminder that travelling with children can enrich everyone.", "description": "The 14-night Japan Explorer cruise sails during the Easter holidays and features an itinerary that includes Mount Fuji, Kobe, Kyoto and Hiroshima.", "authors": ["Kate Crockett For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/12/08/18354432-0-image-a-5_1568273826397.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
