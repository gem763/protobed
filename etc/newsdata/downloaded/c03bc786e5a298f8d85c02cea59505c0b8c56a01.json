Josh Robenstone\n\nKKR didn't respond to questions about the significance of two failed IPOs on their business model by deadline.\n\nJust last Tuesday, KKR and co-owners Varde Partners and Deutsche Bank iced the $3.2 billion Latitude Financial offering, which had been tipped as the year's largest IPO.\n\nBain Capital's Retail Zoo, which owns Betty's Burgers and Boost Juice, also ditched its plans to list on Tuesday.\n\nThat followed the decision to pull coal seam gas services business MPC Kinetic's initial public offering on October 10.\n\n\"Confidence is pretty fragile, and people are jumpy and IPOs always have a degree of uncertainty,\" said Yarra Capital's Dion Hershan.\n\nIFM Investors' investment director Melinda White said another factor at play was the growth of passive and quant funds increasing stock valuations, but active managers were the only buyer of new listings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The market multiples we are seeing now, overall, are reflective of all participants in the market \u2013 quant, passive and active,\" she said.\n\n\"But when you go to IPO, you are selling to a smaller subset of the market. You can't sell an IPO to an algorithm.\"\n\nIFM has bought shares in four floats in the past 18 months.\n\n\"Most active managers need a decent margin of safety to buy a stock ... when you buy an IPO, you want to know that it is going to go well post-float.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, investors are now asking whether hire equipment group OnSite Rentals, which is set to test demand with a bookbuild next Monday, and Funlab, which owns Strike Bowling and Sky Zone trampoline parks, will proceed.\n\nThe IPO market has been weak in Australia for at least two years, though this year is now shaping up as the weakest since 2009.\n\nTo date, just $500 million over eight floats has been raised for companies including tracking app Life360, which raised $145 million, non-bank lender Prospa, which failed at its first run at the boards, and Investec Australia Property Fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Never really taken off'\n\nLast year, $4.4 billion in fresh equity was raised over 11 deals. The largest were Coronado Coal and Viva Energy.\n\nIn 2017, some $1.95 billion was issued across 15 deals with a raise of more than $20 million each.\n\nMs Howitt said investors were still happy to support raisings for companies which they already owned, adding follow-on raisings had been robust, particularly in the property sector.\n\nPropertyGuru, which is an Asia-focused real estate listings business, had been seeking to raise $340 million to $380.2 million in a deal that would value it at $1.16 billion to $1.36 billion. That valued the company at more than nine times revenue.\n\nMs Howitt said the market tended to be sceptical about companies that wanted to list in Australia unless there was a clear reason for doing so. She added that local investors hadn't really been comfortable with buying unprofitable businesses.\n\n\"During normal periods, it's very hard to IPO an unprofitable company unless you have really clear line of site to profitability during the forecast period,\" she said. \"The model that was pioneered by Uber, Netflix of semi-permanent unprofitably ... has never really taken off in Australia.\"\n\n\"There were a few unprofitable tech companies that got away in this market, but they had a narrative around shifting to profitability in the near term.\"\n\nMs Howitt's fund has returned 13.87 per cent over 12 months, and 12.91 per cent in the past three years, after fees.", "description": "PropertyGuru's $1 billion Australian listing has become the third initial public offering in just over a week to be pulled at the eleventh hour.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9217%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_343%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/500e515d0dc1c129a7da4a84a77326e74c2a41b4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
