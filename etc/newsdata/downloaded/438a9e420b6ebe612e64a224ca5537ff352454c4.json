But after leaving the house feeling camera ready with her black and red extensions, Marian Scott came home feeling defeated.\n\n\u201cMarian had called from a friend of mine\u2019s phone who saw Marian walking down the hallway going to the office,\u201d Howard tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cShe cried and I told her that she did not do anything wrong.\u201d\n\nVideo: New California Law Bans Hairstyle Discrimination\n\nAccording to Howard, Marian was told by her principal that she wasn\u2019t allowed to get her photo taken. But Howard says that they should have communicated that with her and her fianc\u00e9, Doug Scott, first. Instead, Marian was sent back to her classroom and told that she could get her pictures done in November. Howard wrote on Facebook that she\u2019d be taking her money to purchase photos elsewhere.\n\n\u201dI see other kids with colored hair but since she\u2019s BLACK it\u2019s a problem,\u201d Howard wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cOh yea race has everything to do with this. This is one of there [sic] rules and it should of said for blacks only.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from National Heritage Academies, which operates Paragon Charter Academy, sent the following statement to Yahoo Lifestyle from the parent and student handbook. \u201cHair color must be of natural tones. Headbands must be solid white, navy, hunter green, or black. Students must be in school uniform for fall pictures and any re-takes. Students not in school uniform will not be allowed to have their pictures taken. We take great care to ensure our families are well-informed about this policy, and also work closely with students and their parents if there\u2019s a concern,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe understand the importance of good communication in helping strengthen the partnership we have with our families and will continue to make this a priority to create a school environment where everyone is valued and has their voice heard.\u201d\n\nWhile the school\u2019s handbook reads that \u201chairstyles must be conservative,\u201d Doris \u201cWendy\u201d Greene, J.D, a law professor at Drexel University and expert on grooming codes discrimination maintains that, based on Howard\u2019s observations, Marian may have been treated unfavorably because of her race.\n\n\u201cThis incident highlights the heightened level of scrutiny, regulation, and stigmatization that black children \u2014 and black girls in particular \u2014 endure at school when they do not don straightened hairstyles in black or brown,\u201d Greene writes to Yahoo Lifestyle via email. \u201cWhether a black child is barred from wearing a natural hairstyle or hair color, it is often a reflection of racial as well as color-based stereotypes and biases the decision-makers implicitly or explicitly hold concerning what is \u2018natural,\u2019 or \u2018normal,\u2019 and therefore \u2018acceptable\u2019 for black children.\u201d\n\nGreene goes onto explain that the language used in this particular dress code isn\u2019t unusual. In fact, children of color can often face this type of discrimination at school as a result of these regulations and the discretion used to enforce them.\n\n\u201cTeachers and school administrators regularly characterize natural hairstyles like locs, braids, twists, and afros, as well as humanly natural hair colors \u2014 other than black or brown\u2014 that African descendant children wear as \u2018extreme\u2019 and \u2018unnatural.\u2019 As a result, school officials often determine that black children\u2019s hair violates the school grooming policy prohibiting \u2018extreme\u2019 or \u2018unnatural\u2019 hairstyles,\u201d Green continues. \u201cSchools do not have a right to implement and enforce grooming policies based upon race. One of the central legal issues is whether the enactment and enforcement of these grooming policies constitutes unlawful race discrimination.\u201d\n\nNow, Howard tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she and Scott\u2019s next plan of action is to sit down with the school to address the issues that they have with the rule and the way in which it was enforced in this particular case.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately [Marian] will be impacted regardless of what we do or don\u2019t do,\u201d Howard says. \u201cSo we plan to love her and our other two children with everything inside of us.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A third grader in Michigan was pulled out of school pictures and put in the principal's office because of a hairstyle that the school deemed \"extreme.\"", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ThYIyRaMuSjxDCileGnThA--~B/aD01ODA7dz03MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1c819dc0-ec31-11e9-bfef-c63949ddecb1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
