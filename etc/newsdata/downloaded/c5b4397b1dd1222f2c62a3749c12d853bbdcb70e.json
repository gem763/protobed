Pressed in the Commons, the PM did not close the door to bringing back his deal.\n\nAnd there are those in government who are deeply wary of a winter election. Why? Bluntly, because it is so blooming cold.\n\nNo-one is going to thank him if they have to tramp off to the polling station in the bleak midwinter.\n\nThere's a fear that older voters would be the most likely not to turn up - yet those may be the ones who were keenest to back Brexit.\n\nThen there is the nativity play problem. Many school halls, which are used for polling stations, have been booked up for Christmas activities - and woe betide Mr Johnson if he forces those to be cancelled.\n\nWill a pre-Christmas election happen?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nEven if Mr Johnson does decide to press for an early election there is no guarantee he will succeed.\n\nUnder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister needs to have the backing of two-thirds of MPs to hold a snap poll. This has been rejected twice by MPs.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has said his party is ready to go to the country once it is sure Mr Johnson cannot \"crash out\" in a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a campaign.\n\nHowever, there is widespread opposition among the party's MPs at a time when they are trailing in the polls.\n\nWhile there are other potential routes to an election, such as Tories voting for a no-confidence motion in their own government - which would only require a simple majority of one - they are also fraught with difficulties.\n\nAnother route to an election is a one-line bill, that requires only a simple majority, but any such bill is likely to incur a host of amendments, for example, giving 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote.\n\nThere is also the option of a vote of no confidence in the government, which Mr Johnson could even call himself.\n\nBut Parliamentary rules state that if it passes, the Commons has 14 days to form an alternative administration, so he would run the risk of being forced out of Downing Street if opposition parties can unite around a different leader.\n\nIf an election were to be triggered this week, the earliest it could take place would be 28 November, as the law requires 25 days between an election being called in Parliament and polling day.\n\nMr Johnson was forced by law to send a letter to Brussels requesting a three-month extension, which he did on Saturday.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said he spoke to European Council President Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday and stressed to both his continued opposition to a delay.\n\nThe 27 EU ambassadors have had a first, informal discussion about a Brexit extension.\n\nThey all agreed on the need to extend the deadline, to avoid a no-deal outcome - but the duration of this possible extension remains under discussion.\n\nA decision by the EU is not expected until Friday.", "description": "There are reports of splits over whether to call for an election or focus on getting a deal approved.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AFB8/production/_109348944_mediaitem109348943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
