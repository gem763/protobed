Fundamentally, it is the Secretary of State's belief that adults should be given full freedom to decide how they want to live their lives and should not face barriers to doing so. When children are growing up, they are still developing those decision-making capabilities and there is a role to be played in protecting them and making sure that the implications of decisions are fully understood.'\n\nThe consultation, which has already received more than 100,000 responses from the public and involved 140 organisations, was designed to address complaints that there is currently a 'two-tier system' for transgender people.\n\nIt was designed to canvass opinion on reforms to the Gender Recognition Act, a 2004 law which allows for the changing of a legal gender on a person's birth certificate.\n\nTheresa May launched a public consultation last year on proposals to change the law so that people would be able to switch sex simply by making a declaration of their gender\n\nOver the past year, this newspaper has reported on a number of contentious cases involving transgenderism. They include Girl Guides leader Katie Alcock, who was expelled for objecting to the policy of allowing boys who identify as female to join the organisation.\n\nConcern had also been raised over the fact that biological males would be allowed to share accommodation, showers and toilets with girls during trips.\n\nMs Alcock said that as a feminist she believed that males cannot change their biological sex, and so they should not be admitted to a group created for females.\n\nWe also told how former NHS psychologist Dr Kirsty Entwistle claimed that children are being misdiagnosed as transgender cases. Their 'traumatic' experiences might explain why a misguided desire to swap sex are not being investigated by medics for fear of being labelled transphobic.\n\nOther vulnerable children being referred to Britain's only NHS gender clinic for under-18s include those with mental health problems, she claimed.\n\nLast year, 2,590 children were referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) to start the process of changing sex, a rise of more than 400 per cent since 2013. Ten of the children were aged three or four, and dozens more were of primary-school age.\n\nThe controversial clinic, run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, says it has become so overwhelmed by patients that it could be forced to set children on a path to a new sex on the basis of just a Skype phone call.", "description": "The move has been sanctioned by Equalities Minister Liz Truss (pictured) after The Mail on Sunday highlighted the rocketing numbers of under-18s starting the treatment.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19345072-0-image-a-39_1570314027414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
