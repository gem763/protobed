Fresh accusations about Mr Kavanaugh\u2019s conduct while a student at Yale University emerged only last week.\n\nMr Trump then used the rally to attack The New York Times, also known as the Grey Lady, which published the allegations.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation,\u201d Mr Trump said.\n\n\u201cShe can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management.\u201d\n\nThe president was heckled twice during the speech. The first interruption came shortly after the rally began.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s supporters booed the protester and the president used the disruption to attack the media.\n\n\u201cGood night to that person,\u201d he said as the protester was escorted out. \u201cTomorrow [the media] will say \u2018massive protests!\u2019\n\n\u201cOne person just going home to Mommy a little bit sooner.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech the president also claimed human traffickers were bringing women across the southern border and that his wall would stop them.\n\n\u201cThey traffic, really, for the most part \u2013 in women. They capture women and they bring them across the open borders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd they don\u2019t go through ports of entry.\u201d\n\nHowever, nearly 80 per cent of trafficking victims cross into countries through legal ports of entry, according to the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nMr Trump also became irritated as he swatted away a fly and then turned the interruption into an attack on lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nasty fly,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like those suckers! I don\u2019t know about you in New Mexico but I\u2019m not into flies or mosquitos. I don\u2019t like snakes too much \u2013 we have plenty of them in New York and Washington, a different variety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of snakes in Washington DC, we got a lot of snakes in New York!\u201d\n\nHe went on to repeat false claims about Democrats supporting \u201cextreme late term abortion\u201d before promising to \u201cfind new cures for childhood cancer\u201d and \u201cend the AIDS epidemic.\u201d\n\nBut only 1.3 per cent of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy in the US, according to the CDC, and Democrats have only supported such cases where it is a medical emergency.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nMr Trump also claimed he had \u201cmade much more money\u201d and \u201clived better\u201d than his opponents before becoming a politician.\n\n\u201cIf you go by the old standards \u2013 better houses, better schools, [I] made much more money. [I] lived better and then I decided to run for president.\u201d\n\nThe second protester heckled the 73-year-old at the end of the rally, leading him to complain about being interrupted during the \u201ccrescendo\u201d of his speech.\n\n\u201cGee, it\u2019s too bad \u2013 right in the crescendo. I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character\u2019s going back home,\u201d Mr Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two people tonight \u2013 remember when they say \u201cMassive protests at the Trump rally\u201d \u2013 two people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crowd chanted \u201cUSA!\u2019 as the second heckler was removed.\n\nNew Mexico is a Democratic leaning state though Republicans are hoping to flip it in 2020.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump falsely tells supporters Hispanics 'want a border wall'\n\nTrump may have dug himself into a hole with his Iran policy\n\nTrump lashes out at Kavanaugh accusers\n\nTrump's personal and corporate tax returns subpoenaed", "description": "Donald Trump was twice interrupted by protesters at a rally during which he criticised his opponents, discussed his plans to build a border wall and reiterated his support for Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court justice who has been accused of sexual harassment.The president went on to describe Brett", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FqpFIPPEM59sT2gRrT9qQw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/bbe59c2f26d967774a806f56372129b1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
