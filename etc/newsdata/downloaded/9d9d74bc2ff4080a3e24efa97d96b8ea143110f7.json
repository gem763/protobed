In recent years, that might have led teams around the league to bulk up and try to follow the Blues\u2018 lead - but that is unlikely.\n\nThe differences in recent champions - from fast and skilled to physical and punishing - illustrate how many different blueprints there are to win a championship in today\u2019s NHL. They also show the importance of tailoring style of play to personnel and perfecting team chemistry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different ways,\u201d Blues playoff MVP Ryan O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cMost of the players in the league, you\u2019re not going to change. You change little things and make adjustments, but you\u2019re not going to change the players that they are. So it\u2019s finding your group of players and getting them to play the most effective way.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, the Chicago Blackhawks and Pittsburgh Penguins won it all with speed, skill and talent. The Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals and Blues had plenty of skill, sure, but also used size to wear down opponents.\n\nIn a sport where whoever lifts the Cup tends to swing the pendulum on how to build a winner, it\u2019s become more of a race to see which team can impose its will come playoff time.\n\n\u201cEvery year is different,\u201d said Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask, who started in two finals and was the backup when Boston won the Cup in 2011. \u201cThe way you build your team, everybody needs to be comfortable with that. You can win many different ways as long as your team\u2019s comfortable playing that style of game.\u201d\n\nThe Blues under coach Craig Berube got comfortable playing a defense-first style predicated on taking the body and winning series by attrition. O\u2019Reilly concedes a lot has to go right to play that way.\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 Penguins battled attrition and overcame injuries to win the Cup. They weren\u2019t the biggest team by any means but had the ingredients to go toe to toe with anyone when it mattered most.\n\n\u201cPlayoffs is a whole different beast, and obviously there\u2019s more hitting,\u201d Chicago winger Alex DeBrincat said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re a skilled team, you\u2019re going to hit more.\u201d\n\nJonathan Marchessault, whose Vegas Golden Knights lost to the Capitals in the 2018 final, said it\u2019s important to \u201cstay true to the identity of your team\u201d - whatever that is. Yet there remains a notion that when the regular season ends and the playoffs begin, the NHL trend toward speed and skill ruling the ice is no longer the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different hockey,\u201d said Anze Kopitar, who won with the Kings in 2012 and 2014. \u201cIn order to get into the playoffs, you\u2019ve got to be fast and skilled and everything. Playoffs is a little bit different. You\u2019ve got to wear teams down, and that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s not as high-scoring as it is during the regular season. You still obviously have to have some grit and some hard-nosed guys that are willing to do that.\u201d\n\nPlayers talk about feeling like there\u2019s less room to maneuver in the playoffs, like the surface shrinks and each decision must be made a half-second quicker. That does put a premium on turning up the toughness level.\n\n\u201cEven if the game is going skill and finesse, generally speaking, speed, skill, if you ask anyone around the league, going into a rink where you know it\u2019s going to be a heavy style, there\u2019s an intimidation factor there,\u201d said Tom Wilson, who recorded 15 points, blocked 12 shots and dished out 100 hits during the Capitals\u2018 Cup run. \u201cThat\u2019s why hockey\u2019s great. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a physical sport. When you\u2019re playing a team and you know they\u2019re going to finish their checks, you know they\u2019re going to be heavy on the puck, you know they\u2019re going to battle, that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nBattling isn\u2019t just about the Kings, Capitals or Blues finishing thundering checks and separating opposing players from the puck. It\u2019s about gutting through injuries, winning races to the puck and dictating the tempo of the game to suit a certain style.\n\n\u201cYou always have to stick to what gives you success throughout a regular season,\u201d Krug said. \u201cWe play a certain way where we can match up against any style. If you want to play fast, we\u2019ll do it. You want to play heavy and in your face, we have the players that can do that as well, and we won\u2019t shy away from it.\u201d\n\nThe Blues\u2018 blueprint could help a team like Winnipeg lift the Cup. Maybe the Tampa Bay Lightning can take a page from the Penguins\u2019 playbook. Or perhaps the San Jose Sharks win with the depth on defense that earned the Blackhawks three championships in six years.\n\nBased on the variety of champions and the parity of the NHL , which will be the last team standing and how they do it is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\n\u201cThe fun part about the year we won and this year is that anyone can win,\u201d Capitals center Nicklas Backstrom said. \u201cEveryone can win, which is great.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Had the night of June 13 gone differently, maybe NHL rivals would be looking to the Boston Bruins as the model to follow to win the Stanley Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/championship_blueprint_hockey_70591_c0-39-3419-2032_s1770x1032.jpg?bf0074ff734f6940c8a5401c4bf58a2dd11f9d40", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
