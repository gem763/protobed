Posey's anti-vaxx questions to Zuckerberg pic.twitter.com/HXAeh79g6N \u2014 Jon Sarlin (@jonsarlin) October 23, 2019\n\nThis year, lawmakers and public health advocates have been pushing Facebook, as well as other top social media companies, to take stronger action against anti-vaccine content, arguing that the proliferation of medical misinformation has bolstered the \"anti-vax\" movement of people who choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children.\n\nHealth experts have attributed recent measles outbreaks in the U.S. to an increasing number of people not getting vaccinations, warning that the movement largely uses social media to promote their views.\n\nPosey also raised debunked concerns about the \"risks of vaccinations,\" and Zuckerberg replied that Facebook allows people to participate in \"anti-vax\" groups and conversations but does not direct users to those discussions.\n\nPosey has also discussed vaccines in the past, asking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015 to look into whether vaccines led to a higher rate of autism, a theory that has thoroughly been debunked by the scientific community.\n\nZuckerberg was appearing before the committee to testify about the proposed Libra cryptocurrency and what regulations it should face.", "description": "Rep.
