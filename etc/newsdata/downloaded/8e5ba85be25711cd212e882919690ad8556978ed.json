I'd been planning on getting my hair colored for months, but when the stylist said that my total would be $400, I knew that I had to get a good hair-care product to protect my investment.\n\nOne of the associates at Sephora was quick to point me in the direction of Living Proof Color Care Shampoo ($29) and Conditioner ($29), which she uses on her own hair as well.\n\nI had no idea what to expect, but I'm obsessed with its dry shampoo, so I had high hopes. After the first wash, I was shocked to see that my hair looked brighter than it was before. Sometimes after a salon visit, my hair would look pristine, but the tone of the color would change and look yellow or brassy after a couple of washes.\n\nRead more: The best shampoo for any hair type\n\nMy experience using Living Proof Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner\n\nI can report that these two products helped save the color of my hair.\n\nI've used a lot of shampoo and conditioners that say they're safe for color-treated hair, but in reality, they still strip away my color over time and it kind of makes me feel as though my trip to the salon was a waste. I use these products once or twice a week, and each time, my hair feels super clean, and looks bright and fresh. These two products really bring out my highlights and undertones, which gives more dimension to my hair for that \"just got out of the salon\" look.\n\nThat said, it doesn't take the place of a purple shampoo if you're an unnatural blond like me. I still use a purple shampoo like It's A 10 Everyday Brightening Shampoo to brighten up my hair, and then the next time I shampoo, I'll use the Living Proof products to help amplify that color.\n\nSometimes if I'm in a hurry, I'll just use the shampoo for a little extra color protection, spray in some detangler, and head out the door. The conditioner also helps with color protection and detangling, but I'm out of time, the shampoo will work just fine.\n\nI can also go longer between washes if I'm not doing anything that'll make me sweat a lot. I won't need to use dry shampoo on second- or even third-day hair, but if you normally get greasy roots quickly, then you may need the dry shampoo.\n\nWhat makes the shampoo and conditioner stand out\n\nThe shampoo and conditioner help prevent fading, UV damage, and hard water breakage, which are all things my dyed hair needs. I find myself outdoors a lot and the sun takes a toll on my hair, so my hair definitely needs a pick-me-up.\n\nLiving Proof's product development chemist Betsy Patel says that the formulas don't use ingredients traditionally found in shampoos and conditioners that can be harsh on color-treated hair, like silicones, sulfates, and parabens.\n\n\"The shampoo includes ingredients like [a new type of] UV filter, chelating agents that target metals which can affect color, and esters or film formers to replenish the damaged hydrophobic layer [of your hair],\" she tells Insider Picks. \"The conditioner includes a new UV filter, as well as our new fourth Living Proof patented technology \u2014 the Locking Molecule (CPULA)\u2014 which is our silicone alternative to sealing in color.\"\n\nRead more: The best hair conditioner you can buy\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you have blond hair like me, you'll know that it's almost a chore to maintain. I have a goal of working out five times a week, so it's annoying to figure out how to keep my hair clean without stripping its color, but this set has made it easier.\n\nIt's not cheap at $29 for each bottle, but if I'm getting my hair colored on a regular basis, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that my color lasts as long as possible. I love how clean my hair feels, how long I can go before I need to wash my hair, and how it bright it looks afterward.\n\nThis is a product I know I'll keep using, especially during the summer when my hair tends to get brassy much more easily than in the winter.\n\nBuy Living Proof's Color Care Shampoo, $29, from Living Proof and Sephora\n\nBuy Living Proof's Color Care Conditioner, $29, from Living Proof and Sephora", "description": "Living Proof's Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner helps brighten my color-treated blond hair so it look brighter, and it feels softer too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d680bec2e22af20ff5d18d9-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
