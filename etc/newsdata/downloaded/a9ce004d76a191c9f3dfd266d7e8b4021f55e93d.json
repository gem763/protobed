She wasted no time after taking the helm just a week ago following the ousting of Thierry Bollore, which has further added to disarray at the carmaker also struggling to repair relations with its Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co.\n\n\u201cThis profit warning comes at a time of major instability at Renault and its partner Nissan,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a note. \u201cInvestor worries will more likely intensify.\u201d\n\nDelbos on Thursday said the new management team is reassessing the \u201cDrive the Future\u201d mid-term targets unveiled in 2017.\n\nYet for this year, Renault said revenue will decline by 3% to 4%, after previously forecasting sales would be close to last year\u2019s level. Group operating margin will be around 5%, below previous estimates for 6%. Renault is scheduled to release quarterly sales next week.\n\nThe shares fell 12.2%, the most since the arrest of Ghosn in Japan in November, dragging down the rest of the European auto sector. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index dropped 2.7%.\n\nCar sales across Europe have been weak. They declined 1.6% to 12.1 million in the nine months through September, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said this week. Spain led the decline with a 7.4% drop, with Germany the only major market to record a gain.\n\nThe poor outlook for this year for Renault has raised the spectre of more radical surgery at the carmaker.\n\n\u201cWe assume a significant cut to the dividend and believe Renault may need to consider selling assets including Nissan shares to defend its balance sheet,\u201d Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a note.\n\nRenault took a hit in the first half of 2019 from poor results at partner Nissan Motor Co. The French automaker owns 43% of the Japanese company, which is forecasting its worst operating profit in a decade, hurt by an aging product lineup and a slide in vehicle sales in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nHaving replaced its CEO, one key question when Nissan reports results in early November is whether the new management will take more drastic measures to improve profitability.\n\nRenault\u2019s third-quarter sales fell to 11.3 billion euros ($12.6 billion) from 11.5 billion euros the previous year, the company said. Cash flow should be positive in second half of the year, but may not be for the whole of 2019.\n\nIn the video to employees, Delbos said the company need to \u201cmake some choices,\u201d highlighting Renault\u2019s negative cash flow in the first six months of the year. \u201cUnfortunately the situation hasn\u2019t improved during the summer and we need to put Renault back on track,\u201d she said.\n\n(Adds shares in second paragraph, analyst comment in third.)\n\n--With assistance from Frank Connelly.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ania Nussbaum in Paris at anussbaum5@bloomberg.net;Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net, John Bowker\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Renault SA set a gloomy tone for the European automotive sector by slashing its outlook for revenue and profit this year, saying weakening economies are weighing on car sales and tougher rules on emissions have increased costs.The French carmaker\u2019s shares fell as much as 13% in early trading", "authors": ["Ania Nussbaum", "Francois De Beaupuy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Am0ePojyh_.wrGJm9KhqVg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/18bcc2f94a14e3f9e215aeb34e27546c", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
