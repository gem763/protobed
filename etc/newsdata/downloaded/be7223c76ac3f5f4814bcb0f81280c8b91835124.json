This comes months after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because of liabilities stemming from deadly wildfires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe shutoff drew sharp criticism from California\u2019s top utility regulator who blasted the it for \"failures in execution\" that \"created an unacceptable situation that should never be repeated.\"\n\n\"The scope, scale, complexity, and overall impact to people\u2019s lives, businesses, and the economy of this action cannot be understated,\" California Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer wrote in a letter to PG&E CEO Bill Johnson.\n\nThe company said Monday that the spots where parts of its systems were damaged during the strong winds included downed power lines and places where trees had hit the lines. The damage, according to the company, could have contributed to the spread of wildfires that have gravely impacted the state.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % PCG PG & E CORP. 7.73 +0.06 +0.75%\n\nRepairs were either completed or underway at those impacted sites.\n\n\"It is possible that any one of these instances could have been a potential source of ignition had a PSPS not been initiated,\" the company said.\n\nOverall, PG&E crews and contractors inspected nearly 25,000 miles of distribution lines and 2,500 miles of transmission lines after the event.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has also criticized PG&E for its performance during the outage, blaming what he called decades of mismanagement, underinvestment and lousy communication with the public. On Monday the Democratic governor urged the utility to compensate affected customers with a bill credit or rebate worth $100 for residential customers or $250 for small businesses.\n\nNewsom said the shutoffs affected too many customers for too long, and it is clear PG&E implemented them \u201cwith astounding neglect and lack of preparation.\u201d\n\nJohnson responded in writing to Newsom\u2019s letter Monday, noting that no fires occurred during the power shut-off.\n\n\u201cWe know there are areas where we fell short of our commitment to serving our customers during this unprecedented event, both in our operations and in our customer communications, and we look forward to learning from these agencies how we can improve,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn its website, PG&E says after confering with experts from multiple National Weather Service offices and the Northern Operations Predictive Services, they agreed that this was \"very high fire risk event\" that \"had all the ingredients necessary for significant fires.\"\n\nON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAccording to the California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection, within the past two years, California experienced the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in its history with the latest fire erupting just last week in Southern California. A blaze broke out in San Fernando Valley, searing its way through dry vegetation and spread quickly.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Pacific Gas and Electric\u00a0confirmed Monday that\u00a0more than\u00a0100 instances of damage were found during the largest planned power outage\u00a0in state history\u00a0to avoid wildfires.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/PGE-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
