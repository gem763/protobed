Mr. Steyer fell one poll short of qualifying for the third Democratic debate in Houston this week. But the Democratic National Committee\u2019s rules allow polls to carry over and count toward qualification for the fourth set of debates in Ohio, on Oct. 15 and 16.\n\nOnly 10 candidates earned enough support to appear in this week\u2019s debate, and they will all appear on a single stage on Thursday night. But with 11 candidates now qualified for the October event, the D.N.C. will have the option to split that debate across two nights, as it did for the first two sets of debates in June and July. The committee has not yet indicated whether it will do so.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics October-Democratic-Debate-Tom-Steyer.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
