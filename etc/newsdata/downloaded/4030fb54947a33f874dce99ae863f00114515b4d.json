We've made it out with our lives, in health, and amazing spirits - with gratitude to Gd - as today there was a large scale terrorist attack in Halle, and the terrorist began his day right outside the walls of the synagogue we were praying in.\n\n'For whatever reason, the man with the gun was stalled or prohibited from entering the synagogue. Gd counted us all there today, one by one, as deserving of life.'\n\nRebecca Blady described how a loud bang was heard outside the synagogue as around 50 worshipers barricaded themselves inside\n\nBlady described how the scared worshipers heard a loud bang outside but she did not realize what was going until they were escorted out of the building by police.\n\nShe added: 'Our group from Berlin was meant to experience the day with some extra intention, joy, and conversation along the way. We had incredible prayers, full of beautiful songs and even dance, until we suddenly heard a loud bang outside.\n\n'We hardly had any information about what was going on, but we shuttled ourselves upstairs and into safe rooms. Eventually we learned that a man with a rifle had tried to get into the synagogue.\n\n'He struggled with a passerby. The passerby was killed. Several hours later, with the threat of the gunman still at large, police units escorted us out of the synagogue and to a local hospital to check for signs of shock and trauma.\n\n'We are still here, trying to make sense of what happened and what is going on. Please know that we are safe. I'm so grateful for all the calls and messages and most of all for the support of this community and the anchor that our group has provided.'\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said.\n\nPolice captured a suspect after a gun battle that left the man injured, though they have refused to say whether the man they captured is the same one seen online in anti-Semitic videos.\n\nMax Privorotzki, chairman of the Jewish Community in Halle, added: 'We saw through the camera of our synagogue that a heavily armed offender with a steel helmet and rifle tried to shoot open our doors.'\n\nAround 50 worshipers watched on CCTV cameras as they were barricaded inside the Halle synagogue prayer room. When the gunman failed to get in he shot dead a woman in the street and a man at a kebab shop\n\nBalliet shot two people dead and wounded at least two others in Halle, Germany, on Wednesday after trying and failing to massacre worshipers inside the city's synagogue\n\nBalliet was unable to get inside the synagogue so drove around the corner to a kebab shop where he shot another man dead, before firing several shots into the street (pictured, bullet holes in the shop window)\n\nRoman R, who was inside the building, said the majority of the 50 people inside hid away from the gunfire while he and around five other men barricaded the door to the prayer room and prepared to fight\n\nAround a week before the attack took place, a manifesto appeared online outlining plans for the attack which included killing 'anti-whites', along with pictures of home-made weapons and ammunition\n\nPeople place down flowers in front of a synagogue in Halle, Germany, where a woman was fatally shot after the attacker falied to get inside the prayer house\n\nA woman lights candles at a mourning site on the market place in Halle.

Police finally arrested the suspect north of Zeitz, around two hours later\n\nArmed police swarmed to the scene after the gunman opened fire. Witnesses said he used a submachine gun before throwing a grenade into a Jewish cemetery\n\nIt was later revealed that Stephan Balliet, a loner who lived with his mother, posted a manifesto online a week ago where he specifically talks about attacking the synagogue in Halle while outlining his plan to kill 'anti-whites', including Jews.\n\nThe 27-year-old spent hours online and was a user of Twitch - a live-streaming service popular with video gamers - where he shared footage his rampage on Wednesday in chilling echoes of the Chirstchurch mosque attack in New Zealand.\n\nThe majority of those inside - including the elderly and children - went to find shelter while Roman and five other men barricaded the door to the prayer room, called police, and then prepared themselves to fight back.\n\nHe described watching as Balliet shot at the wooden doors, believing they would give way any moment and that he would come inside and attack them.\n\nFortunately the doors held, explosives that Balliet placed at the doors did not go off, and flammable liquid he sprayed at the building failed to light.\n\nAfter failing to get into the synagogue, Roman watched as Balliet left to continue his attack elsewhere as police arrived. He remained trapped inside the building for hours afterwards before finally being freed once officers had disarmed the explosives. Afterwards worshipers were pictured hugging and laughing as they were led away.\n\nJewish community leader Max Privorotzki, who was in the Halle synagogue, told the Stuttgarter Zeitung of the harrowing minutes as the site came under assault.\n\n'We saw through the camera of our synagogue that a heavily armed perpetrator wearing a steel helmet and rifle was trying to shoot open our door.'\n\nBetween 70 and 80 people were in the synagogue then, Privorotzki said.\n\n'We barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,' he said, adding that 'in between, we carried on with our service.'\n\nA body lies in the street outside the synagogue, believed to be that of a female passerby who was gunned down when an attacker failed to get into the synagogue\n\nA kebab shop where a man is thought to have been shot dead after the gunman threw an explosive at the entrance, then fired shots into the restaurant\n\nAn armed officer runs to his vehicle in Halle.

'I couldn't reach him any more.'\n\nWhile the man didn't reveal details of his final conversations with his Balliet, when asked whether he thought about his son after reports spread of an attack on a synagogue, he stayed silent and began weeping.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel greets members of the Jewish community at a vigil in Berlin on Wednesday evening\n\nPeople leave candles and flowers at a vigil in Halle this evening after a man and woman were shot dead earlier on Wednesday\n\nForensic officers were working at the site where one of the victims was shot outside a synagogue on Wednesday\n\nA bus whose destination board reads 'evacuation' is escorted by police past the site of a shooting in Halle on Wednesday\n\nArmed police block access to a street near the scene of a shooting that has left two people dead\n\nLocal Jewish leaders said that an attacker had attempted to get into the synagogue but security measures 'withstood the attack' before he began shooting elsewhere\n\nArmed police wearing masks and helmets seal off part of Halle near the scene of one of the shootings on Wednesday\n\nWhile the attacker appeared to have been targeting the synagogue, Jewish community leaders said that none of the victims of the shooting appeared to be Jewish\n\nSynagogue visitors sit in a bus after a shooting in Halle after police relaxed the cordon enough for them to leave\n\nShooter posts video on Amazon-owned Twitch Social media firms faced anger and calls to 'step up' last after graphic footage of the anti-Semitic gun rampage in Germany was streamed live on Twitch and watched by thousands of people. The 35-minute video was streamed live on Twitch, an Amazon-owned gaming site, and stayed there for another 30 minutes after the broadcast had finished before it was finally taken down. In that time more than 2,000 people viewed the footage and some of them distributed it further via other social media networks. The 35-minute video was streamed live on Twitch (file photo), an Amazon-owned gaming site, and stayed there for another 30 minutes after the broadcast had finished The shooter had created his Twitch account two months before Wednesday's Yom Kippur violence. Last night there were calls for social media sites to take action to stop their platforms being used for violence. 'Amazon is just as much to blame as Twitch for allowing this stream online,' said Hans-Jakob Schindler of the Counter Extremism Project. 'Online platforms need to step up and stop their services being used and in turn, parent companies need to hold them accountable. 'This tragic incident demonstrates one more time that a self-regulatory approach is not effective enough and sadly highlights the need for stronger regulation of the tech sector.' 'We are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Germany, and our deepest condolences go out to all those affected,' a Twitch spokesman said. 'Twitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously. 'We worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act. 'Once the video was removed, we shared the hash with an industry consortium to help prevent the proliferation of this content. 'We take this extremely seriously and are committed to working with industry peers, law enforcement, and any relevant parties to protect our community.'\n\nRecords seen by Bilt reveal that Balliet graduated from high school and went on to study chemistry for two semesters at a higher education institution, but had to abandon his studies after a serious stomach operation.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what he did for work after quitting his studies, though a neighbour said he was working as a broadcasting technician at the time of the attack.\n\nVideo taken of Balliet during the rampage suggests he was at least familiar with combat tactics, even if he had no formal training, as he can be seen taking shelter while firing his weapons and moving around as a solider might.\n\nIn footage that he streamed online, Balliet also claims he built his weapons himself, suggesting a familiarity with mechanical engineering, though he can also be heard lamenting the fact that his guns keep jamming.\n\nIn a manifesto which was posted online as a PDF document, the author included pictures of the weapons and ammunition used in the attack, according to extremism monitoring service SITE.\n\nThe manifesto also mentioned a live-stream as well as his objective to kill 'anti-whites', including Jews.\n\n'This manifesto document, which appears to have been created a week ago on October 1, gives yet more indication how much planning and preparation' the gunman put into the attack, Rita Katz, director of SITE, said.\n\nGerman newspaper Die Welt reported that the text, which is about 10 pages long and written in English, specifically mentions the plan to attack the synagogue in Halle during Yom Kippur.\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said.\n\nPolice subsequently captured a suspect after a gun battle that left the man injured, though they have refused to say whether the man they captured is the same one seen online.\n\nIt is thought that Balliet tried and failed to get into the Halle synagogue where around 80 people were praying, before shooting through the doors, throwing explosives, and then laying bombs outside.\n\nHe then gunned down a woman in the street before driving around the corner to a kebab shop where he again opened fire, killing a man and wounding several others.\n\nVideo taken outside the shop shows a man wearing tactical gear and a helmet with a camera strapped to it climbing out of a car and firing several shots into the street with what appears to be an improvised shotgun.\n\nHe then walks up and down the road in full view of security cameras before fleeing in the direction of Wiedersdorf.\n\nAfter arriving in that village he shot an electrician in a workshop, then stole a taxi and made his way on to the A9 motorway, skirting around the city of Leipzig, before turning on to the B91 towards Zeitz.\n\nIt was there that he was confronted by police and arrested after a brief gun battle, Bild reports.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel joined a solidarity vigil at Berlin's main synagogue on Wednesday, and firmly condemned the anti-Semitic rampage.\n\nBut Jewish leaders said that words were not enough, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joining calls for German authorities to 'act resolutely against the phenomenon of anti-Semitism'.\n\nThe head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany ripped into the authorities for failing to provide adequate security on such a key day.\n\n'It is scandalous that the synagogue in Halle is not protected by police on a holiday like Yom Kippur,' said Josef Schuster.

It is celebrated throughout the Jewish world, even by typically secular members of the faith.\n\nThe owner of the kebab shop, Rifat Tekin, meanwhile described the gunman as 'calm like a professional'.\n\n'Maybe he has done this many times.
