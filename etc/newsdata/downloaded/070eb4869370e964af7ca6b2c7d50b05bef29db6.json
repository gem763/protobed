The circuit boards can be reverse engineered to determine the exact route the weapons flew. But U.S. officials said the most damning evidence is still unreleased satellite photos showing the Iranian Revolutionary Guard making preparations for the attack at Ahvaz Air Base in southwestern Iran.\n\nFrom there, the weapons flew through Kuwaiti airspace some 400 miles to their targets in Saudi Arabia. The satellite photos were of no use in stopping the attack since their significance was not realized until after the fact. \"We were caught completely off guard,\" one U.S. official said.\n\nA picture taken on September 18, 2019, shows displayed fragments of what the Saudi defense ministry spokesman said were Iranian cruise missiles and drones recovered from the attack site that targeted Saudi Aramco's facilities.

We'll see what happens,\" he said.\n\nGeneral Frank McKenzie, the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, has asked permission to send three more batteries of anti-aircraft missiles to help Saudi Arabia protect its oil facilities. McKenzie has also drawn up plans for retaliatory strikes against Iranian oil facilities and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.\n\nWhen President Trump was briefed on the military options, he insisted Saudi Arabia would have to contribute to any retaliatory strike. He's scheduled to meet again with his national security advisors on Friday.", "description": "Saudi Arabia on Wednesday displayed wreckage of what it said were Iranian cruise missiles and drones", "authors": ["David Martin"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/387f3f04-b68b-4e2b-8452-f314dacbd55d/thumbnail/1200x630/deb886661018d342d7c065a24de19fd6/gettyimages-1169201156.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
