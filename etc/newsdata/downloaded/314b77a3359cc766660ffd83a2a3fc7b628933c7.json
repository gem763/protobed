I landed in the hospital once this year from heat exhaustion,' Hurst said\n\n'I\u2019m in a leather trench coat and two layers under that in Georgia in the summer. It\u2019s no joke, man,' he added.\n\nHospitalized: During his wide-ranging interview, Hurst was asked if he gets hot in the Beta costume, when he revealed he was hospitalized\n\nHe didn't reveal how long he was hospitalized for, or how serious his bout of heat exhaustion was.\n\nThe show typically films during the sweltering summer months in and around Atlanta, Georgia, and with the costume Hurst wears as Beta, it's not terribly surprising he suffered a bout of heat exhaustion.\n\nHis character's face has not yet been seen, hiding either behind a zombie mask or a full ski mask, though it's not known which he was wearing when he was hospitalized.\n\nHeat exhaustion: He didn't reveal how long he was hospitalized for, or how serious his bout of heat exhaustion was\n\nThe Walking Dead showrunner Angela Yang teased that Beta's face will be shown at some point, with Hurst joking about what fans will see when that happens.\n\n'A bleary resemblance to Whoopi Goldberg,' Hurst said with a laugh. 'No, I can\u2019t tell you too much about that.'\n\n'We\u2019ve been dropping Easter eggs here and there, maybe on this show, maybe on another show that\u2019s connected to it, but I\u2019ll sort of keep dangling that carrot and let people wait for the end of this season to see what happens.\n\nBeta's face: The Walking Dead showrunner Angela Yang teased that Beta's face will be shown at some point, with Hurst joking about what fans will see when that happens\n\nThis season has featured a few brief flashbacks that tease Beta's past, with Hurst adding one of the most fun aspects of the character is his 'secretive nature.'\n\n'It\u2019s something that I very early on brought to [showrunner Angela Kang], that I had this idea of his backstory and also, how they met, and we collaborated a bunch on making this back story a reality,' he said.\n\n'So, I\u2019m just super happy with the way that it all worked out because Angela and I\u2019ve been talking about this since the beginning of season 9, when I first signed on,' Hurst added.", "description": "With The Walking Dead continuing its 10th Season with the third episode this Sunday on AMC, one of the show's stars revealed he was hospitalized on set.", "authors": ["Brian Gallagher For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19719630-0-image-a-61_1571104477146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
