I look like Harry Hill!\"\n\nHis trademark goatee that caused dedicated fans to swoon in the past has now transformed into a well maintained beard, and his once-brunette locks are a thing of the past.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAfter leaving Albert Square back in 2002, the heartthrob actor was voted the sexiest male soap star ever by Radio Times.\n\nMichael first joined EastEnders back in 1998 but was axed by executive producer John Yorke in 2002 as he set to \"revamp the show\" with his final scene airing on 4 June later that year.\n\nWhile taking a break from acting, Michael then threw himself into a tough exercise regime after he ditched the UK for Los Angeles over a decade ago.\n\nDuring an appearance on Loose Women in 2016, the ex soap star sent hearts fluttering when he talked about his new ripped physique.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe star is now officially back in the UK and looking for new ventures. Fans on social media have commented on the star's transformed look.\n\nOne questioned: \"OMG is that Beppe from Eastenders?\"\n\nWhile another one commented on a ten year challenge snap Michael posted in January.\n\nMichael shared two images side-by-side alongside the caption: \"This is my 10 year Challenge. It doesn\u2019t matter how we have changed our appearance and how we look on the outside.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe continued: \"It\u2019s far more important how we have changed on the inside. Be kind. Smile and be happy.\n\n\"Life is beautiful and life is precious. Stay healthy and love your friends and family with all your heart.\"\n\nThe fan praised: \"You look exactly the same!! Wicked!!\"\n\nAnother dedicated fan complimented the soap star: \"Like a fine wine, gets better with age, but always makes my heart skip a beat.\"", "description": "He won the hearts of the nation for playing Beppe di Marco in EastEnders in the nineties, but looks completely different now", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Bbc", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20759673.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EASTENDERS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
