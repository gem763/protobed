But when former Republican governor Scott Walker used it on Monday, he didn\u2019t realize how ironic he was truly being.\n\nPoking fun at Democratic nominee Senator Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail in Detroit with Representative Rashida Tlaib \u2013 both self-proclaimed socialists - Walker joked:\n\nScott Walker (@ScottWalker) Anyone notice the backdrop behind @BernieSanders and @RashidaTlaib looked like the empty shelves of grocery stores in many socialist countries?\n\n\n\nIrony. pic.twitter.com/rHuXGMhDX9\n\nThe rightwing blog Gateway Pundit also ran a piece mocking their poor choice of location for a photo opportunity, titled \u201cPERFECT! Two Radicals Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib Stand in Front of Empty Grocery Store Shelves and Push Socialism.\u201d\n\nAfter all, what could be funnier than laughing at people starving in poorer countries when you live in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, right?\n\nBut what they didn\u2019t realize was that the photo was taken at the last stop of a \u201ccorporate greed tour\u201d which Representative Tlaib takes Detroit visitors on. Sanders and Tlaib\u2019s final stop was at a food pantry where free food, water and clothes are given to low income families in Detroit.\n\nThe pantry is on the other side of the city from some earlier stops at Marathon Oil and Little Caesar\u2019s: both received millions in tax breaks to expand into the city.\n\nAmong other provisions, the pantry is running out of bottled water at the moment \u2013 due to the fact that a number of families in Detroit have had their water shut off because they can\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nThe reverend Roslyn Bouier, the executive director of the Brightmoor Pantry, pointed out that the shelves were empty because of the overwhelming demand there is for food and water in Detroit. The pantry sees around 1,700 families a month.\n\n\u201cThe pantry shelves are so empty because we are doing our job. Because people need the food. That shows the inhumanity. America needs to do better. That\u2019s the sadness of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nRev Bouier pointed out that many people in need of food in the US are employed, but with wages so low they don\u2019t cover the bills. She said it was evil that someone who had once held public office could laugh about that fact.\n\n\u201cFor this community, any community in America to be without food and water, to constantly have to live with housing insecurity or water insecurity. It\u2019s so utterly ridiculous. It\u2019s so evil. It is evil in and of itself.\u201d\n\nShe added that the former governor, despite being from a \u201cmore affluent area\u201d, would have people starving in his constituency, too:\n\n\u201cThat tells you how disconnected he is, from the people in his own community. I promise you that someone in his community will exist on the margins of society. We know that to be true all over the US.\u201d\n\nAccording to local reports, during Sander\u2019s visit, he heard speeches from local students who had campaigned to get clean water in their schools, after realizing that the water they were drinking was contaminated with lead.\n\nSanders called out corporate greed in his speech at the pantry, lamenting a system that allows tax breaks for billionaires while the poor go hungry. He said:\n\n\u201cHere in this campaign, we hear the word socialism a lot. Well, what this is a perfect example of is socialism for billionaires, massive amounts of subsidies and tax breaks \u2026 But for children, there\u2019s not enough money for a decent education and for poor people, there\u2019s not an ability to get clean drinking water.\u201d\n\nOne in nine Americans lives with insecure access to food. In Wisconsin, where Walker was formerly governor, one in five children lives with food insecurity.\n\n\n\n", "description": "In misused irony, Scott Walker pokes fun of a photo of Sanders and Tlaib at a food pantry in Detroit with empty shelves", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443671fd0efab381322662085385c052242a4b80/119_0_1267_760/master/1267.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=09cf4c9edbfe8a723aaad3b768dbfa0f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
