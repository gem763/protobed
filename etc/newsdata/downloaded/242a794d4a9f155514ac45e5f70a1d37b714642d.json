REUTERS/Stringer\n\nShaped like a phoenix - though to some observers it is more reminiscent of a starfish - the airport was designed by famed Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid. It boasts four runways and is expected to handle up to 72 million passengers a year by 2025, eventually reaching 100 million.\n\nIt was hailed as \u201ca new powerful source of national development\u201d at a ceremony overseen by President Xi Jinping, just days ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nA China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) Airbus A380 flight to Guangzhou in the country\u2019s south was the first to fly out.\n\nChina is forecast to overtake the United States as the world\u2019s largest aviation market by 2022. Daxing, located south of Beijing, will help ease pressure on Capital International Airport in the city\u2019s northeast, where capacity constraints often cause flight delays.\n\nThe new airport is, however, about 46 km (29 miles) away from central Beijing, almost twice the distance of Capital airport. An express train from Daxing will take about 20 minutes to reach the south of Beijing.\n\nDaxing will also accommodate passengers from the neighboring areas of Hebei and Tianjin, linked by a sprawling network of trains, subways and public buses.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Map of Beijing's commercial airports, here)\n\nChina Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines will be the main domestic carriers at Daxing. About 50 foreign airlines, including British Airways and Finnair (FIA1S.HE), plan to move all or part of their operations in the next few quarters.\n\nThe relocation of all airlines is to due to be completed by the winter of 2021.\n\nWith the opening of Daxing, Beijing Nanyuan Airport, China\u2019s oldest airport, will cease operations from Thursday.\n\n(GRAPHIC: The 20 busiest airports in the world, here)", "description": "The first commercial flights from Beijing's new Daxing International airport took off on Wednesday - an airport that cost $63 billion to build, is roughly the size of 100 football fields and is expected to become one of the world's busiest.", "authors": ["Stella Qiu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433733290&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0VY", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
