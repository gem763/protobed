Also, when it comes to \"green\" fuel, they do not look at the science behind bio-fuels. It is a fact of science (physics) when you convert from one energy source to another there is an energy loss and a pollution increase. Take bio fuel from corn for an example easy to understand. To harvest the corn, diesel fuel combines are used which pollute. Transportation of the corn to a bio-fuel facility pollute. The machines use fuel for the conversion from corn to bio-fuel polluting while the conversation takes place. Then, when the bio-fuel is used again there is pollution. The use of methane which is the cleanest burning fuel known reduces the pollution three fold. Any gasoline vehicle can be converted to natural gas for a relatively small amount and would be a cost saving in the short run as natural gas is very cheap since we (USA) do not have enough storage capacity for it.. All that needs to happen is for the major gas outlets like Exxon, Shell, Mobil, Valero and so on need to add a natural gas pump to their outlets so one can travel coast to coast. Even wind and solar produce more pollution in the manufacturing process than they produce. I have taught math, physics and chemistry for 18 years so I understand the science better than you. I have for the last 12 years been a deep water wellsite geologist internationally so again I have the basis for speaking to the oil and gas industry. Get your facts straight before you embarrass yourself further.
