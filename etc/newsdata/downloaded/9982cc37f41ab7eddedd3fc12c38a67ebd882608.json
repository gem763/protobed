ACB, +1.02% dropped 5.9% in premarket trading Monday, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Andrew Carter recommended selling the Canada-based cannabis company following disappointing quarterly results. Carter cut his rating to sell from hold and slashed his price target to C$5, which is 36% below Friday's closing price, from C$7. The U.S.-listed shares closed Friday at $5.95. He wrote in a note to clients that Aurora's fiscal fourth-quarter results point to a \"less robust in-market performance and difficulty to continue positioning for the larger global opportunity.\" Carter said he believes Aurora's financing efforts will be \"challenged\" against a backdrop of \"overwhelmingly negative investor sentiment\" towards the sector, damaged credibility and limited near-term catalysts to drive enthusiasm. Aurora's U.S.-listed stock has tumbled 21.3% over the past three months, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +0.56% has dropped 19.1% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% has gained 4.2%.", "description": "Shares of Aurora Cannabis Inc. dropped 5.9% in premarket trading Monday, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Andrew Carter recommended selling the Canada-based...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
