I have played for over a decade and Middlesex and Ireland had a 50-50 standing in my own heart and head. But it is tough to turn down international cricket and playing against the best in the world and touring around the world, that is what sealed it but London has been a home for me since 2009. I have enjoyed every minute.\n\n\u201cIt is an ECB rule and I can understand it. Cricket Ireland have Test status and if you want to play Test cricket for Ireland then why should the ECB let someone play in their local tournaments if they are not looking to play for England? I get it from their point of view but it is slightly more complicated than that in our case. Middlesex has been my home for so long so it does feel baffling to have to go but hopefully I will be able to play in some capacity in the future.\u201d\n\nStirling is centrally contracted by Ireland and is hoping to land white ball deals around the world. He will enter the draft for the Hundred and hopes to play in the T10 tournament in the UAE later this winter between international fixtures for Ireland.\n\n\u201cI would love to keep playing in England. It suits my style of cricket. Maybe someone will pick me up and do a good job as a lesser price tag,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf there is availability for a couple of weeks where they need someone to fill in it is an easy option to fly over from Ireland. The logistics might be a lot easier for the teams and that might help my case. But the overseas tag probably make chances in the Hundred slim. I hope something comes through there but there is still the T20 Blast with the counties and I would love to still play my cricket in England.\u201d", "description": "Paul Stirling has described having to leave Middlesex as a \u201cbaffling\u201d situation after he was forced to become an overseas player despite being born in Belfast and holding a British passport.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BqYuneCou4XjGzgBSWO.og--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wNZH9iCZ_wetFd_TL0nKdg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/1430f98ee85f8256329ed2b47a4b9c55", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
