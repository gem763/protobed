As money poured in, Venmo announced it would match any donations King received. King specifically requested the beer Busch Light, and maker Anheuser-Busch offered to send King a free year's supply of the beer once he surpassed the $1 million mark.\n\nRead more: The paper that reported on the Busch Light guy's racist tweets had to hire security because they're getting violent threats\n\nKing then rose to prominence as a local hero, with beer cans made with his face on them and a local ice cream store planning to name a Busch Light flavor after him.\n\nAmid the excitement, the Des Moines Register assigned its reporter, Calvin, write a profile of King.\n\nCarson King with sign at Iowa stadium. https://twitter.com/kittenmitton009/status/1173360672740184071\n\nIn the course of reporting, Calvin examined King's social media profiles, where he found old, offensive tweets, including one that compared black mothers to gorillas and another that made light of black people who died during the Holocaust.\n\nCalvin decided to publish a brief explanation of the tweets he found at the bottom of his article and notified King before publication. King apologized for the tweets, which Calvin included - but before running the article, King also began to apologize for his old tweets in advance, including in a written statement he posted to Twitter.\n\nIn light of the tweets, Anheuser-Busch retracted the partnership and the offer to send King a year's worth of free beer. The charity donations were not impacted. However, the ensuing attention created a firestorm online.\n\nAfter King's old tweet resurfaced, an anti-cancel culture mob turned on Calvin for his reporting\n\nMany critics, both in and outside of Iowa, saw Calvin's reporting as an example of cancel culture, a term that has found roots as a wide array of both public and private figures have faced consequences after old and offensive social media posts are resurfaced.\n\nAs Calvin explained to BuzzFeed News, a horde of negative online attention then came his way, including efforts to reveal his address and other personal information, along with death threats. Most of the negative attention stemmed from libertarian and alt-right online communities - the anti-cancel culture movement has largely been championed by conservatives.\n\nRead more: YouTubers are calling out the platform's 'cancel culture' that subjects them to a rampant hate mob and sees them lose thousands of subscribers in a matter of hours\n\n\"I was trying to do my job as a reporter\"\n\nCalvin disagreed that he was attempting to \"cancel\" King in the first place.\n\n\"I was never trying to hold Carson to any kind of 'higher standard' or any kind of standard at all,\" Calvin told BuzzFeed News. \"I was trying to do my job as a reporter, and I think I did so to the best of my ability.\"\n\nRegardless of intent, the mob was able to find old, offensive tweets written by Calvin, too. Those tweets were directed toward the Des Moines Register and the company that owns it, Gannett.\n\nRepresentatives for Gannett called Carson, who had been asked to vacate his home in light of the death threats, and gave him the choice to either resign or be fired. He chose to be fired. The executive editor of the Register explained the decision, as well as the editorial decisions leading up to the reporting in the first place, in a lengthy editorial.\n\n\"Until readers called to our attention some inappropriate posts from several years ago, the Register was unaware of them,\" executive editor Carol Hunter wrote. \"We took appropriate action because there is nothing more important in journalism than having readers' trust.\"\n\nNeither Aaron Calvin, Carson King, nor the Des Moines Register immediately responded to Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Aaron Calvin, the Des Moines Register reporter who found Carson King's offensive tweets, got fired for his own.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d91327721214c54d968c579-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
