Leftists cheer and whoop and post admiring profiles of the judges who agreed with them. Conservatives complain that the judiciary is overstepping its authority and ruling on the basis of what it thinks the law ought to say rather than what it actually says.\n\nAmerican readers might be familiar with this scenario, but not Brits. When our Supreme Court declared that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had behaved improperly by advising the queen to prorogue Parliament \u2014 that is, to suspend prior to a new session, normally a standard procedure \u2014 it tore up our constitutional settlement as it had existed for 330 years.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know that the United Kingdom had a Supreme Court? Neither, until this week, did most Brits. That body was created in a characteristically slapdash way by Tony Blair, from no higher motive than wanting to look modern.\n\nUnlike its American cousin, the British Supreme Court is not interpreting a written constitution. It is there, at least in theory, to uphold a system based on the supremacy of Parliament. Our 1689 Bill of Rights, large chunks of which were cut and pasted by James Madison when he drafted the American version, differs from yours chiefly in that it elevates Parliament over the judiciary, laying down that \u201cproceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court.\u201d\n\nThat sounds pretty clear-cut, doesn\u2019t it? But, this week, the judges got around it by claiming that \u201cthe prorogation is not a proceeding in Parliament. It takes place in the House of Lords chamber in the presence of members of both Houses, but it is not their decision.\u201d Hmm. So the prorogation happens in Parliament but, somehow or other, it isn\u2019t in Parliament. Whatever you say, M\u2019Luds.\n\nA prorogation normally happens every year. But Theresa May was reluctant to hold a new legislative session, because she feared that MPs would take the opportunity to vote against her agenda and thus precipitate her departure. The current session became the longest since the appropriately named Long Parliament, which sat for 13 continuous years until 1653.\n\nJohnson and his supporters argue that the prorogation was overdue and point out that, until he took over, the opposition had been demanding one. His detractors say that his real motive was to reduce the amount of time that MPs had to pass resolutions that weakened his negotiating position in Brussels. But here\u2019s the point: Whichever side is right, it is plainly a political rather than a legal question.\n\nEven 10 years ago, such a case could not have come to court. No law existed, so no law could have been broken. That, indeed, was also the view of every senior judge this time until the Supreme Court decided otherwise.\n\nWere the 11 Supreme Court justices biased against a Euroskeptic prime minister? Obviously, I have no way of knowing. But I can say with certainty that the legal profession as a whole is pro-Brussels. I know it, because just days after the referendum more than a thousand barristers signed a letter telling MPs not to implement its result. Although the judges kept emphasizing that they were only concerned about the technicalities of the prorogation and not about Brexit, the case had been brought by anti-Brexit campaigners who rejoiced when the result was declared.\n\nWe now have the worst of all worlds: judges who are political but not accountable. There are two ways we can go as a country. Either we can return to the notion of parliamentary supremacy, perhaps by limiting the use of judicial review by statute, as Australia does. Or we can go the whole hog, totus porcus, and adopt a written constitution which formalizes the division of power.\n\nIf I thought we would end up with a constitution such as yours I\u2019d be tempted by the second option, but the peculiar emphasis on individual freedom that sustains that document was a product of the 18th century. I doubt whether the Bill of Rights would get through your Congress today, and I can\u2019t see our House of Commons approving anything remotely like it.\n\nIn their determination to stop Brexit, the British establishment has ripped aside norms, violated precedent, and politicized previously impartial bodies \u2014 all in order to overturn a referendum result that MPs had solemnly promised to uphold.\n\nWhen Oliver Cromwell finally sent the Long Parliament packing in 1653, he used words that seem eerily apt today. \u201cYou were deputed here by the people to get grievances redressed, are yourselves become the greatest grievance.\u201d\n\nYup. Sooner or later, the people will have their say.", "description": "A politicized court rules against an elected government.
