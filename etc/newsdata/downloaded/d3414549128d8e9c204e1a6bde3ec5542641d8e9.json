REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli\n\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday gave his full backing to Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, an apparent effort to quash recent press speculation of a rift between the two.\n\nSpeaking at conference in Sao Paulo after Guedes himself had addressed the audience, Bolsonaro said Guedes has total control over economic policy and that there is no \u201cplan B\u201d.\n\nOn Monday Guedes told Reuters there was \u201czero basis\u201d for a Brazilian newspaper report that he plans to leave Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet early next year after a landmark overhaul of the country\u2019s pension system has cleared Congress.\n\nBolsonaro also reinforced the independence of the central bank, saying the bill to give the central bank an official seal of autonomy will not make \u201cmuch difference\u201d because it already operates independently from political influence.\n\n\u201cI only call the president of the central bank after interest rate decisions are made,\u201d Bolsonaro said, a likely reference to news last week that prosecutors were investigating Banco BTG Pactual SA (BPAC11.SA) and former central bank and finance ministry officials over allegations of illegal leaking of interest rate decisions between 2010 and 2012.\n\nIn his address to the conference, Guedes said Brazil has already met its privatization targets for this year and the process continues to accelerate, part of the government\u2019s drive to deregulate the economy.\n\nThe Economy Ministry said last week that privatization and asset sales in the first nine months of the year had totaled $23.5 billion, already surpassing the 2019 target of $20 billion.\n\nWhile Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), or Petrobras, may not be on the privatization bloc itself, Guedes said the state-run oil giant is breaking up its monopolies.\n\nOil bidding rounds for exploration and production rights off the Brazilian coast are being held on Thursday, ahead of the much larger so-called transfer-of-rights bidding round and 6th pre-salt round scheduled for early November.", "description": "Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday gave his full backing to Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, an apparent effort to quash recent press speculation of a rift between the two.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439303977&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991HE", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
