You literally are changing the course of an election,\u201d said one senior GOP lawmaker.\n\nThe GOP has been ratcheting up pressure on Democrats to hold public hearings, formally vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry \u2013 as has been done in the past \u2013 and release the transcripts of their closed-door briefings, accusing Democrats of trying to shroud their impeachment investigation in secrecy.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a strategy by Adam Schiff and the Democrats to have closed-door depositions in his bunker here in the basement of the United States Capitol, and then to cherry pick out facts that they think can be spun to best help make their case by also withholding other key facts,\u201d Rep.
