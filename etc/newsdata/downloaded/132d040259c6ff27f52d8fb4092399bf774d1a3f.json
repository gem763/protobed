There is a long period to debate and discuss the provisions in this Withdrawal Agreement.\"\n\nIn his letter to Mr Corbyn, Mr Johnson wrote: \"This parliament has, with your encouragement, voted repeatedly for delay. The vote on Tuesday was parliament's last chance to get Brexit done before 31 October and it voted, again, for delay. I am extremely sceptical this habit will change and many will doubt that this parliament will do anything other than waste more time and then, in January, ask for yet another delay.\"\n\nHe continued: \"This Parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new Parliament that can make decisions. Prolonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\n\n\"You have repeatedly said that once the EU accepts Parliament's request for a delay until 31 January, then you would immediately support an election. I assume this remains your position and therefore you will support an election next week so the voters can replace this broken parliament.\"\n\n\u200b", "description": "Boris Johnson has announced he is seeking\u00a0a 12 December general election.
