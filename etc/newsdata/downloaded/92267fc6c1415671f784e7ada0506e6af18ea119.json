We can explain away almost anything that doesn\u2019t support our party, candidate or worldview. Hyperbole and \u201cwhataboutism\u201d are almost second nature. It\u2019s not always pretty, but that\u2019s the reality.\n\nThat said, there are moments in time when the mental gymnastics aren\u2019t worth it. This is one of those times.\n\nPresident Trump has abused the power of his office to benefit himself to the detriment of the public good, which is an impeachable offense. If mental gymnastics were an Olympic sport, Republicans desperate to defend Trump would all be gold medal contenders\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES,' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\n\nTrump\u2019s request that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cdo us a favor\u201d in looking into alleged corruption of a political opponent \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 is clear cut in the summary notes of the July 25 call between the two presidents that was released Wednesday by the White House.\n\nAnd we are now learning that Trump reportedly made a discussion of Biden a precondition of the phone call with Zelensky \u2013 an obvious abuse of power.\n\nABC News reported Wednesday that \u201cUkrainian officials came to recognize a precondition to any executive correspondence\u201d between Zelensky and Trump was a commitment to discuss the involvement of Biden (Trump\u2019s potential 2020 election opponent) and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine.\n\nTRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT: READ THE DOCUMENT\n\nABC reported: \u2018\"It was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case,\"\u2019 said Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption advocate and former member of Ukraine's Parliament, who now acts as an adviser to Zelensky. \u2018This issue was raised many times. I know that Ukrainian officials understood.\"\u2019\n\nAs a legal standard, we don\u2019t even need a quid pro quo to impeach, though it is present in the notes of the call. Against the backdrop of nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine that was frozen by Trump before the call \u2013 and that Ukraine urgently needed to defend itself against Russian aggression \u2013 the two presidents had this exchange, according to the White House\u2019s rough summary:\n\nZelensky\u2019s quid: \u201cThank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d (Javelins are anti-tank missiles).\n\nTrump\u2019s Quo: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more, of course. Trump\u2019s mention of reciprocity; his request that Ukraine investigate Biden; and his mention that his people (Attorney General William Barr and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) will be in touch with Ukraine all read like a classic mob shakedown.\n\nAs journalist Ryan Lizza put it: \u201cAnyone who has ever listened to the Gotti tapes will recognize the subtlety here.\u201d I\u2019ve heard the tapes of the late Mafia boss and Lizza is spot on.\n\nAnd by the way, why was Trump using his personal attorney rather than U.S. government officials to deal with a foreign country? This was not only highly inappropriate, but ironic, given that Giuliani made his reputation as a crusading U.S. attorney in New York City by prosecuting Mafia figures.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we know what lengths the Trump administration at first went to avoid allowing the whistleblower complaint against Trump regarding his call with Zelensky becoming public. The Washington Post reports that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire threated to resign over concerns that the White House may force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday morning.\n\nMaguire has denied the resignation threat publicly, but released a letter emphasizing his commitment to protecting whistleblowers and has pushed the White House to make explicit whether it would assert executive privilege. He is no doubt caught in a fight between Congress and the White House.\n\nBuckling to pressure from Democrats, the Trump administration turned over the whistleblower complaint about the Trump-Zelensky phone call to select members of congressional intelligence committees Wednesday afternoon, along with related documents. And Wednesday night Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d on Fox News Channel that the whistleblower complaint has been declassified, though it was not immediately publicly available.\n\nIn announcing the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was clear that the Trump-Zelensky call isn\u2019t the only instance by Trump of impeachable conduct, but is the most easily digestible. She\u2019s absolutely right.\n\nI have been against the idea of a formal impeachment inquiry since we saw the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. That isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t believe that President Trump obstructed justice. I think it\u2019s quite obvious that he did, and I wish that Justice Department guidelines allowed for Mueller to make a decision one way or the other on charging Trump with obstruction.\n\nThe Mueller report was enough for dozens of Democrats to get on board with impeachment, but not Pelosi and certainly not a majority of moderate House Democrats who either found the argument for impeachment not compelling or felt the politics were too dangerous for Democrats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThings are different today and there is little ambiguity. Impeachment remained unpopular before now, with the latest Quinnipiac poll showing that only 37 percent of Americans supported impeachment, with 57 percent against. And while 73 percent of Democrats were supportive, we know that the country is made up of more than just Democrats and that the politics of impeachment remain perilous.\n\nBut it remains to be seen what impact the rapidly unfolding revelations on Trump\u2019s efforts to use Ukraine to hurt Biden\u2019s candidacy will have on public sentiments about the need for impeachment. We\u2019ll get a better reading on this when new polls come out in the next few weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that these are perilous times and things change, as they did during impeachment hearings for President Richard Nixon in 1974, when public support for impeachment grew dramatically.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nToday we have a president who is abusing the power of his office for his personal and political gain, putting his own interests ahead of America\u2019s. He clearly should not be entrusted with the highest office in the land. The mental gymnastics to avoid coming to that conclusion are too much to ask, even of the biggest partisans.\n\nI know that the prospect of a Democratic president feels like an intolerable nightmare to millions of Americans, but the prospect of supporting a man with so little regard for the office of the presidency and the American people is an intolerable nightmare we are all living through today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JESSICA TARLOV", "description": "Trump is putting his own interests ahead of America's.
