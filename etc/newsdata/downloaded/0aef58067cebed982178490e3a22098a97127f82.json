As the audience whooped at her plans to rip our freedoms from us, she declared that, as a daughter of immigrants, she needed no lectures from the \"north London metropolitan liberal elite\" to say otherwise.\n\nThis son of an immigrant does say otherwise.\n\nPatel is in many ways to be admired: she has risen to become our first Indian-origin home secretary and has dealt with racism and prejudice, within her party and beyond. Yet she has bought into, and now sells on, two great lies.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe first is that freedom of movement of people is something to be mocked, attacked and abolished, based on the myth that the freedom only works one way: against the UK. It is the Brexiteer falsehood, peddled by Boris Johnson and much of his new cabinet, that freedom of movement means millions of workshy immigrants pouring into a borderless Britain unable to keep them out. It fails to recognise two key facts: the first is that European freedom of movement is, of course, merely the freedom to seek and take a job (or live off your own resources) in another European country. The second is that it is a vital freedom for British people too \u2014 to work, love, and live across Europe.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Families belong together\u2019 protests over Trump immigration policy Show all 8 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

I am here today because of Britain\u2019s openness and Europe\u2019s freedom of movement. Patel\u2019s plan is to seize that freedom from me, my generation, and those who were too young even to vote in the Brexit referendum that she claims gives her the mandate to do so.\n\nThe second great lie, used to alarming effect in the British Indian community during the stormy days of the referendum campaign, is that ending European freedom of movement will allow a suddenly \"global Britain\" to welcome engineers from India, academics from Australia and scientists from Sri Lanka. As Patel knows, it is not and has never been the EU that prevents us doing so. Her department\u2019s latest attempts to deport a junior doctor born in Taiwan were nothing to do with the EU either.\n\nWe effectively already have the Australian-style points based system, a policy the Tories perennially promise at their party conference. The only reason those Indian engineers are not welcome is because our government doesn\u2019t want them.\n\nBritish Asians, and the rest of the country, were sold a lie. The idea that Britain will be more welcoming to Sri Lankan scientists under a Conservative Party tilting endlessly rightwards as it courts Brexit Party votes is ludicrous.\n\nTo the delight of her audience, Patel compared herself to Margaret Thatcher, and declared that Thatcher knew that if \u201cyou make the British people your compass, your direction will always be true\u201d.\n\nThatcher was many things, but she was certainly a conviction politician who did follow the directions of a populist compass. She would look with disdain on those who now flit after the latest poll results. Certainly, she would have abhorred Patel\u2019s original plan to simply abolish freedom of movement on 31 October, and to hell with the consequences for workers and families across the country.\n\nPatel\u2019s story is impressive, yes, and so is the story of her parents, who came here to create a new life, just as my grandfather did the same. It only takes a visit to the Migration Museum in Lambeth to understand that our island story is an immigrant story \u2014 a hopeful story that should drown out those cheers at Tory conference every time. So I say to Patel, as one child of an immigrant to another: you must not lose sight of that.", "description": "Priti Patel, our new home secretary, was rapturously received at Conservative Party conference\u00a0this week as she triumphantly announced Tory plans to end free movement of people.
