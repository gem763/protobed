AP\n\nHowever, like Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party at the other end of the spectrum, Jo Swinson\u2019s Lib Dems have no such trouble. The political centre ground and the traditional \u201cbell curve\u201d profile of voters crowded in the moderate middle has given way to a different \u201ctwin peaks\u201d pattern, with many voters polarised and gathering around the extremes.\n\nAfter almost four years of argument about Brexit, we can see the broad contours: better-off, university-educated middle class voters in bigger cities and in London and Scotland in particular tend to favour Remain and pro-Remain parties. Less affluent voters in towns in decline tend to back Leave. Attitudes towards things like migration or LGBT+ rights, more than traditional economic concerns, are becoming the new fault lines.\n\nIn this new topography the Liberal Democrats would be well placed to supplant Labour as the natural home of the progressively pro-Europe minded, and in particular those unconvinced by Labour\u2019s statist tendencies, passion for nationalisation and aggressive redistributionist policies. Some will also have been put off by the sustained talk of antisemitism around the party.\n\nOnly the sheer size of the Labour machine, its established position, funding and the first-past-the-post voting system offers Labour some defences against the secular trends running hard against it.\n\nIt is far too early to predict the strange death of the British Labour Party in the 2020s, in the same way as the old Liberal Party faded away in the 1920s. After all, Mr Corbyn scored the best swing to his party since 1945 as recently as the 2017 general election, and he remains, by a long way, the leader of the largest opposition party.\n\nAnd yet the Lib Dems are catching up, and Labour tacticians and MPs would do well to shed any complacency about the realignment taking place on the centre left. In an election campaign, with the broadcasters obliged to give the Liberal Democrats a larger share of airtime, and with, prospectively, some interest in their new, young, woman leader, they might be expected to add to their current support at 19 per cent or so of the electorate. If so, then the Lib Dems might soon edge close to Labour\u2019s share of around 25 per cent, albeit that is not saying much.\n\nFor the outstanding feature of the British polling scene today is this pitifully meagre Labour strength, measured by historical standards, and confirmed in various recent real-world elections. As in 2017, Mr Corbyn and his frontbench team \u2013 which contains some bright talents \u2013 might ignite their campaign, if and when it gets going.\n\nOn the other hand, as the saying goes, past performance is not necessarily a guide to future results. Two years ago Mr Corbyn was up against a dismally poor performer in Theresa May, and he benefitted from his \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d on the EU. Neither of those conditions looks likely to apply in 2019 or 2020. Labour, in fact, still hasn\u2019t got a coherent message on what it would do in government about Brexit.\n\nMs Swinson will also need to prepare the answer to the question she, like her predecessors, will be asked incessantly: will you support Labour in a hung parliament, and under what terms?\n\nThus far, as in the talks about the elusive \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d, she has been relatively hostile to Jeremy Corbyn, but if he does end up as prime minister-designate in a hung parliament, she will need to find a way of accommodating him, just as he will have to trim the more extreme sections of his party\u2019s manifesto.\n\nApart from a possible targeting of her East Dunbartonshire seat by the SNP, the bigger, longer-term problem for Ms Swinson is, perversely, the decline of Brexit as a major issue. Difficult though that may be to envisage now, were there to be a deal, or even under no deal, many of the Remain arguments would simply cease to be relevant (though still valid), if the UK has formally left the EU. For reasons of high principle as well as base electoral politics, Ms Swinson has an interest in keeping the UK in the EU, and keeping her party in business.\n\nFor now she is doing well, but she obviously needs to widen her party\u2019s policy \u201coffer\u201d beyond Brexit, and make sure the stance on working with Labour is clear. Otherwise she will see her party dragged down by the unpopularity (relatively speaking) of Mr Corbyn, for Lib Dem support is probably not that deeply rooted. Ms Swinson\u2019s predecessors have witnessed many a false dawn. Nick Clegg might remind her of the old Kipling line about success and failure both being imposters.", "description": "They\u2019re going to need a bigger minibus. The defection, or re-defection, of Luciana Berger from Labour to the Independent Group/Change UK and, now, to the Liberal Democrats brings the party\u2019s Commons strength up to 16. It\u2019s still quite a come down from the high water mark of 63, achieved under Charles Kennedy\u2019s leadership, but remarkable progress all the same.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/15/12/POLITICS-Brexit-Swinson-10493780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
