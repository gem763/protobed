Allan Hubley\n\nSome councillors asked how the city can continue charging residents an $88 solid waste collection fee when it's not providing reliable service.\n\nKanata South Coun. Allan Hubley said garbage bins left out last Thursday were still sitting at the curb on Tuesday.\n\n\"What's the plan here? Are we going to go through this from now until June? Because it's unacceptable,\" he asked staff.\n\nEmployees with the city's roads and water departments are being pulled back to operate garbage trucks, Wylie said. Meanwhile, smaller collection trucks used to empty trash bins in parks are being deployed, and the city is looking to waste companies outside Ottawa for temporary help.\n\nKevin Wylie is general manager of public works and environmental service for the City of Ottawa.
