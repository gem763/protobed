Shown here is one of the advertisements in Exhibit A of the charge filed with the D.C. Office of Human Rights. (Housing Rights Initiative and Neuhtah Opiotennione)\n\nHousing companies used Facebook\u2019s ad system to discriminate against older people, according to new human rights allegations.\n\nTwo parties \u2014 nonprofit watchdog group Housing Rights Initiative and a D.C. woman seeking to lead a class-action group \u2014 filed human rights complaints Wednesday with administrative agencies in D.C. and Maryland. They allege that seven housing companies that lease or manage properties in the metropolitan area used Facebook\u2019s advertising system to target specific age groups, excluding others. They also allege Facebook\u2019s algorithms compounded the issue by disproportionately showing the ads to younger users.\n\nThe plaintiffs did not file a charge against Facebook, which is implementing changes to its advertising system as part of a settlement over other discrimination claims. But an attorney for the plaintiffs said he plans to subpoena the company during the investigation process to study Facebook\u2019s advertising algorithms.\n\nThe allegations mark the first time a civil rights action has accused specific housing companies of discriminatory ad-targeting through Facebook, according to the Housing Rights Initiative. If successful, the case could open the door to other anti-discrimination actions against advertisers, even if those advertisers are simply using another company\u2019s ad-targeting tools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to hold advertisers responsible,\u201d said Peter Romer-Friedman, counsel at Outten & Golden LLP and one of the attorneys on the case. \u201cTo date, both Facebook and advertisers have said, 'It\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them,\u2019 to pass the buck.\"\n\n[Facebook agrees to overhaul targeted advertising system for job, housing and loan ads after discrimination complaints]\n\nA Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nJoining the Housing Rights Initiative in the case is 54-year-old Neuhtah Opiotennione, who is filing on behalf of \u201call Facebook users who have been interested in housing opportunities in the District of Columbia metropolitan area and who have been or are being excluded from receiving a housing-related advertisement,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nOpiotennione works for the D.C. Public School System and was seeking housing in the Washington metropolitan area during the past year, according to the filing. Her housing budget was at least $2,500 per month. During the 12-month period, she was a regular Facebook user and said she would have liked to see housing ads. But because she was not part of the age group targeted in the advertisements, the complaints argue, she was denied the ability to learn more about the housing opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt does make me really emotional to feel like I\u2019m not wanted, and not even considered,\" she said in an interview. \"Thrown away like yesterday\u2019s trash, that\u2019s how I feel.\u201d\n\nFacebook has long allowed advertisers to use its algorithms to market to specific groups of people. But many advertisers have been called out for abusing those services to discriminate, either purposefully or unintentionally excluding groups of people from their target audience. The company became the subject of several discrimination lawsuits after a 2016 ProPublica investigation found that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude users by race.\n\nOne lawsuit \u2014 brought by the National Fair Housing Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Communications Workers of America, among others \u2014 ended in a settlement earlier this year. The terms require Facebook to adjust its tools so that advertisers can\u2019t advertise for housing, credit and job opportunities based on certain criteria, including gender, age and Zip codes, which can be used to help determine race. Those advertisers also have a much smaller set of \u201cinterest\u201d categories that can be used to target users. The changes, which the company began implementing in June, are scheduled for completion by the end of the year.\n\nIn a March blog post announcing the changes, which also includes a tool to view housing ads around the country, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg called the adjustments \u201can important step in our broader effort to prevent discrimination and promote fairness and inclusion on Facebook.\u201d\n\n[HUD is reviewing Twitter\u2019s and Google\u2019s ad practices as part of housing discrimination probe]\n\nFacebook is also under federal investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which alleges Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting system encourages discrimination and violates the Fair Housing Act. The agency is scrutinizing Twitter and Google for similar potential abuses.\n\nGoogle, Twitter, Amazon and others allow advertisers the ability to target ads, too. But Facebook, with its hyper-targeted advertising system and more than 2 billion monthly users, has borne the brunt of the scrutiny around ads and discrimination. Nearly all of Facebook\u2019s $55.8 billion revenue last year came from its advertising business, one of the most successful in the world.\n\nRomer-Friedman, the attorney on the case, said detailed demographic data like age is Facebook\u2019s \u201csecret sauce,\u201d information that allows advertisers to access the exact users they are seeking in a more detailed way than many other advertising platforms.\n\nHousing has become more difficult to find in the D.C. area, with high rents and millennial-focused developments frequently pushing out residents in historically black communities. One study found the District has the highest \u201cintensity\u201d of gentrification in the United States.\n\n[Facebook is now legally bound to stop advertisers from excluding people because of their race]\n\nThe plaintiffs say Facebook\u2019s algorithm further compounded the alleged age discrimination by advertisers. They say the thousands of data points on which Facebook\u2019s ad system is based make it more likely that an even narrower, younger subset of users will see the ads. An advertisement targeted to a user between ages 22 and 55, for example, was more likely to be delivered to someone in their 20s or 30s because of Facebook\u2019s algorithms, they allege.\n\nThe filings cite at least one case, an advertisement for Central Apartments managed by Greenbelt, Md.-based Bozzuto Management Company, where the age range targeted was 22 to 40 years of age, according to information displayed when a user clicked Facebook\u2019s \u201cWhy am I seeing this ad?\u201d feature.\n\nThe housing companies named in the complaints are Bozzuto, Fairfield Residential (San Diego), Fore Property (Las Vegas), Greystar (Charleston, S.C.), Kettler (McLean, Va.), the Tower Companies (Rockville, Md.) and Wood Partners (Atlanta).\n\nBozzuto said it is \u201ccommitted to fair housing\" and that it has been proactive to ensure its advertising doesn\u2019t discriminate. \u201cWe are confident that our advertising practices comply with D.C. and Montgomery County law, and will gladly work with these jurisdictions to investigate and address any issues,\u201d the company added.\n\nGreystar declined to comment. The other companies were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe complaints are being filed with the D.C. Office of Human Rights and the Montgomery County Office of Human Rights in Maryland. Romer-Friedman said that after the agencies complete their investigation, the plaintiffs will have to decide whether to continue the case in front of an administrative judge, or move the case to state or federal court. In either situation, the plaintiffs will seek damages as well as an injunction that prohibits the seven companies from using social media or advertising in a discriminatory way.\n\nRomer-Friedman said Housing Rights Initiative is likely to file similar complaints against housing companies in other metropolitan areas, including New York City.\n\nCorrection: The agency with which the attorneys filed allegations is the D.C.
