All primary sources. Eye witnesses,\" he said. \"Every comment confirmed and authorized. People who\u2019d been present or dug out confirmation. [...] This is his actual life history.\"\n\n\"This fact-based account of a sitting president, in our lifetime, as history unfolds, will bring backlash,\" O'Reilly went on. \"My book\u2019s neither pro nor con. Every word true. I sent it to him and will probably hear from him at his usual 2 AM.\"\n\nThe conservative TV personality promises that \"The United States of Trump\" will address Trump's \"complicated\" relationship with his children, \"about not serving in Vietnam\" and his ancestral history.\n\n\"The president mightn't like info such as his German grandfather in the flesh business,\" O'Reilly teased.\n\nAs for his current feelings on the United States' divisive leader, the disgraced Fox News host called him \"brilliant.\"\n\n\"USA won\u2019t admit he\u2019s brilliant and five steps ahead of most. Nobody could do what he did, hardscrabble, and get elected. He knows America\u2019s feelings and how to market it. Not luck,\" he told Page Six. \"Look, I just got fed up. Ninety percent of what\u2019s reported is nonsense. He\u2019s no second Messiah -- and who knows what he\u2019ll do? -- but I will say the Democrats are helping him out.\"\n\n\"He has tenacity, perseverance. His flaw? Self-discipline,\" he went on. \"And defeating his own purpose is dumb. Who cares that he doesn\u2019t like John Bolton? Instead of screaming the Democrats are Socialists, he\u2019s tweeting about CNN\u2019s corruption. But there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s re-elected.\"\n\nOrder \"The United States of Trump: How the President Really Sees America\" here.", "description": "Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly latest book,'The United States of Trump,' is all about the sitting president.", "authors": ["Aol.Com Editors"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0sfDF56NTtPZ_daZh1_Hmw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2190x1436+575+330/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/aceb7660-deda-11e9-bf7c-d6714c10cffb", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
