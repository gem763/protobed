Combine the deficits against Green Bay and the previously winless New York Jets in the past two losses, and the Cowboys were down 52-6 before coming back.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest part of the puzzle the Cowboys must solve against Philadelphia on Sunday night with first place in the NFC East on the line. The teams are tied at 3-3.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, until we figure it out, that\u2019s been what\u2019s hurting us,\u201d Prescott said after last weekend\u2019s 24-22 loss to the Jets, who were 0-4. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start faster.\n\n\u201cI know we have the right men, the right coaches, and the right people to get it done. We\u2019ve got a huge (game) next week, so that\u2019s what matters now - getting it done before next week.\u201d\n\nPrescott pinpointed the offense as the key to the issue for not giving the defense a chance to play with a lead. But the defense shares plenty of responsibility.\n\nThe best case in point came in the shocking loss to the Jets, when coach Jason Garrett passed on a field goal down 7-3 late in the first half and went for it on fourth-and-2 from the New York 7-yard line.\n\nAfter Prescott was dropped for a loss on a sweep, Chidobe Awuzie was too aggressive and safety Jeff Heath took a poor angle on San Darnold\u2019s 92-yard touchdown pass to Robby Anderson. Just like that, the Jets were up 14-3 on their way to an 18-point first-half lead.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we haven\u2019t executed,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cEverything we do goes into execution, so everyone has a responsibility for that, every coach, every player who is involved in each of the units of our football team. So we haven\u2019t executed well enough early on in games.\u201d\n\nHeath says the danger for a defensive player is getting anxious about making a game-changing play when things don\u2019t go well early. The seventh-year player thinks the loss to Green Bay was the best example. The Cowboys were down 14-0 quickly, and 31-3 before rallying.\n\n\u201cWe were down 14-0 early and then I think errors just started to pile up because we felt like we needed to make these difference-making plays to turn the whole game around,\u201d Heath said.\n\n\u201cThe way to win is you\u2019ve got to keep hammering. You\u2019ve just got to hunker down, focus on your job and just keep doing that and then hopefully there\u2019s enough time to where you can come back.\u201d\n\nEach of the past two weeks, the Cowboys have been criticized by TV commentators for appearing to be emotionless on the sideline during the first half. Cornerback Jourdan Lewis wasn\u2019t saying that was the problem - but he was saying that\u2019s the solution.\n\n\u201cJust go out there on fire,\u201d said Lewis, whose interception sparked the comeback against the Jets. \u201cJust clean up the details and be on our details earlier. Not having to clean up stuff at halftime that we know and we saw already.\u201d\n\nThe trick is trying to understand why the Cowboys aren\u2019t on the details earlier.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you honestly,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI can tell you that we\u2019re definitely going to fine-tune those things.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys are second in the NFL in total offense, but something inside those numbers also illustrates the slow starts. In the 34-24 loss to the Packers, Prescott had his second 400-yard game of the season after having just one his first three years.\n\nDallas also had its most yards ever in a loss (563) - through trying to erase the four-touchdown deficit after several promising drives early didn\u2019t lead to points.\n\n\u201cIt just comes down to execution of the plays and not shooting ourselves in the foot and just starting fast,\u201d running back Ezekiel Elliott said. \u201cWe moved the ball last week. We moved the ball down the field. We\u2019ve just got to find a way to get the ball in the end zone.\u201d\n\nNOTES: A day after announcing defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford would have hip surgery and miss the rest of the season, the Cowboys signed another one in Justin Hamilton. He played four games for Kansas City last season. \u2026 Offensive tackles Tyron Smith (ankle) and La\u2019el Collins (knee) still haven\u2019t returned to practice. \u2026 WRs Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb also didn\u2019t practice. Cooper aggravated a thigh injury early against the Jets, and Cobb didn\u2019t play in New York after showing up on the injury report last week with a back issue.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Before scoring touchdowns on five straight possessions and cruising to a comfortable win over the New York Giants in the opener on their way to a 3-0 start, Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys stalled on their opening drive and fell behind.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/cowboys_jets_football_00873_c0-103-2484-1552_s1200x700.jpg?141c3c98106860b0abdb45cf1a80e454dde37b63", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
