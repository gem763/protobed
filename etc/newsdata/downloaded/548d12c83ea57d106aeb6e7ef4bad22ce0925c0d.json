One million is 10 to the sixth power, so a basic millionaire is a 6. Someone with $1 is a zero and someone with a dime (or one-tenth of a dollar) comes in at minus-1. Less than that \u2014 negative net worth \u2014 and it\u2019s minus-2.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nAs you can see, the biggest cohort comes in at the 3 level, and that includes the median American renter with a net worth of $1,000, which covers a small emergency without borrowing. Only two people, Microsoft MSFT, -1.41% founder Bill Gates and the aforementioned Amazon AMZN, -0.01% founder, get the 11 designation.\n\nTesla\u2019s TSLA, +1.59% Elon Musk is stuck at 10, while Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is midpack at 5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit appalling that disparities in wealth have gotten so big that we need logarithms to describe them,\u201d Coy wrote. \u201cBut that\u2019s the world we live in.\u201d", "description": "Ever wonder where you fit in, wealth-wise, on a scale from \u201csubsistence farmer\u201d to Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos?
