As such, it deserves a serious response from Congress.\n\nHere\u2019s how the underlying problem occurs.\n\nWhen patients seek medical care, they typically make every effort to visit their in-network physicians or facilities, but could still end up receiving care from an out-of-network specialist. For example, if they need x-rays or specific lab work done, out-of-network entities often must perform the task. That, in turn, can result in patients receiving huge bills in the mail weeks after their treatment, demanding payment for the cost of care not covered by insurance.\n\nThat creates an unexpected, unfair and unmanageable situation.\n\nAlthough lawmakers have worked to address this issue, a consensus remains elusive. As elected officials in Washington consider potential solutions, however, we must ensure that whatever legislation they pass not only protects patients, but preserves a free-market approach that will help control costs and increase access to care.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the proposals under consideration in Congress could actually make things worse.\n\nFor example, establishing a government-mandated rate based on insurers\u2019 discounted in-network averages would unfairly skew the marketplace in the favor of large insurance companies and to the detriment of patients nationwide. A rate-setting approach would translate to significant financial losses for local hospitals and emergency rooms, in turn threatening access and affordability across the health care system.\n\nTo more fairly address the problem of surprise medical billing without making matters worse by disrupting the patient experience or undermining the free market, Congress must focus on passing a solution that is grounded in the free market \u2014 not one that relies on government intervention. The only legislative approach fitting that description is Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR). IDR is a proven, market-based solution that will hold patients responsible only for their in-network cost sharing amounts by establishing a framework for health insurers and medical providers to negotiate payment terms in good faith.\n\nIn New York, which passed its own version of IDR in 2015, the process has worked exceedingly well, enhancing transparency among insurers, increasing network participation, and lowering out-of-network bills. All of that has occurred while also protecting patients from surprise billing and keeping costs stable or even lowering them. That illustrates the power of a free market.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s disconcerting that legislation introducing a big-government rate-setting solution \u2014 the Lower Health Care Costs Act, introduced by Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) \u2014 even remains on the table in Congress. That rate-setting approach would only grow the federal government\u2019s role in our health care system, making it a slippery slope to government-run health care schemes like Medicare for All.\n\nInstead of that one-size-fits-all approach, conservatives in Congress should rally behind the IDR process. In a positive sign, legislation that leverages IDR \u2014 the STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act introduced by Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), himself a physician \u2014 has been cosponsored by 12 conservatives in the U.S. Senate, including Senators Rob Portman (R \u2013 OH), Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and David Perdue (R-GA), among many others.\n\nWhen Congress takes up the issue in September, those and other conservative leaders should help champion IDR and work to replace the misguided rate-setting framework in Senator Alexander\u2019s bill with this proven process from Senator Cassidy\u2019s legislation.\n\nThat offers the surest way to eliminate surprise billing, while preserving a free market that yields lower costs and increased options for patients.", "description": "Surprise medical billing poses a serious problem that increases the .09/17/2019 19:23:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Lee", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/319/3d637f0a-90c9-4083-b7d3-5b058798c220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
