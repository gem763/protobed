Research that looked at fine-grained data from Canada found that when people won the lottery, their neighbors were more likely to run up their debts and file for bankruptcy\u2014the idea being that they tried and failed to keep up with their lucky peers. In a different study, not as focused on such an extreme outcome, people tended to be less happy the more their neighbors earned.\n\n\u201cIf you live in a neighborhood where everybody has about the same as you do, then you don\u2019t feel as perpetually behind as [when] you\u2019re in a place where it\u2019s more diverse economically,\u201d says Keith Payne, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies the mental effects of inequality.\n\nDunn also noted a couple of variables, other than peers, that might lead people to feel richer. She brought up a 2016 study that found people\u2019s bank balances\u2014viewed separately from just spending, or investments, or debt\u2014to be, in its authors\u2019 words, \u201cof unique importance to life satisfaction.\u201d \u201cOne reason why middle-income people might feel pretty good about their level of income is if they just happen to be living their lives in such a way that even if they don\u2019t actually have a lot of net worth, but they always have 8,000 bucks in the bank,\u201d Dunn speculated.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019d be more prudent to invest that money, Dunn noted, \u201cbut then it's tucked away and you don\u2019t see it except maybe quarterly, when you check that balance\u2014whereas your bank-account balance, you just see it so much that I think it shapes your sense of your financial security.\u201d\n\nShe also suspects that people overrate the importance of earnings in feeling financially satisfied. \u201cAll of this talk about \u2018income, income, income\u2019 overlooks the fact that it matters a lot what you do with your money,\u201d she said. As she and other researchers have found, spending money in certain ways can make people feel better; it generally helps to funnel more funds toward charity, memorable experiences (as opposed to material goods), and paying others to handle one\u2019s most dreaded tasks, such as washing the dishes or cooking.\n\nAnd these spending tactics don\u2019t only work for affluent people. \u201cIt's not just how much you have\u2014it's what you do with it,\u201d Dunn told me. \u201cIf you make really good spending decisions, \u2026 you can turn a middle income into a fair bit of happiness.\"\n\nThose are some of the main takeaways of the academic research that\u2019s been done on this subject, but maybe financial coaches\u2014people who have firsthand experience listening to people\u2019s money problems\u2014can fill in some answers that research can\u2019t.\n\nMaggie Germano, a financial coach in Washington, D.C., who works mostly but not exclusively with mid-career professional women, told me her clients are often under the wrong impression about what will ease their financial stress. \u201cThat\u2019s actually something that I hear a lot, where they think that if they just increase income, that everything would get better,\u201d she said. Yet even when they do earn more, they frequently remain frazzled by their finances and sometimes, Germano said, \u201cstill feel like they\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s not just how much you have\u2014it\u2019s what you do with it,\u201d says one researcher who studies money and happiness.", "authors": ["Joe Pinsker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTSIO13/facebook.jpg?1563573101", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
