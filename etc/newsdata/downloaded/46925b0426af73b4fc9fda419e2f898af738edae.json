REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo\n\nLast month, India banned the sale and import of electronic cigarettes, warning of a vaping \u201cepidemic\u201d among young people and dashing plans of companies such as Juul Labs Inc and Philip Morris International to sell products in the country.\n\nJuul had aimed to launch its e-cigarette in India in late 2019 and had hired several senior executives in recent months, Reuters has previously reported.\n\n\u201cWhat was impending was a nationwide launch of Juul ... it (the government) chose to act immediately,\u201d additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi told the court.\n\nLekhi made the remarks while defending two challenges against the ban that have been filed by e-cigarettes importer Plume Vapour and another company Woke Vapors.\n\nHe told the judge the cases were a \u201cproxy for Juul\u201d but did not elaborate. He later told Reuters inside the courtroom: \u201cWe feel they are a proxy for Juul, there\u2019s a very real possibility\u201d.\n\nA Juul spokesman declined to comment on the government\u2019s remarks. Woke Vapors and Plume Vapour did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTwo senior Juul executives were present inside the packed courtroom on Tuesday, seated for most of the two-hour hearing next to the federal health ministry\u2019s bureaucrat who oversees tobacco control, Vikas Sheel.\n\nTOBACCO VS E-CIGARETTES\n\nJuul Labs, in which tobacco giant Altria Group Inc owns a 35% stake, is facing increased scrutiny in the United States, its home market, as teen use of e-cigarettes surges.\n\nEven before the ban was announced, the Indian government had said products such as Juul were harmful and could potentially undermine its tobacco control efforts. More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses.\n\nHowever, India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative potential market for companies selling both tobacco and vaping products.\n\nPlume Vapour, one of the companies arguing against the ban, told the court on Tuesday that \u201crelative harm\u201d from e-cigarettes was less than from tobacco products and the government was scaring consumers by banning the product.\n\nThe government\u2019s counsel Lekhi said e-cigarette\u2019s novelty and attractiveness pose a public health danger, and the product needs to be nipped in the bud. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a new substance to cause addiction,\u201d he told the court.\n\nThe court on Tuesday did not put the ban order on hold, but as a temporary relief revoked the current requirement for sellers to submit their existing stock of e-cigarettes to authorities for disposal.\n\nThe cases, which have emerged as a key legal test of the government\u2019s ban order, will next be heard on Nov. 14.", "description": "The impending launch of Juul e-cigarettes in India was a factor in the government's decision to ban the sale of vaping products, a top government lawyer said on Tuesday while defending the move in a Kolkata court.", "authors": ["Aditya Kalra", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435923920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9030L", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
