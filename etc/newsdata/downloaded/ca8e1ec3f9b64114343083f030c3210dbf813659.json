(Ivan Aguinaga/EPA-EFE/Sutterstock)\n\nA prominent computer scientist resigned Monday from MIT and the Free Software Foundation after comments he made related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRichard Stallman was a visiting scientist at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, known as CSAIL, and founder and president of the Free Software Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for computer-user freedom. He resigned from both organizations.\n\nStallman posed questions recently on a group email to members of the computer lab that struck some colleagues as an offensive attempt to downplay child sex trafficking and to diminish the role a prominent MIT scientist might have played in the Epstein scandal. In the group email, Stallman suggested one of Epstein\u2019s victims may have presented herself as \u201centirely willing.\u201d\n\nStallman, an outspoken advocate for online freedom, has provoked controversy in the past for his opinions. He has written previously that he did not think there was anything wrong with sex between an adult and a child. In September, he wrote that in recent years, he had learned that sex could cause psychological damage to a child.\n\nBut debate flared following revelations at MIT that senior officials knew of gifts from Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to two felony offenses, including procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He was arrested in July on new federal charges of sexually abusing dozens of girls in the early 2000s. In August, he was found dead while in federal custody.\n\n[Senior officials at MIT \u2014 including the university\u2019s president \u2014 knew about Epstein donations]\n\nAt MIT, a colleague sent to the computer lab\u2019s group email an invitation to a protest. Stallman responded with a complaint that the announcement did an injustice to his former MIT colleague, Marvin Minsky, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, who died in 2016. The protest announcement said Minsky was \u201caccused of assaulting one of Epstein\u2019s victims.\u201d\n\nStallman wrote, \u201cThe injustice is in the word \u2018assaulting\u2019. The term \u2018sexual assault\u2019 is so vague and slippery that it facilitates accusation inflation: taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which is much worse than X.\u201d Stallman wrote that if Minsky and the girl did have sex, the word \u201cassaulting\u201d presumes force or violence was used to coerce it.\n\n\u201cWe can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing,\u201d Stallman wrote. \u201cAssuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.\u201d He wrote that it was best to use precise language to ensure an accusation would not be inflated.\n\nWhen a colleague responded that the girl was 17 at the time and that made the encounter rape in the Virgin Islands, Stallman wrote, \u201cDoes it really? I think it is morally absurd to define \u2018rape\u2019 in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.\"\n\nHe wrote that they know the girl \u201cwas being coerced into sex \u2014 by Epstein. She was being harmed. But the details do affect whether, and to what extent, Minsky was responsible for that.\u201d\n\nThe exchange prompted a post on Medium by an MIT graduate, Selam Gano, calling on Stallman to be removed from the university. It also resulted in a story in Vice and calls from leaders of two nonprofits for him to resign.\n\nOn Saturday, Stallman wrote, \u201cI want to respond to the misleading media coverage of messages I posted about Marvin Minsky\u2019s association with Jeffrey Epstein. The coverage totally mischaracterized my statements.\n\n\u201cHeadlines say that I defended Epstein. Nothing could be further from the truth. I\u2019ve called him a \u2018serial rapist\u2019, and said he deserved to be imprisoned. But many people now believe I defended him \u2014 and other inaccurate claims \u2014 and feel a real hurt because of what they believe I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that hurt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI wish I could have prevented the misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nStallman did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. In a blog post Monday night, he wrote to the MIT community that he was resigning effective immediately. \u201cI am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of CSAIL, sent an email to the lab announcing the resignation and thanking Stallman for \u201chis technical contributions to the lab, to the free-software movement, and to the wider computer-science community over the decades.\u201d She wrote that leaders at the lab plan to discuss \u201chow we can improve the ways we respectfully work with one another in this community.\u201d", "description": "Stallman posed questions recently on a group email to members of the computer lab that struck some colleagues as an offensive attempt to downplay child sex trafficking and to diminish the role an MIT scientist might have played in the Epstein scandal.
