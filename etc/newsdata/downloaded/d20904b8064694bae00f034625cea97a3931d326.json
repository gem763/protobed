We know from years of research they don\u2019t really care if upward pressure on prices is coming from wholesale generators, or retailers, or regulated networks, or various external factors that add costs to the system. To truly address the long-term interests of consumers, we need to think about the energy market in the same way they do. As one system working together to deliver an essential service.\n\nInstead of just asking how much does it cost to produce electricity from this or that technology we need to also ask how that generation gets to market, and what does it do to the costs of the generation and transmission system. And we need to address both questions at the same time so that the generation mix and transmission can both be considered as part of the whole.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a comprehensive overhaul of the way generation and transmission investment and operational decisions are made.\n\nThis largely comes down to how generation gets access to the market both physically and financially.\n\nNo control\n\nGenerators have no control over where and when connections are made around them, and, currently, do not have a way of insuring against the risks of being congested and of exposure to changes in marginal loss factors as a result of their location which impacts on the spot prices they receive. The transmission costs of getting this generation to where it is needed are borne by consumers through the regulated network charge on their bills. The regulatory system incentivises networks to make sure customers have a reliable supply, the cost of which is recouped from consumers via a larger asset base over decades to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith more and more geographically-spread generation, the pressure on costs is potentially set to grow considerably. Beyond direct costs in building new networks, the generators are increasingly exposed to the risks of being congested off the network or having critical investment delayed.\n\nMore than that, the lack of coordination between generation and transmission investment decisions is slowing down the integration of new generation, limiting the Australian Energy Market Operator's ability to dispatch the lowest-cost generation to consumers, and increasing the risk of bandaid fixes to keep the lights on.\n\nReform package\n\nToday the Australian Energy Market Commission announces a reform package to address both the costs and risks of integrating new generation into the grid in a holistic, comprehensive way. They are major reforms, that complement and strengthen the rollout of the integrated system plan. The package includes special mechanisms which have been proposed to fast-track the connection of renewable energy zones in line with those proposed by AEMO.\n\nThese reforms complement the Energy Security Board\u2019s work on implementing the integrated system plan, which is needed to make sure the transmission investment process is fit for purpose in a new regime where transmission infrastructure takes longer to build than new generation like wind farms and large-scale solar.\n\nThe AEMC has been working on this for some time. In 2015 we identified potential changes to the way generators accessed the grid and were asked by the COAG Energy Council to let the ministers know when those changes became necessary. That time is now.\n\nToday we released two discussion papers as part of our review on the coordination of generation and transmission investment to outline proposed changes so further consultation can happen before the review concludes at the end of the year.\n\nIt is time for generators, especially innovative generators, to be rewarded for locating where their energy has the most value to those who need it. And when congestion occurs, instead of complaining about the inability to connect, generators would be in a position to do something about it.\n\nAnything less than comprehensive reform risks a continuation of short-term, piecemeal changes that that are likely to result in higher prices and less reliability in the long-term.", "description": "Customers only care about the delivered cost of electricity.
