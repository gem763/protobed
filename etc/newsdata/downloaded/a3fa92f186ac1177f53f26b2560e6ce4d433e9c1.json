REUTERS/Irakli Gedenidze\n\nTBILISI (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in the center of Georgian capital Tbilisi on Friday for a protest against the government and ruling Georgian Dream Party, three months after the brutal dispersal of an anti-Kremlin demonstration.\n\nThe demonstration was organized by young activists who have been holding daily protests outside the parliament building for the past three months and drawing thousands at their peak.\n\nProtestors were blowing vuvuzelas and holding placards reading \u201cTogether against one!\u201d, referring to ruling party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili, an oligarch who critics accuse in ruling the country from behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cWe should unite and finish this government,\u201d Shota Digmelashvili, one of the protest organizers, told the crowd.\n\nThe protest movement has presented Georgia\u2019s government with the biggest domestic challenge to its authority in years and ahead of 2020 parliamentary election.\n\nIt erupted in June when a visiting Russian lawmaker was allowed to address the Georgian parliament from the speaker\u2019s chair, in Russian, touching a nerve in a country that fought a war with Russia 11 years ago.\n\nThe rally outside parliament on June 20 descended into violent clashes with police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.\n\nThe opposition and anti-government activists and supporters were angered further this month when parliament approved a new government led by Russian-educated former interior minister Giorgi Gakharia and has been calling for his resignation since the June 20 police crackdown.", "description": "Thousands of people gathered in the center of Georgian capital Tbilisi on Friday for a protest against the government and ruling Georgian Dream Party, three months after the brutal dispersal of an anti-Kremlin demonstration.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432359409&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0K1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
