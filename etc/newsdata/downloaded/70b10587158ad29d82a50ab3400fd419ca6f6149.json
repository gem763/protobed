On Tuesday in Washington, Trump administration lawyers found a way.\n\nIn DC federal court Tuesday, a Justice Department lawyer argued that the Administration could keep grand jury materials from Congress, contradicting the famous 1974 decision by Judge John Sirica that released Watergate special prosecutor findings to the House. The Sirica decision held that congressional impeachment proceedings are exempt from typical grand jury secrecy rules, but Trump\u2019s Justice Department lawyer, Elizabeth Shapiro, said Sirica relied on an \u201cambiguous\u201d interpretation of law and \u201ca different result\u201d would have come from the case today.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the US District Court replied.\n\nThe episode highlights how Congress and the White House are staking out maximalist constitutional positions across a number of fights, potentially remaking the balance of power for a generation. The Trump Administration is advancing an aggressive, pre-Watergate view of executive power. House Democrats, for their part, are betting that labeling a number of ongoing investigations part of a formal impeachment inquiry will strengthen their search for evidence that Trump has abused the office of the presidency for personal political gain.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The Trump Administration lawyers may find at least one sympathetic ear in the current Supreme Court on Nixon-era precedent, if the battle gets that high. In 1974, the Supreme Court held unanimously in U.S. v. Nixon that presidents don\u2019t have unchecked power to declare executive privilege and that Nixon had to comply with a subpoena and turn over White House tapes that the special prosecutor was seeking.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s second nominee to the Supreme Court, once questioned that decision. \u201cMaybe Nixon was wrongly decided\u2014heresy though it is to say so,\u201d Kavanaugh said in remarks at a round table that were published in 1999. \u201cMaybe the tension of the time led to an erroneous decision.\u201d Kavanaugh, a former White House lawyer for President George W. Bush, continued: \u201c[The] Nixon [decision] took away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a huge step with implications to this day that most people do not appreciate sufficiently.\u201d\n\nThe fight between Trump and Congress escalated this week as the White House shut down any possibility of renewed cooperation under an impeachment inquiry in a letter to House leadership on Oct. 8, signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone. \u201cPresident Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cYour unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn a call with reporters the same evening, a senior administration official elaborated on the contents of the letter, saying there would be a \u201cfull halt\u201d on making members of the administration available to testify, providing documents or complying with subpoenas. \u201cJust saying flat no, we\u2019re not going to cooperate at all, is really a pretty extraordinary position,\u201d says John Bies, a former Justice Department lawyer for the Obama Administration.\n\nWhile House Democrats think a formal inquiry will strengthen their legal footing in forcing subpoena compliance, the White House argues that the fact that the House never held a vote to launch the inquiry will tip the scales towards the executive branch if the courts need to step in. The impeachment inquiries against both President Richard Nixon and President Bill Clinton were authorized by a full vote in the House, though that is not a constitutionally prescribed step. In this case, Pelosi merely announced the formal beginning of an inquiry in a press conference.\n\n\u201cCourts tend to look at the practice\u2014 the precedent of the way that branches have handled inter-branch conflicts, and treat that as gloss in many circumstances on what the Constitution requires,\u201d a senior administration official said on the call about separation of powers issues. The courts have required a vote from the House to authorize engagement in \u201cvery grave inter-branch conflict\u201d such as certain kinds of litigation, the official said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s that vote from the House that shows the will of the body, the institution.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats hope that initiating a formal impeachment inquiry, even without a vote to initiate it, will give them more leverage against the White House and, if necessary, help advance a stronger argument in court if the executive branch continues to stonewall. \u201cWe want to make it abundantly clear that any effort by the secretary, by the president, or anyone else to interfere with the Congress\u2019 ability to call before it relevant witnesses will be considered as evidence of obstruction as the lawful functions of Congress,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told a packed room of reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday. \u201cAnd more than that, it will allow an adverse inference to be drawn as to the underlying facts. If they are going to prevent witnesses from coming forward to testify on the allegations in the whistleblower complaint, that will create an adverse inference that those allegations are in fact correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nIn the weeks since Pelosi formally said the House was launching an inquiry, the three committees tasked with investigating President Trump\u2019s outreach to Ukraine have moved quickly. The Foreign Affairs committee issued a subpoena for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the House Intelligence committee did the same for President Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani. Rep. Elijah Cummings, who chairs the committee on oversight and government reform, has said that he will subpoena the White House for documents relating to President Trump\u2019s July 25th phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nProcedurally speaking, these moves are nothing new. Democrats have issued multiple subpoenas for both White House officials\u2019 testimonies and documents since they assumed control of the House of Representatives last January. But, taking a bold stance on executive power, the White House has ignored many of them, and directed former officials do the same. To Democrats\u2019 dismay, all of this has so far largely been without repercussions.\n\n\u201cImpeachment removes some of [the White House\u2019s] defenses,\u201d says Elliot Mincberg, former chief counsel for oversight and investigations of the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cThey\u2019ve argued in response to oversight that there is no legislative purpose. Here there is a legislative purpose. That doesn\u2019t mean the White House won\u2019t come up with another excuse. But whether they comply still depends on their willingness to do it and if not, then the willingness of a court to force them to.\u201d\n\nSo far, neither Giuliani nor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said they will comply with the subpoenas. The White House also blocked Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, from appearing before a House panel on Oct. 8 as part of the impeachment inquiry. This will likely tee up another subpoena fight, says Samuel Dewey, a former Congressional staffer who served on Capitol Hill for four years. \u201cThe Administration had several valid legal objections and stood by them,\u201d says Dewey, now a lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery. \u201cYet the next likely step will be for the House to issue a subpoena.\u201d\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, say some experts, an impeachment inquiry does not significantly change the White House\u2019s ability to defy subpoenas. Even if Democrats threaten obstruction, the Republican majority in the Senate, and the fact that those lawmakers have so far been supportive of the administration, offers a sense of protection against actually removing Trump from office. \u201cThere is nothing legally different than the subpoenas that went to [former White House Counsel] Don McGahn or [Treasury Secretary] Steve Mnuchin or the other ones out there,\u201d said Kerry Kircher, who served as the General Counsel for the House of Representatives under Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner. \u201cIn terms of enforcing them, if the House decided to go to court\u2026 It would be the same song and dance legally.\u201d\n\nWhile the legal considerations for the White House on cooperating with Congress may remain largely the same, experts say that the political considerations have certainly changed. \u201cImpeachment is the big story now,\u201d said Kircher. \u201cThat was not true of the subpoena with McGahn and the subpoena with Deutche Bank and [Trump\u2019s accounting firm] Mazars.\u201d\n\nStill, so far the political pressure has not inspired a more open posture from the White House, and congressional Democrats worry the stonewalling will continue. \u201cIt hurts the ability to move through expeditiously,\u201d says Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \u201cIf the process is slowed, it won\u2019t be because of us.\u201d\n\nWhich is why the courts may ultimately need to step in.\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com and Tessa Berenson at tessa.berenson@time.com.", "description": "It's not easy to surprise a judge.
