CBC has not independently verified Wylie's claims.\n\nIn 2018, Wylie became the primary whistleblower against Cambridge Analytica, which had harvested the data of millions of Facebook users to build voter profiles intended to sway the results of the U.S. presidential campaign and Britain's 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nWylie told The Current that he saw the company use the harvested data to target people with disinformation to sway their political beliefs. He also alleges the company had links to Russia and sent psychologists to St. Petersburg to give briefings \"about how to target American voters.\"\n\nWatch Christopher Wylie explain how the data was used to sway people:\n\nCBC's Adrienne Arsenault speaks with Christopher Wylie 3:29\n\nWylie said that, two years before he went public, he shared his concerns with colleagues in the Liberal caucus research bureau (LRB) in Ottawa. He had signed a $100,000 contract with the party to help it find ways to better understand and use voter data.\n\n\"When I was working with [the Liberals], you know, I did talk about all these things that had happened, and they were obviously concerned about it,\" he told Petty on The Current.\n\nIn his book, he writes that he found out in June 2015 that Cambridge Analytica was working on Donald Trump's U.S. presidential campaign. He also writes that accusations of Russian interference began \"bubbling up\" after thousands of Democratic emails were leaked in July 2016.\n\nWylie writes that, based on what he'd seen in London, he had a \"hunch\" that Cambridge Analytica could be \"knowingly or unknowingly working with the Russians to sway the election.\"\n\nThere were accusations of Russian interference in the U.S. election as early as summer 2016.

(Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press)\n\nIn his book, Wylie describes how he approached \"someone in the Trudeau government \u2014 I'll call him 'Alan,'\" with his concerns. Wylie said that while he and \"Alan\" agreed they should pass on the information to U.S. officials, they didn't want to do so publicly for fear of being accused of interfering with another country's election.\n\nWylie said they decided instead to arrange an unofficial meeting with \"White House staffers\" during a conference on data and democracy in Berkeley, Calif.\n\nThey were \"crowded around a picnic table near the UC Berkeley campus, talking about Cambridge Analytica and Russian involvement in the U.S. presidential election \u2014 all while weed-smoking, backpack-wearing students strolled past,\" he writes.\n\nThe Current asked the Liberal Party for a comment on the meeting Wylie described. Liberal spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro acknowledged that two party officials did attend the conference with Wylie \u2014 the LRB's Director of Research and Insights Alexandre Sevigny and Brett Thalmann, who was managing director of the bureau at the time.\n\nBut Catenaro said that while they did speak together on a public panel, \"election interference was not a discussion point for them on the panel, or otherwise, on their trip.\"\n\nThalmann left the research bureau to become director of administration and special projects in the Prime Minister's Office at the end of 2016.\n\nWylie says that officials in the Obama administration did not heed his concerns because they did not believe Donald Trump would win the presidential election. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nWiley writes that he told Obama officials at the meeting that he believed there were individuals working on Trump's campaign who had ties to foreign intelligence services, and that they had built up a massive social media database that was being deployed on American voters.\n\n\"The reaction that I got was just, sort of, shoulder shrugs,\" Wylie told The Current, adding that U.S. officials at the meeting told him that Trump was \"not going to win, so there's nothing really to worry about.\"\n\nHe added that they felt it was \"more dangerous to be seen as pushing the dial a little bit too much, or somehow interfering in the election.\"\n\n\"I got told that enough times that I thought, 'OK, well maybe I'm overreacting and, you know, OK, they have a point,'\" he said. \"It's kind of crazy to think that Donald Trump would be elected.\"\n\nWylie said that, after Trump was elected in November 2016, he began to receive calls from Canadian officials asking for a briefing on his old Cambridge Analytica boss \u2014 the new president's close adviser, Steve Bannon.\n\nWylie accuses Steve Bannon of using Cambridge Analytica to promote extreme political beliefs in the U.S. (Jonathan Bachman/Reuters)\n\nCompany started out very differently, says Wylie\n\nWylie told The Current that when he first started working for Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) \u2014 Cambridge Analytica's parent firm \u2014 the work was about \"how to use data online to identify people who would be more vulnerable to extremist ideologies, or being targeted by extremist organizations.\"\n\nThat changed, he said, following a major investment by U.S. billionaire Robert Mercer.\n\nWylie said Mercer funded the creation of Cambridge Analytica, focused its operations on the U.S. and put conservative strategist Bannon in charge.\n\nRather than trying to mitigate the problem of extremism and radicalization, he wanted \u2014 in my view \u2014 to promote it. - Christopher Wylie on Steve Bannon\n\nWylie was involved in getting Cambridge Analytica off the ground. He said it became clear Bannon was interested in the same type of people \u2014 those \"more prone to extremist ideation\" \u2014 that SCL had been seeking out.\n\n\"It's just that rather than trying to mitigate the problem of extremism and radicalization, he wanted \u2014 in my view \u2014 to promote it in the United States, for the alt-right,\" he told Petty.\n\nWylie left the company in 2014.\n\n\"I really didn't like how I felt like my work had been completely inverted,\" he told The Current. \"Something that I was working on, you know, to protect our democracies was being used to, you know, attack and undermine our democracies.\"\n\nWylie speaks at a rally about fair voting in London, U.K., in March 2018. (Neil Hall/EPA-EFE)\n\nNo one has a plan to fight this: Wylie\n\nWylie said that, after Trump won, it was \"personally devastating\" to watch Bannon's appointment as the administration's chief strategist and \"to see people that I had seen in the office now holding the levers of power, knowing that these people, at least in my view, are extremists.\"\n\nIn hindsight, he said he thinks he should have pushed his warning more \u2014 but at the time he trusted that the Obama administration would know what to do.\n\n\"The thing that I realized in my journey as a whistleblower ... is that the reaction that I got from a lot of law enforcement and regulatory agencies was confusion and bafflement,\" he said.\n\nCambridge Analytica dissolved in 2018, but Wylie warns that the people who ran it are still working in the sector \u2014 and the methods they used are still viable.\n\n\"We have not effectively found a way to regulate, whether it's social media or the internet, and really put safety measures in place. What happens if China becomes the next Cambridge Analytica?\" he asked.\n\n\"When it comes to this sort of new age of hostile foreign interference and the weaponization of information and propaganda online, there is no plan.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
