But his nefarious influence over the machinations of No 10 stretches back much further, David Cameron claims in his forthcoming memoir.\n\nExtracts printed in Saturday\u2019s Times reveal that, in 2013, Cameron suspected a \u201cbilious\u201d Cummings of \u201cdripping his poison\u201d into the ear of Michael Gove, even though he was no longer serving as a special adviser to the then education secretary.\n\nThe resulting episode led Cameron to warn Gove about the perils of becoming \u201ca wanker\u201d, the former prime minister writes.\n\nIn the extracts, he explains that he had convinced Gove to take a job as chief whip, fearing that his poor reputation among teachers was putting the government\u2019s programme of education reforms at risk. Gove had expressed an interest in the role, had indicated a willingness to take it, having been sounded out, and had even started his work.\n\nBut a bump appeared in the road. \u201cMichael emailed to say he had changed his mind. What had happened? I smelt Dominic Cummings, and totally flipped.\u201d Cameron said that he rang Gove, telling him that he had agreed to the job, must withdraw his email and that he wanted him to take on the role as part of a reshuffle.\n\nThe Times extract continues: \u201cI followed this with a text: \u2018You must realise that I divide the world into team players and wankers. You\u2019ve always been a team player. Please don\u2019t become a wanker\u2019.\u201d Gove went on to serve as chief whip for almost a year.\n\nThe reshuffle was partially precipitated by a remarkable spat between Gove\u2019s Department for Education and the Home Office, then run by Theresa May. Gove was suspected of briefing against the latter, while it was suspected of leaking documents to publicly undermine him.\n\nAnd, the Times extracts reveal, Cameron suspected others close to Gove of having a malign influence. \u201cDominic Cummings was still in the business of bilious briefing to the papers. Having left government in 2013, he could now put his name to his insults. I knew he was still dripping his poison into Michael\u2019s ear as well.\u201d\n\nOther episodes covered in the extracts include Cameron\u2019s time at boarding school, both at Eton, where he smoked cannabis, and earlier at Heatherdown, where he was sent as a seven-year-old and said he was frequently beaten. They also cover his pride at introducing gay marriage and his efforts to promote a no-fly zone to help anti-Gaddafi rebels in Libya.\n\nThe serialisation will continue in the Sunday Times.", "description": "In an extract from his memoir, serialised in the Times, former PM makes claim about Boris Johnson\u2019s senior aide", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5768500614ab58419ced8becfa86ea5929579b6a/0_0_724_434/master/724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b1b13140484ddbed23146245c8ddcc0", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
