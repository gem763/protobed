The company also released tvOS 13.2 as well. It\u2019s been a hard road since iOS 13 first arrived on September 19th, which has widely been reported as buggy and unfinished, and it has since issued a slew of updates at a rapid pace.\n\nUsers who are on the fence about upgrading won\u2019t have a choice if they want to use the new $249 AirPods Pro with noise cancellation, which require Apple devices running at least iOS 13.2, iPadOS 13.2, watchOS 6.1, tvOS 13.2, or macOS Catalina 10.15.1.\n\nApart from AirPod compatibility, iOS 13.2 also brings a significant improvement to the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro\u2019s camera with Deep Fusion, which uses computational photography to improve medium-light settings. It runs entirely in the background and is automatically activated based on the lighting situations. iOS 13.2 also brings a Siri recording opt-in feature, which lets users decide whether they want to share audio recordings of their Siri requests with Apple developers to improve the product. The opt-in feature is about the only new feature for tvOS 13.2, which is getting an update ahead of the Apple TV Plus launch on November 1st.\n\nThe update also brings a few new emoji, including more food, animals, and people with disabilities. There\u2019s HomePod multiuser voice support as well, giving the smart speaker the ability to recognize up to six different voices.\n\nUsers can update to the latest iOS and iPadOS update by going to Settings -> General -> Software Update. Users can update to the new tvOS on their Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K in the Settings.", "description": "Apple\u2019s iOS 13.2 and iPadOS 13.2 are now available for download, bringing new features like the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro\u2019s Deep Fusion camera mode as well as compatibility for the upcoming AirPods Pro and Beats Solo Pro.
