Then, he called on the members of that office to stand and be recognized. They were greeted with a hero\u2019s welcome as those in the audience stood and applauded the staff.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Trump said via Twitter and also on TV that Alabama was among a number of states that \u201cwill most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Hurricane Dorian. Trump\u2019s warning was outdated as no model at that point had the storm moving into the state.\n\nThe NWS Birmingham office \u2015 without mentioning the president \u2015 posted correct information on Twitter:\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nTrump then spent the week insisting that he was correct, at one point using a doctored map to show the supposed path of the storm. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees NWS, issued an unsigned media release backing Trump\u2019s false claims.\n\nBut on Monday, Uccellini defended his forecasters, saying they didn\u2019t even know about Trump\u2019s statement when they issued the correction.\n\n\u201cThey shut down what they thought were rumors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey quickly acted to reassure their partners, the media and the public \u2014 with strong language \u2014 that there was no threat.\u201d\n\nUccellini praised the forecasters for acting \u201cwith one thing in mind: public safety.\u201d", "description": "Louis Uccellini praises the office for taking quick action to deliver correct information about Hurricane Dorian after Trump's false warning.", "authors": ["Overnight Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d773b6a2400002e2a77c93c.jpeg?cache=gouwb0og88&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
