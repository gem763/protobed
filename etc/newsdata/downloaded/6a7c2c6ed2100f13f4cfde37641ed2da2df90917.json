The Myrtle Beach Police Department tells TIME that when officers were called to the scene, they discovered the SUV was locked and abandoned. \u201cIt was in what looked like a washout and it was stuck there,\u201d a police spokesman says.\n\nBrittany and Nick Feliciano identified themselves as the \u201cactual owners of the red Jeep\u201d on a GoFundMe page started to raise money for donation money for UNICEF to aid with Dorian relief in the Bahamas.\n\nAt the time, according to the WMBF News report, the anonymous owner said that his cousin had borrowed the jeep to drive to the beach and capture a video of the pre-storm sunrise, but ended up getting stuck. \u201cSo he got on the beach and started driving it,\u201d WMBF News quoted him saying. \u201cI guess there\u2019s that runoff there and he didn\u2019t realize it was in front of him, he was looking out the window when he went off and got stuck.\u201d\n\nThe owner went on to say that although his cousin tried to get help removing the jeep, the steadily worsening weather conditions made it impossible.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop people from flocking to the beach to take photos and videos of the jeep as the tide rose and heavy rains and winds began to batter the coastline. And of course, there were red jeep memes.\n\n\u201cWhat we ended up doing was closing off that area of the beach,\u201d the police spokesman tells TIME. \u201cThe issue was that people kept climbing onto [the jeep] and getting near it during the storm. With the waves moving in and out, it became very dangerous.\u201d\n\nOne video taken at the scene even shows a man standing next to the jeep while playing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d on the bagpipes. However, the funeral dirge turned out to be a little premature, as the SUV survived the night on the beach without getting carried away by the ocean.\n\nThe jeep was removed from the beach on Friday morning. \u201cIt took a backhoe and lifted it up and pulled it right off the beach,\u201d the police spokesman says. \u201cLast I saw, [the jeep was] being loaded onto a tow truck and I\u2019m not sure where it went from there.\u201d\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "description": "A jeep that was stuck on Myrtle Beach when Hurricane Dorian hit the South Carolina shore was removed by authorities.", "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/myrtle-beach-jeep.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1"}
