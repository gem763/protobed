(AP) - Vanderbilt has a new men\u2019s basketball coach in Jerry Stackhouse along with a revamped roster featuring six new Commodores.\n\nAnd Stackhouse is ready to put the past, well, in the past.\n\nThe 20-game skid to end last season cost Bryce Drew his coaching job after three years on the Commodores\u2019 bench, but it\u2019s not a topic of conversation. So much turnover has followed the disappointing 9-23 season during which Vanderbilt became the first team in 65 years to go winless in the Southeastern Conference. That record is one reason why the Commodores have been picked to finish last in the SEC this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the rearview mirror,\u201d sophomore guard Aaron Nesmith said.\n\nFirst-year athletic director Malcolm Turner went outside college basketball for his first hire, bringing in Stackhouse who spent last season as an assistant with the NBA\u2019s Memphis Grizzlies with a 79-33 record as a G League coach for Toronto. Stackhouse coached that team to the G League Finals twice and won a title. Stackhouse had a couple of NBA interviews lined up and decided to go to college with a six-year deal.\n\nThe man who played 18 seasons in the NBA isn\u2019t worried about what Vanderbilt has been through before he arrived. He\u2019s focused only on the players he has right now and whether they do what he asks of them.\n\n\u201cWhen they buy into what we\u2019re trying to do and able to have some success, I\u2019m pretty sure the followers will come \u2026,\u201d Stackhouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s great we don\u2019t have a lot of expectations from the outside, but we have a lot of expectations for ourselves because of how we work and how we approach things and how we teach, and hopefully the teaching and the learning and the accountability that we put on top of that can bear some good fruit.\u201d\n\nSome other thing to look for during the Vanderbilt\u2019s 2019-20 season:\n\nRETURNING COMMODORES\n\nSix are back after a painful season led by junior guard Saben Lee and the 6-foot-6 Nesmith who averaged 11 points and 5.5 rebounds as a freshman. Lee took over last season as point guard when Darius Garland, now in the NBA with Cleveland, decided not to return after a knee injury five games into last season. Lee started all 32 games and led the team in scoring with 12.7 points and 3.8 assists a game.\n\nGuard Maxwell Evans and forwards Matthew Moyer and Clevon Brown started a combined 19 games. Brown is the only senior on the roster.\n\nNEW FACES\n\nStackhouse and his coaching staff had to work to replace the six departees. He kept Dylan Disu, a 6-9 four-star recruit, and guard Scotty Pippen Jr., yes the son of former NBA star Scottie Pippen, who had verbally committed to Drew. Stackhouse also landed Notre Dame transfer DJ Harvey. Stackhouse also added some size in a pair of 6-10 players in Quentin Millora-Brown, who transferred from Rice, and Oton Jankovic from Croatia.\n\nThe newcomers will get a chance to play early.\n\n\u201cIn our case, some of our best players on the floor are going to be some of our younger guys,\u201d Stackhouse said.\n\nENGAGED PUPIL\n\nNesmith plays the same position Stackhouse did in the NBA is the same size as his new coach. For a guard who came in as a top recruit a year ago with NBA aspirations, Nesmith sees his new coach as someone he can learn a lot from.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been where I want to be,\u201d Nesmith said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the league for 18 years, and he\u2019s done it at a high, competitive level so everything he says I listen to. I watch him. I listen to him. I just try to (do) as much as he tells me to do.\u201d\n\nTAKING POINT\n\nLee is the easy pick to play point guard again. Stackhouse says he can see both Lee and Pippen, currently backing up Lee, being on the court together to help Vandy close out a game.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nStackhouse has put together a schedule giving him time starting with the opener Nov. 6 against Southeast Missouri State to grow into the fast-paced way he wants the Commodores to play. They visit Richmond on Nov. 14, host Buffalo on Dec. 3 and play Loyola-Chicago in a Basketball Hall of Fame Showcase before wrapping up the nonconference slate Jan. 4 against SMU. Then SEC play begins Jan. 8 at Auburn with the Commodores trying to end a 19-game skid in conference play.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vanderbilt has a new men's basketball coach in Jerry Stackhouse along with a revamped roster featuring six new Commodores.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Teresa M.
