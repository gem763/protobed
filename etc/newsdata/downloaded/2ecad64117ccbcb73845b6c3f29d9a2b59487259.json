She is just fuming that I \u2018didn\u2019t get Jamie recruiting\u2019 for her like she asked me to...\"\n\npoll loading Was Coleen right to publicly name Vardy as leak? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nDanielle hit out at Becky while speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield during the This Morning debate.\n\nOn seeing the post for the first time, Danielle said: \"I wasn\u2019t that shocked. I\u2019ve had run-ins with Rebekah before over similar things. Obviously like everyone else you read it and are like 'oh my gosh', but I wasn\u2019t as shocked seeing who it allegedly was.\n\n\"It's definitely come out of Becky's account. I think she did it. Sadly I really do. It's a shame as she probably didn't think she was going to get caught out.\n\n\"I think that if she was feeding the press, maybe she would get more headlines for herself. I could never do that to somebody.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhen presenter Holly Willoughby questioned Rebekah's motives, Celebrity Big Brother star Danielle said money was not the issue.\n\nShe said: \"It's obviously not the money it's the press issue. Maybe she thought she\u2019d get more headlines for herself.\"\n\nDanielle, who has three sons with footballer Jamie O'Hara, responded to Coleen's explosive post about being betrayed with three rat emojis.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe gave her sympathy to fellow Scouser Coleen, who ended her explosive post with the words: \"It\u2019s......... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"\n\nDanielle told Holly and Phillip: \"I think she must be sitting there not knowing who to trust. It's not a nice situation to be in at all.\n\n\"I think Coleen is a very private person. I know she's in the public eye. She wants to keep her personal life private. It's a massive thing for her.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDanielle believes Coleen released her lengthy statement \"in the heat of the moment\" out of anger at Becky.\n\nShe added: \"I think probably all Coleen wants is a quiet life. Obviously this person that has been doing the stories hadn\u2019t been respecting that.\"\n\nDanielle was joined by fellow former WAG Lizzie Cundy, who claimed she would \"mediate\" between Becky and Coleen.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nBecky took just minutes to respond directly to Coleen's post on Instagram and strongly denied the allegations.\n\nThe pregnant I'm A Celebrity star wrote: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\"I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The former WAG called on Rebekah to 'name the person' she claims had access to her Instagram account during the Coleen Rooney scandal", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Afp Getty Images", "Twitter", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551308.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_101019TM_5742JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
