Far more gets in than that because they\u2019re not intercepting every bit of mail.\u201d\n\nThe revelations come after a whistleblower told the Record the spread of psychoactive drugs was being \u201cmasked\u201d in Scots jails as managers struggle to keep up.\n\nIn an effort to evade guards, the drugs dubbed New Pyschotic Subtances \u2013 are smuggled in soaked into the letters.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nA tiny scrap of the paper can then be burned in an e-cigarette, or vape and sold on for up to 10 times the street price.\n\nBut the super-strength substance is having a devastating effect \u2013 provoking shocking levels of violence or leaving users like \u201czombies\u201d.\n\nCons running up crippling debts are being beaten or forced into humiliating acts if they fail to pay.\n\nIn some cases, dealers make them perform degrading acts just for a hit and film the shock antics on mobile phones.\n\nIn June, it emerged more than 1,600 prisoners needed medical attention for NPS abuse.\n\nAnd in some cases, officers who inadvertently inhale the fumes are being left needing hospital treatment.\n\nAt Addiewell, two officers were rushed to hospital after being exposed to NPS at the jail in 2017.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nThe source said: \u201cSo many cons are hooked on it and will do anything for a fix and dealers simply feed that demand by bringing it in.\n\n\u201cIt comes in packages over walls, dropped off by drones or soaked into letters.\n\n\u201cThe rewards are so big for dealers.
