Recently, it was delayed due to director Taika Waititi\u2019s major commitments elsewhere. And while some viewed that as another death knell on another failed adaptation of Akira, Waititi isn\u2019t so sure.\n\nTalking recently to IGN, the director spoke about his schedule, the conflicts that led to Akira being at least temporarily shelved, and his eagerness to get back to it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the timing with Akira, because we\u2019ve been working really hard on the script, we had to keep pushing back the start date for the shoot,\u201d Waititi explained. \u201cWe ended up having to push it a couple weeks too far, which actually ate into the Thor schedule, because they were very close together. And that got pushed again and again, and it just got too far into the Thor schedule to be able to make it work. And my first commitment was to Marvel to make that film, so now I\u2019ve kind of had to take Akira and sort of shift it around to the tail-end of Thor and move it down a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the script would give the production trouble. Katushiro Otomo\u2019s original work is a sprawling, dense epic, and the anime adaptation only functioned by essentially cutting it into pieces and turning the first third or so into a self-contained (albeit confusing) story. It\u2019s been called unfilmable for a reason.\n\nBut it\u2019s valuable to know that Waititi will be getting back to it sometime. Though, honestly, maybe some projects should just be left undone.", "description": "Western anime adaptations are always fraught and complex, but few have been as troubled in their development as Akira.
