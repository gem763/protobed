The company announced in its quarterly earnings call today that it added more users \u2014 7 million in the last quarter \u2014 and generated more money, but it\u2019s still unprofitable and lags far behind other social platforms like Facebook and Instagram in terms of user base size. Instagram\u2019s ephemeral Stories product counts 500 million users per day as of January this year, while Snapchat counts 210 million daily active users total.\n\nStill, in his prepared remarks, CEO Evan Spiegel detailed how important AR will be for the company\u2019s future. Spiegel says every daily active user interacts with a Snap AR product nearly 30 times a day on average. These come in the form of AR Lenses and filters that place masks or virtual elements on the user\u2019s face or in their environment. He also notes that the Snap community has created more than 600,000 Lenses.\n\nUsers created more than 600,000 Lenses for Snapchat\n\nThat sounds like a high figure, but we don\u2019t know how many filters Instagram users have built for its much larger platform. Instagram opened its filter program up to the broader public earlier this summer, and much of Snap\u2019s future success will depend on staying one step ahead of Instagram before its rival\u2019s sheer scale makes competing too difficult.\n\nSpiegel also says the company is looking to integrate AR wearables into its lineup within the next seven to 10 years, starting with its third-generation Spectacles glasses, which the company introduced in August. The glasses come with an added camera so that people can overlay these AR effects on their content, and they go on sale in November.\n\nIn the more immediate term, the company says it expects \u201csignificant\u201d potential revenue to come from AR advertisements, and it\u2019s focusing on scaling its platform to make AR more personalized and to help the company make money from the technology. Snap has seen success in the past turning AR filters into a viral phenomenon that extends to other social platforms. That was before people started creating filters for Instagram, however, and with Facebook also looking to build AR glasses, Snap will need to move faster and more effectively than its biggest competition if it wants to win as the dominant AR platform.", "description": "In its quarterly earnings call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said Snapchat added users and generated more revenue, but the company is setting its sights on augmented reality to propel it into the future.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xs4HuQvReou8Jq4wvSvaDDk6WRk=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9030239/snapChatPattern_BW.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
