REUTERS/Pakorn Porncheewangkul\n\nThe complaint over four paintings, displayed last week at a shopping mall in northeastern Thailand, highlights how ultra-conservative Buddhist groups have been emboldened to go farther than establishment religious authorities in combating perceived threats to their faith.\n\nBuddhism, followed by more than 90% of Thais, is one of three traditional pillars of Thai society, alongside the nation and the monarchy.\n\nThe paintings were removed from the exhibition last week and the artist - a fourth-year university student whose name has been withheld for her safety - had to publicly apologise to northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima province\u2019s chief monk in front of the provincial governor.\n\nIn the past, that might have been the end of the incident.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the hardline group Buddhist Power of the Land said it had filed a police complaint against the artist and four others involved in the exhibition, on the grounds that comparing the Buddha to an action figure was disrespectful.\n\nThe group wants the five prosecuted under a law against insulting religion that allows imprisonment of up to seven years.\n\n\u201cThe paintings dishonoured and offended Buddhists and harmed a national treasure,\u201d Buddhist Power of the Land representative Charoon Wonnakasinanone told Reuters.\n\nThe group also wants the paintings destroyed.\n\nUnder Thai law, police must investigate a complaint and recommend whether there are grounds to pursue criminal charges, a process that usually takes at least seven days.\n\nESTABLISHMENT VS HARDLINERS\n\nThailand\u2019s official Buddhist authorities oppose criminal charges against the artist.\n\nPongporn Pramsaneh, director of the Office of National Buddhism, told Reuters he considered the matter closed after the public apology.\n\n\u201cWhoever want to take legal action, we will not get involved,\u201d Pongporn said.\n\nFew have been jailed under the law, though there have been some cases of fines, including against tourists with Buddha tattoos or souvenir statues.\n\nThe artist could not be reached for comment, and the shopping centre that held the exhibition declined to comment.\n\nThe controversy has raised the profile for the paintings, which were all sold last week.\n\nOne of the buyers then auctioned his painting for charity, and it sold for 600,000 baht ($19,693).\n\nSeller Pakorn Porncheewangkul paid only 4,500 baht for the painting last week, but he says he is giving 100,000 baht of the profits to the artist and the rest to the intensive care unit at the local hospital.\n\nPakorn said he didn\u2019t see anything sacrilegious about the paintings depicting Ultraman as the Buddha.\n\n\u201cBuddhism is heroic as it rids people of suffering, so the Buddhism in this painting will help ease the physical suffering of others (at the hospital)\u201d he said.\n\nCHANGING VIEWS\n\nSurapot Taweesak, a Buddhist scholar, said the controversy showed the reforms of Buddhism that took place under the previous military government, which aimed to clean up temples and the monkhood stalked by scandals, have failed.\n\nPaintings of Japanese superhero \"Ultraman\" with Thai-style Buddha's head are seen in Bangkok, Thailand September 11, 2019.

And at the same time, a reactionary hardline movement has arisen that sees Buddhism as under threat and in need of defence the religious establishment is not providing.\n\nThe trend also sparked a Buddhist nationalist party, Pandin Dharma Party, modelled after similar political movements in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, which contested July\u2019s elections under the slogan of Buddhism under threat.\n\n\u201cIn the Ultraman case, the law is dragged in instead of a normal debate,\u201d Surapot said. \u201cThis case reflects the insecurity felt by many monks and followers about their religion.\u201d", "description": "A group of Buddhist hardliners in Thailand filed a police complaint against a young female artist on Wednesday over paintings that depict images of the Buddha as the 1960s Japanese superhero character Ultraman.", "authors": ["Panu Wongcha-Um", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428933890&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B07U", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
