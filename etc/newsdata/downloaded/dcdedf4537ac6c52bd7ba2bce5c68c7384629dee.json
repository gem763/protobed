GM owns 6.6% of Lyft.\n\nMarkets Insider GM's shrinking stake\u201a which was also affected by a drawdown in its partnership with PSA, doesn't necessarily mean the bet is underwater quite yet. Its original $500 million investment was made in January 2016 as part of Lyft's Series F funding round. At current prices, that stake appears to be worth about $829 million, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe investment was touted as a partnership to further self-driving technology advances for both companies.\n\n\"We've seen our business changing and the mobility business changing more in the last five years than it did in the 50 years prior,\" GM's president, Daniel Ammann, told Business Insider at the time. \"We want to lead that change, and this [partnership] is an important step along the way.\"\n\nIn the almost four years since, both companies have made notable progress when it comes to autonomy. Lyft, which now offers the ability to hail Waymo self-driving vans in Phoenix, has provided \"well over\" 50,000 self-driving rides in Las Vegas through its partnership with Aptiv.\n\n\"The first generation of autonomous vehicles will only be able to do a small percentage of trips,\" Lyft CEO Logan Green said in August. \"And they'll be critical that they're rolled out on a platform such as Lyft, so that the rest of the rides that are unable to be served by an autonomous vehicle, can be fulfilled by a driver.\"\n\nLyft is scheduled to report its own third-quarter earnings Wednesday, ahead of which executives have said the company expects to become profitable sooner than expected. The company is also hosting a panel of its self-driving leadership next month in California to give progress updates.", "description": "Between Lyft's 28% rout and troubles with a PSA partnership, GM's third-quarter earnings took a big hit.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db83f92dee0193c5f3bfa32?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
