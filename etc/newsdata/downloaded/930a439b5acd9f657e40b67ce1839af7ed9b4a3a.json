While this is a fairly simple outpatient procedure \u2014 and one of the most common surgeries in the country \u2014 there are decisions to make and occasional complications. Here\u2019s what to know about cataract surgery.\n\nAD\n\nWhen to consider surgery\n\nSigns that you may have cataracts or that existing cataracts are worsening can be subtle. They include increasing difficulty seeing well at night (especially when facing an oncoming car\u2019s headlights), having to make the text on your computer screen larger and sensing that colors are fading.\n\nAD\n\nWhen might cataract surgery be appropriate? \u201cIf you\u2019re happy with your current vision, don\u2019t do anything,\u201d Devgan says. But if vision problems are affecting activities such as reading or driving, consider seeing an ophthalmologist to discuss cataract surgery.\n\nWhat to expect before surgery\n\nIf you and the ophthalmologist agree that you\u2019d benefit from cataract surgery, the doctor will give you a thorough eye exam a week or two before the procedure.\n\nAD\n\nYour doctor may also recommend a test such as an electrocardiogram (EKG). According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, tests such as an EKG or a complete blood count may make surgical procedures safer for some people, but most don\u2019t need them before eye surgery.\n\nAnd having such pre-op tests needlessly may have negative effects. For instance, research published online in June in JAMA Internal Medicine found that nearly 16 percent of older adults without heart disease who had an EKG before cataract surgery had one or more potential \u201ccascade events\u201d within 90 days, such as medical treatment, additional testing, doctors\u2019 office visits or hospitalization.\n\nAD\n\nYou\u2019ll also choose new lenses before cataract surgery. Standard monofocal lenses, which usually help with distance vision, are often included in the price of surgery and provide excellent clarity. But you may still need glasses for reading afterward, says Neal Shorstein, an ophthalmologist and associate chief of quality for Kaiser Permanente in Walnut Creek, Calif.\n\nAD\n\nMultifocal lenses, which can help with near and far vision, may eliminate the need for eyeglasses but can cost more than $2,000 an eye out of pocket. And you may still have difficulties with nighttime driving glare afterward.\n\nDuring surgery and after\n\nCataract surgery is usually done at outpatient surgical centers, but some eye surgeons do the procedure in a hospital or private medical office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no research to support better outcomes in one venue over another,\u201d Shorstein says.\n\nAD\n\nMost people receive a light sedative and an anesthetic to numb the eye, Devgan says. The surgery takes less than 30 minutes, and you should have improved vision the day after. (For surgery on both eyes, the procedures are often performed several weeks apart.)\n\nAD\n\nBecause the sedation may leave you groggy, you\u2019ll need a ride home and should take it easy for at least a few hours.\n\nCut complication risks\n\nOverall, the likelihood of complications after cataract surgery is low. But call your eye doctor right away if you notice increased redness, pain or discomfort; decreasing vision; or other concerns.\n\nSome research estimates that about 1 percent of cataract surgery patients have some temporary vision loss from macular edema (eye swelling), and less than 1 percent develop an eye infection.\n\nYour doctor will probably prescribe corticosteroid eye drops to lower the chance of macular edema and possibly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops. Antibiotic eye drops can help ward off infection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome research shows that many people use eye drops incorrectly, so have your doctor show you how. \u201cWash your hands thoroughly before putting in eye drops,\u201d Shorstein says, \u201cand avoid touching your eyeball or any other surface with the eyedropper tip.\u201d\n\nOlder research suggests that droopy eyelids may affect 10 percent or more of people after surgery (usually returning to normal within six months).\n\nBut Devgan says droopy eyelids after surgery are rare today. If you experience this, your doctor might prescribe apraclonidine eye drops to reduce droopiness short term.\n\nCopyright 2019, Consumer Reports Inc.\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.
