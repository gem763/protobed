Here are the top ten cities where $1 million can go the furthest, according to research from SmartAsset.\n\nJonesboro, Arkansas: National rank 10\n\nJonesboro, which is also known as the \u201cCity of Churches\u201d in Arkansas, will give a retiree with $1 million the spending power of 28.1 years. If this estimate is correct, a person who retires at age 65 will max out their million dollars a little after their 93rd birthday.\n\nConway, Arkansas: National rank 9\n\nArkansas gets a second spot on the top ten list with its 65,000-plus resident city known as Conway. This city that is about a two hour drive away from Jonesboro, and has a slightly lower cost of living, giving retirees with $1 million 28.4 years of spending power.\n\nAccording to SmartAsset\u2019s numbers, residents who retire here at 65 will use up their million dollars around three months after their 93rd birthday.\n\nWichita Falls, Texas: National rank 8\n\nTechnically, in the Texas city of Wichita Falls $1 million will last a retiree 28.59 years, according to SmartAsset\u2019s estimate. However, it very nearly ties in seventh place with Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\nIn this Texan stomping ground for cattle ranchers those who retire at age 65 will spend their entire million dollars about seven months after their 93rd birthday.\n\nKalamazoo, Michigan: National rank 7\n\nIn 2014, NerdWallet named Kalamazoo as one of the best cities for work-life balance. It turns out this metropolitan area in the southwestern part of Michigan is also friendly to retirees who have seven figures saved.\n\nResidents who retire at age 65 with a million dollars in Kalamazoo can expect to run out of funds after 28.6 years, which means they\u2019ll surpass the age of 93 by seven or so months.\n\nMuskogee, Oklahoma: National rank 6\n\nIt\u2019s another near tie for two cities in Oklahoma and Tennessee, however, the city of Muskogee falls short by .02, which earns it sixth place by technicality, according to SmartAsset\u2019s rankings.\n\nMuskogee retirees who call it quits with a million dollars at age 65 can spread out their money about 28.87 years \u2013 meaning they will run out of funds about 10 months after their 93rd birthday.\n\nKnoxville, Tennessee: National rank 5\n\nKnoxville, the \u201cMarble City\u201d and home of Mountain Dew is the official halfway point on SmartAsset\u2019s top ten list. It snags fifth place with an estimate that says retirees can make a million dollars last for 28.89 years.\n\nThis bustling city that is 181 miles away from Tennessee\u2019s state capitol can help retirees nearly reach age 94 with a million dollars. Funds will run dry about 10 months after a person\u2019s 93rd birthday.\n\nRichmond, Indiana: National rank 4\n\nIndiana\u2019s city of Richmond nearly ties with Tennessee\u2019s other ranking city on this list \u2013 Memphis. However, this competing cradle of recorded jazz earns the number four spot with a million dollars lasting retirees approximately 29.75 years, according to SmartAsset.\n\nPeople who retire in Richmond at the age of 65 with this amount of money will have enough to last until nine months after their 94th birthday.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nMemphis, Tennessee: National rank 3\n\nMemphis has a slight advantage over Richmond by extending a retiree\u2019s savings to .03 of a year. But, perhaps living in a city that is known for its barbeque, blues and rock-n-roll is an added bonus.\n\nA million dollars for retirement can last in this Tennessee city for 29.78 years, according to SmartAsset, which buys a little extra time \u2013 however, not by much. Similar to Richmond, a millionaire retiree will run out of funds about nine months after their 94th birthday, give or take.\n\nMcAllen, Texas: National rank 2\n\nMcAllen is one of the most populous cities in Texas, which isn't surprising given its incredibly low cost of living. It earns second place on SmartAsset\u2019s list. According to their numbers, a million dollars can last a retiree 31.3 years.\n\nIf a person retires here with that amount of cash, they can expect to reach the end of their funds about three or so months after their 96th birthday.\n\nHarlingen, Texas: National rank 1\n\nComing in at number one and wearing the crown as the city where a million dollars for retirees can go the farthest is the modest Texan metropolis of Harlingen. It can be found at the southeastern edge of Texas \u2013 about 30 miles away from the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 and is known as \"The Capital of the Rio Grande Valley.\"\n\nResidents who retire in Harlingen at age 65 can expect their million dollars to last a generous 31.7 years. That means funds won't run dry until about eight months after a person\u2019s 96th birthday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Do you think a million dollars is enough to retire?
