Will comedy miss him? There are moments of vintage Izzard in Wunderbar, as tigers pause to pray before hunting their dinner, and William the Conqueror learns krav maga. But they get lost amid a superfluity of waffle. And there\u2019s a weird dissonance between all this featherlight surrealism and Izzard\u2019s save-the-world ambitions, which at his misjudged encore feel practically messianic.\n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that the crowd applauds his platitudes about love versus hate and improving the global population\u2019s life chances. But his rallying cries at the curtain call want for self-irony, while his theory of the universe that precedes it is less profound than he seems to think.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest From dinosaurs to Bruce Wayne \u2026 Eddie Izzard. Photograph: Amanda Searle\n\nAll of which might be easier to forgive in an otherwise tight comedy show. But Wunderbar isn\u2019t that. It finds Izzard tracing the planet\u2019s history (and scorning religion) \u201cfrom the big bang to last Tuesday\u201d, via dinosaurs on quiz shows, the first ever human conversation, and, er, a rumination on the superheroes we would get if other species were, like Bruce Wayne, crossed with a bat.\n\nEach of those routines find Izzard in fine form, role-playing odd animal encounters in English and gobbledegook, following the thread of his fizzy logic and chortling at his own jokes. There are also rare forays into personal material \u2013 about his family, his marathons, his adventures in sea swimming. But in most cases, he needs to self-edit rather more strictly, both in the moment (does he need to articulate every thought that enters his head?) and across the span of the show, several of whose routines feel \u2013 even by Izzard\u2019s standards \u2013 indulgent and inconsequential.\n\nEddie Izzard: \u2018Everything I do in life is trying to get my mother back\u2019 Read more\n\nIzzard jokes more than once that this or that riff is for his own amusement. Certainly, over two-and-three-quarter hours, the show seldom feels as if it\u2019s been honed to maximise public effect. Then comes that climactic tonal switchback, from frivolity to political piety. You could carve an excellent 75 minutes of comedy out of Wunderbar. But for now, it\u2019s all a bit overblown.\n\n\u2022 At Brighton Dome, 29 September. At King\u2019s theatre, Glasgow, 2-6 October. Then touring until 16 November.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
