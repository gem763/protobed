But now the fund is in damage-control mode after WeWork canceled its IPO.\n\nThe office-sharing company\u2019s fall from grace has been dramatic. In its last round of private funding, it boasted a $47 billion valuation. But then growing concerns about steep losses and the company\u2019s governance structure prompted the CEO to resign and pushed the company\u2019s valuation to under $10 billion, according to some reports.\n\nWith Uber\u2019s and Slack\u2019s respective market values down big since their public debuts, SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund is facing billions in losses. This has sparked questions from the fund\u2019s backers over how SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son lost his Midas touch.\n\nSurprise over Son\n\nThe dominant tone in coverage of the WeWork debacle has been one of surprise that Son, who acquired a deserved reputation as a visionary with SoftBank\u2019s early investments in Yahoo and Chinese e-commerce platform Alibaba BABA, -1.00%, could have so badly misjudged a business and its founder. But for those who understand the venture capital industry and SoftBank\u2019s history in Japan, its current problems aren\u2019t so shocking.\n\nThe common image of SoftBank is of a cutting-edge Japanese technology firm. But, in fact, SoftBank is a strange hybrid of unsexy subsidiaries rooted firmly in traditional, industrial Japan. SoftBank is essentially a telecom company.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make much sense then, and it makes even less sense now.\n\nA large number of SoftBank\u2019s executives come from the railway industry through its 2004 purchase of Japan Telecom, which emerged from the privatization of Japan Railways. The company\u2019s executive team comes from that staid industry, along with bankers and private-equity specialists picked up in SoftBank\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Fortress Investment Group.\n\nTwo moves\n\nSon has had two basic moves since the earliest days of SoftBank. The first was to buy distressed assets on the cheap and use them to create cash flow for further operations and acquisitions. That includes his purchase of the Comdex computer trade show and the Ziff Davis publishing company in 1995, followed later by Japan Telecom.\n\nHis second strategy was to throw a ton of money at digital start-ups. This strategy led to a lot of bets that didn\u2019t pay off and two that would make him famous: tens of millions of dollars invested in Yahoo and Alibaba.\n\nThis history makes it easier to understand where the Vision Fund went off the rails. Son had always made large bets in hopes of owning a market, but mostly did so on digitally native companies that didn\u2019t have the massive upfront costs associated with a brick-and-mortar business, the exact opposite of Uber and WeWork.\n\nLike Yahoo and Alibaba, those investments had leaders who seemed like visionaries, but they lacked that digital advantage that made scaling so profitable. Son\u2019s strategy of throwing more money at founders than they had asked for remained the same, but that money just got thrown to people in vastly different business models that required heavy investments in things like drivers, insurance and real estate.\n\nIf Son were truly following the model that had made him one of the world\u2019s richest men, he would have never sunk billions into Uber and WeWork. He wouldn\u2019t have been the one to watch as they became distressed assets in his own portfolio. He would\u2019ve been the one to buy them on the cheap after somebody else had already lost a fortune.\n\nDistressed-asset model\n\nWhich is exactly what he and SoftBank, though not the Vision Fund, just did \u2014 SoftBank\u2019s recent WeWork rescue package perfectly fits with that distressed-asset model, it just so happens that it was his fund was the one that provided, and arguably lost, the initial funding.\n\nThe other now-obvious red flag about the Vision Fund is the breakneck speed at which it was formed and grew. A venture fund usually works on 12- to 14-year feedback cycles, and the process of transferring the \u201cgenius\u201d of the founder to a key successor can take even longer. At the most successful funds like Sequoia, Emergence and Floodgate, successors have all been groomed for years by the original innovators, product experts, entrepreneurs and technologists.\n\nRather than transfer Son\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d to a successor, the executive staff seem to have been making decisions by committee and compromise. This can be a dangerous approach in the venture capital world, where you have to play in the top 10% of investments to get an acceptable return, and in the top 35% just to break even. Decisions based on compromise tend to drive investments toward the middle, rather than the top. The result may be that instead of magnifying Son\u2019s genius, the structure and culture of the Vision Fund has diluted it.\n\nThe SoftBank Vision Fund looks increasingly like an unhealthy attempt to scale with money, rather than with strategy. That it has fallen so hard, so fast, may be shocking now. For those who know Japan, SoftBank, and Son, though, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nPhil Wickham is the former CEO of Kauffman Fellows.
