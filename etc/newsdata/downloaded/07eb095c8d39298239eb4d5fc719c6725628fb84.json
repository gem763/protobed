Just one game, that\u2019s all. But it was a game that gave Carolina Panthers fans something they haven\u2019t had in quite some time: hope.\n\nStarting in place of the injured Cam Newton, Kyle Allen \u2014 who played high school ball in nearby Scottsdale \u2014 absolutely torched the Arizona Cardinals in a 38-20 win. Allen threw for 261 yards and four touchdowns with zero interceptions. The highlight: a 52-yarder to D.J. Moore just before halftime that put Carolina ahead 14-10, a lead the Panthers would never relinquish.\n\nComing into this game, Allen had played a grand total of two games in his NFL career, both last season for Carolina. His career totals: 266 yards, two touchdowns, both of which he topped Sunday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKyle Allen and fellow backup Will Grier are enjoying life. (Getty)\n\nNewton is as durable as they come \u2014 this was only the sixth game he\u2019s missed to injury since 2011, despite the fact that he gets hammered every single game \u2014 but even he has his limits. The question now is whether he\u2019ll be ready for next week\u2019s game on the road against Houston. If he\u2019s not, Allen will be ready. And if Allen puts up another strong road game, conversation\u2019s going to get very interesting around Charlotte.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
