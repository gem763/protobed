The 24-year-old from Killarney in Ireland is eloquent and assured and, apart from being able to speak four languages, carries the same addiction to winning as all the great champions.\n\nMurphy has also overcome resentment in the weighing room and taken punches from older jockeys who did not like the speed of his rise after he left Ireland for England six years ago. He is now a model champion and could become the jockey that racing will rely on most to fill the giant hole that Frankie Dettori will leave when, eventually, the little master retires.\n\nTalking Horses: Dee Ex Bee set to miss Champions Day after track switch Read more\n\n\u201cI grew up watching Kieren Fallon being champion jockey,\u201d Murphy continues. \u201cAnd in the last few years I\u2019ve looked up to champions like Sylvestre De Sousa and Jim Crowley. I\u2019ve got huge admiration for them and wanted to become champion. Now that I\u2019ve done it I want to do it again. Money doesn\u2019t motivate me in any way. I just want to win many championships.\u201d\n\nMurphy smiles on a crisp and sunlit morning in Newmarket as he compares himself to racing\u2019s most famous champion who will turn 49 in December. \u201cI\u2019ve won 13 Group Ones. Frankie Dettori has won well over 200 Group Ones. I think he\u2019s ridden 17 this year. That\u2019s phenomenal. I\u2019ll never get to his level. At 24, Frankie was streets above where I am now.\u201d\n\nHe leans forward to stress his enthusiasm. \u201cI still idolise Frankie Dettori. I actually named my dog Frankie. I never told Frankie about the dog but we get on really well. We just have to try and avoid each other because we\u2019re too mad together. I really look up to him. But when I was a kid, back in Ireland, I wasn\u2019t allowed to look up to him. My grandad said I couldn\u2019t because his favourite rider was Timmy Murphy [the Irish jockey then known for his exploits over jumps].\u201d\n\nDettori steadied Murphy during the young Irishman\u2019s slump this summer \u2013 soon after he got into trouble after failing a breath test in June. \u201cMay was going supremely well.\u201d Murphy remembers. \u201cI had a really good week and I was excited about Royal Ascot. I had more rides there than everybody except Frankie and Ryan Moore. I thought I had some genuine chances. Then came a massive reality check.\u201d\n\nOn 16 June, Murphy\u2019s breath test reading was well under the drink driving limit (35 micrograms per 100 millilitres) but he still exceeded the accepted limit for drinking as a jockey and Murphy does not attempt to excuse himself.\n\n\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d he says of a misdemeanour that cost him a day\u2019s racing at Salisbury. \u201cIf you\u2019re dehydrated the day before and you consume alcohol, don\u2019t go to bed on time, don\u2019t hydrate the next day and don\u2019t eat anything, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nDid the failed test affect his racing? \u201cYes. It was going round in my mind that I missed three winners that Sunday. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018If I lose the championship by three winners then it\u2019s my fault.\u2019 All the trainers I ride for texted me and I obviously also rang Sheikh Fahad as I\u2019m the retained jockey for Qatar Racing. Everyone was really supportive. But it was so embarrassing. Even now I\u2019m ashamed of it.\u201d\n\nHe allowed that season low to knock him off kilter. \u201cI went from about 12 in front to about 12 behind. I was getting on favourites but my instinct and feel had gone and they weren\u2019t winning. So you get in that rut and you overthink it. But there was a turning point. In late July things started to pick up. Frankie won the Irish Oaks on Star Catcher. I texted him after the race and he said: \u2018Thanks kiddo. Remember I want you to be champion jockey. Forget about the numbers at the moment. Start riding off instinct. I believe in you.\u2019 So the next fortnight I did not look at the championship table. I had the strength not to do it. I was one or two in front and then I got four winners. I had that belief back.\u201d\n\nAfter 166 victories so far this season Murphy is 33 winners clear of the runner-up, Danny Tudhope, and 69 ahead of Crowley in third place. It feels like the start of a new championship reign \u2013 as well as the culmination of a long journey. When he was a boy Murphy wanted to become a champion show-jumper and, as many of the best riders in that sport were based in Germany, he worked hard and learned German. But his life changed when he finally sat on a race horse for the first time at the age of 14.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benbatl ridden by Oisin Murphy wins the Shadwell Joel Stakes at Newmarket in September. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nHis uncle, Jim Culloty, had won the Grand National and the Gold Cup, but he was merciless in dissecting Oisin\u2019s technique. \u201cIn Ireland we have pony and horse races \u2013 it depends on the course. We call them flappers and normally the big races are over two miles. They\u2019re actual race horses, ridden by children, so you develop fantastic horsemanship skills but also lots of bad habits. Like interference-wise. It becomes quite competitive. The falls can be bad and the tracks are tight. I had a couple of concussions. Most Irish boys will start riding race horses aged 10. I was 14. It didn\u2019t come naturally. I remember watching the video replays with my uncle Jim and he made me cry because I was really bad.\u201d\n\nMurphy points out that Fallon was much older than him when he first got on a horse in Ireland. Fallon became a six-time champion jockey and, after Murphy began racing seriously in England in 2013, he often put his fellow Irishman in his place. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Murphy says amid much laughter. \u201cNumerous times. It\u2019s a bit different now and interference rules are stricter. When I started, if a senior jockey wanted your position, he just took it. I love riding for Hughesie [Richard Hughes the former champion jockey turned trainer now] now. But he taught me some lessons. I used to float up into second or third place and Hughesie would decide: \u2018Oh, I\u2019d like to be right where Oisin is now.\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019d just manoeuvre himself into position and push me out the way.\u201d\n\nDid Murphy attempt to fight his corner? \u201cIt really used to depend on my mood and how confident I was on the day. If I had a chance, normally I could keep them off.\u201d\n\nWould someone as feisty as Fallon take it out on Murphy afterwards? \u201cOh no. He\u2019s actually very good to me. Often he would encourage you. He\u2019s a good person.\u201d\n\nI like Fallon too but I\u2019ve heard he once knocked Murphy down in the weighing room. \u201cNo,\u201d Murphy stresses. \u201cKieren Fallon never punched me. He never laid a finger on me. Other jockeys did. They would get physical.\u201d\n\nMurphy is almost amused about the fact that he took a few punches from older jockeys when he began to succeed in England. \u201cI was probably a little cheeky. I suppose I still am \u2013 but nobody would punch me now. If a young lad rides badly in a race, it\u2019s my job to discipline him. But you achieve a lot more saying something quietly, and explaining what was wrong, than losing the plot.\u201d\n\nWhen he was hit by older jockeys did it increase his determination? \u201cOf course. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re trying to prove yourself. I was handed loads of opportunities. Lads see that and there\u2019s envy. It was easy to take because I was just riding winners all the time. But a jockey\u2019s confidence is tempered on a daily basis. No matter how good you are, you\u2019re going to suffer from that all the time. It\u2019s a constant battle, believing in yourself. No jockey is that cocky, actually.\u201d\n\nMurphy rejects the claim that the weighing room is much more cut-throat on the flat than in the less lucrative world of jump racing. \u201cI can\u2019t have that. You wouldn\u2019t find a closer knit weighing room than ours at the moment. James Doyle, Harry Bentley, Andrea Atzeni, Luke Morris, Sylvestre De Sousa and I hang out very often. I get on with all the apprentices. I\u2019m not in the jump jockey\u2019s weighing room but they all work in the same yards and try to steal each other\u2019s rides. As flat jockeys we all have our own jobs.\u201d\n\nHis relationship with Dettori was evident again when the Italian was disappointed not to win the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe for a third year in a row this month. \u201cI tried to help before and after the Arc. Before the race he was nervous so I tried to calm him down. I got him joking a bit. So he was fine. In the race he sat even further back then he would have done normally, the pace was strong and, on slow ground, it turned into a war of attrition. The strongest stayer [Waldgeist] won. We just had to accept that. The best horse in the race doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Murphy chats with Frankie Dettori as they leave the weighing room at Sandown Park in May. Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images\n\nIs Dettori the best jockey Murphy has ever raced against? \u201cYip. Ryan Moore\u2019s very good but I love the way Frankie rides. He doesn\u2019t get into traffic because his hands are so good. He can light them up from the gate, and then get his hands on their neck. That\u2019s such an asset. You often don\u2019t appreciate that because you just see him do it automatically. But swap jockeys and those horses couldn\u2019t be ridden as aggressively. He\u2019s just different class.\u201d\n\nUnlike Dettori, who focuses on the big races, Murphy still wants to win multiple championships while also racking up Group One victories. Is it possible to maintain this relentless strategy for the next few years? \u201cIt is. I want to stay as champion jockey and I think I can do it. I got my license in May 2013 and haven\u2019t been on a holiday since then. I don\u2019t feel it because most of my horses are winning. So it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nToday is a rare day off racing but, as much as he is relishing Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, Murphy suddenly winces. \u201cI had a look at the racing in Chelmsford this evening. I could have ridden two or three of the top favourites. So that\u2019s thrown me now. I could go and jock some young riders off those horses but I\u2019m not doing that. So I\u2019m waiting for Ascot.\u201d\n\nHow will he feel when he walks down the tunnel of applauding jockeys to collect his trophy as champion jockey? \u201cA bit weird. It will feel good for five minutes and then I will have to try get another winner. The buzz is almost over now. It\u2019ll be nice to lift the trophy but I\u2019m already thinking of doing it again next year.\u201d\n\nOisin Murphy will be crowned Champion Jockey on QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday 19 October.
