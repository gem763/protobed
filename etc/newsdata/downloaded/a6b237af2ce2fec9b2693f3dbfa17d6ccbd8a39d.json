Due to the limited number of products currently available we are opening a registration system,\" the new site explains.\n\n\"You have until 28th October to browse the shop and register your interest to buy a product. Please pick one item only, then enter your details and answer the question.\"\n\nWinners are then chosen at random and those lucky enough to be picked get first refusal to make a purchase within 7 working days.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nItems for sale include disco balls made from used police riot helmets and a toddler's counting toy where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck.\n\nFor some things - such as the mugs, spray cans and T-shirts - there are unlimited items available and prices start from \u00a310.\n\nOthers are one-offs or limited supply, with just one stab-vest and 5 children's toy migrant sets available, with prices of a few hundred pounds.\n\nBut even these are well below what they'd fetch on the open market, as the artist warned \"wealthy art collectors\" that they aren't welcome.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBanksy fan Mark Jefferies told Mirror Money: \"The Croydon shop front was brilliant and fans loved seeing the artworks and also discussing some of the serious messages around certain pieces, but the online shop where you can actually buy items takes things to another level.\n\n\"Millions of his fans will be trying to buy the prints and sculptures, and it is the chance of a lifetime for a lucky few hundred to own something signed by Banksy.\n\n\"His work these days is normally only affordable to serious art collectors so it is a great gesture and once again an innovative idea from Banksy.\n\n\"If you want to be sure of owning something though your best bet would be to choose a mug, T-shirt or spray can which are unlimited editions, but I think most people will want the art prints on offer.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe artist did have one more warning for fans making purchases though.\n\n\"All the products are made in an art studio, not a factory,\" the new site reads.\n\n\"Everything is produced by a handful of people using recycled material wherever possible in a workplace culture of daytime drinking. So there isn\u2019t loads of it and it\u2019s not all ready to ship straight away.\n\n\"You are advised that GDP may prove to be a disappointing retail experience - especially if you\u2019re successful in making a purchase.\"", "description": "Fans and low-income collectors rejoice - Banksy is finally letting people buy the things from his famous Croydon shop", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Swns", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20384405.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-ART-BANKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
