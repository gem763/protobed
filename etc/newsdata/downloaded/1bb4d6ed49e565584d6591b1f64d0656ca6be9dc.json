The actress, who played Andrea Beckett, the girlfriend of Lloyd Mullaney, on the cobbles has shared her pregnancy journey with Brooke Vincent and Julia Goulding.\n\nThe three cobbles actresses have regularly taken pictures together with their bumps and Hayley has marvelled at how big she had become by joking on Instagram that it looked like she had stuffed a watermelon down her pants.\n\nThe star recently hit out at trolls who shamed her for sharing pictures of her bump with her followers, with one telling her to \u2018put it away\u2019. Hayley won support from her fans by calling out this behaviour.\n\nAlso known as Delilah Dingle in Emmerdale and for a stint on Dancing On Ice, Hayley remains close to the Corrie cast and, upon sharing the news, has had waves of congratulatory messages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe hasn\u2019t yet revealed a name for the new addition to the family. The 42-year-old star has previously described her pregnancy as a \u2018miracle\u2019 after being told for years that she wouldn\u2019t be able to conceive.\n\nShe welcomes the child with her boyfriend Adrian and she tweeted: \u2018He\u2019s here. He\u2019s incredible. And we are besotted.\u2019\n\nNot long ago, Hayley\u2019s followers and friends were shocked that the then seven month pregnant mum-to-be was forced to sit on the floor of a train as others barged past her to get a seat. She said at the time in a tweet to Virgin Trains: \u2018Hey @VirginTrains had quite the rotten journey home to manc today as my 1pm was cancelled from Euston.\n\n\u2018At 7 months pregnant I sat outside the toilet for the whole journey. Staff were amazing by the way but as I had a 1st class ticket I\u2019d like my money back. How do I do this?\u2019 (sic)\n\nHayley\u2019s newborn son is her first child \u2013 what lovely news to start the week with!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Congratulations!", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hayley-tamaddon-c56c_1571045211.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
