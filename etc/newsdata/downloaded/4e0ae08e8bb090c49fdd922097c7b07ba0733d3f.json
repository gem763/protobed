At least 33 have died", "language": "en", "text": "Fatalities and lung injuries due to vaping continue to mount in the U.S., though not quite as quickly as before.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday the multi-state outbreak of illnesses associated with the use of e-cigarettes is now responsible for at least 33 deaths and 1,479 cases of pulmonary disease.\n\nThough the outbreak has spread to all states except Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia and one territory, the increase of 180 cases in the weekly tally is the smallest since mid-September. But the CDC, which reported 26 deaths and 1,299 lung injuries last week, said the outbreak has not shown any signs of abating.\n\nMost of the patients report a history of using vaping with THC products. THC is the mind-altering compound of marijuana that produces the \u201chigh.\"\n\nThe CDC says the latest findings indicate the THC involved often was obtained \"off the street or from other informal sources\" as opposed to sanctioned providers.\n\n\"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nFor the most part, the victims are young and male: 70% of patients are male, the median age of patients is 24 and 80% of patients are under 35 years old. Symptoms of the illness include severe shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain.\n\nThe outbreak might have more than one cause, and many different substances and product sources are still under investigation, the CDC said.\n\nThe CDC is not alone in its renewed scrutiny of vaping. In Florida, Sarasota County Sheriff Tom Knight announced Thursday that eight local store clerks were cited this week for selling vaping products to minors during a recent undercover operation.\n\nKnight said undercover personnel were sent into 29 stores and nabbed the clerks selling \"a nicotine product or nicotine dispensing devices\" to a minor. Clerks at all eight locations were given misdemeanor citations.\n\nDeath in Tennessee: Vaping-related death in Nashville is the first e-cigarette fatality in Tennessee\n\n\"Vape pens and e-cigarettes are becoming more popular these days than traditional cigarettes,\u201d Knight said. \u201cWe will continue our education and enforcement efforts so long as there are children to protect and businesses to hold accountable.\u201d\n\nAlso Thursday, e-cigarette giant Juul announced it would suspend sales of its fruit-flavored and other non-tobacco flavored products in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers,\" CEO K.C. Crosthwaite said in a statement.\n\nIn Nashville, health officials announced earlier Thursday that an adult man is the first person to die of vaping-related illness in Tennessee. On Wednesday, the Minnesota Department of Health confirmed a second and third deaths in the state due to complications from severe lung injuries associated with vaping.\n\nBoth patients died following breathing difficulties that resulted in \"complicated hospitalizations,\" the department said.\n\nMinnesota has 73 patients classified as confirmed or probable cases of severe lung injury associated with vaping and is reviewing the cases of more than 30 other patients for possible inclusion in the state's vaping statistics.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened by the news of these deaths, and we are troubled that so many Minnesotans continue to suffer in this outbreak,\u201d said Minnesota Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard with our partners across the country to learn as much as we can about these injuries and deaths, and to determine what can be done to prevent them.\u201d\n\nLast month, the Army advised soldiers to stop using e-cigarettes and other vaping products after an active duty soldier in the U.S. and another stationed overseas were treated for vaping-related lung injuries.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Vaping-related deaths and injuries rise at slower rate, CDC says", "description": "The number of vaping-related deaths climbed to 33 and injuries rose to 1,479, a decline in the previous pace, the CDC said.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SpXO5_VrI5UURddFPIB6Qw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/b8799d3f-848d-4d2e-8109-b6ebc50fd803/e4d6acd2-5f16-57b8-89d6-0b07e6c4140b/data_3_0.jpg?s=ce98c78dc6356409bf12e297615770b3&c=c10f4db42d57d450861ab0385d84a80a&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
