The video modified a short clip from the Nickelback music video \"Photograph\" to criticize former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is seeking the Democratic nod to challenge Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nCornell University legal scholar James Grimmelmann told Ars that Donald Trump has a strong fair use claim. The video only used a few seconds of the Nickelback music video, and it does so in a way that poses no threat to sales of the original song\u2014two factors that typically point toward a finding of fair use.\n\nThe music video for \"Photograph\" begins with a shot of Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger holding up a framed photograph as he sings, \"Look at this photograph. Every time I do, it makes me laugh.\" People started to modify the video clip and put other photos in the frame. An official meme was born.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 73-year-old Trump got in on the action, tweeting a video with the caption \"LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!\" The video showed a clip of Biden denying that he had ever talked to his son Hunter about his overseas business dealings. Then it cuts to Kroeger singing \"look at this photograph\" while holding up a 2014 photo showing Joe and Hunter Biden golfing with businessman Devon Archer. Hunter and Archer served together on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.\n\nWarner Music Group got Twitter to take down Trump's video\n\nBy Thursday morning, the video had been taken offline. In its place was the message \"this media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.\" Records show that the takedown request was made by Warner Music Group, which holds rights to the video.\n\nGrimmelmann argues that Trump has a strong argument that his use of the short Nickelback clip is legal under fair use doctrine. The Supreme Court held in 1994 that a use is likely to be fair if it is \"transformative\"\u2014\"altering the original with new expression, meaning, or message.\"\n\n\"Memes are essentially born transformative,\" Grimmelmann told Ars in an email. Trump's video, he said, \"expresses a dramatically different message than the original video in a way that can\u2019t be done without it.\"\n\nTrump's video used only a few seconds of the video, another factor that favors a fair use finding.\n\nA final factor in fair use analysis is the effect of the use on the market for the original work. This factor also favors a fair use finding, Grimmelmann argues. No one else is paying to use the \"Photograph\" meme, and the meme's popularity can only increase demand for the full song.\n\nGrimmelmann had harsh words for Twitter's approach to moderating Trump's tweets.\n\n\"Trump can incite violence all day long and Twitter doesn\u2019t care,\" Grimmelmann said. \"But God forbid he uses a short clip from a copyrighted music video.\"\n\nPresidential candidates keep getting hit with dubious takedown requests\n\nThe law doesn't require Twitter to take down content in response to a DMCA request, but complying with takedowns shields Twitter from liability in any subsequent copyright infringement action. If Twitter had ignored Warner's takedown request, Warner could have sued Twitter as well as Trump for copyright infringement. But if Grimmelmann's analysis is correct, Twitter almost certainly would have won any such legal battle.\n\nDMCA controversies are a perennial feature of presidential campaigns, and they often hit Republican candidates. In 2008, the John McCain campaign complained to YouTube that its videos had been targeted for using short clips of copyrighted music in ways that the campaign argued were clear-cut fair use.\n\nFurther Reading YouTube to McCain: No special treatment for DMCA takedowns\n\nIn 2012, YouTube took down a Romney campaign ad mocking Barack Obama for singing Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together,\" juxtaposed with \"headlines about Obama rewarding lobbyists and campaign donors.\" As we noted at the time, the ad seemed to be \"as clear-cut a case of fair use as can be imagined.\"\n\nThe problem is that the DMCA gives platforms like YouTube and Twitter no real incentive to scrutinize DMCA takedown requests for legal validity. If platforms comply with the requests, they are shielded from liability. There is a DMCA process for the video owner to request the video be put up, but it requires the platform to wait a minimum of 10 days before doing so\u2014an eternity in a modern political campaign.\n\nWhen I asked Twitter about the incident, a spokesman said only that \"we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives.\" He refused to say whether Twitter conducted a fair use analysis before taking down the video.\n\nA spokesman for Warner Music Group declined to comment.", "description": "Look at this copyright gaffe.
