It\u2019s not the first time Carmack has discussed the Gear VR\u2019s shortcomings, but with Samsung dropping Gear VR support from its Galaxy Note 10 this summer, it may end up being one of the last.\n\n\u201cIt is probably time for me to give a bit of a eulogy for Gear VR,\u201d Carmack told the audience during his day two keynote \u2014 which is usually a frank and casual monologue that contrasts with the news-heavy day one event. \u201cWhile the software is supported, the days are numbered. And I do think we missed an opportunity here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile the software is supported, the days are numbered.\u201d\n\nCarmack raised issues that he\u2019s mentioned before with the Gear VR, like the fact that people worried about draining their phone\u2019s battery and rarely used the device after they\u2019d tried it once or twice. \u201cIt\u2019s the foundation that we built all the mobile things off the back of,\u201d he said, and it sold comparatively huge volumes \u2014 \u201cmuch larger than all of our other headsets.\u201d But its design, which required a laborious process of fitting the phone into the headset, was a huge barrier to actual use.\n\nCarmack says that Oculus experimented with new features like a gamepad-style controller \u2014 which was scrapped because they couldn\u2019t come up with a design that seemed accessible but was still full-featured enough to play complex games like Minecraft. Android Central, which attended another impromptu conversation with Carmack at Connect, reports that Samsung also asked for high-end features like built-in cameras and full \u201csix degrees of freedom\u201d tracking. Oculus reportedly pushed back, though, saying that they would introduce serious performance issues.\n\nConversely, Carmack praised the simplicity of Google\u2019s Daydream View headset \u2014 while the overall platform got much less traction, the product itself was significantly easier to use. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always better to trade things to make it easier and faster to get into the experience,\u201d he said.\n\nOculus effectively replaced the Gear VR with the standalone Oculus Go last year, and it\u2019s now pushing Oculus Go owners toward the higher-end Oculus Quest. Now, Carmack and others at Oculus seem even more clearly ready to move on from their first mobile VR headset.", "description": "Oculus CTO John Carmack has confirmed that the Samsung Gear VR mobile headset\u2019s \"days are numbered\" as the company moves toward fully standalone VR.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEwDDD9VDLj5DNGVpczjvppliv8=/0x180:2500x1489/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4294227/stock-samsung-gear-vr-old-0181.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
