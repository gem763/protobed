Kron Gracie at UFC on ESPN+ 19: Best photos view 43 images\n\nCub Swanson\u2019s UFC Tampa co-feature bout with Kron Gracie turned into a compelling throwdown.\n\nThe veteran Swanson taught Gracie a thing or two about high-level striking in their featherweight fight at Amalie Arena on Saturday night, all while mostly avoiding Gracie\u2019s world-class ground game.\n\nBut Gracie, for his part, showed poise, toughness, and heart that seemed to give lie to the fact this was just his sixth pro MMA fight.\n\nSo it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the duo earned \u201cFight of the Night\u201d honors for UFC on ESPN+ 19, which means each competitor will pocket an extra $50,000.\n\nFor Swanson (26-11 MMA, 11-7 UFC), who snapped a four-fight losing streak, this marked his eighth career postfight bonus. Gracie (5-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC) now has two postfight bonuses in as many UFC bouts.\n\nAs always, there were four overall bonus winners on the evening, as a pair of \u201cPerformance of the Night\u201d awards rounded things out.\n\nOne was obvious, as Niko Price (14-3 MMA, 6-3 UFC) defeated James Vick (13-5 MMA, 9-5 UFC) at 1:44 of the opening round by way of an all-time memorable upkick knockout. And Marlon Vera (17-5-1 MMA, 9-4 UFC) finished Andre Ewell (15-6 MMA, 2-2 UFC) in the third round of their undercard fight, as Vera continues to build momentum. Price and Vera also earned $50,000 extra for their efforts.\n\nThe UFC announced a crowd of 10,597 at Amalie Arena for a paid gate of $897,805.\n\nGallery Niko Price def.
