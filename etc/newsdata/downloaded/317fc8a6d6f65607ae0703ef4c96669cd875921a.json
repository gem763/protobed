The entire solar group looks like it\u2019s going to go higher. FSLR looks like it\u2019s headed to 69-70, then take out 75, and make it to 80.\n\nHealth Insurance Innovations (HIIQ)\n\nHealth Insurance Innovations Inc (NASDAQ: ) popped and I put a swing on it. On Tuesday, it ran 1.14, or 6%, to 20.91, on 869,749 shares traded. It\u2019s in a 5-wave decline, broke out, pulled back, and it\u2019s above the 50-day, double-top, and declining tops line. I\u2019m looking for 25, 28, and 34 going forward.\n\nSnap (SNAP)\n\nSnap (NYSE: ) may have broken out. It took out the declining topsline and lateral price resistance. On Tuesday, it was up 1.07, or 7% to 16.83, on 40 million shares. If it can get up through 17.20, then we should see something around 18 1/2, and perhaps something higher down the road.\n\nSunPower Corporation (SPWR)\n\nSunPower (NASDAQ: ) exploded 1.56, or 12%, to 14.50, on 7.3 million shares on Tuesday. I would estimate midchannel target 16, and then 20 going forward.\n\nTerraForm Power (TERP): Swing Trade\n\nTerraForm Power (NASDAQ: ) broke out of a four-week flag on Tuesday, and popped 68 cents, or 4%, to 17.58, on 945,325 shares traded. It looks like it\u2019s going higher. It\u2019s a really nice pattern since the Dec lows at 10, and change. Now, it\u2019s above 17 1/2. Targeting 18 1/2 and 20.\n\nStocks on the long side\n\nAvadel Pharmaceuticals (AVDL), Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH), First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (HIIQ), HUYA Inc.
