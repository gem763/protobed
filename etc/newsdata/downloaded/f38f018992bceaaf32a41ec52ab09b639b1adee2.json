If they combined their money, they could buy (if they were for sale) countries such as Kenya, Bulgaria or Croatia.\n\nAlthough football clubs in England have been the playthings of the rich, it was Roman Abramovich who got the ball rolling in 2003 when he bought a 50% share in Chelsea.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the Russian had purchased the remaining shares and delisted the club from the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAt the time, Abramovich said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to throw my money away, but it\u2019s really about having fun and that means success and trophies.\u201d\n\nAnd he has managed that. Since taking over, the club has won the Premier League and the FA Cup title five times, the League Cup three times and three European titles.\n\nAbramovich\u2019s entry into the Premier League not only started the rush of billionaires into the top flight, it also saw an influx of foreign owners, with 15 of the clubs currently being controlled by foreigners.\n\nThis change in ownership has not gone unnoticed by the fans, with some of them criticising the new owners for not having the clubs\u2019 interests at heart.\n\nIn the most extreme case, fans even set up a rival club, with FC United of Manchester being established when Manchester United was sold to the Glazer family of the US.\n\nThe breakaway club currently campaigns in the seventh tier of English football.\n\nOne of the criticisms levelled against the owners is that they are seeing the clubs as mere investments and as vehicles to make money \u2013 a lot of money.\n\nSurprisingly, what has helped owners \u2013 especially the owners of the so-called big six: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 make more money are the financial fair play rules that have been introduced throughout Europe and England.\n\nThe financial fair play rules prevent newcomers from buying a club and investing huge amounts to secure success, thus keeping it mainly in the hands of the big six.\n\nFootball finance academic Rob Wilson said: \u201cThe financial fair play rules make football a better investment and one that can yield returns.\u201d\n\nIt is obviously a strategy that has worked for the owners, many of whom have investments in other clubs and sporting codes.\n\nStan Kroenke, for instance, owns Arsenal and US Major League soccer team Colorado Rapids, for whom Shaun Bartlett played.\n\nHe also owns clubs in other sports, including American football (Los Angeles Rams), basketball (Denver Nuggets), ice hockey (Colorado Avalanche) and lacrosse (Colorado Mammoth).\n\nHe has even bought a club (Los Angeles Gladiators) in the newly formed e-sports league, Overwatch League.\n\nThe richest of the owners in the Premier League is Manchester City\u2019s Sheikh Mansour, who is the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, as well as a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe 48-year-old heads the City Football Group, which not only owns Manchester City, but also New York City, Melbourne City, Yokohama F Marinos, Club Atletico Torque, Girona and Sichuan Jiuniu.\n\nThey are said to be on the verge of buying Indian club Mumbai City.\n\nSome fans question how owners can feel an allegiance towards a club if they own so many different ones.\n\nThere can, however, be no question about what foreign owners have brought to the Premier League: money and success.", "description": "Together, the owners of the Premier League clubs are richer than many countries.", "authors": ["Peter Auf Der Heyde"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2632/ee07a86596644e0a80a952064083c362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
