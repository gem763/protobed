Cummings, Maryland Democrat, said in letters to the White House, vice president, Secret Service and the Trump Organization.\n\nThe Irish adventure now joins another probe into the president\u2019s promotion of Doral, his Miami resort property, as site of next year\u2019s summit of the Group of 7 nations.\n\nAny violations of the Constitution\u2019s \u201cEmoluments Clause\u201d \u2014 a ban on profiting from the presidency \u2014 \u201care of significant interest and grave concern to the committee as it considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, wrote in his own letters to White House counsel and James M. Murray, the director of the Secret Service.\n\nThe Trump team was already scrambling last week to figure out a story that could protect Mr. Trump from legal jeopardy, reversing the original version that the president suggested the stay. Now Mr. Trump says the decision was Mr. Pence\u2019s alone.\n\nThe Doral and Doonbeg affairs could spark momentum for Democrats looking to ding the president or build the case for impeachment ahead of 2020, said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to get the legal process in order, but now they are ready to go \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be a long fall for the administration,\u201d said Mr. Manley, who served as a spokesman for former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.\n\nCongress is also looking at a March incident, first reported by Politico, in which the crew of an U.S. Air Force C-17 stayed at Mr. Trump\u2019s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland amid a refueling stop on the way to Kuwait. The Air Force said in a statement said the stop was \u201cnot unusual,\u201d though it\u2019s another instance in which taxpayer money appeared to flow to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal company.\n\nMr. Trump has maintained ownership of his business empire after becoming president, though he turned over day-to-day operations to his children.\n\nInvestigations by press outlets have found foreign governments have poured money into his properties since he took office. And even Attorney General William Barr has scheduled his annual Christmas party for a Trump hotel in Washington this year.\n\nThose sorts of moves had spawned lawsuits arguing the payments were emoluments, violating the Constitution.\n\nMr. Trump had been winning some of the legal skirmishes, getting one lawsuit brought by Maryland and the District of Columbia tossed this summer. And the president\u2019s team has managed to slow down another lawsuit by winning the right to appeal at an early stage.\n\nMr. Trump didn\u2019t return fire at the Democratic chairmen over the weekend, though he\u2019s bristled at attacks on his properties, saying he\u2019s on track to lose money while serving as president because he has to forgo big deals.\n\nThe Doonbeg affair put him on the back foot, however, with Mr. Cummings saying the shifting explanations out of Mr. Trump\u2019s team add to the fishy stench.\n\n\u201cThe White House has not made public how much vice president\u2019s trip cost the American taxpayer \u2014 or benefited the Trump Organization \u2014 but based on previous investigations by the Government Accountability Office, the bill could be significant,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote to White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and others.\n\nMr. Nadler, meanwhile, says if the president follows through on his plan to host the next summit at his Florida property, it would be the \u201cfirst publicly known instance\u201d in which foreign governments would be required to spend money at Trump-branded properties to engage in diplomacy with the U.S.\n\nMr. Trump called his Miami resort a great fit when he made the suggestion during the most the recent G-7 summit in France. He said White House scouts couldn\u2019t find a better site for next year\u2019s meetings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s, like, such a natural,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cEach country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow.\u201d\n\nMr. Nadler wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\n\u201cThe threat that the president\u2019s personal financial interests could shape decisions concerning official U.S. government activities,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis precisely the type of risk that the emoluments clauses were intended to minimize.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
