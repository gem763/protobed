They both left the scene, leaving two injured passengers (one of them Keogh) in one of the wrecked cars.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThey returned to the scene 45 minutes later and were arrested by police. Bennett\u2019s lawyer said he drank a Jagerbomb earlier in the evening that made him sick.\n\nThe pair also pleaded guilty to failing to stop for an accident.\n\nLawrence's lawyer said in court: \"He throws himself at the mercy of the court. He does not duck or dive from his responsibilities.\n\n\u201cHe made a gross, gross error of judgement. He made an incredible decision to drive. He damaged his vehicle and damaged someone else.\u201d\n\nThe court also heard that Lawrence had turned to alcohol following the death of his mother to \u201cremove the deep sadness\u201d and had become \u201cquite dependent\u201d on drink.\n\nIt was claimed going to jail would \"mess with [Lawrence's] head\" and that Bennett, who is a father to his four-year-old daughter at 23, would \"struggle to cope\" in custody.\n\nLawrence and Bennett have since returned to action for Derby, and the club have already imposed a punishment of 80 hours of community service and rehabilitation alongside their fines.\n\nIn a statement following the incident, Lawrence said: \"Following the events of the evening of the 24th September I wish to offer my sincere apologies to the football club; our Chairman, the manager, my teammates and all our supporters for my indiscretions that night.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"It was a total error of judgement on my part, out of character for me and I am deeply disappointed in my behaviour and upset for my teammate and our Captain Richard Keogh.\n\n\"Going forward, I will make every effort to make amends by working diligently to give something back to our local community and I will strive to repay all the faith and support I have received from everybody during my time at the club in the best way I know how, on the field of play.\"\n\nBennett also released a statement, saying: \"On the night of Tuesday 24th September, I made huge mistakes after consuming alcohol. What I did was wrong.\n\n\u201cBeing a footballer and someone who young fans look up to I know the example I set is key. I am ashamed. At 23 I am old enough, and I was brought up, to know better.\n\n(Image: Derbyshire Constabulary)\n\n\u201cI understand that such actions have serious consequences. I take full responsibility for my actions and accept the punishment that the club has issued.\n\n\u201cI have to and will learn from these events and will strive to be a better person.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m sorry to my family, my friends, the club, all Derby supporters and to the wider football community, I let you all down.\u201d", "description": "The duo were charged with drink-driving after a road collision following a team night out last month", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Pa", "Derbyshire Constabulary"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582641.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Derby-County-footballers-court-case.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
