Olivier [Rousteing] has made me the most fun dress to dance the night away.\"\n\nGoulding added that she didn't want to \"give too much away\" with regards to her multiple bridal looks.", "description": "On Saturday 31 August, Ellie Goulding and her partner, art dealer Caspar Jopling, were wed at York Minster in front of a star-studded congregation.
