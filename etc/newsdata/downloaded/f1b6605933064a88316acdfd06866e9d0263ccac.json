The Fed reiterated that \u201cuncertainties\u201d about its generally positive outlook remain, indicating the central bank still could act in response to a further slowdown.\n\nCLOSE Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the U.S. economy is facing some risks at the moment, but overall it is in a \"good place\" and the Fed's main job is to \"keep it there as long as possible.\" (Oct. 4) AP, AP\n\n\"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate\" as long as the economy and inflation are consistent with the Fed's outlook, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference.\n\nBut he added that if developments emerge \"that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.\"\n\nWednesday\u2019s rate decrease is expected to ripple through the economy, further pushing down borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages but also pinching seniors and others who were finally benefiting from higher savings account yields.\n\nStocks advanced in the wake of the Fed\u2019s policy decision, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record. The broad index ticked up 0.3% to close at 3046.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 115.27 points to end at 27,186.69. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was stable at 1.8%.\n\nFed officials have been starkly divided over the flurry of rate cuts, with many supporting them and others preferring more tempered moves or none at all. Wednesday\u2019s decrease was viewed as a milestone because the three reductions since July now equal the three moves the Fed made in both 1995-96 and 1998.\n\nAs during those periods, Fed policymakers have said the economy is performing well and they\u2019re acting to effectively take out insurance against the risk of a downturn. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has called the cuts a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d rather than a more aggressive effort to lift the economy from a downturn.\n\nEconomists, in turn, have been split over whether the central bank on Wednesday would leave the door open to another rate decrease in December or hint that it\u2019s pausing to see how the economy responds to the moves so far.\n\nOn the one hand, the economic picture has brightened somewhat in recent weeks. The U.S. and China tentatively reached a truce in their trade war that would suspend additional tariffs. The risk of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that leaves Britain without a trade deal with Europe has ebbed. And long-term Treasury rates have edged back above short-term Treasury yields, reversing an \u201cinverted yield curve\u201d that reflected a dim outlook.\n\nThose developments provide ammunition for the Fed\u2019s apparent inclination to take a breather the rest of the year. Fed funds futures markets reckon the odds of another rate cut in December are just 27%.\n\n\"We also see the risks to the outlook as moving in a positive direction,\" Powell said, citing the developments with the trade war and Brexit.\n\nAt the same time, the global economy remains sluggish and existing tariffs by both the U.S. and China are expected to curtail economic growth both through reduced trade and weaker business confidence and investment. Manufacturing, in turn, has been contracting. And while consumer spending remains solid, it has slowed in recent months.\n\nAlso, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy items has picked up recently but remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target, giving the Fed more leeway to trim rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly badgered Powell and the Fed on Twitter for not pushing down rates more sharply.\n\nYet the Fed\u2019s about-face on rates has been head-spinning. Just last year, the central bank raised its federal funds rate four times, capping nine increases since late 2015.\n\nThat push was aimed at preventing an eventual spike in inflation and bringing the rate back to normal after it hovered near zero for years after the Great Recession of 2007-09. The recent spurt of rate cuts has reversed just a third of the hikes.\n\nHe said a reversal back to rate hikes isn't on the horizon.\n\n\"We would have to see a really significant move up in inflation,\" he said.\n\nKansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren dissented again, preferring to leave rates unchanged.\n\nWhat the Fed said about:\n\nThe economy\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a solid 1.9% annual rate in the third quarter, above the 1.6% pace economists expected. After expanding by about 2.5% the first half of the year, many economists expect growth of about 1.5% in the second half. That\u2019s well below the 3% or better growth Trump has promised.\n\nThe Fed said \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak,\u201d the Fed said in its statement.\n\nJobs\n\n\u201cJob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\u201d the Fed said.\n\nAverage monthly job growth has slowed to 161,000 this year from 223,000 in 2018, though last year\u2019s figure is expected to be revised down. In September, the unemployment rate fell to a new 50-year low of 3.5%.\n\nInflation\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred measure of core inflation has climbed from 1.5% in May to 1.8% in August but Wednesday\u2019s statement noted it\u2019s still below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nWhat it means\n\nThe Fed didn\u2019t disappoint markets, lowering rates for the time in three months as it highlighted lingering uncertainties surrounding its outlook that stem from a sluggish global economy and the trade fight with China.\n\nBut amid recent progress in the trade conflict, Fed officials signaled they may well be done cutting rates for now in light of their strategy aimed at heading off a recession rather propelling the economy from a downturn.\n\n\"There is good reason to believe that, as it was in the mid-1990s, the three insurance cuts the Fed has provided are enough to leave the economy on an even keel,\" economist James Marple of TD Economics wrote in a research note.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Jerome Powell (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE)\n\nCLOSE National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow discusses the September Jobs report and the state of the U.S. economy.
