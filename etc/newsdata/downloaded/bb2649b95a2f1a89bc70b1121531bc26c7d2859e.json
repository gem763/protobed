You cannot say a word,' the message read.\n\nHe initially denied the offending when he was questioned by police but later pleaded guilty.\n\nThe girl had previously told the court the incident left her feeling like 'a piece of meat'.\n\n'I had my childhood taken away from me and my dignity stripped,' she said.\n\nThe girl initially told Schembri she was 15 but revealed she was actually 13 after they got physical. He was also jailed for unrelated drug offences, bringing his total sentence to five years but he could be released on parole in two years and six months (court pictured)\n\nThe judge described the offending as 'deeply disturbing' during her sentencing remarks in the County Court.\n\n'You knew she was only 15, and that in itself is bad enough because she was underage and that you continued when you knew she was 13 clearly makes it worse,' Judge Hampel said.\n\nHowever, she noted Schembri had started to turn his life around, had stopped using drugs and maintained vocational employment.\n\nThe judge hit out at a personal reference provided for Schembri which was written on the letterhead of a Catholic school.\n\nShe said it was 'inappropriate' considering the 'well documented poor behaviour of the Catholic church' in relation to child sex abuse.\n\n'I'm considering making a formal protest about it, it's just wrong,' she said.\n\nThe judge also took into account Schembri's age at the time of the offence, his remorse and believed he would be a good prospect for rehabilitation.\n\nHe was also jailed for unrelated drug offences, bringing his total sentence to five years but he could be released on parole in two years and six months.\n\nAfter he was sentenced the convicted sex offender spoke to his tearful mother and passed a letter to her.", "description": "Nathan Schembri admitted three counts of sexual penetration of the girl in 2015.
