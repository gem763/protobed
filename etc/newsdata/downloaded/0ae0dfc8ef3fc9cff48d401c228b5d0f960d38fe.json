Medics at the clinic suggested she should abandon her baby in an orphanage and 'try again for free'\n\nThe mother, in her 40s, had wanted another baby when she remarried but her husband Sergei was sterile.\n\nShe went to the sperm bank instead - but mother and donor both carried the same rare genes, a fact which was not spotted at the time.\n\nMs Borodulina told the newspaper Sobesednik: 'The clinic promised me a normal, healthy child.\n\n'They painted such a beautiful picture. I am not a doctor, I do not understand such issues.\n\n'I went through all the tests they prescribed for me, sparing no money, because it was about the health of my child.'\n\nThe mother said she had quizzed staff at the clinic and asked whether their donors were healthy.\n\n'I asked the question: Are your donors checked? The doctor told [me] that yes, they were checked,' she said.\n\nThe Russian mother now has to pay for expensive medical treatment for her daughter (pictured together) and said the stress had broken up her marriage\n\nMs Borodulina with her daughter Nika. She and the sperm donor both carried the same rare genes, a fact which was not spotted at the time\n\nShe claims she was told: 'You will have a genetically healthy baby.'\n\nNika's condition started to become apparent at the age of four months when she became sluggish and could not hold up her head.\n\nA neurologist examined Nika and told her mother that 'this is one of the most serious fatal diseases'.\n\nWhen she asked what to do, she was told: 'Prepare a coffin for a child.'\n\n'I was shaking all over, I did not believe him,' she said.\n\nShe then went to confront the clinic, where staff told her she should put the disabled child in an orphanage and 'try again for free' with a new donor.\n\nThey would provide a new donor, fully tested at a clinic outside Russia, she said.\n\nOlga Berestova (pictured), the director of the clinic, said donors were examined but under Russian law there were no tests for 'recessive genetic diseases'\n\n'A new donor would be taken to Europe to check for all genetic diseases,' she said.\n\nThe director of the clinic, Olga Berestova, did not comment on the claim but said a rare situation had arisen where the mother shared the same 'genetic pathology' as the sperm donor.\n\n'What happened to our client is a rarity,' she said. These are very rare mutations. And it just so happened that this patient has the mutation and the donor.'\n\nDonors are examined but under Russian law this did not include screening for 'recessive genetic diseases', the clinic's lawyer Anastasia Barannikova told Russian media.\n\nThe mother said she is taking legal action to meet costs of treating for Nika, who is receiving injections of Spinraza at a cost of \u00a3102,000 a jab.\n\nThe stress had led to the breakup of her marriage but her husband still visits the child, she said.", "description": "Russian medics suggested that\u00a0Svetlana Borodulina should abandon her baby daughter after the girl was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a severe genetic condition that wastes the muscles.", "authors": ["Will Stewart For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/13/19203946-0-image-a-15_1570020169857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
