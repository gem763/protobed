Aurora Borealis is seen for first time in UK this winter", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nThese incredible pictures reveal the first time the Northern Lights were seen in the UK this year as they made a Scottish loch glow bright green.\n\nPhotographer Maciej Winiarczyk, who is based in Wick, Caithness, on the far north of mainland Scotland, was able to capture the sunning images yesterday because of the darker nights.\n\nOne of the beautiful images was taken at Sinclair's Bay in Caithness and the other was captured last night at Loch Watten.\n\nThe Northern and Southern Lights are natural light spectacles triggered in our atmosphere that are also known as the 'Auroras'.\n\nPhotographer Maciej Winiarczyk, who is based in Wick, Caithness, on the far north of mainland Scotland, was able to capture the sunning images on Thursday because of the darker nights. Pictured is Sinclair Bay\n\nOne of the beautiful images was taken at Sinclair's Bay in Caithness and the other was captured last night at Loch Watten (pictured)\n\nThere are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means 'dawn of the north', and Aurora Australis, 'dawn of the south.'\n\nThe displays light up when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nUsually the particles, sometimes referred to as a solar storm, are deflected by Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nAuroras are typically green due to collisions with oxygen particles, but \u2018exciting\u2019 different atmospheric gases can produce a blue, violet, yellow, or even red colour.\n\nAs these reactions occur at the magnetic poles this is why auroras are most likely to be seen in Scotland and the northernmost parts of the UK.\n\nBut during stronger storms they enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles, including hydrogen and helium.\n\nThese collisions emit light. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are common.", "description": "Photographer Maciej Winiarczyk, who is based in Caithness, Scotland, captured the stunning images last night.
