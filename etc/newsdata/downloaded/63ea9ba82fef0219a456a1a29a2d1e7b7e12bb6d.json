Harry & Meghan 26thSeptember 2019.'\n\nA placard reading 'Our rainbow is bleeding women's blood' at the Cape Town post office where Mrwetyana died on September 4\n\nIt has been written by her in the local language Xhosa and she tied it herself to a post office railing.\n\nBut this weekend it was revealed that the personal royal message on the ribbon to the murdered girl which made headlines round the world had been untied and stolen by a thief.\n\nUyineye's mother Noma told the Weekend Argus: 'The disappearance of the ribbon is quite unfortunate and is actually a reflection of the type of society we have become'.\n\nSchoolgirl Aaliah Jacobs, 17, who had spotted Meghan actually tying the ribbon memorial also told the Weekend Argus: 'I am highly disappointed that someone took it.\n\n'But at least Meghan got the word out all over the world about Uyinene and gender-based violence'.\n\nPost office workers said they suspected the ribbon may have been taken by a royal fan as a souvenir but said they hoped their conscience would lead them to return it.\n\nHer killer tortured her into submission and then raped her then beat her to death with the post office scales then dumped her body in the nearby township in Khayelitsha\n\nA 42-year-old man who cannot be named yet has has appeared before Wynberg Magistrates in Cape Town charged with rape, murder, and defeating the ends of justice.\n\nHe is an employee at the Clareinch Post Office in Claremont, Cape Town, where the student was last seen alive on August 24. Her body was found dumped 15 miles away a week later.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess and baby on Archie returned earlier this week to the UK from their 10 day trip to South Africa with Prince Harry also visiting Malawi, Botswana and Angola on his own.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex will be deeply upset to learn that the moving message of support she left in memory of the tragic University of Cape Town student had been untied.", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt In Cape Town For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/19360864-0-image-a-55_1570365189288.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
