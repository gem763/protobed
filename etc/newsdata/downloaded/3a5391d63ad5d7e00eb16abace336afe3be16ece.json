Bring it on.\n\nHaving watched Eddie Jones\u2019 side batter the All Blacks on Saturday, they took the opportunity to declare themselves as underdogs, but did not shy away from the fight.\n\nThey are a team led by inspirational skipper Siya Kolisi, who grew up in a township and survived on jam sandwiches.\n\nSouth Africa captain Siya Kolisi said that his team are up for the fight with England next week\n\nRecalling his memories of watching South Africa beat England in the 2007 World Cup final, Kolisi said: \u2018I was in a tavern because I didn\u2019t have a TV at home.\n\n\u2018It means a lot to me and the team to be in the final. It\u2019s awesome to see it come together. It will mean a lot for us to go all the way.\u2019\n\nIn a country burned by its Apartheid past, Kolisi is the Springboks\u2019 first black captain. He is supported by a band of heavyweights in the pack, who used their raw size and physicality to beat up Japan, before winning yesterday\u2019s arm wrestle with Wales.\n\nThey do not come much bigger than lock Lood de Jager, who will throw his 6ft 7in and 125kg frame into English bodies on Saturday.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be very physical,\u2019 said De Jager. \u2018The only way we know is fighting fire with fire. We base our game on physicality and they\u2019re a very physical side. Its going to be the team that dominates the gain line that wins the game.\n\n\u2018South Africa\u2019s a tough place to grow up and you have to bring that out when you\u2019re on the pitch. There\u2019s a lot of stuff. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s a lovely country and I love it but it\u2019s tough.\n\nThe Springboks won a grueling contest with Wales on Sunday to book their place in the final\n\nThe semi final in Yokohama was a physical affair with South Africa's pack coming off the better\n\n\u2018Our captain grew up in a township. Go there and see for yourself. A lot of people grew up in tough places and rural places and they need to bring that out. He\u2019s a big inspiration.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of guys that came from poverty and really tough circumstances to make it to this level. It\u2019s great playing with those guys and you draw some inspiration from that.\u2019\n\nHead coach Rassie Erasmus has been hailed as the brains behind South Africa\u2019s turnaround. He only took on the role in 2018, but one of his first moves was to appoint Kolisi as captain.\n\nThe Boks will hope their physicality can come off trumps again when they face England\n\nErasmus has restored pride in the Boks jersey and driven home to his players what it means to play for your country.\n\nHe said: \u2018I think there were players in South Africa who just saw rugby as good pay check. Now they realise if they want to be a professional rugby player you have to work very hard and it\u2019s not just about going from province to province and getting a pay check. They have taken responsibility and ownership of what it means to be a professional rugby player.\u2019\n\nErasmus hinted last night that his side will stick to their physical gameplan against England: \u2018We have a six-day turnaround, and I\u2019m not 100 per cent sure that a World Cup final will be won by a very expansive gameplan and wonderful tries.\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus admitted his country has inferior resources to England\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have the money England have but we definitely have the player pool. In terms of resources, qualified coaches, player development pathway, England are right up there.\n\n\u2018Premiership rugby has rich owners that back their clubs with a wonderful system \u2014 and keep them in a professional mindset.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got different challenges in South Africa. The Rand is not the strongest. We had to make a few changes in overseas-based players, talk to franchises. Now we\u2019re in the final, only then will we really see if we\u2019ve turned the corner as much as we wanted to.\n\n\u2018England are definitely favourites,\u2019 added De Jager. \u2018If you beat the All Blacks by 12 points, you\u2019re going to be the favourite in most games. The way they beat them was comprehensive so they are the favourites, but we have a foot in the door, these are the biggest games of your life, and anything can happen.\u2019", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKOHAMA: Having watched Eddie Jones' side batter the All Blacks on Saturday, they took the opportunity to declare themselves as underdogs for the World Cup final.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/20254042-0-image-a-67_1572207057726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
