While the installment, which had Steve Forbes as a guest, focused on traditional markets, Trump\u2019s policies, and the evolution of media, ARK Invest threw a curveball towards the end of the podcast.\n\nConcluding the episode, Cathie Wood, chief executive of ARK Invest, asked Forbes about his thoughts on cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Surprisingly, Forbes bit.\n\nRelated Reading: Institutions Long on Bitcoin as Analysts Expect Upward Price Breakout\n\nThe Forbes editor-in-chief argued that Bitcoin is a \u201chigh-tech cry for help\u201d, before going on to briefly touch on the growing mistrust being placed in governments and their currencies:\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Bitcoin has performed a very important role in helping people in distressed situations around the world: getting around governments (institutions, really) that want to control you, starve you, and hurt you.\u201d\n\nWhile he did give the leading cryptocurrency the classification as a tool against high-level corruption or irresponsibility, the media guru did admit that the challenge for Bitcoin and their ilk is that they need to become as trustworthy as the classical hard, non-sovereign money gold. This, he claims, can be accomplished by ensuring that Bitcoin is an unhackable system and becomes an asset with much less volatility than it has now.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that an ARK Invest podcast has contained such a comment \u2014 for some reason, the firm is great at eliciting pro-crypto comments from guests.\n\nPer previous reports from NewsBTC, when Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk took to the podcast, he explained that cryptocurrencies are fundamentally great as they facilitate the maneuvering around currency controls in places like Venezuela, where citizens may be oppressed by the local government.\n\nNot Only Its Only Value Proposition\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t only a tool that can combat measures imposed by authoritarian governments, it can also act as a hedge against inflation and fiscal/monetary irresponsibility.\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg op-ed on the case for Bitcoin, Jarden Dillian, an editor and investment strategist, wrote that the \u201cphilosophical bias\u201d of governmental currencies has never been as weak as it is now. Governments, Dillian writes, are shifting to a model known as Modern Monetary Theory, \u201cor the printing of as much cash as a government needs to fund its spending.\u201d\n\nThis transition, he claims, will be astronomically bullish for Bitcoin, as \u201cit just seems like common sense that you would want to avoid any currency (most of the fiat world) that is being debased to such a degree.\u201d\n\nThe analyst \u2014 after mentioning Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics of decentralization, scarcity, censorship-resistance/privacy, and cost-efficiency \u2014 then concluded that writing that he believes Bitcoin will see another bull market, one that is \u201cmuch larger than the first one where the potential is finally realized\u201d.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "While Bitcoin has assumed many mantles over the years \u2014 digital gold, magical internet money and a currency for criminals, just to name a few \u2014 it has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1119446906-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
