They were sitting next to me, had a seizure and passed out.\n\n\u2018We tried to help them off but ultimately had to press the emergency alarm to keep the doors open and get assistance.\u2019\n\nThe Circle and Hammersmith and City Lines remain part suspended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was no service between Edgware Road and Hammersmith on either line, according to the Transport for London (TfL) website, which said it was dealing with \u2018SEVERE DELAYS\u2019 while a trespasser on the track is dealt with.
