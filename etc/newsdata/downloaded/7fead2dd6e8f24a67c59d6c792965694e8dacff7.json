Papa John's International slumped 4% while Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands fell 1%.\n\nBuffeted by increased competition from food-delivery services such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats, the pizza chain said it expects U.S. same-store sales to grow between 2% and 5% over the next two to three years. That is down from prior projections for an increase of 3% to 6% over three to five years.\n\nBut Domino's stock turned 4.7% higher after Chief Executive Ritch Allison tried to ease investors' concerns about the long-term outlook and the company announced it would repurchase $1 billion in shares.\n\n\"The reality is that we don't have visibility into exactly how long some of these new entrants into the quick-service delivery segment are going to benefit from the financial support of aggregators who are seeking to buy market share,\" Mr. Allison said during the earnings call with shareholders Tuesday.\n\nDomino's shares have largely underperformed the broader market this year. The stock has risen 2.2% in 2019, compared with the S&P 500's 15% climb.\n\nWrite to Jessica Menton at Jessica.Menton@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 16:47 ET (20:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
