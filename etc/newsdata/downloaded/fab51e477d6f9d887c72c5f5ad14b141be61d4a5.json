The NPP's move could force other banks to also cede some control of payments to the cloud accounting sector.\n\nValue in business data\n\nThe new payments platform, which the major banks spent more than $1 billion to build under the guidance of the Reserve Bank, was launched with a customer-facing service called Osko, allowing for real-time person-to-person payments.\n\nBut the system will also be useful for businesses, given its ability to carry rich data alongside the payment. NPPA is preparing standards to automating messages with defined fields, so data could move with a payments between a company and, say, the Australian Taxation Office or Australian Securities Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe real value is with machine-to-machine payments in key verticals like invoicing and tax and superannuation,\" Mr Lovney said. \"When we speak to businesses, they are really focused on the data opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs well as the \"basic payment initiation service\" and \"mandated payments service\", the road-map shows NPP will develop over the next few years messaging standards to allow business to make sense of the platform's structured data capabilities, and services to support the domestic leg of in-bound cross-border payments by integration with the SWIFT network. The NPP will also support the use of QR codes and extend the 'application programming interface' (API) framework to help connectivity and encourage more start-ups to use the system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NPP is currently processing 750,000 transactions worth around $750 million each day. Westpac Banking Corp is directing large volumes through the system, however use by the other three major banks is more limited.\n\nRBA governor Philip Lowe, who chairs the Payments System Board, wrote to the CEOs of the banks in September last year seeking commitments to delivery of services over the NPP and the RBA said this month that each CEO had confirmed their support for it.\n\nStart-ups involved\n\nThe NPP's report shows payment innovation is being driven from outside the major banks: for example, Azupay is developing a real-time system to validate and process online payments; Earnd is enabling employees to access income as they earn it in real time; and Block8 is building equity management, compliance and share registry services.\n\nWith the RBA keen to see fintechs get access to the system, Katrina Stuart, NPPA\u2019s head of engagement, said the strategy is to \"provide the right capabilities and make that available at the core so different organisations can build products and service offerings outside the platform, and use it unilaterally to foster greater competition and innovation.\"\n\nIn the review of open banking conducted for Treasury, \"write\" access to allow third parties to initiate payments fell outside its terms of reference. But the report said the power of third party payments innovation \"could encourage services that make it more convenient for a customer to manage their finances, meet payment obligations, or increase their ability to achieve better return on their funds\".\n\nSome of the major banks argued write access could create a security risk for customers, because if an account was illegally accessed, a bad actor could steal funds. This could \"give malicious actors a greater incentive to make cyber-attacks because the party with write access would be a more lucrative target,\" the open banking report said.\n\nNPPA Australia has been working to improve security around its its PayID service, which allows payments to be made with a phone number, after customer data was compromised following problems with CUA's look-up system.", "description": "NPP Australia, which governs the 'new payments platform', will create a new \"payment initiation service\u201d as it seeks to lift volume.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.1949%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_186%2C$y_181/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/37f0dde8465690521ac99c76d410c17f311b5005", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
