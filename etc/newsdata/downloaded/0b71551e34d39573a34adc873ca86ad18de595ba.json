(Wolfkann/Flickr)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say the weather was less than ideal for this morning\u2019s Marine Corps Marathon. Upward of one to two inches of rain fell across the area over the past 24 hours, the bulk of which came during a particularly heavy band of rain from 10 a.m. to noon. And did you notice the humidity? Dew points briefly jumped into the 70s! Thankfully, the rain and the summerlike humidity have departed before first pitch of the crucial World Series game happening in town tonight.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Continuing to dry out with mostly clear skies. Temperatures will be falling through the 60s during Game 5, with a cool breeze out of the northwest at about 10 mph. Winds will become calm overnight, and with mostly clear skies in place, temperatures will drop into the upper 40s outside the Beltway, lower 50s closer to Interstate 95 and the city.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Monday): High pressure will build in from the west on Monday, leading to some rather warm and pleasant weather. Temperatures will make a run at 70 degrees (most locations settle for the upper 60s) before some cloud cover builds in by the late afternoon as winds become more easterly. Partly cloudy and seasonable tomorrow night with temperatures in the low 50s.\n\nSee Brian Jackson\u2019s forecast through this week.

Hurricane Pablo isn\u2019t a big storm, but its very existence in its current location is enough for a record.\n\n#Pablo is now a #hurricane. It became a hurricane at 18.3\u00b0W - the farthest east an Atlantic named storm has first become a hurricane on record - breaking the old record set by Vince in 2005 (18.9\u00b0W). pic.twitter.com/f3Nwh8vXtY \u2014 Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) October 27, 2019\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
