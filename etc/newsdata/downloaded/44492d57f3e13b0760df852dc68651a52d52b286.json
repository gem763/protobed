Or won\u2019t they?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nEither way, markets have generally considered rate cuts good news \u2013 unless, of course, the cut is less than expected. But keep in mind easy monetary policy reflects a good, bad and ugly side of our economic reality.\n\nThe good \u2013 market feel-good factor\n\nThere are potential short-term benefits to cutting rates.\n\nHouseholds and businesses can service their debts easier when rates are low \u2013 freeing up capital for spending or investment. This is the same for the government \u2013 lower rates mean less of a drain on the Treasury\u2019s budget for servicing debt.\n\nLower interest rates can also incentivize businesses and individuals to move up plans for spending on housing or investment, which could accelerate economic activity. However, with central banks guiding to low-rates for a prolonged period of time, there may not be the same rush to borrow as there has been in the past.\n\nANDREW CROWELL: A HAPPY RETIREMENT MAY BE EASIER THAN YOU THINK \u2014 HERE ARE BABY STEPS\n\nRates are also the \u201cdiscount\u201d factor for all investment valuations. So, lower rates mean less of a \u201cdiscount\u201d factor to determine valuations, meaning your portfolio would likely rise in value (all else being equal).\n\nThe bad \u2013 they\u2019re unsustainable\n\nSince the 1980s, the point of rate cuts has been to manage the economic cycle. So, when rates are being cut, it signals that the underlying economy could be slowing and requires stimulation.\n\nBut as rates trend lower and lower, the effect of each cut diminishes. Take Europe, which looks the most at risk of a recession in the developed world, even though policy rates are -0.5 percent.\n\nLow rates are problematic for the real economy, too. They make it harder to conduct financial planning. Retirees looking for meaningful income are forced to take higher risks that might not suit them. Worse, low rates punish savers and reward speculators.\n\nLow rates are problematic for the real economy, too. They make it harder to conduct financial planning. Retirees looking for meaningful income are forced to take higher risks that might not suit them.\n\nWorse, low rates punish savers and reward speculators. On top of that, 44 percent of adult Americans have no allocation toward fixed income because of a \u201clack of understanding of asset classes.\u201d We see this as a potential \u201cmisallocation of capital.\u201d\n\nThe ugly \u2013 death by a thousand cuts\n\nRates are currently sub 2 percent in the U.S. and lower, and even negative, elsewhere.\n\nRather than good news, this actually reflects hard fundamental truths about the economy that we need to face up to.\n\nIt links to the fact that the populations in the developed world are aging. More have transitioned from working age to retirement age. So, the overall proportion of workers in the economy has fallen (and their output needs to support the retirees).\n\nLIBERTY VITTERT: A STATISTICIAN\u2019S GUIDE TO LIFE \u2014 WHAT ONLINE \u2018AVERAGE\u2019 CUSTOMER REVIEWS REALLY MEAN\n\nAn aging population also means that the owners of capital increasingly prefer security and capital preservation to growth (which is a reason why fixed income has steadily grown in terms of inflows, at the expense of equities).\n\nA further problem is that economic growth is driven by population growth and productivity gains. Given shrinking populations, particularly in the 25 to 55 working-age bracket, there is downward pressure on potential growth rates.\n\nMeanwhile, labor productivity growth has been outright poor for over a decade, which we believe is largely a result of tepid business investment.\n\nIn summary, interest rates are lower for structural, and to some extent, cyclical reasons and while rates don\u2019t have significant room to fall, they don\u2019t have much room to rise either.\n\nBut what will follow, is likely a long period of uncertainty. Monetary policy can only do so much.\n\nCentral bankers can\u2019t change demographics any more than they can create the next great innovation. As we reach the final frontier of monetary easing, we will need fiscal and regulatory authorities to pick up the baton to spur economies out of this low growth, low inflation and low rate world.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWith no such action on the visible horizon, central bank-driven markets and low rates are likely here to stay.\n\nGautam Khanna is senior portfolio manager of Insight Investment, a BNY Mellon Investment Management affiliate.", "description": "Easy monetary policy reflects a good, bad and ugly side of our economic reality.", "authors": ["Gautam Khanna"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/bills-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
