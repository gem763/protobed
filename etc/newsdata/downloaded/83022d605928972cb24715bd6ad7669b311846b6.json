And the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations announced an investigation.\n\nInvestigation, indeed. Now: Where are the results?\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing both political parties should be able to come to agreement on it\u2019s that little kids in America ought not to be singing songs that promote the chopping of others\u2019 heads. Yes?\n\nApparently, it\u2019s not moving along as fast as it should. At least to some. At least to a couple of members of Congress \u2014 Republican Reps. Lee Zeldin and Scott Perry \u2014 who penned a letter to the executive director of the Philly commission, Rue Landau, asking if she\u2019s nearly finished \u2014 and if she needs some help from the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201c[This] shocking event at the Muslim American Society (MAS) Islamic Center in Philadelphia to celebrate \u2018Ummah Day\u2019 \u2026 captured children lip syncing in Arabic about beheadings in the name of Islam with lyrics like, \u2018We will chop off their heads. \u2026 We will lead the army of Allah fulfilling his promise, we will subject them to eternal torture.\u2019 Additionally,\u201d the congressmen wrote, \u201cthe anthem called for the elimination of Israel with lyrics promoting jihad.\u201d\n\nThe congressmen also spoke of the ties of MAS to the Muslim Brotherhood and emphasized the need to get to the bottom of who exactly sponsored the April event.\n\n\u201cThis video exposed the indoctrination of young children promoting radical Islamic ideology in the United States,\u201d they wrote, \u201cThat is why we ask for additional information, including the results of your investigation.\u201d\n\nShould say so.\n\nIf anything warrants investigation, this event does.\n\nIt\u2019s good the locals said they launched their own investigation of the affair back in April. But it\u2019s going on five months \u2014 and still no answers? This is definitely a matter for Justice Department scrutiny.\n\nJust as we shouldn\u2019t have children in America running around and singing songs about beheading infidels and so forth \u2014 we can\u2019t have Muslim organizations masquerading as harmless purveyors of the arts, all the while teaching little kids to kill.\n\nKudos to Zeldin and Perry for following up and pressing for answers.\n\nFeds shouldn\u2019t drop the ball on this one.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
