Collaros, 31, is scheduled to become a free agent in February.\n\nThe Bombers also receive a fifth-round pick from Toronto.\n\nWinnipeg becomes Collaros's third team this season. He began the year with Saskatchewan but suffered a concussion in the Riders' season-opening loss to Hamilton.\n\nSaskatchewan put Collaros on the six-game injured list. But with the emergence of backup Cody Fajardo, the club traded Collaros to Toronto for a 2020 fourth-round selection July 31.\n\nCollaros never played a down with the Argos but has been cleared to play.\n\nCollaros threw for 2,999 yards with nine TDs and 13 interceptions in 14 games last season with Saskatchewan. Collaros was traded to the Roughriders in January 2018 by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and signed a one-year deal in the off-season to remain in Regina.\n\nCollaros does address a need in Winnipeg. The Bombers are 2-4 with backup Chris Streveler after incumbent Matt Nichols suffered a season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nLike Collaros, Nichols is scheduled to become a free agent this off-season.\n\nWinnipeg (9-6) has clinched a playoff spot but will chase its first win in four games when it hosts the Montreal Alouettes (8-6) on Saturday.", "description": "The Toronto Argonauts dealt quarterback Zach Collaros to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on Wednesday just prior to the league's trade deadline.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315522.1570657883!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fbo-cfl-blue-bombers-argonauts-20190731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
