(Teresa Wood/Studio Theatre)\n\nTheater critic\n\nWatching Studio Theatre\u2019s well-put-together revival of \u201cDoubt,\u201d you may be struck by the sensation of time having stood still. John Patrick Shanley\u2019s Tony-winning play debuted on Broadway 14 years ago, and eerily \u2014 no, tragically \u2014 the crisis at its heart has in the decade and a half since hardly budged from its prominent place in the headlines.\n\nThe drama\u2019s subject is sexual abuse of children by priests, a scourge that continues to roil the Catholic Church. We are nearing the end of the 2010s and still dealing with the aftershocks of ghastly crimes and coverups. That underlines a dimension of the play that didn\u2019t hit audiences with quite such blunt force in 2005: the degree to which the church would prove unable to root out all of the offenders, and would, according to news reports, even continue to protect some of the worst of them.\n\nShanley suggested the intractability of the anguish in his creation of Father Flynn (here played by Christian Conn), the parish priest at St. Nicholas, a fictional Bronx church and school, whose closeness to a student comes under the scrutiny of its disciplinarian principal, Sister Aloysius (Sarah Marshall). The play is built on the axis of a nagging question having to do with both belief in an unseen God and suspicion of criminality: At what point do intuition and observed patterns form a reasonable assumption?\n\nBut if \u201cDoubt\u201d once came across most forthrightly as a debate play blessed by Shanley\u2019s gift for sober and elegant disputation, it now seems a drama not so much about gray areas as about the all-too-apparent truth. For it\u2019s hard at this late date not to set aside the doubt in \u201cDoubt\u201d and commune entirely with the nun who\u2019s confronted by an institution that has betrayed its charges, and her.\n\nThe shift in one\u2019s sense of the world is a good reason for paying a visit in 2019 to \u201cDoubt,\u201d even if it\u2019s a surprisingly safe choice for the launch of a new season at Studio, a company that tends toward pushing envelopes rather than opening old ones. \u201cDoubt\u201d \u2014 subtitled \u201cA Parable\u201d \u2014 is a conventional, well-made play and, as such, is a little staid for this moment in theater, when exploding the norms feels more and more called for. But then again, there has to be room for looking back at good theater, and on that score, Shanley\u2019s rock-solid achievement would never be considered a step in the wrong direction.\n\nOn Studio\u2019s Metheny stage, in director Matt Torney\u2019s handsomely manicured production, Marshall and Conn go at it bracingly as the clear-eyed sister smells a magnetic rat in the vestments of the clergy. They are joined, ably, in this four-cornered discourse by Amelia Pedlow as a younger, more sensitive nun who\u2019s far less convinced of the transgressions, and Tiffany M. Thompson as the mother of the vulnerable boy whom Sister Aloysius seeks to protect.\n\n\n\nSarah Marshall and Tiffany M. Thompson in Studio Theatre\u2019s revival of John Patrick Shanley\u2019s \u201cDoubt.\u201d (Teresa Wood/Studio Theatre)\n\nAmong all of the attributes of Torney\u2019s production \u2014 which include the fine mid-century costumes of Wade Laboissonniere and set by Daniel Conway \u2014 the best is the work of Marshall. The brittleness of her Sister Aloysius is so meticulously rendered that it would be as proper for an audience member to want to tiptoe around her as to clap. The extent to which Aloysius seeks to assert rectitude and common sense as essential values is beautifully embodied by Marshall, who never in her unforgiving mien asks for our sympathy; rather, she earns it. It is one of the veteran actress\u2019s best performances, which, of course, is what is often said of what she does onstage.\n\nConn, too, is particularly effective, in convincing us of the depth of Father Flynn\u2019s state of denial; in an atmosphere ever murkier, his cocky Flynn carries himself with the conviction of one who holds all the cards. Indeed, \u201cDoubt\u201d posits a \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d-type hierarchy, one that compels Sister Aloysius to observe: \u201cHere there is no man I can turn to \u2014 and men run everything.\u201d\n\nThe racial complication that Shanley introduces \u2014 the eighth-grade victim is the first and only black student at St. Nicholas \u2014 is a device to raise the dramatic stakes, and accords the excellent Thompson a strong scene in which to plead her son\u2019s case. But the terrible choice the dramatist foists on the mother feels heavy-handed, and that she gets only one chance to explain herself lends to a sense of a character being underserved. In 2019, the question of what happens to the unseen student, Donald, hangs distressingly in the air.\n\nStill, Shanley manages with lyrical economy to create a twisting battle of wills, building to the kind of satisfying confrontation scene audiences crave. And with the astounding Marshall up there on the ramparts, the playwright has a hero one can confidently describe as honest-to-God.\n\nDoubt, by John Patrick Shanley. Directed by Matt Torney.
