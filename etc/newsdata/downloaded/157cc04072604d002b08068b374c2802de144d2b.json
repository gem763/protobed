I am usually in an awkward public situation. I am climbing or crawling in a glam look to get to the perfect spot for a photo. Without the behind the scenes, you don't see that. For me, it brings my photos to life.\"\n\nShe added: \"The other thing that I have loved about posting the behind the scenes, is that it educates and validates those who are creators or those who want to be but don't have the confidence.\"\n\nWhile some photos are taken in private, many involve Watts putting herself in risky positions in public.\n\nFor example, in the middle of a skate park...\n\n... Or leaning on a taxi in the middle of a busy road in New York.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, she receives an array of reactions.\n\n\n\n\"Some people will stop and ask what I am shooting photos for,\" she said. \"Others will walk by, pull out their phones to record me, laugh, roll their eyes, etc.\n\n\"It's weirdly kind of fun to see the different reactions. The negative ones really make me want to work harder or do even weirder poses or concepts than what I am doing at that time.\"\n\nSome shots take 45 minutes to capture\n\nHow long it takes to capture the perfect shot varies wildly, too, Watts explained.\n\n\"Sometimes we knock it out of the park and get a shot in 10 minutes,\" she said. \"Other times it takes much longer.\n\n\"The longest we've gone for one creative concept (one picture) was 45 minutes! You just never know what ideas are going to work and how you are going to adjust when your ideas fall through.\"\n\nThat 45-minute shoot wasn't anything elaborate, but simply making toast in a kitchen.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons Watts' photos stand out more than others on Instagram is that she works with professional photographers who also edit her shots for her.\n\n\n\nShe often tags the brands of the clothes she's wearing, but they're mainly fast fashion, such as Asos, Forever 21, and Zara.\n\nWatts has been posting photos and videos in her current style for about 2.5 years, and she still hasn't run out of ideas.\n\n\"I am always brainstorming,\" she said. \"I observe everything in life. When I am driving I look for locations. When I am at home working, I look around and think of props or different scenarios I can capture.\n\n\n\n\"When I am online, I'll be having a conversation with someone, and sometimes the words tossed back and forth give me ideas.\n\n\"Listening to music will spark creative concepts. If I am at the mall shopping, different outfits will spring on different ideas. It wasn't until these last few months where I realised that I have trained my brain to always be seeking out creative concepts.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Paige Watts told Insider that most of the time she looks \"really weird\" doing \"crazy poses\" to get her stylish photos.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9474/8f420c5f4f38483bb800972c2015d3d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
