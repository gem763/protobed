But today we\u2019ve learned that Kim Kardashian West wouldn\u2019t let anything come between her and something extremely critical, like her ideal nail color, on the day her eldest child was born.\n\nDuring a recent episode of her best friend Jonathan Cheban\u2019s podcast, Foodgod: OMFG, Kardashian West opened up about the events that occurred during the day North West entered the world. First, Cheban drove Kardashian West around town and helped her run errands, like getting a bikini wax and picking up a Mcgriddle from Mcdonald\u2019s. You know, all the important things to do before a baby comes.\n\nThen, while dodging paparazzi, Kardashian West gets a call from her doctor, saying she has to deliver the baby that day due to preeclampsia, which is a condition where a pregnant woman has high blood pressure, swollen hands, and other issues. It can have serious health consequences for both the mother and baby.\n\nNow, I\u2019m no mom, but I feel like hearing that would make me run to the hospital immediately. But Kardashian West had more important issues to think about, like her glam. Particularly, her nails, which were a dark, goth shade. Unacceptable!\n\n\u201cMy nails were dark,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was when I was still in my Lincoln Park After Dark phase with my burgundy nails. And I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m having a girl like I really need a nice light pink nail for delivery.\u2019 So I told the doctor, \u2018Are you sure I have to deliver right now, can you give me like two hours?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018Fine meet me in two hours.\u2019\u201d As a fellow Libra, I understand Kim Kardashian\u2019s unwavering want for aesthetic perfection.\n\nAnd listen, North West came out fine. Fine! Some of us just know that you gotta have those nails on point, AND on theme, no matter what\u2026", "description": "On an episode of Jonathan Cheban\u2019s Foodgod podcast, Kim Kardashian West talked about how she pushed back North West\u2019s birth even though she had preeclampsia, because she wanted to make sure she had the right nail color.", "authors": ["Marie Lodi"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/19/19-kimkardashian.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
