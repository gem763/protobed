That has been said before, not just by him but by Ed Miliband and probably by Tony Blair too.\n\nBut today\u2019s speech was different in the scope, scale and detail of the changes he proposed. And it was striking for its conclusion. \u201cI believe our time is coming,\u201d he said. He set out his vision of the \u201cnew world\u201d of the future, ending homelessness, poverty and climate change.\u201cAnd when they ask, \u2018How did you do that?\u2019 You can tell them: \u2018I supported Labour; I joined Labour; I voted for Jeremy Corbyn.

That would not be achieved by legislating for a 32-hour working week, his advisers explained to journalists afterwards. It would be achieved by appointing a quango called the Working Time Commission, modelled on the Low Pay Commission, that would recommend things such as how many bank holidays the country could afford.\n\nThe new world also includes strong trade unions and collective bargaining, which will \u201callow unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector\u201d, which would be set out in \u201clegally binding sectoral agreements\u201d.\n\nBut what if workers democratically decided that they would rather work longer hours for higher pay? McDonnell crashed through the contradictions in his speech. He went straight from the shorter \u201caverage\u201d working week to Labour\u2019s plan to ban zero-hour contracts \u2013 that is, his plan to increase the working week for people who want to work longer hours.\n\nMost of the other elements of the shadow chancellor\u2019s vision of paradise were more credible in the sense that they could be delivered by the application of large sums of money.\n\nMcDonnell had an ingenious ploy to fend off the utopians at his door lobbying for a universal basic income, which was to launch a document about \u201cUniversal Basic Services\u201d. A plan for basic services free at the point of need, extending the principle of the NHS to housing, culture and recreation, could be easier to define and deliver than one for a basic income paid to all citizens, but it is still potentially expensive.\n\nThe more specific the New Jerusalem became, however, the more expensive it was. Labour\u2019s plan for social care \u2013 free personal care for over-65s \u2013 is wholly admirable, and the promise to pay for it out of general taxation, rather than a complex state-run insurance scheme, is sensible.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t in Labour\u2019s manifesto last time. In 2017 the party promised to spend an extra \u00a32bn a year on social care; now it seems to be committed to an extra \u00a320bn a year. Some of that might be recouped from lower NHS spending, but not much.\n\nThis week, the Labour Party has been spending money like there is no tomorrow. The last manifesto set out increases in public spending adding up to \u00a350bn a year \u2013 and the party forgot to include the cost of reversing cuts in working tax credits. That\u2019s several billion; now there\u2019s several billion more for free prescriptions; plus the social care promises on top.\n\nAll of the spending is desirable, but the religion of socialism is the language of priorities, as Nye Bevan said. The means for raising the money to pay for McDonnell\u2019s plans were not well scrutinised at the last election and the means for raising the even greater sums now have not even been set out yet.\n\nHow is it to be done? By faith alone. By believing in Jeremy Corbyn. That\u2019s how.", "description": "John McDonnell is the Martin Luther of his day.
