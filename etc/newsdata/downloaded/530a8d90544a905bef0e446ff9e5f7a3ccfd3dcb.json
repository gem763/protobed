But their warnings have grown louder this week after a new report by Human Rights First revealed that there were at least 340 reports of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent attacks against people returned to Mexico while they wait for their case to be heard in US immigration court.\n\nUrsela Ojeda, a policy adviser at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, has visited the border multiple times to see how the policy is being implemented and said the new report was the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen you see people not showing up for their court hearing in Remain in Mexico, you have to wonder what happened to the people who aren\u2019t there,\u201d Ojeda said.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to know why they just missed court \u2013 they could have been kidnapped, they could have been killed, they could have been put on a bus by the Mexican government and shoved to another part of the country with no way to get back.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights First report surveys gruesome incidents, such as when a three-year-old boy from Honduras and his parents were kidnapped after being returned to Nuevo Laredo. The mother said the last time she saw her husband he was lying on the ground, beaten and bleeding and told her: \u201cLove, they\u2019re going to kill us.\u201d The kidnappers released the three-year-old and his mother, who doesn\u2019t know if her husband is alive.\n\nA Cuban asylum seeker told the group he saw a group of men stop a taxi outside a Mexican government immigration office and kidnap the four Venezuelan women and girl inside who were being sent to a shelter.\n\nMigrants, mostly from Mexico, are pictured sitting on the ground waiting near the Paso del Norte Bridge at the Mexico-US border, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on 12 September.

The US State department issued a level 4 travel warning for the region because \u201cviolent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion and sexual assault is common\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Tuesday, the acting head of US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), Mark Morgan, ignored multiple questions about what the US government was doing to address the violence facing people sent back to Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to overcome the message that the cartels have been putting out there that it\u2019s going to be a free ride into the United States,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019re now sending the message that, if you\u2019re coming here as an economic migrant, you\u2019re not going to be allowed into the United States.\u201d\n\nHe celebrated the program for keeping people out of the US, where they would have been detained or released while they waited for their court date. He also said the program was stopping smugglers and improving due process \u2013 though advocates say it is doing the exact opposite.\n\nShelters and other aid groups are overwhelmed by the migrants pouring into border towns and many are left to sleep and fend for themselves on the streets, without healthcare or work opportunities.\n\nAttorneys say it is nearly impossible to provide legal counsel. Some of the US-based attorneys who have crossed the border have received credible threats of violence and the US has not secured an agreement with Mexico to ensure US attorneys don\u2019t get arrested for practicing law in Mexico without a license.\n\nAt the end of August only 34 out of 9,702 people placed into the Remain in Mexico program had legal representation \u2013 just 0.4%, according to researchers at Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (Trac).\n\nThere is also little accountability for the government\u2019s claim that vulnerable people are exempt from the program on a case-by-case basis. Human Rights First said the screening process is a \u201cfarce\u201d and advocacy groups have seen vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and LGBT people, returned.", "description": "Advocates have sounded the alarm about the dangers of Remain in Mexico program as report reveals at least 340 instances of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent attacksMigrants, mostly from Central America, wait to board a van which will take them to a processing center, in El Paso, Texas, on 16", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch In New York"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wEGP08y3ksSmIs0d8jrWpw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/3184e1cf35c6fb1772bf8dd78791a6ec", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
