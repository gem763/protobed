The government hasn't done anything. It's not just the metro fare that triggered this and ended in vandalism,\" sandwich seller Carlos Lucero, 30, told AFP.\n\nHe said the government needed to take concrete measures \"to improve salaries, health, pensions\".\n\nOn Sunday, five people died when a garment factory was torched by rioters in a Santiago suburb, despite right-wing Pinera's Saturday announcement that he was suspending the fare increase.\n\nTwo women burned to death after a store owned by US retail chain Walmart was set alight in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nAlmost all public transport was paralyzed in Santiago on Sunday, with shops shuttered and many flights canceled at the international airport, leaving thousands of people stranded due to a curfew imposed from 7pm until dawn.\n\n'Listen to the people'\n\nAuthorities reported 103 serious incidents throughout the country with 1 462 people detained - 614 in Santiago and 848 in the rest of the country.\n\nIn some neighbourhoods, residents donned the yellow vests made popular by French protesters earlier this year, and wielded sticks vowing to protect their homes, local shops and supermarkets.\n\n\"There were some attempted robberies in this area so we got organized to defend ourselves,\" Priscila, from eastern Santiago, told Canal 24 Horas.\n\nChile international footballer Arturo Vidal, a midfielder for Spanish giants Barcelona wrote on Sunday night: \"I pray that my beloved Chile will be better.\"\n\nAmong the buildings torched and damaged in the violence were the headquarters of the ENEL Chile power company and a Banco Chile branch - both in the center of Santiago - and Chile's oldest newspaper, El Mercurio, in Valparaiso.\n\nSocial tensions erupt\n\nLouis de Grange, president of the state Metro S.A. company, told Canal 13 the \"brutal destruction\" of Santiago's metro service - South America's largest and most modern, used by around three million people a day - had caused more than $300 million in damage.\n\nThe proposed hike in fares would have raised the price of peak hour travel from 800 to 830 pesos ($1.11 to $1.15).\n\nThe government said the rise, which followed a 20-peso increase in January, was driven by rising oil prices and a weakening peso.\n\nInitially, students and others responded by fare-dodging, but underlying social tensions quickly bubbled to the surface.\n\nAlthough Chile has the highest per capita income of Latin America at $20 000, there is widespread frustration at privatised health care and education, rising costs of basic services and falling pensions.", "description": "Chile's death toll has risen to 11, authorities said on Monday, after three days of violent demonstrations and looting that saw President Sebastian Pinera claim the country was \"at war.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/123/4329b23755264af295869ecba21bdece.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
