In fact, the crowds got so big that the store was forced to cut opening day short over safety worries, according to news reports. For Costco, the day one response \u2014 and the inevitable surge in new memberships \u2014 should temper concerns on Wall Street that its bulk-selling model wouldn\u2019t work in the hyper local Chinese food market.\n\nA Costco spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment on membership signups.\n\nIt\u2019s very likely that Costco becomes a key retailer in China as the growing middle class \u2014 which is triggering investments in larger living spaces and creating more income \u2014 drives demand to buy in bulk (which is still a rather unique model in the country).\n\nCostco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti confirmed on a May conference call with analysts it plans to open its second warehouse in China within the next two years despite trade war concerns.\n\n\u201cChina's a little unique in many ways aside from any issues right now with tariffs. That's not hopefully a long-term issue. Each item has to be registered separately,\u201d Galanti said.\n\nCostco isn\u2019t alone in selling bulk goods to the Chinese masses. Walmart\u2019s (WMT) Sam\u2019s Club has been in China for about 20 years. The warehouse chain has roughly 24 stores open in the country. It said earlier this year it plans to add 16 more locations in mainland China by 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s what folks are saying about Costco\u2019s new store on Twitter:\n\nCostco just opened its first store in China and had to close it after 5 hours due to too many people...The video on Douyin captured the craze pretty well $COST pic.twitter.com/Uots66O1Nj \u2014 Krystal Hu (@readkrystalhu) August 27, 2019\n\nInstead of leaving China, US retail giant Costco opened its first Chinese store in Shanghai on Tuesday. Consumers waited in long queue to get inside the store. Such a grand opening can't be seen in other places. Chinese market is crucial to American companies. pic.twitter.com/93oGP1QOdf \u2014 Hu Xijin \u80e1\u9521\u8fdb (@HuXijin_GT) August 27, 2019\n\n#Costco opened its Shanghai outlet, causing traffic jam and huge crowds waiting to shop.
