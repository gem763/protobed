With the draft of this weekend\u2019s Final Document now in discussion among the gathering\u2019s 12 language-based workgroups, a report earlier today from Chris Lamb of the London-based Tablet said that a proposition for the ordination of women to the permanent diaconate in Amazonia has made it into the current stage of the all-important closing text. While unsurprising given the explicit openness to the idea from a majority of the circuli minores in their Friday reports, that the sheer prospect of ordaining women would be contained in a Vatican document \u2013 even in preliminary form \u2013 is staggering to a degree that, on this beat, few things genuinely are. Yet even as the ultimate product lies in the hands of the 13-man drafting team led by the Relator-General, the Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes OFM, you can bet the house that nothing would be put on the table without Francis\u2019 implicit approval\u2026 and even so, the notion of extending the priesthood to married men in the Amazon \u2013 and, for that matter, the admittance of women to the instituted ministries of lector and acolyte \u2013 suddenly doesn\u2019t feel so big after all. That said, as discussion on and proposed amendments to the draft Final continue from within the small groups, there\u2019s still a long way between now and Friday, when the finished proposals \u2013 usually over 100 in all \u2013 are presented in the Aula before Saturday\u2019s voting, where each proposition must receive two-thirds approval from the 185 clerical members (i.e. 124 \u201cplacets\u201d) to pass. And again, given the now-explicit possibility that the Pope can simply ratify a Synod\u2019s Final Document as a text of the Magisterium at will, the stakes are higher than most would\u2019ve anticipated.\n\nRead his entire post.\n\nA friend \u2014 a conservative Evangelical \u2014 brought that to my attention earlier tonight. He texted (I quote this with his permission):\n\nYou know, I have never believed that the claims of the Church of Rome were true, but I have always taken a certain comfort in the belief that Rome would hold firm to its ancient convictions. And now the Ancient Faith is being transformed into the Episcopal Church before my eyes \u2014 the dismantling could be completed in less than a decade of this papacy. Of all the amazing things happening around the world this is surely the most amazing. How could anyone doubt the \u201cliquid modernity\u201d thesis after this?\n\n\u201cLiquid modernity\u201d is the concept that the late sociologist Zygmunt Bauman came up with to describe our present condition. An explanation:\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bauman was known as a key theorist of postmodernity. While many theorists of the postmodern condition argued that it signified a radical break with modern society, Bauman contended that modernity had always been characterized by an ambivalent, \u201cdual\u201d nature. On the one hand, Bauman saw modern society as being largely characterized by a need for order\u2014a need to domesticate, categorize, and rationalize the world so it would be controllable, predictable, and understandable. It is this ordering, rationalizing tendency that Max Weber saw as the characteristic force of modernization. But, on the other hand, modernity was also always characterized by radical change, by a constant overthrowing of tradition and traditional forms of economy, culture, and relationship\u2014\u201call that is solid melts into air,\u201d as Marx characterized this aspect of modern society. For Bauman, postmodernity is the result of modernity\u2019s failure to rationalize the world and the amplification of its capacity for constant change. In later years, Bauman felt that the term \u201cpostmodern\u201d was problematic and started using the term liquid modernity to better describe the condition of constant mobility and change he sees in relationships, identities, and global economics within contemporary society. Instead of referring to modernity and postmodernity, Bauman writes of a transition from solid modernity to a more liquid form of social life. For Bauman, the consequences of this move to a liquid modernity can most easily be seen in contemporary approaches to self-identity. In liquid modernity, constructing a durable identity that coheres over time and space becomes increasingly impossible, according to Bauman. We have moved from a period where we understood ourselves as \u201cpilgrims\u201d in search of deeper meaning to one where we act as \u201ctourists\u201d in search of multiple but fleeting social experiences.\n\nWhat my Evangelical correspondent means is that what was once solid no longer is. The thing that seemed most solid within Christianity \u2014 the teachings of the Catholic Church \u2014 are now revealed to be made not of rock, but lava. My friend continued:\n\nRemember when all the trad/conservative Catholics were confidently claiming that JP2 and B16 had transformed the church through their wise appointments and driven out the \u201cSpirit of Vatican II\u201d once and for all? So what happened? Why didn\u2019t it work out that way? I have looked for answers and haven\u2019t found any.\n\nThat\u2019s a very good question. I don\u2019t have a good answer either, only some intuitions. I\u2019ll throw it open to you readers.\n\nFor one, I think conservative Catholics \u2014 I was one of them, as you know \u2014 were victims of wishful thinking in a particular way. We thought that because the Catholic Church is an absolute monarchy, having a strong, orthodox pope at the pinnacle would cause reform to flow down and out to the peripheries. We didn\u2019t count on the fact that liberals staffed the Church\u2019s bureaucracy, and had a lot of staying power.\n\nSecond, the kind of conservative Catholics (CCs, from here on) prone to believing this, and talking about it, were intellectuals. I came into the Catholic Church at age 26, and was genuinely shocked by the chasm between the actual, existing parish churches, and the Catholic Church as reflected in the writings of contributors to First Things magazine, Crisis, and the other CC publications I devoured, as well as the many writings by converts and apologists.\n\nTo be fair, I had the starry eyes of a convert, and was ready to be talked into buying the narrative. I became serious about Christianity at the same time I felt called to Catholicism, and I remember thinking that all these other churches are either surrendering to the spirit of the Age, or eventually will \u2014 but not the Roman Catholic Church! It seemed like such a solid thing. Anyway, intellectuals are prone to believing that if you think clearly, everything will get sorted. Looking back, it\u2019s easy to see how those wonderful encyclicals by JP2 made people think that a new day was dawning, and that there would be no turning back.\n\nThird, JP2 and BXVI did not appoint stellar bishops across the board. There are no doubt many reasons for this, but something to keep in mind is that the bishop-making system is designed to produce yes-men and managerial types. And, though the pope names bishops, he typically chooses from a handful recommended by the local bishops\u2019 conference. It\u2019s not possible for any pope to know everything about episcopal candidates. He has to rely on those he\u2019s delegated to give him good advice. You could blame JP2 and BXVI for poor episcopal appointments, or at least not-great ones, but you also have to consider what they had to work with, and the constraints under which they labored.\n\nFourth, there is the matter of keeping up appearances. A Catholic friend back in the late 1990s repeated to me the substance of a conversation a leader in one of the lay movements had with a curial cardinal. The layman wanted to know why the pope (JP2) was not governing with a stronger hand against dissenters. The cardinal said that the pope well knows that the Catholic Church is in a state of undeclared schism, and he hopes to keep everything together long enough for the dissenters to age out. I had no way to verify that anecdote, but it sounded plausible.\n\nAlong those lines, there was this in 2012 from the traditionalist Catholic writer Christopher Ferrara:\n\nThe answer is revealed by an incident of which I was reliably informed during a recent Ignatian retreat at the Retreat House of the Society of Saint Pius X in Ridgefield, Connecticut. During an audience with the Pope, Bishop Fellay found himself alone with the Pope for a moment. His Excellency seized the opportunity to remind the Pope that he is the Vicar of Christ, possessed of the authority to take immediate measures to end the crisis in the Church on all fronts. The Pope replied thus: \u201cMy authority ends at that door.\u201d (Castel Gondolfo August, 2005)\n\nAgain, that\u2019s a secondhand story, but it sounds plausible. I was told a few years back by a priest who knows Benedict XVI personally that the reason he resigned was because he concluded that he was a figurehead, blocked on all sides by the curia, without actual power. He hoped that the Holy Spirit would send a pope who had the strength and the capability to defeat the curial evildoers. That, as we know, is not how it all came down. But that was BXVI\u2019s hope, or so my source said. (I have heard versions of this basic story repeated by others since then.)\n\nWhat does it mean for an absolute monarch whose office has exclusive, God-given powers, to have little effective control over his kingdom? This is not a question that faithful Catholics, especially conservatives. were eager to ask, because it could call the entire system into question.\n\nIt is also the case that both JP2 and BXVI were fated to lead the Catholic Church in a time of widespread dechristianization in the West, even apostasy. Here\u2019s a quote from Roberto Suro, who covered JP2 for the Washington Post, and who was interviewed by the PBS Frontline documentary series for a film about him (transcript here). The part I\u2019ve highlighted below is what came to mind just now as I was thinking about my Evangelical friend\u2019s question, but the entire quote is so good that it deserves reproducing:\n\nI think if you\u2019re going to try to judge John Paul\u2019s legacy, it has to be on his own terms, as a spiritual figure, as a religious leader. Not as a worldly man. Not in terms of his impact on culture or politics. But he is someone who clearly believed that this time in the world\u2019s history that there was an opportunity for great spiritual reawakening, for a new understanding for humanity in spiritual and moral terms. A time for the ascendancy of Catholicism, in the demise of Communism and Capitalism. It didn\u2019t happen. Now, it may well have been that he was struggling against something that was overwhelming. Twentieth century culture with its materialism, its immorality, in his terms, \u2013the force of ideology\u2013were too great for him to overcome. But you know, had he done what he set out to do, he would have been another Saint Paul, a Luther, a man who transformed humanity\u2019s understanding of itself, transformed Christendom certainly. Instead, I think he ends up a smaller figure than that\u2013a Lincoln, a Thomas Jefferson, a St. Thomas More. A man who stood for great value and had a tremendous impact on the world, but maybe didn\u2019t change it as much as he believed possible, or as much as he believed was necessary. Now whether that was his failing or ours, is a much more difficult question. \u2026I think the pope has to be a prophetic figure, somebody who changed humanity. What he offered, what he suggested, the road laid out, if followed, would have transformed humanity in a spiritual sense. He was calling at the end of the twentieth century for a spiritual life to become the center of man\u2019s humanity, for all men, and certainly for all Catholics and all Christians to rediscover spirituality as the guiding force in their lives. If he had accomplished that, he would have been a millennial figure, not the man of the century. Somebody who produced much grander changes than that. Instead he is a historical figure, he\u2019s somebody who lives within the period of time, who had a message that had impact, that changed events, that changed lives, but did not nearly reach the dimensions that were the ambitions that its author set out. At the end of the day, when you look at this extraordinary life and you see all that he\u2019s accomplished, all the lives he\u2019s touched, the nations whose history he\u2019s changed, the way he\u2019s become such a powerful figure in our culture, in all of modern culture\u2013among believers and not\u2013taking all of that into account, you\u2019re left with one very disturbing and difficult question. On the one hand, the Pope can seem this lonely, pessimistic figure\u2013a man who only sees the dark side of modernity, a man obsessed with the evils of the twentieth century, a man convinced that humankind has lost its way. A man so dark, so despairing, that he loses his audiences. That would make him a tragic figure, certainly. On the other hand, you have to ask, is he a prophet? Did he come here with a message? Did he see something that many of us are missing? In that case, the tragedy is ours.\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger \u2014 who became Benedict XVI \u2014 was JP2\u2019s right-hand man for his entire papacy, so what is said about JP2 can also be said to some degree about Ratzinger. To the extent they failed, it was because it would have been impossible for anybody to succeed in these times.\n\nNevertheless, the system they left in place, in which every cardinal who voted on BXVI\u2019s successor had been named either by JP2 or BXVI, was supposed to be fail-safe. It was not supposed to produce a revolutionary figure like Francis. But it did. And he\u2019s tearing down JP2\u2019s and BXVI\u2019s legacies, in substantive ways (e.g., what the pope is doing to Pontifical John Paul II Institute).\n\nThose are my thoughts. I agree with my conservative Evangelical friend: it is beyond astonishing that the Catholic Church is being transformed into the Episcopal Church right before our eyes. It is one of the most important religious stories of my lifetime or anybody\u2019s lifetime. It is one thing when the parish down the street is a hotbed of theological revolution. It is quite another when the Vatican is.\n\nI would really like to hear from Catholics and other Church watchers willing to offer non-ranty, serious answers to my friend\u2019s questions, which I\u2019ll repeat:\n\nRemember when all the trad/conservative Catholics were confidently claiming that JP2 and B16 had transformed the church through their wise appointments and driven out the \u201cSpirit of Vatican II\u201d once and for all? So what happened? Why didn\u2019t it work out that way? I have looked for answers and haven\u2019t found any.\n\nSerious comments only. If you just want to take potshots at Rome, or at Rome\u2019s critics, save yourself the trouble, because I\u2019m not going to post your remarks.\n\nOne thing is for sure: the kind of appeal that conservative Catholic apologists made to potential converts like me \u2014 that Rome was a solid rock in a world of theological shifting sand \u2014 is no longer plausible.
