Imagine a new law was passed which said all students over the age of 14 did not have to attend school: 'Learning is no longer compulsory. You do not have to be educated if it is against your will. Parents: this is not about you; it's about the kids. Teachers will still be here (this is not about them either) and exams will still run. Lessons will continue as usual, but feel free not to come in if you don't want to.'", "description": "Author Mark Twain once said: 'I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/article/20090907/20090907151552.jpg", "published_at": "2009-08-17"}
