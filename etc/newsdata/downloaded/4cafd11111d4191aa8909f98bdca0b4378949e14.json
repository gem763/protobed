There'd be an organised boycott of sunflower seeds, and vegans would block every refinery importing oil from the Black Sea.\n\nBut humans? One of them a child? Worl, they jus' wanted ver benefits, dint they? Comin' over 'ere, tryin' to be British. We're not 'AVIN' it.\n\nCue the Home Secretary, Priti Pathetic, announcing she was \"shocked and saddened\" by the news which has in no way stopped her proposing only migrants who earn \u00a336,700 a year will be accepted in a country where the average employee earns \u00a324,232.\n\nOh, and saying she'd \"end the free movement of people once and for all\". Without apparently noticing it would be replaced by the trafficking of people, instead.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nNo word yet from Theresa May, architect of the \"hostile environment\" which not only forced migrants fleeing certain death into the hands of criminal gangs, but also led to illegally deporting actual British citizens who just happened to be black. Presumably there'll be something about thoughts and prayers for the dead, and sotto voce muttering about how they had it coming.\n\nJust for comparison, 39 people is slightly more than the number of children in the average school classroom. It is an almost-full bus, half a train carriage. It is about three times the number of dead badgers in bags in this picture.\n\nWould you still blame them for putting themselves in danger, if you could see people inside these bags? In a pile 3 times the size?\n\nThis is a problem that is about to get magnificently worse.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are fleeing a fresh war in the Middle East that was sparked by Donald Trump's crazed whim.\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to evict 3.6m refugees. He doesn't care where, and is prepared to point them at Europe if it tries to stop him invading Syria.\n\nWhite phosphorus is being fired at children, a chemical weapon so atrocious that it melts skin, fuses bones, and burns whatever you use to extinguish it.\n\n(Image: ANHA)\n\nErdogan is helping Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad to control land they've been kept out of for the best part of a decade. Land controlled by our strongest, and sanest, allies. Land in which the terrorists we fear most are jailed, on our behalf.\n\nBut we will not stop him. Partly because wewe can't be bothered, partly because we're too enthralled at our own Brexit, but mostly because we are scared of Muslims.\n\nThis week, the government is in the High Court arguing one of the people it is most worried about is a child who birthed and buried 3 children on her own after being groomed by a gang of rapists.\n\nIf Shamima Begum was white - if she was called Sharon Brown - she'd be home by now. She'd face British justice, in the same way IRA and UDA terrorists did, in the same way anti-gay nail bombers and Nazi race warriors do.\n\nInstead, she is forced to argue for her right to go to a British jail.\n\nShe is alleged to have committed dreadful crimes, on top of the crime of joining ISIS in the first place. But she was pregnant at 15, widowed at the age she should have been going to university, and is now living in a form of squalor that has not been seen in Britain since the Middle Ages.\n\nThe British government has stripped her of citizenship, which is illegal unless she has another country to go to. Sajid Javid says she can go to Bangladesh, where she has never set foot before. Bangladesh says it'll hang her on sight. It's not exactly a home.\n\nYet any government that brings her home would be accused of importing terrorism. The legal aid system which has funded her court fight has been criticised for letting terrorists play the system.\n\nShe is not arguing her innocence, or her freedom. She is arguing for the right to pay her penalty with a jail term in the land of her birth - the same right you, I, Priti Patel and Theresa May all enjoy.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBoris Johnson has the right to a fair trial by a jury of his peers in the UK. And he wasn't born here.\n\nBut he's rich and he's white and he's a citizen of a country with a worldwide reputation for fairness.\n\nThat's why migrants want our benefits. That's why they take their lives in their hands, give their life savings to criminals, consent to being locked in airless trucks for days at a time. They want the benefit of not being executed for making the wrong choices, of being able to live, love, work and move freely. They want to be British, and that's something many people are bizarrely offended by.\n\nPersonally, I'm flattered. Even more so, considering how little we do to deserve it.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShamima Begum did not join ISIS because she was foreign. Nor did she join it because she was Muslim. She joined it because she did not appreciate what she had, and in that she's just like every other Briton.\n\nWe do not appreciate, as a country, how we are seen by others. We do not value our justice system, do not think it reasonable that the poorest should have a lawyer provided for them, do not believe that stripping some of our citizens of rights will, eventually, lead to the loss of our own.\n\nThere are going to be more migrants. They will be driven by wars we refuse to intercede in, climate change we refuse to tackle, and terrorists we refuse to take responsibility for.\n\nThe 7/7 bombers were British. The Manchester Arena bomber was British. We dismiss them as being radicalised by a religion. But the London nail bomber was British. The man who murdered Jo Cox was British. We did not say they were Christianity's problem. We said they were OUR problem.\n\n(Image: Huddersfield Daily Examiner)\n\nPolice warn today that our fastest-growing terror threat is from white supremacist Nazis. International aid agencies warn Trump's Syrian disaster is freeing hardened ISIS fighters, and turning the Kurds against their former allies in the West.\n\nYet this country - this bright, brave, internationally-shining union of four nations that seems to have forgotten what greatness is - will not even bring home British mothers and children to save them from being radicalised by murderers, groomed by rapists, and turned into brainwashed soldiers for a hopeless cause.\n\nIt is them and us, the whole world over. The West versus ISIS, animals versus humans, right versus wrong. And of course it's racist - we'll deal with white terrorists, but not the brown ones.\n\n'We' are not the animals, here. So why do we keep acting like we are?*\n\n\n\n* NB: Animals would like it to be known they are distancing themselves from the British", "description": "The British are not animals.
