I find this is essential for capturing the most accurate representation of a room as possible. It is camera vs. eye, and not all cameras are created equal, especially in comparison to the vast dynamic range of our eyes. I am known for bright, crisp images, so it always surprises my clients and followers when I methodically flip off all light switches as we begin photographing a space. It may be counterintuitive, but it yields the most accurate representation of the room\u2019s color and all the beauty within it.\n\nBe a straight shooter: I am a back-to-basics kind of woman in every area of my life, especially when it comes to angles behind the lens. Let\u2019s keep things simple and shoot straight-on. This will yield beautiful, clean lines and communicate the composition of the space. Overly complicated angles result in fussy images and confusing focal points.\n\nLayer on: An image is technically flat, but what makes it come to life with great dimension are its \u201clayers.\u201d The rooms you are shooting need to communicate to the viewer. So, tangibly, there needs to be an element of visual texture to the space for it to have dimension. Ways to add layers include decorative tabletop accessories, mirrors, layered artwork leaning against a wall, layered rugs, texture-rich throws and fabrics, and flowers picked from the garden. Pro tip: Leave the red roses at the store and stick with a neutral color palette such as whites, green and blushes. This color palette will keep an image fresh and attainable without being season-specific.\n\nProp with proof of life: When styling for shoots, I add an element of practical fantasy to each space, but it\u2019s important to keep it as natural and minimally invasive as possible. I call this \u201cproof of life.\u201d Use it as an opportunity to highlight the history of the home or honor the character of the client. Some of my favorite tools for introducing proof of life are an open book on a desk, fresh florals on a kitchen counter, branches to add textural layers to a bedroom, a simple necklace coming out of a jewelry dish to showcase depth, or fruit falling from a bowl as an element of interest.", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | Natural light is essential for capturing the most accurate representation of a room.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=131", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
