In addition to feeling undermined by the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into the Russia probe's origins, sources also said FBI officials were frustrated with how the Justice Department handled a criminal referral related to a whistleblower's allegations against Trump, saying it added to a sense that the bureau was being \"neutered.\"\n\nAt the heart of the controversy are Trump's repeated efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Biden is one of the 2020 Democratic front-runners and Trump's chief political rival.\n\nRead more: Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Rudy Giuliani violated foreign lobbying laws in Ukraine\n\nTrump ordered his administration to hold up a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine in July. A few days later, on July 25, the president had a phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart the US \"does a lot for Ukraine.\"\n\nZelensky acknowledged that and said Ukraine wanted to purchase more Javelins \u2014 a powerful US-made anti-tank missile \u2014 from the US. Trump immediately followed up and told Zelensky he would like Ukraine to \"do us a favor, though,\" and investigate Biden.\n\nTrump made no direct mention of the aid package, but his request was alarming enough to White House officials and others on the call that they began discussing how to \"lock down\" all records of the conversation, and White House lawyers immediately began working on damage control, according to a whistleblower complaint a US intelligence official filed against Trump in August.\n\nTrump Zelensky More\n\nAP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nOfficials are concerned about whether the FBI is being 'neutered as an organization'\n\nOne US official who works in counterintelligence told Insider that staff at the bureau were not only \"blindsided\" by the contents of Trump's call with Zelensky but also frustrated with the Justice Department's handling of the matter.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the intelligence-community inspector general, and Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, sent the whistleblower's complaint to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation because of concerns that the president may have violated campaign-finance laws by asking the Ukrainian government to manufacture dirt on his political opponent.\n\nRead more: Trump says he doesn't know if Rudy Giuliani is still his lawyer amid reports that Giuliani is under federal investigation", "description": "Officials were stunned not just by the nature of Trump's actions but also by his brazenness, which came months after the FBI closed the Russia probe.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4Tz6SOuE08Of0hFPlh2oeA--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/888168b95cd9f340ecefb307e7cf849d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
