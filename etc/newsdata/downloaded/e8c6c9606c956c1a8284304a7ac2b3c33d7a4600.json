Over 300 local community volunteers have joined the Facebook group, looking to get involved.\n\nSteve says that since hearing the TFL announcement and starting to meet more people experiencing homelessness, he\u2019s realised that \u2018it\u2019s very easy to think that because there are so many of us bearing witness to homelessness, that someone else is doing something to help\u2019.\n\nInstead, he says, \u2018we all need to be showing solidarity and connection on a human level \u2013 it\u2019s not a case of charity\u2019.\n\nSteve and Gem started the community meal with the support of a group called Streets Kitchen, one of a number of rapidly-growing groups working on homelessness.\n\nBorn out of a squat five years ago, Streets Kitchen is a group set up to support the homeless community with food, essential supplies such as clothes and menstrual products, and information. It\u2019s run by volunteers \u2013 many of whom have experienced homelessness themselves \u2013 and the founding principle is \u2018solidarity not charity\u2019. People all over London have been using their guide to start street kitchens in their own community.\n\nStreets Kitchen isn\u2019t only about providing sustenance for the homeless, says founder Jon Glackin, and it\u2019s definitely not about \u2018charity\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon tells us: \u2018As a charity you\u2019re handing down support, like you\u2019re \u2018better\u2019 than the other person. We act in solidarity, we work with mutual aid, we work together \u2013 we recognise that we\u2019re a community who can work together to resolve issues.\u2019\n\nStreets Kitchen poster (Picture: StreetsKitchen)\n\nStreets Kitchen works in partnership with The Outside Project \u2013 an LGBT+ group that launched at London Pride in 2017 and created the UK\u2019s first LGBT+ homeless shelter and community centre. As well as providing practical support that centres the needs of LGBT+ people experiencing homelessness, they organise weekly socials with films, popcorn, fizzy pop and hot chocolate.\n\nAnother organisation aiming to meet the varied needs of different groups of people experiencing homelessness is Refugee Community Kitchen (RCK).\n\nLike Streets Kitchen, RCK aims to build solidarity with homeless communities by building networks of people committed to providing reliable sources of support. Founded in 2015, the organisation has groups in London and northern France \u2013 in Calais and Dunkirk, RCK serves 2000 meals a day to refugees fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, from places like Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, and Eritrea.\n\nIn East London, Bob Trafford helps to run a twice-weekly RCK street kitchen. The group of around ten local volunteers serve up to 100 meals each week in Hackney and Bethnal Green, and in the process have nurtured a sense of community.\n\nBob, who co-founded the East London RCK, says: \u2018Solidarity essentially means: there is a problem \u2013 widespread poverty forcing people onto the streets, and we want to stand with the people that are in the jaws of that problem, stand right next to them, and fight that problem together in some small way, instead of standing somewhere else, handing down charity to them from some other place\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as the food and other essentials, Bob says the RCK group is about \u2018greeting people with a smile, listening, sharing food, and music, and breaking down some of the barriers that get erected between people when it comes to the issue of homelessness\u2019.\n\nMigrants and refugees in London experiencing homelessness face compounded challenges. The services that might be on offer may be inaccessible for people who don\u2019t speak or read English, or those who have English as an additional language. And many migrants have \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019 status \u2013 meaning that can\u2019t access basic support such as housing or benefits.\n\nShaunna Rushton, a volunteer with Streets Kitchen, is part of a growing campaign to fight in solidarity with the homeless around issues such as \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019. This year she started organising with the recently-launched Labour Homelessness Campaign \u2013 a group of Labour Party members and homelessness campaigners pushing for the Labour Party to take a strong stand on homelessness.\n\nShaunna says: \u2018I got involved with Streets Kitchen and the Labour Homelessness Campaign because \u2013 as a human and a Londoner \u2013 I felt an urgent need to show solidarity with those experiencing poverty and exclusion in our painfully unequal society\u2019.\n\nThe Labour Homelessness Campaign had a motion passed at the Labour Party conference this year. Among their demands are an end to the criminalisation of homelessness \u2013 people sleeping rough often receive fines and other sanctions for simply existing on the streets \u2013 and an end to \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019 status for migrant rough sleepers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As someone who campaigns around homelessness, what really makes me hopeful is that I see more and more people, groups of people, rallying together alongside homeless people, being led by them,\u2019 says Shaunna.\n\nStreets Kitchen in Clapham is now busy every week. (Picture: Steve Jurado)\n\nPart of this increasing solidarity has included more direct action linked to the homelessness crisis. Last year, Streets Kitchen activists and allies occupied an empty corporate-owned building to open a community shelter, and just yesterday,activists occupied a tunnel beneath Parliament that was barricaded shut to stop homeless people sleeping there.\n\nBob says that he hopes more people will resist society\u2019s dehumanisation of people experiencing homelessness, and show active solidarity.\n\n\u2018The alternative is what we see every day,\u2019 he says, \u2018and it\u2019s shocking that we\u2019re learning how not to look at homeless people, or interact with people who are in need.\n\n\u2018You come out of the station and hear a voice and by the time someone has asked you for some change, you\u2019ve already said \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve no change\u201d, and you haven\u2019t even looked around.\u2019\n\nBob says communities need to wake up to the fact this \u2018automated\u2019 interaction is in fact \u2018really shocking, actually kind of terrifying\u2019.\n\nJon from Streets Kitchen is hopeful that things are changing.\n\nThrough the strengthening network of grassroots groups organising around homelessness, Jon and activists like him hope more Londoners will rally around the crisis on our streets.\n\nThis Sunday, a coalition of groups \u2013 including Streets Kitchen and The Outside Project \u2013 are hosting an event to help do just that. Shock to the System: a community response to homelessness, held at Union Chapel in Islington, is an open event for everyone concerned about the rising homelessness crisis, and will include panel discussions, performances, and a documentary screening \u2013 all with the aim of fostering solidarity with those on our streets.\n\n\u2018I believe that people are beginning to understand homelessness once more,\u2019 says Jon, \u2018people are realising that it\u2019s close to them, that many of us are just a paycheck away from it \u2013 Londoners have always been showing solidarity, but sometimes people just don\u2019t know how to help.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum who bragged about being a \u2018kept woman\u2019 reveals she was homeless for three months\n\nMORE: Homeless woman filmed singing opera in subway station \u2018should be performing on stage\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "This Sunday Shock to the System: a community response to homelessness will take place in Islington.", "authors": ["Sophie Hemery"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89291643_1570879445.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
