The title, Passing The Torch, is also apt - it was what she physically did at London 2012 and, at the age now of 80 and after major heart surgery last year, is what she still does with as much vigour as ever.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the most amazing life through sport - the joy of travel, opportunities, friendship and health,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to inspire the next generation. I think so many children these days will have arthritic thumbs with iPads and iPhones but just reading a story of somebody else\u2019s success can make them wonder, \u2018Can I do that?\u2019 Of course they can. And you don\u2019t need to be a champion to succeed in sport. You just need to enjoy the journey.\u201d", "description": "It was when Lady Mary Peters contacted her local bookshop and asked for a comparison between how many books they had about sportsmen and sportswomen that she became convinced by the need for her latest project.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Jim White", "Ben Bloom", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000213033341-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoNNSexKcI53-HHJW8z5oHGclioocPp7CdIUOTtw1IRI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
