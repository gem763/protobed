Police say the boy then displayed a pocket knife before lifting up his shirt to show off the gun tucked in his waistband. The report says no one was injured, and the knife and gun were surrendered to authorities.\n\nThe police report lists the offense as assault with a dangerous weapon, but the station says it\u2019s unclear if the student was charged.
