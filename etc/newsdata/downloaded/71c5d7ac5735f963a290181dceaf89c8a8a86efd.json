Tour operator Lucas Pantone says 80% of his business is from Thomas Cook. \"If it goes under\" he says, \"we'll be having a crisis meeting within hours, over whether we can survive\".\n\nThere are currently 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British.\n\nOne of the world's largest travel companies, Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of \u00a39bn.\n\nIt employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of whom are in the UK, and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Thomas Cook has hundreds of High Street stores\n\nIn July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed \u00a3900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of \u00a3150m. The \u00a3900m would come from China's Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors.\n\nThe group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional \u00a3200m on top of the \u00a3900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to \u00a31.1bn.\n\nThomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional \u00a3200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out.\n\nThe firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.\n\nWhat are your rights?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIf you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).\n\nThe scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.\n\nAtol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.\n\nIf you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme.\n\nIf you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.\n\nWhen Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.\n\nHere is more information on Atol protection and Your questions answered\n\nAre you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?
