The local time was just before 6 a.m.\n\nJohnson is due to address the United Nations' annual conference Tuesday, his first opportunity to do so as Prime Minister.\n\nRead more: What happens now the Supreme Court has ruled Boris Johnson broke the law by suspending parliament?\n\nReuters\n\nJohnson is meant to deliver a speech to announce a new \u00a31 billion ($1.2 billion) fund for UK inventors seeking to create new technology to fight climate change.\n\nThis is likely to be totally overshadowed by the court ruling.\n\nHe may now be forced to return to London to address parliament after John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced his intention to reconvene parliament as soon as possible.\n\nIf parliament does reconvene in the next 24 hours, Johnson will likely be be expected to speak during Prime Ministers' Questions at midday Wednesday.\n\nPrime Ministers often delegate this role while they are overseas, but political reality may make this difficult for Johnson.\n\nBritish political journalist Paul Waugh speculated that should Johnson fail to return to the UK in time for PMQs, he could be \"empty-chaired\" by Speaker Bercow.\n\nTom Newton Dunn, the poltical editor for The Sun newspaper, suggested that Johnson could abandon his address to the UN to get home sooner.\n\nAlongside a likely rapid return to the UK, Johnson is also facing calls to resign as prime minister from opposition politicians. Labour MP David Lammy calledon the prime minister to \"open the doors of Parliament and resign.\"\n\nNumber 10 Downing Street said it will not be responding to the Supreme Court's decision immediately, according to Sky political reporter Sam Coates.", "description": "An immense gamble at the heart of Johnson's strategy for Brexit \u2014 to shut down parliament \u2014 was ruled illegal by the UK's Supreme Court on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Will Martin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2303b1a17d6c39d7287ee4-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
