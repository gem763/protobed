Almost half the accounts claimed to be based in 'swing states,' especially Florida.'\n\nFacebook said it was taking down accounts for 'inauthentic' activity and stepping up scrutiny of 'state controlled' media seeking to manipulate American voters.\n\nFour separate networks of accounts from Russia and Iran were closed for 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' on Facebook and Instagram, the company said.\n\nThree of the groups originated in Iran and one in Russia, and they targeted users in the United States, North Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe Graphika analysis said the Russian accounts appeared to sow division by posting from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n'Accounts across the 'progressive' spectrum attacked President Donald Trump; accounts across the 'conservative' spectrum attacked Democratic congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio Cortez ('AOC') and lhan Omar,' the report said.\n\nFacebook's statement said one of the Russian groups used posts with concealed identities to make comments 'on both sides of political issues including topics like US elections, environmental issues, racial tensions, LGBTQ issues, political candidates, confederate ideas, conservatism and liberalism.'\n\nAn Iranian account which 'masqueraded as a news entity' posted on topics including race relations, U.S. and Israeli policy on Iran and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former US Vice President Joe Biden appears to be the target of Russian attacks on Facebook, according to data from the social network\n\nThe report said the accounts reused messages from the Internet Research Agency which targeted U.S. audiences in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n'Facebook's own analysis... showed some links to the IRA,' the report said.\n\nRussian accounts were blamed for a wave of misinformation during the 2016 campaign, in particular targeting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nOne Russian troll farm even tried to encourage U.S. 'secessionist movements' in California and Texas, a report said.\n\nHundreds of fake Facebook accounts, probably run from Russia, spent about $100,000 on ads aimed at stirring up divisive issues, Facebook admitted.\n\nOne of the new steps announced by Facebook calls for labeling of messages coming from state-controlled media outlets, starting next month.\n\n'We will hold these pages to a higher standard of transparency because they combine the opinion-making influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state,' a Facebook blog post said.\n\nFacebook also said it would seek to curb the viral spread of misinformation by using a 'pop-up' that will appear when people attempt to share posts on Instagram debunked by third-party fact-checkers.\n\nSome Russian accounts are believed to have posted in support of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders (pictured in New York on Saturday)\n\nThe moves add to a series of measures from the leading social network since 2016, when foreign entities were prominently involved in social media in the US campaign.\n\n'The bottom line here is that elections have changed significantly since 2016, and Facebook has changed too,' Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told a conference call.\n\n'We face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation-states... but I'm confident we're more prepared now.'\n\nA contrite Zuckerberg was summoned before U.S. senators last year amid the fallout from the 2016 election and other scandals and admitted he had not taken a 'broad enough view of our responsibilities'.\n\nFacebook said it was offering new protections for the accounts of political candidates, monitoring for hacking or hijacking.\n\nIt also outlined steps to protect against 'voter suppression' including any efforts to mislead people about where or when to vote.\n\n'All of these operations created networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,' said Facebook cybersecurity chief Nathaniel Gleicher.", "description": "Facebook today said it has stopped four new Russian and Iranian attempts to interfere in the 2020 Presidential election by praising Bernie Sanders and attacking Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/20/wire-20004010-1571684879-426_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
