What joys will this Toronto International Film Festival bring? Vulture is packing our bags and sending us north: We\u2019re headed to TIFF and, by extension, into the earliest days of awards season. Per usual, the festival has a lot of buzzy titles: Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story, Terrence Malick\u2019s A Hidden Life, Rian Johnson\u2019s Knives Out, and a pair of comebacks, from Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Eddie Murphy. What should be on your TIFF radar? The peaches in Parasite, J.Lo\u2019s mink coat in Hustlers, the Ford v Ferrari co-leads, and Kevin Garnett and some Uncut Gems. Here\u2019s what Vulture will arrive at the festival looking out for:\n\nHustlers\n\nWhat\u2019s the running price on the American Dream these days? A handful of strippers, a bunch of guys on Wall Street, and a few credit-card swipes, according to Hustlers. The movie is based on New York\u2019s saga of a get-rich-quick scheme run by some resourceful women who danced and drugged their way into rent checks and Louboutins. Lorene Scafaria directs a slick retelling: Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu are the Kobe-and-Shaq team behind the plan, and share scenes with Lizzo, Cardi B, and one very surprising superstar cameo. J.Lo is already getting buzz for playing the mama-bear mastermind \u2014 Variety called it her \u201cErin Brockovich moment,\u201d but instead of battling a big, bad utility company, J.Lo & Co. mix ketamine and MDMA to con a couple dudes out of their bank accounts. \u2014Hunter Harris\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nCall it Cars 4: In 1966, at the Le Mans World Championship, Ford Motor Company went up against the polished, sleek Ferrari. James Mangold\u2019s Ford v Ferrari dramatizes the race and the preparation, with Matt Damon starring as car designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale starring as the British driver Ken Miles. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) pitches a plan to have the two join forces to beat Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone), and the real work begins: Can they really make a superfast Ford? The early reviews out of Telluride were big and glowing, with lots of praise for Damon and Bale as co-leads. \u2014H.H.\n\nMarriage Story\n\nMarriage! Divorce! New York! Los Angeles! In Noah Baumbach\u2019s new family drama Marriage Story, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play a stage actor and director going through a painful divorce. Nicole (Johansson) wants to move to L.A. for a TV role; Charlie wants to stay in New York City. Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta play lawyers. The obvious influences all look like they\u2019re there: Kramer vs. Kramer, Shoot the Moon, Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Persona. To IndieWire, Baumbach said he intentionally layered in other genres too: \u201cThere\u2019s a hidden thriller, a procedural, a romantic comedy, a tragic love story. I felt like this was a subject that could handle all those things.\u201d A domestic disaster I can\u2019t wait to see. \u2014H.H.\n\nHope Gap\n\nAnnette Bening and Bill Nighy \u2014 a moment most pleasing to me in my career! In Hope Gap, directed by writer-director William Nicholson, Bening and Nighy play a married couple named Grace and Edward, and their son has returned home for the couple\u2019s anniversary. The twist: Edward has long felt insecure and insufficient and plans to leave Grace. (Leaving Annette Bening is an act of misogyny, if you ask me, and I will respond in kind.) This is Bening\u2019s second movie at this year\u2019s TIFF \u2014 she appears as Dianne Feinstein in The Report, which premiered at Sundance earlier this year. \u2014H.H.\n\nThe Personal History of David Copperfield\n\nIs the glorious, acerbic In the Loop really ten years old? Armando Iannucci and co-writer Simon Blackwell reunite in this adaptation of one of Charles Dickens\u2019s most famous novels, David Copperfield. Dev Patel plays the titular role, a clever observer who moves between houses and families after he\u2019s shipped off when his widowed mother remarries. Cathartic Iannucci one-liners, costumes, Dev Patel\u2019s floppy hair \u2014 I said thank you! The Personal History of David Copperfield co-stars Tilda Swinton, Hugh Laurie, and Ben Whishaw. \u2014H.H.\n\nUncut Gems\n\nShould I call the Safdie brothers my white boys of the month? Maybe not. Will that stop me? Absolutely not! Their follow-up to the wild, gutter masterpiece Good Time \u2014 After Hours meets The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, bathed in neon \u2014 is Uncut Gems, starring Adam Sandler as a diamond-district jeweler. The description, per TIFF: \u201cWhen he makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime, Howard (Sandler) must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides, in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win.\u201d First-look images of Gems make it look as slick and colorful as Good Time, with an even broader cast that includes LaKeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett. \u2014H.H.\n\nEndings, Beginnings\n\nTIFF loves a Drake Doremus relationship drama! In this one, unlucky-in-love Daphne (Shailene Woodley) is trying to get her life back on track when she finds herself in the throes of a love triangle: between bad boy Carter Baizen Frank (Sebastian Stan), and his thoughtful, academic best friend Jack (Jamie Dornan), who should she choose? Doremus scripted this feature with the novelist Jardine Libaire; Matthew Gray Gubler, Lindsay Sloane, and Shamier Anderson also star. Will Endings, Beginnings be the first Doremus drama to recapture the magic of his debut, Like Crazy? \u2014H.H.\n\nWaves\n\nLucas Hedges and I are both dealing with a Little Women\u2013size hole in our calendars in different ways: He is starring in Trey Edward Shults\u2019s movie Waves; I had Doritos for breakfast. The It Comes at Night and Krisha director returns with a music-heavy movie (once upon a time, the rumor was that the movie would be soundtracked entirely by Kanye songs) about family. Sterling K. Brown, Taylor Russell, and Kelvin Harrison Jr. star. Per Deadline, Waves \u201ctraces the epic emotional journey of a suburban African-American family \u2014 led by a well-intentioned but domineering father \u2014 as they navigate love, forgiveness and coming together in the aftermath of a loss.\u201d \u2014H.H.\n\nDolemite Is My Name\n\nAn Eddie Murphy renaissance is upon us! In Dolemite Is My Name, he\u2019s playing the comedian and actor Rudy Ray Moore, who set out to make a blaxploitation movie, Dolemite, in 1975. Hustle & Flow director Craig Brewer directs Murphy\u2019s turn as one of his inspirations: Moore fashioned himself into the character Dolemite, a flamboyant pimp who breathes new life into his dormant career. Moore is ambitious and clever, and Murphy\u2019s portrayal is already the subject of awards-season murmurs. Will this be the biopic to land him an overdue Oscar? \u2014H.H.\n\nHarriet\n\nWidows introduced Cynthia Erivo as a screen actor who was more than capable. This TIFF gives her a starring role: Here, she\u2019s Harriet Tubman, directed by Kasi Lemmons. Harriet follows not only Tubman\u2019s fight for her own freedom, but her efforts to free slaves with other abolitionists along the Underground Railroad. Harriet co-stars Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Leslie Odom Jr., and our Favourite favorite Joe Alwyn. At the very least: It\u2019ll be better than Anthony Hopkins name-checking Harriet Tubman in that Transformers movie. \u2014H.H.\n\nLucy in the Sky\n\nFirst things first: Yes, this is the diaper astronaut movie, based in part on the infamous astronaut love triangle of 2007. In Lucy in the Sky (the movie that Reese Witherspoon dropped out of to make Big Little Lies season two \u2014 now she\u2019s just producing), Portman puts on Claire Foy\u2019s First Man hair and a Texas accent to play the desperate, obsessive astronaut Lucy Cola. She\u2019s married to Drew (Dan Stevens), having an affair with Mark (Jon Hamm), and going through a trippy existential crisis as she trains for her next mission. I feel comfortable declaring today, here and now, that we are one nation under Natalie Portman\u2019s space diaper! \u2014H.H.\n\nJoker\n\nIn the immortal words of DJ Khaled, \u201canother one.\u201d Having learned its lesson from the misbegotten efforts to create a Marvel-style interconnected universe, Warner Bros. has instead decided to pivot its DC Comics movies toward stand-alone efforts, hoping to attract A-list talent put off by the decade-long contractual obligations of that other superhero universe. First up: Joaquin Phoenix stepping into the role once held by Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and [gulp] Jared Leto. It\u2019s an origin story seemingly inspired by Martin Scorsese\u2019s The King of Comedy, which paints the future Clown Prince of Crime as a downtrodden would-be comedian pushed into supervillainy by an uncaring world. Talk out of Venice suggests the film is outrageous in every sense of the word, and we\u2019ll likely be debating the film\u2019s take on violence, masculinity, and violent masculinity all season long. \u2014Nate Jones\n\nThe Goldfinch\n\nLiterary adaptations don\u2019t come much more gilded than this. Brooklyn\u2019s John Crowley directs the film version of the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning Donna Tartt novel, with a cast that includes Ansel Elgort, Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, and Stranger Things\u2019s Finn Wolfhard as a Ukrainian teen living in Las Vegas. With a sprawling plot that involves terrorism, grief, drug addiction, and international art heists, the book was considered even by its fans to be nigh-unadaptable. We can\u2019t wait to find out whether this is the next Life of Pi or Tulip Fever. \u2014N.J.\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nIf you\u2019re an indie-minded director coming off a big Marvel hit, how do you spend your newfound industry capital? For Thor: Ragnarok\u2019s Taika Waititi, the answer was simple: Direct yourself as Adolf Hitler, or at least, a version of the f\u00fchrer as the goofy imaginary friend of a young boy in 1940s Germany. Based on a book by Christine Leunens, the film follows a loyal member of the Hitler Youth who\u2019s shocked to discover his mother (Scarlett Johansson, not playing a tree) is harboring a Jewish girl in their attic. The Kiwi director has described the movie as a satire against war and nationalism, saying, \u201cThis film is going to piss off a lot of racists and that makes me very happy.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping! \u2014N.J.\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nYou know how sometimes you just need a good, hard cry? This is that, in movie form. From director Marielle Heller comes this Mr. Rogers biopic, based on an encounter the late TV legend had with journalist Tom Junod in the \u201990s. Rogers is being played by Tom Hanks, who looks nothing like him, but you have to admit their energies are the same. Junod (who is called \u201cLloyd Vogel\u201d here and is played by Matthew Rhys) has said that his time spent with Rogers changed his entire outlook on life, and for those of us who couldn\u2019t meet the guy in person, this film might suffice. \u2014N.J.\n\nJust Mercy\n\nThey may not make middlebrow legal thrillers like they used to, but Michael B. Jordan\u2019s production company is doing its part to make the world safe again for actors who want to play crusading attorneys making a brave stand against the system. The actor plays real-life activist Bryan Stevenson, who takes the case of an obviously innocent man (Jamie Foxx) who\u2019s landed on death row thanks to racial bias in policing. Short Term 12\u2019s Destin Daniel Cretton directs, and that film\u2019s star, Brie Larson, pops up in a supporting role. Jordan told Vulture last year he\u2019d slimmed down \u201cso much\u201d to take the role of Stevenson \u2014 his sweaters are probably thanking him. \u2014N.J.\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nNetflix sees HBO\u2019s The New Pope, and raises it one more pope. The latest film from Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (City of God) dramatizes the uncomfortable relationship created in the Vatican by the retirement of Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins), as the conservative German spars with his ideological opposite, the future Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce). The movie is almost entirely made up of a series of imagined conversations between the two men, and audiences at Telluride have come out raving about both performances, as well as Anthony McCarten\u2019s witty script. McCarten previously wrote The Theory of Everything, Darkest Hour, and Bohemian Rhapsody, and The Two Popes looks like it should fit nicely into his string of crowd-pleasing biopics. \u2014N.J.\n\nKnives Out\n\nNo, it\u2019s not a Radiohead biopic. (Though when that happens, please cast Barry Keoghan as Thom Yorke.) Instead, it\u2019s the latest effort from Rian Johnson, shaking off the bad vibes that crept up around Last Jedi with a star-studded Agatha Christie pastiche. Daniel Craig is the Poirot stand-in investigating a wealthy family (Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, Don Johnson, and more) for the murder of their patriarch (Christopher Plummer, of course). It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a really solid mystery movie \u2014 we shall not speak of the recent CGI-addled version Murder on the Orient Express \u2014 and my Gosford Park\u2013loving ass could not be any more excited to find out whodunit. \u2014N.J.\n\nJudy\n\nHave you heard? Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is back! The actress is getting major Oscar buzz for veritably becoming Judy Garland for this biopic set in the waning days of the singer\u2019s life. (She even did her own singing.) She\u2019s so good in it, in fact, that every review casually mentions that the movie is only okay, then goes back to praising Zellweger anyway. That\u2019s star power! \u2014N.J.\n\nParasite\n\nIf you missed the eventual Palme d\u2019Or winner when it played at Cannes \u2014 don\u2019t worry, we did, too \u2014 you\u2019re in luck: Bong Joon-ho\u2019s delicious satire is touring the fall festival circuit before its Stateside release in October. Parasite is the kind of film that plays best the less you know going in, but if you simply must hear the basics, the movie follows a downwardly mobile Korean family who slowly entwine themselves into the life of some vapid poshies. Those who\u2019ve seen any of Bong\u2019s previous films know how much pleasure he takes in situations spiraling desperately out of control, and much of this movie\u2019s anxious fun comes from never knowing precisely when or how the house of cards will crumble. \u2014N.J.", "description": "What should be on your TIFF radar?
