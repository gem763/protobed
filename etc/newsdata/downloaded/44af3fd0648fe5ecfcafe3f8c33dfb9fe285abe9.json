A Hollywood filmmaker you\u2019ve never heard of is collapsing in a puddle because former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is scheduled to participate in a women\u2019s conference next week. Her demand that others follow her lead and drop out has been met by, you guessed it, Hillary Clinton.\n\nAn annual conference for the past 22 years, Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women Summit will be held in Washington, D.C. next week. Filmmaker dream hampton (lowercase letters) has dropped out of the summit and is demanding that others do the same. Why? Kirstjen Nielsen is slated to participate. Apparently ms. hampton is too delicate to be anywhere near Nielsen.\n\nNot to be left out of a gesture made by a social justice warrior, Hillary Clinton has joined in the attempt to get Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s invitation rescinded. She, too, has canceled her appearance. Just hours after it was reported that hampton was raising a ruckus, Hillary Clinton suddenly remembered a conflict in her schedule that will prevent her participation. All it took was for an activist to alert Hillary\u2019s people that Nielsen would be there and just like that, Friday Hillary was out.\n\nSo, you might ask, what exactly is the problem here? The executive producer of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d, dream hampton, was scheduled to participate on a panel about justice and power. She can\u2019t possibly be in the same building with Kirstjen Nielsen, you see, because Nielsen put kids in cages, or something. Nevermind that Nielsen is scheduled for thirty minutes after hampton\u2019s panel and the two don\u2019t have to interact at all. This temper tantrum is all about cancel culture. The left is so intolerant that people with opposing views must not be tolerated, they must be destroyed.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound as though Nielsen will be given an easy go of it at the conference. Her appearance is billed as a \u201cno-holds-barred interview\u201d and promises \u201ctough questions.\u201d That\u2019s not good enough, apparently. Nielsen doesn\u2019t deserve a platform. The filmmaker calls it \u201creputation rinsing\u201d and she\u2019s not having it.\n\nHampton provided HuffPost with a statement on her decision: Fortune should not be giving Kirstjen Nielsen a platform to rehabilitate her image. I\u2019ve worked all my life to tell the stories of women, girls and families. Sharing a stage with Nielsen, who separated immigrant families and put babies in cages, would have put a stamp of approval on her immoral and reprehensible actions and help legitimize the terror that Trump is inflicting on immigrants and communities of color. So I\u2019m cancelling my attendance and encourage other speakers to do the same. I\u2019m thankful for the organizing CREDO Action, Define American and Bend the Arc have done to hold Trump collaborators like Nielsen accountable for their atrocities. Reputation rinsing \u2015 using visible, celebratory platforms to restore and normalize monstrous abuse \u2015 was actually common practice for predators like R Kelly and Jeffrey Epstein. When every infant, toddler, child and teenager Nielsen is responsible for ripping from their families is released and reunited, when attempts at restitution are made, then perhaps she can face one of them for a public \u201cinterview.\u201d Perhaps they\u2019ll begin by asking her a softball, like \u201cDoes she now know Norway is a white country?\u201d\n\ndream hampton is encouraging other speakers at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit to pull out as long as Nielsen is given a platform. Fortune spox said they plan to have Nielsen face a \u201cno-holds-barred interview\u201d and \u201ctough questions.\" \u2014 Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) October 18, 2019\n\nAgain, despite hampton\u2019s statement that she can\u2019t share a stage with Kirstjen Nielsen, she wasn\u2019t ever going to. It\u2019s all just an excuse to start a stink. It\u2019s what the left does these days. Imagine being so arrogant that she feels entitled to demand someone else not be invited to participate in a conference, simply over political policy. How is this filmmaker an example of a powerful woman if she can\u2019t even be in the same building as a former Secretary of Homeland Security? She sounds weak, insecure, and out of touch. You know, like the rest of Hollywood.\n\nHillary Clinton has been broken by President Trump. She will say anything if she thinks it advances her fight against him, no matter how unhinged she sounds doing it. Apparently she is so weak that she, too, cannot handle being in the same building as Nielsen. Good thing Clinton isn\u2019t still tasked with standing up to brutal dictators overseas on behalf of the United States.\n\nHillary Clinton was set to speak at the summit, too. On Friday, however, she removed herself from the event, citing a scheduling conflict. But a person close to Clinton\u2019s decision-making process told Slate that she had decided to drop out after hearing that Nielsen was also on the docket. \u201cWe work with a lot of activists who are trying to do their best to improve this horrible situation down at the border,\u201d the person said, citing Clinton\u2019s support of RAICES and other organizations that advocate for asylees and immigrants. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s an easy decision. You have to side with them.\u201d The person said one of those activists alerted Clinton to Nielsen\u2019s slot on the schedule earlier this week, after which Clinton\u2019s team notified Fortune that she would no longer be attending the event. Friday evening, Clinton\u2019s name and headshot were removed from the summit\u2019s website. \u201cWhile there\u2019s an argument to be made to hear all voices, there are those who fall outside of what should be the band of acceptable behavior and public policymaking,\u201d the person said, describing the actions of Nielsen\u2019s Department of Homeland Security as \u201cone of the most horrific things that we\u2019ve had to bear witness to within our borders in modern political history.\u201d\n\nLet all that nonsense sink in. Hillary Clinton, a former First Lady and Secretary of State, sides with the illegal aliens at our southern border instead of the Department of Homeland Security. I\u2019m old enough to remember when Hillary Clinton voted in support of border security and establishing the department she now turns her back on.\n\nNaturally, there is a petition to get Nielsen kicked out of the summit. So far, Fortune is standing firm.\n\nMore than 51,000 people have signed a petition asking Fortune to remove Nielsen from the agenda. \u201cFortune strongly believes that interviewing Nielsen\u2014and other key figures from the private and public sector, however controversial\u2014is important journalism and provides us an opportunity to ask substantive questions in front of our viewers and readers,\u201d Fortune communications manager Alison Klooster said in a statement. When asked why Fortune placed Nielsen\u2019s interview under the umbrella of Most Powerful Women\u2014a brand associated with cheering on female leaders and advocating for gender parity in business and government\u2014rather than interviewing her for a regular news story, Klooster explained that the summit will allow Fortune to \u201creach a much greater audience for this crucial topic than we might have with a straight news piece.\u201d The three-day summit is only open to Most Powerful Women members, who pay $13,500 each year for the ability to attend five events, but Nielsen\u2019s interview will be livestreamed and made available to broadcast news outlets.\n\nThere are still about 100 speakers slated to appear at the summit. Most of the speakers are business executives, plus a handful of journalists, scholars, and elected officials. The title of Nielsen\u2019s panel has been modified and her co-panelist has dropped out. Let\u2019s hope no more adjustments are made. By simply accepting the invitation to be grilled in front of a potentially hostile audience makes Kirstjen Nielsen far more powerful than Hillary Clinton or her comrade, the lesser-known Hollywood filmmaker.", "description": "Cancel culture", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hillary-rematch.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
