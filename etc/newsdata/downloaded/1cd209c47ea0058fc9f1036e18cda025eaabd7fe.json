He is tied up, and a storm floats over the White House.\n\nCNN'S DANA BASH PRAISES 'ICONIC' PELOSI FOR WHITE HOUSE PHOTO\n\n\"We are proud to join Planned Parenthood in defending women from assaults on our reproductive rights,\" said Dhvani's chief communications officer, Chloe Mason. \"Trump administration policies are threatening the health and bodily autonomy of women, especially women of color, low-income women and LGBTQ women.\"\n\nAs part of its #StandForSomething campaign, the Portland, Ore., company has other images of the president that are just as shocking, including one in which he sits on a golden toilet as a model takes away his cellphone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to Dhvani's mission, as described on its website, the company is \"committed to creating change in the world\" and partners with nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on the ad campaign.", "description": "An athletic clothing brand launched a controversial campaign targeting\u00a0President Trump with a billboard ad in Times Square depicting him hog-tied in front of the White House.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
