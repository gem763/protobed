It\u2019s important for babies to sleep in order for parents to hope to get a little of their own rest, which is how we can arrive pretty quickly at the \u201cdo whatever works\u201d strategy. But more reports are coming out that some of the products parents use\u2014and love\u2014are unsafe for their sleeping babies. At the top of that list now are in-bed sleepers.\n\nWe learned earlier this year that inclined \u201csleepers,\u201d like the Rock \u2018N Play, are linked with dozens of infant deaths. And now, a Consumer Reports investigation has concluded that several infant in-bed sleepers are linked to at least 12 deaths that occurred between 2012 and 2018. These in-bed sleepers are meant for bed-sharing with an adult caregiver.\n\nIn-bed sleepers do not currently have their own federal safety standards, and they have other potentially dangerous design elements. Notably, some feature padding and soft surfaces, which can block airflow if a baby\u2019s face comes into contact with the fabric. And by their nature they encourage bed-sharing, a practice that itself increases the risk of infant death. \u201cWe know that padding is a suffocation risk\u201d when it\u2019s close to a sleeping baby, says Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nThis news hit at the same time as a study was released in the Pediatrics journal that found that just 31% of mums reported always or often putting their infants to sleep on separate, approved sleep surfaces. (Only women were surveyed, so it\u2019s not clear what the rate is for dads.)\n\nTo reduce the risk of sleep-related infant death, though, the American Academy of Pediatrics has guidelines that are helpful for parents:\n\nUntil their first birthday, babies should sleep on their backs for all sleep times\u2014for naps and at night.\n\nUse a firm sleep surface.\n\nRoom share\u2014keep baby\u2019s sleep area in the same room where you sleep for the first 6 months or, ideally, for the first year.\n\nOnly bring your baby into your bed to feed or comfort.\n\nNever place your baby to sleep on a couch, sofa or armchair.\n\nBed-sharing is not recommended for any babies.\n\nKeep soft objects, loose bedding or any objects that could increase the risk of entrapment, suffocation or strangulation out of the baby\u2019s sleep area.\n\nIt is fine to swaddle your baby.\n\nTry giving a pacifier at nap time and bedtime.\n\nYou can read the AAP\u2019s recommendations in greater detail here.\n\nSo although many of these products seem like a way to make naps and nighttime sleep easier to achieve, if they don\u2019t fall under the AAP\u2019s recommendations, parents can\u2019t be sure they\u2019re safe.", "description": "Parents of infants are both sleep-deprived and sleep-obsessed.
