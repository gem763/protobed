It was a little spooky, but I stayed. Just me, eating popcorn, enjoying Aaron Taylor-Johnson\u2019s penis while Britain burns.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time hiding in this gargantuan 20-screen cinema on the top floor of a shopping centre through the summer of 2019. Finally, I understand the meaning of the safe space. I love the crisp air-con and pure anonymity. The snacks are atrocious, the staff sullenly dehumanising, and the tickets, all day every day, are a penny short of seven quid.\n\nAs everything about Brexit has become incendiary, all news items confusing, all social media feeds angrily polarised, making the miners\u2019 dispute look like a period of warm societal cohesion by comparison, I have spent long periods in the dark. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be first against the wall,\u201d several of you may be presently thinking, \u201cyou whining, fascist Marie-Antoinette bint!\u201d Well, quite.\n\nBut at the multiplex, there is none of this anger. (I cannot vouch for rage levels at my local art-house independent, where entry is at least \u00a317 and an earnest film student will ferry a bespoke organic fudge sundae to your seat as you watch weighty Oscar 2020 contenders such as Parasite or The Souvenir.) It\u2019s the blockbusters that provide a refuge. As Spinal Tap\u2019s Nigel Tufnel says on his tour of Graceland: \u201cWell, it really puts perspective on things, though, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo much,\u201d sighs David St Hubbins. \u201cThere\u2019s too much fucking perspective now.\u201d\n\nPerhaps like me, right now, you do not have the bandwidth for perspective. Perhaps you are instead in the mood to see if Jason Statham can win a ninja battle against 12 assassins, accompanied by a score of Tha Movement & Anonymouz ft Poetik and MC Arme. Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw ticks this box.\n\nWhat else? The Queen\u2019s Corgi was a Belgian-animated pile of dog mess-scented will-this-do gubbins which left me feeling dizzy; but it stopped me worrying about whether I should stockpile groceries, medication and water. Or whether even thinking that is the hallmark of a hysteric? Or whether, if the worst happens, I will brave starvation-related civil unrest by just killing a lot of people as Gerard Butler does in the atrocious (ergo amazing) third part of the Lidl Jason Bourne franchise that is Angel Has Fallen?\n\nMidsommar, a horror film loosely depicting what happens if one takes mushrooms and gets lost in the Petersham Nurseries garden centre, positioned itself as a clever movie, but was actually soothingly daft. The Current War with Benedict Cumberbatch was 108 minutes of men in top hats bickering about lightbulbs, but also a good chance to hide while the nation came to terms with the word \u201cprorogue\u201d.\n\nLikewise Rocketman, in which Taron Egerton batters nonstop through Elton John hits, the perfect pick-me-up after I observed a mass social-media-blocking spree between friends, which started out about Brexit but slid into trans rights in the Trumpian era and concluded with a call to arms from both sides. Clearly neither side would be committing violence themselves; they merely suggested that if someone bigger and harder punched a Brexiter, a Terf, a Nazi, a misogynist or a remoaner, well, it would only be understandable.\n\nIs Simon Cowell's surprising new face a vision of our deepfake future? Read more\n\nAlas, all good things cannot last. Summer is over. The race to win prestigious trophies has begun. Film distributors will stop quietly pushing out stinkers that they were contractually obliged to show, instead unveiling the big guns. Here comes The Goldfinch, the adaptation of the epic Donna Tartt novel; Joker, with Joaquin Phoenix, about a standup comedian who turns psychopath; Judy, about Judy Garland, set to be one of the roles of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s life. The forthcoming Bombshell stars Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie, and is about sexual harassment and Fox News. These are films one will be required to have a strident view on. What\u2019s more, as the 92nd Academy Awards look set to be more political than ever, Hollywood will try to show that it really cares about climate change, gun control, #MeToo and a dozen other pressing issues through various sombre outfits and angry speeches.\n\nStars should be able to use their celebrity to make important points; but for me, Oscars season is anything but an escape. I am awarding my summer 2019 prize for acting to Taylor-Johnson\u2019s member. It stole the entire movie. We live in interesting times, surrounded by idiots. Let\u2019s at least give credit to useful pricks.", "description": "As everything becomes incendiary, all news confusing, all social media polarised, I have spent long periods in my local multiplex", "authors": ["Grace Dent"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3c622cd139eae622faaf92ab3a0632f109db93/0_187_5612_3367/master/5612.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c925503fddb9f1977e97c24e4d6bb47", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
