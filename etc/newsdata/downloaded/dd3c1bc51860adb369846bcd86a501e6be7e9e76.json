Prices softened even more for apartments, where the average price declined 16.5% during the same timeframe.\n\n\n\nMore: Developments Sporting Brand-Name Affiliations Have Tripled Since 2009\n\nA flurry of new builds have hit the market in anticipation of Dubai 2020, a world\u2019s fair planned to launch a year from now. Developers, facing fierce competition, have turned to attractive payment plans and pricing that has forced home prices down across the emirate, according to commentary from Cavendish Maxwell.\n\n\n\nThe obvious upside is that home ownership has become far more attainable than it was five years ago as declining home values and new avenues for long-term residency have helped spur more home sales.\n\n\n\n\u201cA prolonged softening in prices and rents has made real estate more accessible to and affordable for owner-occupiers and tenants,\u201d said Aditi Hariharan, a senior consultant at the firm. Sales have also surged on the news that the Dubai government would form a real estate committee aimed at rebalancing supply and demand.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe positive impact of the move is already evident with real estate transactions in Dubai more than doubling since the announcement of the committee,\u201d Ms. Hariharan added.\n\n\n\nTotal residential sales between July and September clocked in at 9,243, a surge of more than 45% compared to the same period last year, according to a separate report from property agents Luxhabitat on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Hockney\u2019s \u2018Sur la Terrasse\u2019 Could Net $45 Million at Christie\u2019s\n\nMohammed Bin Rashid City, where the average apartment trades for around AED1,200 (US$327) per square foot, saw a particularly strong third quarter. Across Dubai Creek from Downtown Dubai, the neighborhood accounted for over AED2 billion in sales in the third quarter. It also logged the highest single deal: A sumptuous villa in the neighborhood's District One development that sold for AED90 million.\n\n\n\nThe second most expensive deal in the second quarter was a AED74 million penthouse at One Palm, a luxury high-rise on the Palm Jumeirah, according to Luxhabitat.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117682?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
