Lost on a deplorable night of tension and racial hatred in Bulgaria was his move into the top 10 post-war players to lead England.\n\nIt was Harry Kane's 22nd game as captain and in many ways his most accomplished display. He stood tall in his role as leader, listened to his team-mates and acted with the same clear mind usually in evidence in front of goal.\n\n'Harry handled everything perfectly and showed great maturity in a situation that was not easy,' said his Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nHarry Kane's 22nd game as England captain was marred by shameful scenes in Bulgaria\n\nENGLAND POST-WAR CAPTAINS 1) Billy Wright & Bobby Moore 90 3) Bryan Robson 65 4) David Beckham 59 5) Steven Gerrard 38 6) Alan Shearer & John Terry 34 8) Kevin Keegan 31 9) Emlyn Hughes 23 10) Johnny Haynes, Wayne Rooney & Harry Kane 22\n\n'It was good to see how he behaved. The way he handled it was exemplary. He showed calm and followed the rules. We are so proud.'\n\nIt was a reassuring sight for a manager preparing to hand Tottenham's captaincy duties to Kane in the absence of Hugo Lloris, who is ruled out until after the New Year by a dislocated elbow.\n\nPerhaps it was proof of what he already suspected: that Kane's character was too strong to be damaged by the extra responsibility of leading Spurs out of their early-season form slump.\n\n'Harry does not need to feel too much pressure,' said Pochettino. 'He needs to act natural. The most important thing is to not show too much the responsibility on your shoulders.\n\nKane's strike-rate has remained prolific with 13 goals in his last 14 games for club and country\n\n'If you are a natural leader, you don't feel the responsibility. When you do what you feel in your heart, it's natural.\n\n'The problem is if you are not a real leader and you need to act, you spend energy thinking: \"How do I face this problem?\" But if you trust in yourself and you are a natural leader, that, I promise, you don't feel the responsibility.'\n\nKane has proved his leadership credentials at Spurs as the long-serving vice-captain to Lloris.\n\nThe goalkeeper is respected for his intelligence and experience but is not always the most vocal player in the dressing room.\n\nTottenham prepare for Saturday's Premier League encounter with Watford on Saturday\n\nAfter a defeat at Chelsea last season, it was the 26-year-old England skipper who stepped up to lead a dressing-room inquest by forcefully criticising what he feared was a drop in standards.\n\nAnd, although he was ruled out by injury, it was Kane who made his way into the dressing room in Amsterdam to deliver a rallying half-time speech at Ajax in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final.\n\n'He has learned a lot from Hugo who is a good example,' said Pochettino. 'He has become a natural leader.\n\n'His commitment is great, not only for Tottenham but for the national team. We are going to miss Hugo for a few months and to have Harry to step up with others is important. He is young but he is very mature, he is capable.'\n\nMauricio Pochettino is ready to hand captaincy duties to Kane in the absence of Hugo Lloris\n\nThis, however, is a different test. One where Kane will be relied upon to lead by example, not only as a model professional but as a striker of remarkable consistency. Even as Spurs have struggled for rhythm his strike-rate has remained prolific with 13 goals in 14 games for club and country this season.\n\nTottenham, having won three of 11 games this season, are expected to start momentum rolling forward against Watford who are winless and on the bottom of the Premier League. They will need him to shine as captain.\n\n'Hugo is our captain and one of the most important players,' said Pochettino. 'We all feel sad for his situation but we need to move on. If we find an excuse because Hugo is injured we are going to fail.\n\n'It is always important in this type of period to have all the players together. This is the moment to trust them. Not one more or less than another.\n\n'In a period like this you can hear a lot of opinion but the most important is our assessment and the way we talk. To be calm and free, to play with happiness and fight with energy. Most important is not to think of the consequences.'", "description": "The age of captain Kane is already well under way.
