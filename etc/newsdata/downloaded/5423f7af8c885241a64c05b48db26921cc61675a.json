Under the agreement, forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad effectively replace the U.S. troops on the ground in the border areas, with Moscow guaranteeing the deal.\n\n\u201cWe told (Trump) that we are contacting the Syrian regime and the Russians in order to protect our country and land,\u201d Abdi, better known by his nom de guerre Mazloum Kobani, told a local TV station, Ronahi TV. \u201cHe said, \u2018We are not against that. We support that.\u2019\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence, heading a U.S. delegation that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is set to arrive in Turkey Thursday afternoon, aiming to press Turkey to accept a cease-fire in its offensive. Before their arrival, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met with White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Trump dismissed the very crisis he sent his aides on an emergency mission to douse. Trump said the situation in northern Syria was under control and that the Syrian government was now protecting the Kurds.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday once again called on Turkey to stop its military offensive in Syria, telling parliament that the offensive \u201cmakes tens of thousands, among them thousands of children, flee.\u201d\n\nShe said the military operation \u201ca humanitarian drama with big geopolitical consequences,\u201d strengthening the role of Russia and Iran.\n\nSyria\u2019s Kurdish fighters have allied with the U.S. since 2014 to fight Islamic State militants. Abdi said the priority now is to stop Turkey\u2019s invasion.\n\nAbdi said his forces have frozen their activities to counter IS, other than defending themselves against the militants, who he said were taking advantage of the Turkish offensive. He said the militants have attacked prisons where fellow members are jailed and have freed some families of IS members from holding areas in displaced people\u2019s camps.\n\nAbdi said his forces will decide what to do with detained IS prisoners and their families.\n\n\u201cThe matter is in our hands. We captured them. We are holding them, and we will decide what to do with them. No one else,\u201d he told the channel.\n\nMerkel said both the Middle East and Europe are being made to feel insecure because prisoners of the Islamic State extremist group are no longer being adequately guarded by Kurdish-led forces. Those forces are now diverting their attention to the Turkish invasion.\n\nSo far, Syrian troops have deployed in the border town of Kobani, further south and along a main highway to the east.\n\nBut fighting for the strategic town of Ras al-Ayn continued, as Turkish-backed fighters make a new push for the town where the Kurdish-led group has put up stiff resistance. An Associated Press journalist on the Turkish side of the border reported heavy shelling into Ras al-Ayn.\n\nAn Associated Press journalist said Turkish cross-border artillery fire targeted the town of Ras al-Ayn and areas beyond the town on Thursday. The shelling came despite Turkey announcing that it has captured the town three days ago.\n\nAn official with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the town saw \u201cinsane bombing\u201d from the air and land as the Turkish-backed fighters launched a three-pronged attack. They advanced slightly in the town but there were \u201cfierce battles,\u201d the official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe operational details.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Turkish-backed forces have encircled Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe SDF official also said Syrian government forces have deployed south of Ras al-Ayn, near Tal Tamr and the highway there, taking a rear position behind the Kurdish forces.\n\n___\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.
