He said the U.S. \u201cis more prepared\u201d for a conflict than any country in history.\n\n\u201cWith all that being said, we\u2019d certainly like to avoid it,\u201d he said of a conflict.\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody.\u201d\n\nDAMAGE FROM IRAN-LINKED DRONE ATTACK ON SAUDI OIL FACILITY CAPTURED IN SATELLITE IMAGES\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels said they launched drone attacks on the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge fires and halting about half of the supplies from the world's largest exporter of oil.\n\nThe attacks marked the latest of many drone assaults on the kingdom\u2019s oil infrastructure in recent weeks, but easily the most damaging. They raised concerns about the global oil supply and could further escalate tensions across the Persian Gulf amid a growing crisis between the U.S. and Iran over the troubled nuclear deal.\n\nThe fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, as Saudi officials said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, planned to provide updated information in the coming days.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper attended an emergency National Security Council meeting on Sunday at the White House along with Vice President Pence, where military options were discussed, officials told Fox News.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Esper said on Twitter he returned to the Pentagon from a meeting at the White House where Department of Defense leadership discussed the situation. The Defense Secretary said he spoke with the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, and Iraqi Minister of Defense al-Shammary about the recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n\n\"The United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran,\" Esper said.\n\nEarlier Monday in Austria, Energy Secretary Rick Perry placed the blame for the attack squarely on Iran.\n\n\"I want to reiterate that the United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran's attack on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and we call on other nations to do the same,\" Perry told reporters. \u201cThis behavior is unacceptable. It is unacceptable and they must be held responsible.\"\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump said Monday it\u2019s \u201clooking like\u201d Iran was responsible for the weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil supply and talked up the United States\u2019\u00a0military might, but said he wanted to \u201cavoid\u201d war.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086829905001_6086832997001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
