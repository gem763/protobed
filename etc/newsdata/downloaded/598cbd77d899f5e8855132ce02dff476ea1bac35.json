Airships could complement multi-billion-dollar aircraft carriers.\n\n\u201cThe necessary technology already exists for unmanned airships to team up with UAVs to provide modern-day equivalents of the Akron-class airships,\u201d Mizokami wrote.\n\nThe Navy on its official website describes the brief service of the two Akrons, which at 785 feet long could cruise at 50 knots over a distance of thousands of miles while carrying 89 crew, seven machine guns and four fighter aircraft that launched and landed via a complex trapeze device.\n\nDuring an exercise near Cuba in 1932, the New Jersey-based Akron \u201csucceeded in spotting the light cruiser Raleigh and a dozen destroyers, positively identifying them on the eastern horizon two minutes later,\u201d the Navy explained.\n\nThe sailing branch quoted historian Richard Smith. \u201cConsideration given to the weather, duration of flight, a track of more than 3,000 miles flown, her material deficiencies and the rudimentary character of aerial navigation at that date, the Akron's performance was remarkable,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThere was not a military airplane in the world in 1932 which could have given the same performance, operating from the same base.\"\n\nBut Akron crashed in 1933, killing 73 people. Sister ship Macon crashed in 1935, killing two. The Navy abandoned airships in favor of ship-based aircraft carriers. Still, the Navy should reconsider the concept, Mizokami wrote.\n\nA high-flying airship, equipped with sensors and networking capabilities, could reach its destination faster than a seaborne aircraft carrier and remain on station for days or weeks at a time. The airship could carry a battery of several dozen unmanned aerial vehicles, each equipped with radar, electro-optical, and other sensors, to extend the sensor reach of the mothership and hence the surface fleet. Those same drones could pack a variety of weapons for use against ships, submarines, lower-performance aircraft such as helicopters, and targets on land. Attack airships would not replace traditional surface warships but instead augment them, providing a new layer of distributed lethality to the fleet and support for Marines and soldiers on the ground. Airships can screen large swathes of ocean where enemy contact is unlikely but some friendly sensor presence\u2014backed up by weapons\u2014would be useful. Convoys would gain access to improved situational awareness as well as an airborne antisubmarine warfare capability.\n\nThe Pentagon in recent years has experimented with airships for cargo and surveillance missions. Several prototypes have flown but none have led to major acquisitions programs.\n\nIn 2005 the Navy acquired an American Blimp Model A-170. MZ-3A was 178 feet long and flew at a top speed of around 40 knots. Like many airships, the helium-filled A-170 performed best at low altitude \u2014 just a few thousand feet, at most.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s blimp spent time with test squadrons in New Jersey and Maryland testing out various sensors. \u201cDue to the size and/or aerodynamic limitations imposed by some of these systems, an airship provides a faster and more consistent development path than ordinarily possible in fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft,\u201d explained Doug Abbotts, a spokesman for Naval Air Systems Command. \u201cThe airship also expands the possibilities for developing large multi-dimensional apertures/arrays that aren\u2019t physically achievable with any other airborne technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2010 the airship also deployed to Alabama to assist in the cleanup following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. MZ-3 acquisition and operations between 2006 and 2012 cost the Navy $3.6 million, according to the Asbury Park Press newspaper in New Jersey.\n\nThe Navy grounded the MZ-3A in 2013. \u201cIt is being deflated,\u201d Abbotts told Asbury Park Press. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we have a lack of funding. We have a lack of mission.\u201d The Navy instead has invested in high-flying surveillance drones and F-35B jump jets and other vertical-launching aircraft that can fly from a variety of amphibious ships.", "description": "We had something like it in the 1930s.
