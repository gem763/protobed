Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that ensures that students will get a \u201cstate reimbursable meal of their choice\u201d even if their parent or guardian has accrued fees for unpaid meals.\n\nNone of this would be happening without Ryan Kyote, a 10-year-old at West Park Elementary School in Napa, who made headlines during the summer when he donated $74.80 he had saved up from allowance money to help pay off student lunch debt for his classmates.\n\nKyote sparked a state-wide conversation about school lunch debt, resulting in Newsom meeting with Kyote and telling him that he would sign the bill, which was authored by state Senator Robert Hertzberg, if it made it to his desk. After signing the bill this Saturday, Newsom released a statement where he personally thanked Kyote for bringing attention to this problem.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Ryan for his empathy and his courage in bringing awareness to this important issue,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nWhile this is a wonderful development for California, sadly, many other states continue to utilize lunch-shaming, including a nine-year-old in Ohio who had his lunch taken away from him on his birthday due to a $9 lunch debt. Hopefully, every state will make this outdated practice a thing of the past, so that students can just enjoy their lunch in peace.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe post California Is Officially Putting an End to Lunch-Shaming Students appeared first on Fatherly.", "description": "Everybody gets a free lunch.
